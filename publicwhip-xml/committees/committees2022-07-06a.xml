    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#A00200"><p>I remind members and witnesses in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to continue pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the agricultural and food supply chain Bill 2022.  The committee will hear from representatives of the Consumer and Competition Protection Commission and Retail Ireland.</p> <p>  On 28 February, legal requirement for mask-wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus or in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p> <p>  In the first session, we will hear from representatives of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  I welcome Mr. Brian McHugh, member of the commission, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, director of the consumer protection division, and Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, director of policy and international division.  I invite Mr. McHugh to deliver his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#A00300"><p>My colleagues and I are glad to have the opportunity to brief the committee on our recent submission on the general scheme of the agricultural and food supply chain Bill 2022 and to share the views of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, on the proposed role and functions of the office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain.  Based on our experience as an enforcement agency, we will share our observations on the proposed approach to complaints, prohibitions and enforcement with regard to unfair trading practices, UTPs.</p> <p>  The CCPC welcomes the establishment of the office and believes that the Bill as proposed in the general scheme would enable the effective implementation of the UTP directive and some of the measures in the now revoked grocery goods regulations.  The CCPC welcomes that a key function of the office will be to make available analysis of information on price and market data in the agricultural and food supply chain in Ireland, and that the office will report and advise the Minister based on its analysis and research.  This will enable the new office to track market trends as they develop and identify issues arising in the agrifood sector, including any presence of systemic UTPs with wider impacts throughout the supply chain.  In turn, this will strengthen the office's ability to support and advise the Minister and make recommendations on any legislative or policy change it considers necessary based on that evidence.  This will allow for a more comprehensive picture of the supply chain than is currently available.</p> <p>  The CCPC also welcomes the emphasis placed on the importance of the office engaging with stakeholders and its empowerment to co-operate and consult with farmers, primary producers and buyers of agricultural and food products.  This will assist the office in the execution of its functions.  In addition, establishing strong relationships with such stakeholders will facilitate effective communication channels and encourage suppliers to come forward and engage with the office, on a confidential basis if required, allowing complaints to be brought to the attention of the new office.</p> <p>  Suppliers must have confidence that they would not face repercussions if they were to make a complaint.  It will be essential to ensure that robust confidentiality measures are put in place.  For this reason, the CCPC recommends that the provisions relating to confidentiality for complaints should be strengthened.  We suggest that similar provisions to the UK's groceries code regarding confidentiality, are considered.  In particular, the UK's groceries code sets out that the Groceries Code Adjudicator may not make an unauthorised disclosure of information that it thinks might cause someone to believe that a particular person has complained about a large retailer failing to comply with the code.</p> <p>  The CCPC welcomes the provisions of the Bill that will allow flexibility for the Minister to maintain or introduce national rules designed to combat UTPs that are not currently within the scope of the directive.  The approach also allows for the Minister to consider the reintroduction of the obligations of the grocery goods regulations on grocery businesses.</p><p>It is important that any such regulations be appropriate and evidence-based.  In this context, the CCPC very much welcomes the provisions set out in head 43 of the general scheme, where the office is mandated to review the regulations made under the Bill and to assist in the preparation of relevant draft legislation.  The CCPC also welcomes the provision under which the office will consult relevant persons before submitting proposals to the Minister or to any other Minister of the Government.</p><p> The CCPC notes that the UTP directive&rsquo;s list of prohibited UTPs are separated in two different categories, commonly referred to as the grey list and the blacklist.  The blacklist sets out the UTPs which are prohibited in any circumstance and the grey list sets out the UTPs which are prohibited unless they have been previously agreed in clear and unambiguous terms in the supply agreement or in a subsequent agreement between the supplier and the buyer.  It will be important for any regulations to clearly communicate the type of prohibition applicable to provide certainty to suppliers and buyers.  Having an adequate and robust enforcement framework will be key to the effectiveness of the office and the Bill&rsquo;s success for several reasons.  In the first instance, there may be a significant imbalance between the parties concerned in terms of bargaining power, expertise, resources and information.  Therefore, regulatory intervention will be necessary and appropriate.  The enforcement model must be capable of deterring traders from engaging in the prohibited practices concerned and the CCPC suggests that the office have a suite of interventions available to it which will address breaches at different times and with different effects.</p><p> The CCPC notes that, under head 50, a prosecution for an offence under the proposed Bill may be brought at any time within two years after the date of the alleged commission of the offence.  The CCPC recommends that this time limit be extended to three years to cater for a potential delay on the part of complainants, or their representatives, to bring a complaint to the office in the first instance.  Furthermore, the time limit should also allow for the office to conduct its investigations, especially given the potential complexity of some of the supply channels or trading environments which might be involved.</p><p> The CCPC welcomes the content of the general scheme.  It will provide a basis on which relationships in the agrifood supply chain can be strengthened and poor practices can be dealt with effectively.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan was the first to indicate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00300"><p>I thank the CCPC for its detailed submission and opening statement.  I wish to go through this enforcement area it is concentrating on.  It is the area I am interested in.  Ultimately, if this proposed legislation is to be effective, it must be enforced.  Mr. McHugh stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Having an adequate and robust enforcement framework will be key to the effectiveness of the Office ... In the first instance, there may be a significant imbalance between the parties concerned in terms of bargaining power, expertise, resources and information. </blockquote> <p>Will Mr. McHugh tease out each of those aspects of bargaining power, expertise, resources and information?  There is a lot involved and it has been encapsulated in that sentence.  It is a big ask but an important one.  Regarding enforcement, we will have to have the right powers, capacity, expertise and resources to make this undertaking a success.  All that, however, must be based on the appropriate and applicable information.  I ask Mr. McHugh to tease out how he envisages that working.  What is he asking of this committee?  In real terms, what is he saying there regarding some key and simple messages concerning recommendations to the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00400"><p>I will ask Mr. Murphy to speak about the issues Senator Boyhan raised and the enforcement aspect.  We broadly welcome the general scheme of the legislation.  We have made some recommendations, including on confidentiality, for example.  We have an understanding of the issues and imbalances in this industry.  We have engaged, and we will continue to engage, with the new office in the context of our operational experiences in this area.  Therefore, it is not necessarily that we are recommending significant changes to the enforcement powers.  I ask Mr. Murphy to speak about those powers in the proposed Bill and our experience of the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00500"><p>Our comments in this regard are generally based on our experience to date of enforcing similar provisions in the consumer protection field.  There is a suite of remedies.  Which one we use depends on the nature of the breach encountered.  We like to use what we call a quadrant, whereby we look at the intent and the information behind the breach itself.  To give an example, well-intentioned and well-informed traders will not appear on our radar because they are doing things properly.  Those instances, then, involving well-intentioned but ill-informed traders could be cases where those concerned do not realise they are engaging in something to that effect.  This is why we would deploy something like a compliance notice in that type of instance where we have identified something that is an offence and could be prosecuted in itself.  We will, however, make a call based on the intent behind the practice concerned and if those involved knew what they were doing.  Moving on, the third quadrant concerns those traders who are ill-informed and ill-intentioned.  These situations just go to prosecution.  The intent was there in the first place and those involved had a paucity of information regarding what they were doing.  The final quadrant then is the one that is probably the most problematic, namely, those who are well-informed but ill-intentioned.  Traders in this area might know what they are doing and be very aware strategically of it.  This requires us to have the robust framework we referred to in respect of having a suite of interventions available.</p> <p>  This is not necessarily just about enforcement.  Particular breaches that emerge might be examined.  The office would be in a position to advise the Minister that it has encountered certain practices that are not necessarily called out as prohibited in themselves.  This is a minimum harmonisation directive, which sets out ten blacklist and six grey list provisions.  They are not finite lists.  As the office develops in the years to come and gets to grips with the markets, which are complex, and the relationships in this area, it must have several interventions available to it.  This is what we welcome in that sense.  Examples would be a compliance notice, where an officer would identify an issue, make a judgement call, in consultation with whatever internal processes the office might have, and then deploy a compliance notice to address the issue and to bring it back on track.  That type of process is for those lower-level breaches.  In cases of other types of breaches, however, it would obviously not be appropriate or suitable to deal with them in that way and that is why criminal provisions are also needed to address those issues.  This is the complexity we are referring to in this context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00600"><p>On the suite of interventions spoken of, does the CCPC have a schedule of them?  The witnesses might not have it with them today, but it would be helpful to us and to our understanding.  There is clearly a scale and a hierarchy or matrix of interventions in this regard.  Mr. Murphy referred to the quadrant and I understand what he means by that.  Regarding what is an appropriate action in response to a particular type of circumstance, the suite of interventions is important.  The need for it has been referred to.  Has the CCPC worked out the level of responses in respect of the suite of interventions it considers appropriate?  I ask this because it is going to be important in respect of the overall review of this issue undertaken by this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00700"><p>Sure.  When we look at the proposed legislation as currently presented, there are the compliance notices, which I referred to, the summary prosecutions and the indictable prosecutions, which are filed with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  References also made to alternative dispute resolution processes.  Where the office would deem a particular issue amenable to being resolved in that alternative manner, such an approach would also be possible.  This is what I mean in respect of the interventions.  It concerns the approaches available and then making the relevant judgement in the context of the practice, the intent and what is to be delivered in this sense in respect of interventions.  It is not that the interventions are listed in a sort of chronological order.  When we read through the heads of this legislation, we see those as forming part of this suite.  Hopefully, this clarifies the position for the Senator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00800"><p>Are the interventions adequately covered in the proposed legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B00900"><p>Absolutely, with the rider that as this develops and as the office engages with the existing markets, based the complaints it receives and on the practices pointed out to it, the office can either satisfy itself that those interventions are appropriate and sufficient or it can advise the Minister that perhaps something else is required.  Again, however, this is an aspect that will develop over time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#B01000"><p>Turning to the dispute resolution mechanism, that is a positive move.  Ultimately, this is about continuing on, people learning lessons and moving on from them.  It is about having an appropriate response to an issue.</p><p>Does Mr. Murphy see greater potential for dispute resolution in this area at a certain level, clearly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#C00200"><p>It is very much dependent on, let us say, the first cases that might be referred to it and if there is confidence in that system.  I think the head addressed it appropriately and adequately where, in the office's opinion, an alternative dispute resolution, ADR, would be suitable for it and then making sure that whoever is conducting the ADR is impartial, independent and proficient in that respect as well.  Again, part of our statutory function generally is that we promote the use of ADR so we would welcome something along these lines.  Again, however, people would have to have confidence in that system and it very much depends on how the office would administer that.  We would see it as a positive development, however, particularly having that function available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#C00300"><p>Okay.  I thank Mr. Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#C00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses this evening from the CCPC.  As Senator Boyhan said, I thank them for their submission and opening statement.  I have no doubt we will be taking their suggestions on board when we draw up our final report.  I have enough information in that regard.</p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses do that which is somewhat impossible - to look into the future for the purposes of debate and assume that the office of fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain is up and running.  According to what we have in front of us now, there may be some tweaks before that happens.  How do the witnesses see the new office's role align with the CCPC's role?  How will they complement each other?  Are there going to be any grey areas between?</p> <p>  I will use an example for the purposes of debate.  Prior to the new office's inception, if I or anyone else reckoned there was a cartel in the beef industry, which has happened in the past because we have had the CCPC here before, I would go to the CCPC.  I assume I would be sent to the new office once it is up and running.  Would the CCPC send me to the new office?  Basically, what I am simply trying to get at is how the CCPC can see its role changing.  Will it enhance or inhibit its role?  How does it see that marriage?  The CCPC will still be in existence.  The new office will be taking some of the work, such as the example I just gave that would have gone to the CCPC.  How do the witnesses see the relationship between the CCPC and this new body going forward?  Do they think they will be helpful to each other or that it could cause some conflict or issues for the CCPC going back as a form of identity of its role within the whole system in agriculture and in the competition side of it?  I know the CCPC will still probably be dealing with the consumer but from farmer to retailer, that whole competition side, will the CCPC then be losing that role?  Has anybody told the CCPC what its new role will be in it?  Has it any vision of how it will work with the new body?  How does it see that working?</p> <p>  Call it naivete or whatever I had before I read any of the CCPC's documentation, but I had an impression that it would have perhaps come here almost opposing this because the new office was going to be taking the CCPC's clothes and that the commission would be circling the wagons.  I was a bit taken aback by the positivity in its documentation.  That triggered to me the question of how these people see this working with them post its enactment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#C00500"><p>We very much welcome this proposed legislation.  I think there is real clarity between the different roles of the CCPC and the new office.  We previously had responsibilities under the grocery goods regulation.  Those are now ended and the new office will take on responsibilities largely coming out of the UTP directive, which is much wider in terms of the issues it is dealing with compared to the grocery goods regulation.  However, there are some learnings we will have.  We have and will continue to engage with the Department and the new office on our learnings from that specific area around the supply chain and the relationship between retailers and primary producers, for example.  We have done that already but we will continue to do that with the new office.  Over time, we expect that we will continue to engage with it and discuss matters of common interest.</p> <p>  One thing that is very clear, as is the new office, is that we remain responsible for enforcing breaches in competition law, which would include any cartels.  We will retain that responsibility.  That is very clear.  We strongly encourage anyone who has any evidence or concerns around potential cartel behaviour in the agricultural industry or, indeed, any other industry, to approach us.  We have a number of routes and avenues under which individuals and companies can do that.  We will also be getting new powers under the legislation on the  European competition network directive, ECN+, directive, which has just passed the Oireachtas.  It will be really welcome.  There is, therefore, a clear differentiation between our different roles.  We would expect that in terms of the new office being an expert in that industry and understanding the market and collecting data and evidence, we would engage with it, as we do with other agencies that are experts in areas, about its views and what it sees in the market.  In terms of the powers, however, there is a very clear difference and there are very clear different roles we will both retain.</p></speech>

Even though it is in the agriculture sector and has almost definitively been identified in layman's terms that it is 100% obvious there is a cartel, it will go to the CCPC.  Does Mr. McHugh not think this will complicate matters as this new body is agrifood-related?  That was my question.  How does Mr. McHugh see that situation evolve?  Were I to go to the CCPC with blinding evidence of a cartel within the agrifood sector, what is the CCPC's relationship with this new body in dealing with that?  Mr. McHugh is telling me that the CCPC has to deal with that.</p></speech>

We will do the investigation.  We are empowered to do that under the legislation.  If it was to be considered a criminal matter, for example, we would send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and we would have the investigation teams in place to be able to handle a criminal investigation, very similar to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We would have those teams in place.  We are empowered to do those investigations in all industries for cartels and breaches in competition law.</p> <p>  We would engage with many other agencies in many other industries if there were to be allegations or investigations to get their views on the market and what they see.  We have strong relationships with many agencies in the State, depending on what particular industry we were looking at at the time.  We would expect with the new office, again, that where appropriate and where we are looking into the agricultural industry, we would have discussions with it on what it sees, what evidence it has and potentially what data it has.  We encourage anyone with evidence of cartels to come to us and engage with us.  We would certainly welcome and encourage this new office, if it identifies any particular issues around cartels, to come and speak to us and engage with us.  We want to get evidence.  We strongly believe there are cartels out there in the State.  We have put much effort into encouraging people to come forward whatever the source might be.  We would very much do that with the new office as well.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McHugh not think people watching the debate this evening would almost assume even by virtue of its title that the office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain, and Mr. McHugh keeps using the cartel example, that this will come under that umbrella?</p></speech>

We do gas, electricity and water.  If someone was to approach the new office, he or she would be well aware of our role in terms of breaches of competition law.  We would expect to have established a relationship and understanding with the new office whereby if anyone approached it with that type of information, it would pass it on to us.</p></speech>

We deal with bureaucracy as public representatives on a daily basis.  I can almost envisage examples where somebody is sent to the new office and six months later, he or she will get an email saying it is actually the CCPC with which he or she should be dealing.</p><p>There is an opening here for people to wonder to where they should go, which will prolong their inquiries.</p></speech>

We have cartel lines and the WhistleB platform programme for people to approach us.  We speak to other agencies about those avenues.  If a person approaches one of a variety of agencies with that type of allegation, supported by evidence, the agency will recognise its urgency and significance and be able to point to the CCPC as the body that has that role and does that job.   The alternative is to put in place criminal investigation teams in lots of different agencies.  It is a specific role.  To bring a file to the DPP to the level of criminal standard that is needed requires a specific set of skills.  One needs to build a team that is experienced in doing it.  It would not be efficient to have different teams across the State to do that because they may only do one case every few years.</p></speech>

I will be brief because there may be a vote coming up in the Seanad shortly.  Mr. McHugh referred to the gathering of data being a major part of the proposed new office.  In the witnesses' unique experience, will that be feasible?  Are those data out there?  How much access is there to those data?  Will the office get appropriate data on which to make conclusions in respect of what is happening in the agrifood market?</p></speech>

A benefit of having this new office is that it will be particularly focused on the industry and, through the years, will build up a data set.  We see it with other agencies and regulators that have a significant amount of knowledge, information and understanding of a market.  We find that really useful.   Going from where we are now and the narrow role we have under the grocery goods regulations, GGRs, to this new office will involve a step change in terms of the amount of data and knowledge the office will have on the market.  Without trying to define exactly how much data it will hold or where it will end up, having that evidence base will be very helpful in terms of arriving at the decisions we will need to make on whatever the matter might be.  I will ask Mr. Murphy to speak to our experience.</p></speech>

There is a lot of information out there.  I note that the office will be empowered to retain the services of consultants to gather and consider that information in order to analyse what the information is showing in terms of market trends and so on, for example.  From our perspective, there was a requirement under the GGRs which is mirrored in the heads of Bill for regulated entities to submit an annual compliance report, ACR.  The ACR set out certain matters that had to be reported back to the commission.  That gives an insight.  The regulated undertaking is required to provide that information.  We set out what was required to be submitted in terms of the format and the timing of it.  That very much influenced how we conducted our compliance and monitoring inspections in the following year.  Once a system such as that, which allows data to be collected, is put in place, those data sets will build up through the years and provide information that will point to certain areas and developments.  Mr. McHugh referred to the expertise and the general engagement the office will have in the context of the many sectors, traders and complexity involved.  Once it develops that aspect, it will know which data to mine.  I am confident in that regard but it will take time, a level of proficiency and efficient resources to carry through on that.</p></speech>

We met individuals and organisations that wished to offer observations.  We did not charge a fee for that because there was no provision within the regulation in that regard.

It is a significant body of work, given the amount of data that will be collected.  Mr. Murphy referred to a requirement to bring in consultants.  How big will the office be in terms of manpower and its associated budgets?  It seems like a significant body of work compared with that of the CCPC.

We are not expert enough to give the exact number, but Mr. Murphy will speak about the type of work we did and the teams that did it.</p></speech>

It is difficult to see how that will align.  What I can say is that once the compliance, monitoring and enforcement was passed to the consumer protection division, we had staff dedicated to this issue.  At different times, they performed this function in addition to their other tasks.  The consumer protection division has significant experience in conducting compliance, monitoring and supervision on issues such as pricing and misleading commercial practices in the retail sector.  We have experience in the front-of-house area, let us say.  We then had to pivot to the back office and headquarters area to go through the contracts and what kind of pricings there were in terms of promotions, marketing, wastage, shrinkage and all of that.  It is a lot of work, particularly given that we were only dealing with direct suppliers to a number of large wholesalers and retailers-----</p></speech>

That was just one aspect of the supply chain.  The UTP directive has many links along the supply chain, with many more actors and stakeholders involved.  It is difficult to answer the Senator's question at this time.  We can offer observations on the inputs required from us in terms of administering the grocery good regulations but this will be an expanded field with more suppliers and different complexities.  Members will have noticed there are graded steps in terms of the relationships between turnovers.  The office will probably have to decide where its priorities lie in terms of where its initial focus will be.   There is a body of work there but I am not in a position to state that it will require X full-time equivalents to carry out the functions.  There is a significant amount of work involved.</p></speech>

I am still trying to get a handle on what the budget should be to run this entity and what manpower is needed for a suitably staffed organisation to apply the directive  I am at a loss in finding that answer.  What is the manpower and budget of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, just to put it into context or would it be hard to compare like with like?</p></speech>

We have a very wide remit in competition, consumer protection, and financial education.  Our budget is about &euro;18 million, but it includes a variety of areas that would not be relevant.  What we can and will do is engage with the office in terms of the type of work we used to do.  We have a legal department that helped out with legal advice from time to time.  We can talk about the type of work and resources we required.  We had inspection teams that went out to retailers and those teams needed to be trained to do that and write reports.  We had a structure whereby the commission members were involved and had discussions.  At the start, we set up an event to engage with the industry.  Advertisements were placed in trade journals which our communications department helped with.  It is very hard to translate all of what I have just set out into one number.  In helping the new office to understand the type of work that is required, it would be useful to say that while it was different, it certainly had some similarities so it can begin to put together a resource plan.</p></speech>

The GGRs were designed to address particular practices, aspects of contracts such as what was prohibited or what was allowed but only with the agreement of the parties.  In terms of fair trading, it involved avoiding unilateral variation clauses and late payments.  The GGRs predated the UTP directive.  The directive is built much more on that.  There is some crossover between what was prohibited, but there are more specific aspects to the UTP directive and it covers a much wider area.  It deals with many more actors along that chain than the CCPC dealt with.  The CCPC was only involved at the end of the chain where the supplier dealt directly with the retailer or wholesaler.  This goes back a lot more.  On the consumer protection side, we still only deal with business to consumer, B to C, transactions.  A lot of what we look at here is business to business, B to B, transactions.  By definition, these suppliers are traders so it did not fall within our previous remit.</p></speech>

The witnesses will know that one of the criticisms of this committee, and we have spoken about it previously, relates to allegations of either price fixing or cartel-like behaviour.  Essentially, the position of the CCPC is that it does not have the evidence to follow that through.  However, it can decide to initiate investigations into a particular set of circumstances.</p><p>To my mind, it has never carried out a comprehensive investigation into what are now consistent and sustained allegations dating back several years that the meat processing sector is essentially operating a position where there is collaboration, to put it mildly.  Why has that been the case?</p></speech>

We had well over 100 complaints from various parties, including allegations of cartel in this sector.  We looked into it carefully and spoke to a number of parties about what evidence there was.  We put quite an amount of resource into it and spent nearly a year looking at all aspects of the quite varied complaints.  There was not just one.  We then set out and published the reasons we did not open a formal investigation.  They are still on our website in terms of what we found and that the evidence we had did not justify opening a full investigation.</p> <p>  Cartels by their nature are secret.  The norm in a cartel would be to have the evidence of a form of a contract and an agreement between those parties to fix prices, for example.  One of the very common steps one would do in investigating a cartel is carry out raids.  We would need a warrant to do raids.  In order to get a warrant one must go to a judge.  There is due process and one needs an element of evidence to be able to do that, and rightly so.  We all would agree with that.  We did not have that level of evidence to open an investigation into a cartel on the back of the complaints and the work we did.  We set that out and the reasons for it.</p> <p>  As I have said previously and I will say again today and in the future, we welcome evidence from anyone with regard to a cartel.  We will look at any evidence we get.  During the process of the complaints we spoke to multiple parties across the industry and-----</p></speech>

It will have the power to investigate UTPs and potential breaches of UTPs, and rightly so.

Those are very specific skills, and this new office quite rightly is not empowered to do that.</p></speech>

We are making the point here because obviously this is a complex sector, as we have said, with many links in the chain and many stakeholders involved.</p><p>I have no doubt there will be challenges in gathering evidence as there always are to get to a criminal standard.  Also, we are reliant upon an individual making a complaint with respect to having been under either the receiving end of a breach or identifying the fact that there is a breach of the UTPs and the timing as to when he or she would actually come to the office.  It can be the case where somebody discovers that there is a breach and either does not realise that it is a breach or does not come forward straight away with it.  Time passes and by the time that then gets to the office, the clock has already started running.  In addition, there also are other limitation periods that provide for complexity and we believe that, given our experience on this, it would be best if the timeframe was expanded to three years.</p></speech>

I again thank the witnesses for coming.  Coming back to what Deputy Carthy was speaking about, have concerns been raised about cartel-like behaviour with the CCPC?  Has it been brought to the attention of the CCPC?  If so, how did it act?  What evidence does it require to investigate these allegations?  Previously, the CCPC more or less demanded that farmers should come up with that evidence.  I do not think the onus should be on the farmers, individuals or groups to find the evidence and come forward.  The CCPC seems to be putting all the onus on others to come up with something that it can investigate.  Have cases come before the CCPC that it has acted on and if so, how did it act on it?</p></speech>

There were a number of complaints, including about cartel-like activity in beef processing, foreign imports of beef, the offal market and how the in-spec system worked in terms of pricing.  There were quite a few complaints; it was not just one.</p> <p>  We worked through those issues for about a year, engaging with different parties.  We then produced a note on our website going through what the complaints were, the work that we had done, what our conclusion was in terms of the issues we saw in the market and whether there was a potential breach of competition law.  That is on our website.  Again, I am happy to share it and forward it on if that is appropriate.  Our conclusion was that we did not have the evidence to open an investigation.</p> <p>  We understand that concerns exist and they are real because we engaged with and spoke to quite a number of parties.  A breach of competition law is a criminal matter for which one can be brought to court and imprisoned for up to ten years.  It is a very serious matter.  In terms of investigating it, getting warrants and doing raids, which would be the norm for a cartel investigation, we did not have the evidence to do that.  That is not to say that therefore, we then claim there is nothing to see here.  We are not saying that.  We understand the frustration and engage with those parties.</p></speech>

I have been in those meetings with farmers and their representative bodies.  Again, I refer to what we can do.   We have these very strong powers.  We must look at what the outcome might be of an investigation.  Just because a significant number of people have concerns about an industry, for example, is not enough to get a warrant to do raids on offices.</p> <p>  We are not saying that therefore, this or any industry does not have cartel activity.  We believe there are cartels out there in Ireland in different industries.  We are very keen and put much effort into creating channels whereby parties can come forward with evidence.  One of the new things we will have under ECN+, thanks to the legislation that has just passed through the Oireachtas, is a leniency.  For the first time, the CCPC can now make findings of breaches of competition law and we can fine companies.  What that brings is us being able to offer reductions in fines to companies.  This has been a very successful tool elsewhere in Europe in identifying cartels.  Most cartels are identified by parties coming forward with evidence.  We now have that leniency tool and we hope that will make a difference.</p></speech>

The CCPC cannot just go in and fine a company without actually investigating it.</p> <p>  Mr. McHugh said the office must have a suite of interventions available to it that will address breaches at different times and have different effects.  What does he have in mind that may not be included?  Can he expand on his reference to addressing different breaches at different times?</p></speech>

When we have the evidence, we will take action.  We will take action against anyone in any industry where that evidence is.  It is important to note that in the beef industry development, we took action in this sector around beef processing, which resulted in the fining of activities that were prohibited under competition law.  There is currently a case before the courts in terms cartels as a result of a file that we sent to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  We found cartels in home heating oil.  We are the first country in Europe to have a criminal conviction for cartels.  Again, we are here to investigate, fine and put an end to cartels.  Again, I would encourage anyone with any evidence to come and engage with us, because we will engage with them.  Where there is evidence, we will take action.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. Murphy answer the question on UTPs.</p></speech>

We welcome that there is a suite of interventions available ranging from alternative dispute resolution, compliance notices, summary prosecution to prosecution on indictment.  In our experience and opinion, having that available gives the office that flexibility to put in place a proportionate response to breaches that it may come across.  For example, it not a case that for somebody with a hammer, every problem is a nail.  It is a case of the office satisfying itself as to what the breach was, the intent behind it and then having something other than, let us say, something straight through to a prosecution, because in many of these relationships, it is often the case that parties will have to continue to trade with each other.  Therefore, we want to maintain relationships if at all possible, which might be difficult following a criminal prosecution.  I suggest that have an ADR facility certainly would encourage something such as that.  A lesser intervention, but an intervention no doubt, is that compliance notice where the office is of the opinion that there has been a contravention, puts it to the party that offended and the party has an opportunity to either accept it or appeal it.  Ultimately, it then ends up before the Circuit Court, which can either accept it, vary it or vary conditions.  We welcome those.  It indicates a good regulatory model.  It is one that we have had much success with over the years and one that we would advocate for.</p></speech>

[the] members or suppliers ... [etc.]&quot;.  Rather than the reference to requesting, should confidentiality not be the default position?  Is the CCPC concerned that the way the text is structured could leave room for interpretation that may have an adverse effect on what may be the assumption of confidentiality?</p></speech>

In this industry, with regard to the supply chain, ensuring that there is confidential information is very important.  We have proposed and referenced the approach in the UK, which is a stronger approach in terms of confidentiality.  The adjudicator, as it is in the UK, may not make an unauthorised disclosure of information that it thinks might cause someone to think that a particular person has complained about a large retailer.  Given our experience of the industry, about which I am happy to let Mr. Murphy talk, we think this is a very important area that could do with some strengthening.</p></speech>

One of the challenges we face under the grocery good regulations, GGRs, and I expect it might be the same for the office going forward, is securing what I have described as robust and actionable information.  That information is, ultimately, what informs either investigations, attitudes towards, or aspects of what might be going on in the markets for very understandable reasons.  In fact, the UTP directive, which provides much of the genesis for what we see in the Bill, identifies that and calls out that there is a fear of retaliation.  Suppliers might not wish to come forward or, certainly, might not be forthcoming, because of a possible fear of de-listing or an equivalent.  We welcome the fact that there are provisions in the Bill that deal with that, in that if there is evidence to show that somebody suffered as a result of making a complaint the office has an enforcement role in that regard.</p> <p>  From the GGR experience, we were always at pains to stress that we would need useful information.  In circumstances where there was a feeling that there was non-compliance with some aspects of regulations, we did not find that a formal complaint was forthcoming.  Where the current Bill, as laid out, encourages engagement, co-operation and interaction with the various stakeholders, this could be developed and in some way assuage the fear that might be out there of coming forward with a complaint.  In reality, unless one has actionable information, it is very difficult to move on it and to form a basis for an investigation.  That is the background to our observation.</p></speech>

With regard to the new body that is being set up and the CCPC, is there any change at present?  Our understanding, from talking to the Minister last week, is that the body is not allowed to talk about price.  It can compare with other places in Europe, for example, what cattle are making in the beef sector.  It is basically nearly trying to embarrass someone, rather than being able to put the foot down with regard to price.  I note that when the farming organisations to which the CCPC referred earlier met in the task force, it was very quick to send a letter that nobody could talk about price.  Is that still the case from the CCPC's reading of the new regulator that will be set up, in that, basically, a farmer is no better off when it comes to talking about price?</p></speech>

With regard to the discussion of prices, the point we make about them is that it is important that parties which are in competition with one another do not discuss and come to an agreement on prices to, effectively, fix them.  That would be a breach of competition law.  I am not sure if the Deputy is referring to that issue.  In terms of our role, however, we would have an obvious concern about businesses discussing pricing among themselves, in that it would have the potential to be cartel-like activity.</p></speech>

Retail Ireland is the representative body for the entire retail sector in Ireland.  Our members include Ireland&rsquo;s main retail brands, including a wide range of grocery retailers, department stores, DIY, electrical retailers, clothing and fashion retailers, symbol groups, forecourts, and independent stores.</p> <p>  Retail is Ireland's largest private sector employer, with a presence in every city, town and village across the country.  The sector directly employs over 300,000 people and supports many thousands more jobs throughout the supply chain, often in small, family run businesses.  Unlike many other sectors, retail jobs are evenly spread across the country.  In every region, it is either the largest or second largest employer, with its share of employment typically ranging from 12% to 15.5%.  However, the positive impact of retail goes far beyond the economic benefits of the jobs it creates.  Retail plays a crucial role in developing its people and improving the local communities in which it operates.  It contributes to the vibrancy and prosperity of localities, and plays a major role in supporting sport clubs, community groups and charities.  The grocery sector supports a vibrant and dynamic food supply chain and works with its suppliers to sustain hundreds of thousands of jobs, and provide quality, choice, and value to Irish consumers.</p> <p>  There is a long history of Irish law to ensure fairness in how the supply chain operates.  In recent years, retailers worked closely with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and their suppliers to embed the grocery goods regulations introduced in 2016.  More recently again, we have actively worked with the interim Unfair Trading Practice Enforcement Authority to ensure members are fully aware of their obligations under the recently introduced regulations.  This has involved various briefing sessions with the enforcement authority and the provision of training on unfair trading practice, UTP, rules, in addition to the direct engagement that individual companies have with the authority.  As such, retailers have done extensive work to comply with the UTP rules and prepare for the introduction of this legislation.  This includes large retailers, but also many smaller grocery retailers, that are subject to the rules due to the relatively low turnover threshold.</p> <p>  Retail Ireland and its members recognise and appreciate the need to ensure fairness and sustainability in the agrifood supply chain.  It is also important to note, particularly given the context of rising inflation and increases to the cost of living, that robust competition throughout the food supply chain is vital in delivering value for money, choice and quality to Irish consumers.  Working with partners across the supply chain, the retail sector has demonstrated its ability to do this over the last decade.  It is crucial that nothing is done to undermine its ability to do the same over the course of the next ten years.</p> <p>  Our submission sets out some specific observations regarding the legislation currently under consideration.  These include a range of issues, first among which is the collection of market information.  Recently, Retail Ireland has engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine over separate EU market transparency requirements to report on the price paid for mince and butter.  In particular, to overcome issues around the sharing and management of market sensitive data and the need to ensure the collection of comparable information from different market participants.  It is important that the new office for fairness and transparency engages with the retail sector on these issues into the future.</p> <p>  The second issue is the balance on the board.  To represent all parts of the supply chain fairly and ensure balance, it is important that the board of the new office has experienced representatives from a diverse range of backgrounds.  We suggest that a representative of the retail sector should constitute at least one of the ordinary members of the board.  It is also important that the voice of the consumer is represented.  There is strong precedent for this proposal in other State-appointed boards.  In addition, to ensure balance, we would suggest that a quorum should need to include at least one independent member.  In other words, the chairperson and two primary producers should not constitute a quorum.</p><p>The third issue is the turnover threshold.  The purpose of the UTPs and the associated enforcement authorities is to afford greater protections to smaller suppliers and primary producers, not larger multinational corporations that have significant bargaining power in the market.  As such, we believe there is no justification to increase the qualifying supplier turnover thresholds beyond the current &euro;350 million level. </p><p> The fourth issue is the definition of grey and black UTPs and the prospect of future changes.  It is important to note that the UTP rules are still relatively new having only come into force in April of last year and, as highlighted in the research presented to the UTP seminar hosted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 5 April, awareness of them is low.  Only 50% of primary producers are aware of the existence of UTP rules and only 14% are familiar with the 16 UTPs.  This rises to only 19% when all business-to-business suppliers are included in the results.  Given this context, it is vital that current UTP obligations are afforded the necessary time to bed in and that this is done in a way that is not too onerous for smaller retail businesses with limited resources.  If there is to be any consideration given to changing the UTP list in the future, this should be done only when it can be fully informed by an appraisal of the effectiveness of the established regulatory obligations and with adequate time for a full consultation with all relevant stakeholders.  It was encouraging to hear the Minister last week confirm that the plan is not to change the current list of UTPs at this time but rather to implement and assess the effectiveness of the current system in the first instance.   </p><p> Before concluding, I want to stress that the general observations of the retail sector are limited to the substance of the Bill as presented.  Retail Ireland and its members take their obligations under competition rules very seriously and as such, Retail Ireland does not engage with members, or facilitate engagement between members, on matters that are in any way commercially sensitive.  Members of Retail Ireland do not discuss, communicate, or exchange any market-sensitive information, including non-public information relating to prices; marketing and advertising strategies; costs and revenues; trading terms and conditions with third parties, including purchasing strategy; terms of supply; trade programmes; or distribution strategies.  In this context, Retail Ireland as an association does not have an insight, and as such does not have a position, on many pricing and wider commercial issues relating to the food supply chain. </p><p> In conclusion, I would again thank the committee again for the opportunity to share the view of retailers on this piece of legislation.  I am happy to take any questions on this position and if there are any areas where I do not have the relevant information to hand, I am happy to follow up afterwards. </p></speech>

At the moment, Retail Ireland would be working with the CCPC.  How does it envisage the working relationship when the new office of fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain comes into being by virtue of the fact that Retail Ireland will probably still be dealing with the CCPC?  We have just heard from the CCPC.  From listening to its deliberation and reading its submission, I can see there will be a lot of crossover between the new body and the role currently played by the CCPC when it comes to agrifood supply, a role that apparently will be maintained.  How does Retail Ireland envisage that affecting its relationship with either organisation or both?</p></speech>

With the revoking of those provisions, that engagement has shifted to engagement with the interim enforcement authority, which is part of the Department and will in turn be part of this office of fairness and transparency when it gets up and running on foot of the legislation.  In terms of our role as a trade association, we would not directly engage with the CCPC on market-related issues.  That would be for individual companies to do.  However, we have already been working with the enforcement authority around the bedding in of the regulations around UTPs, which will flow into the activity of this new office.  We have been working with the authority in terms of making people aware of the provisions.  Recent surveys have highlighted that there is a lack of awareness.  I do not think this is necessarily the case when it comes to retailers.  We have held a number of briefings with the authority and put in place a range of training provisions.  In that respect, we would be very supportive of the role of the new office in terms of promoting its activities and enforcement role in respect of UTPs.  I think it will have a role in reaching out to many other participants in the supply chain to try to improve awareness of that.  This is somewhat in the context of my comments about the existing list of UTPs.  It is important that those are afforded an opportunity to bed in and that the office is afforded an opportunity to do that piece of work before any consideration is given to expanding that list.</p> <p>  What is new in terms of the functions and role of the office is the role it will play in terms of collecting data and reporting on the activities in the food supply chain.  We are very happy and willing to participate in that and work with and support the office in that regard.  Certain data that is market-sensitive will probably will not feature in the work of the office but it can play a valuable role in terms of informing a better understanding of the various relationships that exist in the supply chain.  That will help support policy decisions into the future.  </p></speech>

I would imagine that the majority of the products that would be on the shelves of Retail Ireland's members would come via processors or larger outlet units.  Would Retail Ireland have a very large percentage of members with direct dealings with the primary producer - in this instance, the farmer?</p></speech>

That is an important point to make in the context of this discussion and a discussion around UTPs.  Given that the majority of significant grocery retailers in this country would not deal directly with primary producers, in this regard, they would not have active commercial relationships with those so they would deal with food processors, suppliers and wholesalers.  Some of the data that came up in that survey material in terms of people's awareness of UTPs and what relationships are subject to those new rules.</p></speech>

Another issue that comes up repeatedly in conversations with members is the board.  A chairperson and a board constituted of five individuals or ordinary members are envisaged.  It has already been designated that two of these will be from the primary producers.  There is certainly a sense that if that is to have a governance role in terms of oversight over the enforcement authority, which will obviously have very important roles in terms of monitoring activity, reporting on UTPs and potentially prosecuting parties that are in breach, there should be a broad swathe of representation on that board representing different actors in the supply chain.  That is what our recommendation would be in terms of a retail representative on that board along with a voice of the consumer.</p></speech>

Mr. Dillon might give me a flavour of where he thinks the bedding-in process has happened with these UTPs and what he thinks is required to make sure there is an uptake of information.</p><p>In his presentation does it state that it is the primary producer or the retailer that has the issue with knowledge of this?  Where does Mr. Dillon think the deficiency is at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Arnold Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022070600002#R00200"><p>At a recent seminar hosted by the Department a survey was presented looking at awareness of the UTP rules.  It demonstrated very low awareness, particularly, I think, among primary producers but also among other actors in the supply chain and other suppliers.  The larger businesses and retailers are probably very plugged into this.  The UTPs are legislative obligations that have been in discussion for many years at a European level and are very much on the radar of the main players.  An awful lot of work will have been done already to ensure their businesses are compliant.  The challenge in respect of awareness of this falls to the smaller processors and operators in the retail sector, like in a food chain.  The threshold to be subject to these rules is very different from those in the grocery code.  The annual turnover threshold is only &euro;2 million.  As for the awareness campaign that has been discussed and is envisaged by the interim authority, that is probably where its targeted audience needs to be.</p></speech>

Where does this campaign go?  For the new authority, taking into consideration the lack of knowledge at primary level of the legislation brought in 18 months ago, what does Mr. Dillon envisage will be the drive to make sure we get that knowledge base for the new legislation down to the primary producer?</p></speech>

Other associations representing other parts of the supply chain will play a key role in communicating with their members.  From the comments made last week, I suspect there will be a need for a much wider campaign in that regard and, potentially, a wider media and communications campaign to make people aware of this new office and of these UTP rules.</p></speech>

I asked the previous witnesses about this issue.  These are publicly available data.  Does Mr. Dillon think there will be an issue with the gathering of these data?  Does he think there will be a sensitivity, to say the very least, around this issue?  Does he think there will be buy-in from Retail Ireland's membership in respect of these data?</p></speech>

In certain circumstances there are already obligations on retailers when it comes to disclosure of certain pricing information.  A lot of information on relationships with suppliers is commercially sensitive and I do not envisage it being covered by the work of this office, but there is already a raft of information available publicly, and the CSO collates data regularly.  We have had experience working with the Department over the past year on recently introduced new EU transparency measures on the collection of data for mince and butter, as I cited.  Members had certain concerns about how those data were collected and how they would be used to ensure they were presented in a way that accurately reflected what was going on in the market.  Those data were going to the European Commission, so there were also concerns that the data collected in Ireland would be comparable to the similar data that were being collected in other member states.  There are therefore sometimes specific issues that need to be looked at when it comes to how data are collected and used.  I would be very keen to be engaged with the office in representing the retail perspective in that discussion.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Dillon think Retail Ireland's membership feels threatened by that issue, or will there be buy-in at a local level in that regard?  Having spoken to retailers, I think they are generally concerned about this legislation.  They have a view that it might be a little heavy-handed.</p></speech>

I repeat the point I made earlier about the constitution of the board of the office and ensuring the work of the office is done in a fair and even-handed way and with regard to fairness across the different players in the supply chain.  That would be a concern of retailers, I suppose, and that would potentially feed into concerns about the sort of remit the office would have.</p></speech>

In the absence of a ban on below-cost selling, an analysis of costs and margins along the supply chain may be needed to compare profits with the amount for which the product was purchased from the supplier.  What is Retail Ireland's view on doing that?  If the office took that approach, would it encounter resistance from the sector?  What is Mr. Dillon's view on taking that kind of approach to this?</p></speech>

There would be sensitivities, I think, for any player at the various stages of the supply chain and concerns about market-sensitive information being disclosed and how that would be used and how other parties would be subject to similar requests.  To reiterate the point I made during my opening statement, when it comes to commercially sensitive issues of profit margins and relationships between retailers and their suppliers, it is not a subject we engage our members on at all and not an area on which we facilitate engagement between members.  In that respect, that is an issue we have not discussed with members.  When it comes to disclosing profit margins, there may be an issue with company law as to what information is available.  When it comes to publicly available information, however, we envisage the office operating on that basis.</p></speech>

Would that information be of a significantly sensitive nature and would it be considered inappropriate to furnish the office with it?</p></speech>

That, I suppose, is one of the outstanding questions retailers have of this office, and there is not really yet clarity on the type of information and how it would be used.  Without that clarity and without a clear statement of intent from a new office, it is very hard to answer that question.</p></speech>

We as a retail association and our umbrella body in Brussels, EuroCommerce, have always been actively engaged in this debate.  Our primary objective in these discussions has not really been about being in favour or against it but that if this is the line of travel, we want to make sure the rules as constituted fairly reflect the concerns of retailers.  This is the purpose of this conversation today.  As the rules manifest in domestic law and expand to include the creation of this new office, our objective is that retail concerns are taken into consideration in the process.</p></speech>

We have raised a number of issues about the UTP list but there are very good reasons for the position we set out in terms of not expanding the current list of ten black UTPs and six grey UTPs.  This is not simply due to retail interest.  There are other supplier interests, for example, when it comes to the grey UTPs, that see such activity as being commercially beneficial to both parties.  There is also compelling consumer interest in this regard.  I do not see the perspectives that we bring to the debate as being exclusive to retail but broadly, they are supported by other parties in the supply chain.</p></speech>

The Bill in itself is a significant expansion of the rules that already existed.  The primary objective of retailers in engaging in this discussion is to ensure the interests of retail, which is a very important sector and employs an awful lot of people, as well as of consumers, are reflected in how it is constituted.  I do not think it is necessarily seen to be characterised as representing a vested interest in the supply chain.</p></speech>

I will make a number of observations because I appreciate that committee members are anxious to hear the perspective of retailers on this.  When it comes to below-cost selling, the first point to make is that such promotions are paid for by retailers and they are of enormous value to consumers.  It is important to make this point ,particularly in the context of the significant cost of living increases we have seen.  There is also the desire of the retail sector, which is very competitive, to continue to be able to deliver value for money to its consumers.  When the debate took place on the groceries order, some of the most strident advocates for its abolition were consumer advocates.</p><p>We should be very careful about taking any steps that are likely to lead and push up the cost of food to Irish consumers.  I also refer to the Minister's comments last week, with which we would concur, that there were very limited data to suggest it actually had the desired effect with the objectives of the ban.  If that issue arises again and becomes a live and active debate, we would be happy to engage with members on that and come back to the committee to reflect those views.</p></speech>

Obviously, Irish retailers value enormously the relationship with their suppliers.  One only needs to go into any grocery store to see the value and the promotion that is placed on quality Irish produce.  Certainly, Irish retailers are very anxious to continue on and have a sustainable relationship with suppliers in the future.  At the same time, individual retailers must also compete in a very competitive market to make sure that they can sustain their own market share and in turn be able to deliver that quality, choice and value to Irish consumers.  I reiterate the point that we are entering a phase where there is acute pressure on many consumers due to cost-of-living rises.  It is very important that the retail industry is still allowed to play its role in delivering value to Irish consumers in that context.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Dillon think it would raise an eyebrow that up to one year ago, retailers and factories had a lot of different specifications around the 30-month rule, the movements and all of the other stuff around Bord Bia quality assured specs?  I assume it is the same people eating the same food in the last year so it is funny then to see all of a sudden, when the volume was not around, that the specification of 30-month rule changed, and the four movements could then be five or eight, and the quality assurance did not matter and you got a flat price.  How come the retailers could adjust to that overnight when it was alleged that it was them who required these specs for their consumers when they were giving the same stuff out to the consumers the last year?</p></speech>

Retail Ireland represents these retailers and the specifications have been here for three, four and five years, and in the last year.  Nothing has changed.  I am asking the question.  Did the housewife or the person who buys the food decide?  How come it changed all of a sudden when the numbers got tight?  Is it the processor or is it the retailer?  Who is it that decided that nothing could be said at present because the numbers were not there?  What is the cause?  With the new legislation coming in we will be monitoring what we can put into it in the line of amendments.  It raises an eyebrow for anybody that in 2019, the retailers needed a list of stuff as long as a copybook to have with an animal when it was going for sale but this year they would grab your hand for an animal.  How come that happens when over three and four years ago, it was put out that we had to have X, Y, and Z or the animals would not be accepted?  Is it the retailers group, which Mr. Dillon represents, or is it the middle person between the retailers and the farmer that is deciding a lot of this?</p></speech>

When it comes to pricing of beef, the Deputy will be aware that 90% of beef produced in Ireland is exported.  The domestic market only constitutes some 10% of beef production.  Of that, only 6% ends up in the retail sector with the other percentage ending up in food services.  Prices for beef are largely set by export markets.  That is just a point to inform the discussion around pricing of beef and the retailers' role in that.</p></speech>

With the revoking of those, I do not envisage there being an issue in terms of an overlap of the current mandates of this new authority versus the role of the CCPC.  There are probably quite clear lines around competition law that the CCPC has oversight over and the UTP rules that the currently interim authority and the new office will have responsibility over into the future.</p></speech>

These pressures are obviously having an acute effect on every business operating in this country but retail is no different to that.  Energy and transport costs are a significant factor in overheads.  There is pressure right throughout the supply chain.  While we do not engage with members on price and market-sensitive issues,  one only needs to look at the data from the Central Statistics Office that suggest prices increases have clearly moved through the supply chain.  From a groceries perspective, the objective of members is to try to limit the impact of that inflationary pressure on their consumers.  It is a very competitive market out there, and businesses are anxious to ensure they retain their market share in that context also.</p><p>There is also the wider issue of consumer spending and how it will be affected.  We have line of sight on a whole category of retail rather than just grocery retail.  Some elements are much more exposed to discretionary spending than others.  Some are a little bit more insulated.  There is a definitely a concern that there will be a fall-off in the discretionary spending that goes into certain parts of retail.  If the cost-of-living squeeze continues, there will obviously be an impact as everyone tightens their belt a little bit more.  Needless to say, that will feed into all operators in the market.</p></speech>

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and its environs should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid-19 symptom, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee room.  Members and everyone else in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  As members well know, members who wish to participate in the meeting remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex only.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senator Garvey.</p> <p>  The Companies (Protection of Employees' Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021 proposes to provide for the inclusion of redundancy payments among the list of preferential debts provided for by section 621 of the Companies Act 2014.  It also proposes to insert a new section 621A, which would provide that "payments due to provide for the discharge of the entitlements of the employees who have been made redundant as a result of the employers' insolvency shall have priority to all other debts."  A central issue in our consideration of the Bill is the position of employees as creditors in the winding up of a company's liquidation.  When a company is liquidated, either through insolvency or voluntarily, its assets are collected for distribution to its creditors.</p> <p>  Today, I am pleased that we have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and IBEC.  From ICTU, I welcome Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer, and Mr. Gerry Light, general secretary of Mandate.  From IBEC, I welcome Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employee relations, and Ms Pauline O'Hare, senior employment law manager.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that witnesses may make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege pursuant to the Constitution and statute.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been delivered to members.  To commence our consideration on this matter today, I invite Mr. Berney to make his opening remarks on behalf of ICTU.</p></speech>

This is important legislation and has the full support of ICTU.  We understand that the Bill seeks to change the law in two regards.  First, it seeks to put workers at the head of the queue when it comes to the distribution of moneys from the liquidation of a business.  Second, it seeks to make an unpaid collective redundancy agreement a recognised debt in the eyes of the law and one that must be taken into account in the liquidation process.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation comes against the backdrop of a number of high-profile cases that demonstrated the need to provide great protection for workers in the event of their employers going into liquidation.  The lack of legal protection for workers in such situations was highlighted with the closure of Clerys in 2015.  The circumstances surrounding the closure of Clerys are well known.  The treatment of workers in that case was universally condemned.</p> <p>  Following the closure of Clerys, Congress led a campaign seeking legislative changes that would prevent any company from treating workers in that way again.  As a result of this campaign, the Government commissioned Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy, both law experts, to review relevant legislation with a view to identifying what changes could be made to give greater legal protection to workers.  In March 2016, what has become known as the Duffy-Cahill report was published.  This wide-ranging report made a number of recommendations.  Among other matters, it recommended that employers be legally obliged to consult employees not less than 30 days before any collective redundancy could take effect regardless of whether the employer was insolvent.  The report also made recommendations on sanctions and remedies arising from non-compliance with the requirement to consult workers, including the ramifications for directors under the Companies Act 2014.</p> <p>  The committee should note that Congress argued strongly through the Company Law Review Group for the adoption of the Duffy-Cahill report.  While some progress has been made, the main recommendations have never been implemented.  In April 2020, Debenhams announced that its business in the Republic of Ireland would be placed into liquidation with the loss of thousands of jobs.  The failure to implement the recommendations in the Duffy-Cahill report meant that the Debenhams management had no legal obligations to its Irish workforce and could simply walk away.</p> <p>  It has been acknowledged by all political parties in the Oireachtas that the law regulating the liquidation of a business is unfair on workers and needs reform.  The Duffy-Cahill report provided a fairer and more balanced approach and provided for the equitable treatment of workers.  The Bill that we are discussing here is an attempt to ensure that what happened to workers in Clerys, Debenhams and Connolly Shoes can never happen again.  We urge all political parties to support it.</p> <p>  If the Chairman does not mind, my colleague, Mr. Light, will make some additional comments.</p></speech>

My words should be taken as representative and reflective of the experiences endured by the many thousands of retail workers who have lost their jobs over the past number of years, in particular since the start of the Covid pandemic.  For far too long, workers have been left totally exposed in a cruel and unfair fashion when the businesses for which they work collapse - many in contrived and preordained circumstances.</p> <p>  The Bill under scrutiny today matters not only to those who have lost their jobs but those who might suffer the same fate in the future.  Since early 2020, between Debenhams and Arcadia alone, over 1,500 Mandate members were compulsorily redundant leaving the State to pick up the bill while the businesses in which they worked conveniently disappeared into the dark and mysterious world of liquidation.  The stark reality is that both of those businesses collectively negotiated agreements regarding redundancy that covered the terms of a previous redundancy deal.  This is of particular importance given one of the key stated objectives of the Bill under scrutiny today.</p> <p>  For a remarkable 406 days, Debenhams workers stood on picket lines across this country in an effort to vent their frustration and anger at the way they had been treated but to their credit, they also demanded a better deal for workers in the future.  At this juncture, I acknowledge some of the representatives of the ex-Debenhams workers in the Gallery here today.  I do not know how many people in this room have ever stood on a picket line for any length of time, particularly for 406 days.  To do so takes determination and courage beyond belief and a burning desire to expose the injustice that has been inflicted upon you.  Instead of regularly noting that this dispute was a unprecedented record-breaking achievement, which it was, the time has come to recognise in a real and tangible way the sacrifices of these abandoned workers and ensure their collective efforts were not in vain and that workers in the future will not be left so crudely exposed.  The greatest and most fitting recognition we can show is through the speedy passing of the Bill under consideration here today.  This is why, along with ICTU, Mandate is unequivocal in its support for the main objectives contained in the Bill.</p> <p>  Along with the main requirements contained in the Bill, we should at the earliest opportunity take the Duffy Cahill report off the shelf where it has been gathering dust for the past seven years and seek to have as many of its recommendations implemented through appropriate changes to employment and company law.  This is something ICTU and Mandate have been petitioning the Minister of State, Deputy English, to do with greater intensity since the demise of Debenhams and Arcadia and it is a campaign we intend to vigorously pursue to a satisfactory outcome.</p></speech>

In amending section 621 of the Companies Act 2014, this Bill makes provision for recognition of enhanced redundancy payments in a liquidation, including those agreed in relevant collective agreements, and proposes to give preferential creditor status to employees in the event of a company being wound up in a company liquidation.<br/><br/>IBEC notes that the impetus for the Bill arises from the Debenhams dispute following the closure of its Irish operation in April 2020.  IBEC opposes the Bill, not least in the context of the far-reaching effect it will have if implemented.  While IBEC recognises the distress of the Debenhams employees on the closure of the Irish operation, it respectfully submits that the Bill is a disproportionate response to the situation and will ultimately undermine the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations landscape in Ireland giving rise to constitutional challenge.<br/><br/>The Bill proposes two amendments to the 2014 Act.  In the first instance, IBEC submits that statutory redundancy entitlements in Ireland are already more favourable than those of our nearest neighbour and competitor, the UK, not least for the fact that, unlike Ireland, the UK imposes a maximum statutory redundancy payment of &pound;17,130  and caps length of service in any such calculations at 20 years.  It is the case that claims for enhanced redundancy payments are generally pursued as industrial relations claims using established industrial relations mechanisms whereby any recommendation issued is not binding in law.  Therefore, any such enhanced payment cannot be considered a legally enforceable debt recoverable from the social insurance fund, owing to employees and binding on a liquidator.<br/><br/>The proposed amendment will fundamentally undermine the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations landscape in Ireland.  Giving a collectively bargained agreement statutory footing and effectively penalising employees who are not subject to such agreements will significantly and irreparably undermine the constitutionally protected voluntarist system of industrial relations in Ireland.  IBEC submits that there are serious constitutional concerns with giving legal effect to an industrial relations instrument considering the constitutional right to dissociate, as recognised by the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>The effect of legislating, as proposed, would be to place an enhanced redundancy payment on a statutory footing in insolvency situations only, with the State paying the bill.  Should an enhanced redundancy payment be limited to insolvencies, as proposed, it would create a two-tiered system.  It will essentially mean that those who are made redundant arising from an insolvency will be entitled to an enhanced redundancy payment and every other employee made redundant, where no insolvency arises, will only be legally entitled to statutory redundancy.  Any such proposal would not only be completely unfair and illogical, but, IBEC respectfully submits, a disproportionate and misguided response to the Debenhams situation.<br/><br/>The Duffy Cahill report published on 11 March 2016 arising from the circumstances resulting in the redundancy of employees from Clery's department store, which must be distinguished from the circumstances giving rise to the Debenhams closure, considered the question of what protections could be afforded to an <i>ex gratia</i>payment in a collective redundancy situation.  The authors stated, &quot;it is not desirable to create a special class of redundant worker with legal rights that go beyond those of the generality of workers who lose their employment in circumstances of redundancy&quot;.  On 11 May 2021, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment published the plan for action on collective redundancies following insolvency setting out its conclusions arising from the examination of the legal landscape underpinning redundancy provisions in insolvency situations.  Notably, with regard to a proposal to introduce enhanced redundancy payments where there has been a breach of the Protection of Employment Acts, the plan concludes that &quot;this approach is not recommended&quot; as it &quot;could create two classes of redundant employee and undermines the purpose of collective redundancies in the context of corporate restructuring&quot;.  IBEC submits that amending legislation resulting in a secondary class of employee is entirely unacceptable, regardless of whether the redundancies arise collectively or otherwise or due to insolvency or otherwise.  IBEC submits that rather than placing an additional and excessive burden on an already stretched Exchequer, resources would be better used to require timely submission by liquidators of claims for payments from the social insurance fund and ensure efficient administration of such claims.<br/><br/>Section 621 of the 2014 Act, as amended by section 49 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, already requires certain payments to employees to be classified as preferential payments in liquidation, including compensation payable under Part 4 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  Furthermore, section 42 of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2015 provides for priority of payment of statutory redundancy payments in a winding-up situation.  It is concerning that the Bill seeks to put, without any justification, one class of employee above another in a redundancy situation by proposing more favourable statutory rights for employees made redundant where an employer becomes insolvent.  Any such amendment would result in the State deciding that one class of employee is more deserving of preferential treatment than another despite both being made redundant, which, IBEC submits, is at best entirely unfair and disproportionate.<br/><br/>It is clearly the case that not all redundancies will be the result of employer insolvency.  IBEC refers to those companies that faced unprecedented challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in them having to affect redundancies arising from a restructure or downsizing in order to remain solvent.  To suggest that those employees would not be as preferred in the eyes of the law as employees made redundant due to insolvency is a matter of concern.  Furthermore, the proposed amendment provides that payments due to employees as a result of employer insolvency &quot;shall have priority to all other debts&quot;.  Consideration must, therefore, be given to the potential impact any such amendment would have on the preferential ranking of other creditors in recovering any debts owed.  If implemented, the amendment would put employee debts ahead of State creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners, resulting in a potential adverse impact on the Exchequer and the social insurance fund.<br/><br/>While IBEC is acutely aware of the need to protect employees at times of an employer&rsquo;s financial difficulty, it submits that effective legislative provisions and mechanisms already exist under both employment and company law.</p><p>We respectfully submit that the Bill is an entirely disproportionate response to the Debenhams dispute, with proposed amendments that are not only unreasonable and divisive but also constitutionally challengeable.</p></speech>

I will begin by taking a small amount of time to pay tribute to the Debenhams workers who have now spent more than 400 days on the picket line.  They were not doing that for nothing.  I am sure they want to see a proportionate response as a result of what they have gone through.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this legislation.  We want to see it finalised and enacted.  As the Debenhams workers have said, this would be a fitting tribute to their sacrifice and perseverance.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Berney or Mr. Light.  I note the IBEC submission makes reference to how generous Irish statutory redundancy is by comparison with Britain, but not funnily enough not by comparison with France, Germany or any other country in the European Union.  Where there is a collective redundancy element within an agreement between workers, the union and management, would it be true to say that in that agreement there is also give and take for the workers?  Any agreement may have an enhanced redundancy part of it.  However, it will also contain requirements for the workers, meaning that any agreement is necessarily a form of compromise.  The only difficulty is that when insolvency occurs, the rest of it cannot be actioned because the company is gone.  Am I right in saying that?</p></speech>

The big challenge is that the negotiation table disappears with a liquidation and, as a result, the power of the workers and their representatives also disappear.  We are largely dealing in a vacuum then.</p></speech>

Not every worker facing redundancy is in the same situation as others who are facing redundancy.  It is not that this would create a different class of person to be made redundant.  Many workers in the State are not unionised and do not have an enhanced redundancy arrangement.  Effectively, there are differences between workers.  It is worth workers' while joining a union because a union can negotiate in respect of redundancies.  We are trying to legislate for enhanced redundancy.  Effectively, that would create a difference between the two.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee indicated that IBEC respectfully submits - thanks for that - that this is "a disproportionate and misguided response to the Debenhams situation".  What would be a proportionate response?  I am assuming that she, like the rest of us, accepts that what happened to the Debenhams workers was disgraceful and unfair, and should not be facilitated in law.  What would a proportionate response look like?</p></speech>

It is a very difficult time for any worker who finds himself or herself in a situation of redundancy.  Inevitably, it is also always a very stressful and challenging time, and no more so than when an employer has become insolvent.  Different circumstances arise where there are questions over wrongdoing in how the liquidation occurred.  My understanding of the Debenhams liquidation is that there was no sense that there was any non-compliance with the legislation or any operation to construct anything that was not clearly a business situation arising.  There was no move to implement insolvency that was not a trading necessity, if that makes sense.  The reality of a proportionate response is that the response needs to be fair and equitable when we look at all employees who may be facing a situation of redundancy and creating-----</p></speech>

As she said that this would be a disproportionate and misguided response, I asked specifically what would be a proportionate and well-guided response to the Debenhams situation?  She specifically referenced that in her submission.  She has characterised this legislation as being disproportionate and misguided.  What legislation would be proportionate?  Nobody is suggesting that any laws were broken.  The legislation suggests that the law is not capable of dealing with that situation, which is why it needs to be changed.  There is no suggestion that laws were broken.  However, Ms McElwee characterised this as disproportionate and misguided.  What would be proportionate and correctly guided specifically as it relates to the Debenhams situation?  We are here in that context.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.</p></speech>

A fair and proportionate response is one that treats all employees equally and does not create a secondary class of employees who, by virtue of being made redundant through insolvency versus through other circumstances, achieve higher redundancy payments.</p></speech>

I know she is happy with the existing level of statutory redundancy, and she has made a comparison there.  The Bill is a response not just to what happened with Debenhams, but also to the fact that this it had happened in a number of instances that were not all exactly the same.  We all want something to be fair and equitable, but what does that look like?  Not every worker facing redundancy faces the same situation.  Some workers with a collective agreement for enhanced redundancy will become redundant as a result of insolvency.  What would Ms McElwee regard as a fair and equitable response in that situation?  I do not believe the <i>status quo</i>is grand.  I do not think what happened to the Debenhams workers is right.  We need to legislate to prevent that happening again.  If Ms McElwee is content with how things are, then we are at different ends of the spectrum.</p></speech>

That is the real question.  Many employees find themselves in the very difficult situation of redundancy where an employer needs to restructure because it has lost business but may not be insolvent.  Equally, many employers find themselves insolvent.  I hope the Deputy will agree that the vast majority of employers deal with these things in accordance with the legislation and in the best way they possibly can when the circumstances arise.  We are struggling to see a rationale for why somebody in an insolvency situation would be an entitled to higher statutory pay through the redundancy fund and a higher preference order versus somebody who was made redundant in other circumstances.</p></speech>

Many employers are grand.  They negotiate with their workers and honour agreements.  That is fine.  We do not need to legislate for those.  We need to legislate for a situation where hundreds, if not thousands, of workers were left high and dry and on the picket line for 400 days.  People will not be on the picket line for 400 days for nothing.  There is obviously an issue here.  There already exist different redundancy situations with some people having a collective agreement and some people not having one.  Workers with a collective agreement facing redundancy as part of a restructuring have an employer they can negotiate with.  With insolvency, that is not always the case.  Those workers effectively have no protection because the employer can walk away as Mr. Light pointed out.  As Ms McElwee will know, in an agreement with workers, there is give and take.  The workers have already given things like productivity and wage restraint as part of the agreement.  The employer has got out of that what it was going to get.</p><p>There is reference in the agreement to enhanced redundancy, which can be negotiated with an employer in a restructuring arrangement.  In an insolvency, however, it is different.  That is why there needs to be legislation, as I am sure the witnesses will agree.  Not all collective redundancies are the same.  Where there is a collective agreement, however, the employer can walk away from it.  That is grossly unfair.  One could argue that the employer has already got the value of the agreement and can then walk away from it.  I am not hearing that the witnesses recognise there is a real problem in this regard or that they think there is a legislative solution.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy in that regard.  She is correct.  All redundancies are different and the circumstances in each individual company pertain to what has been agreed and what is in place.  Many employments have collective agreements but many others do not.  If we are looking specifically at the issue of collective agreements, the challenge is that they are industrial relations agreements; they are not statutory awards or a statutory right or entitlement.  That means that employees who do not have a collective agreement in place would be at a disadvantage if the State were to honour <i>ex gratia</i>industrial relations agreements.  Based on my experience, I would challenge whether there is necessarily a benefit in terms of that trade-off in an <i>ex gratia</i>payment.  An <i>ex gratia</i>agreement is normally agreed by an employer with its organisation at a time when it needs to reduce staff.  The agreement is put in place.

I do not think we as legislators, should, stand over a gap in the legislation that allows workers to be treated in the way the Debenhams workers were treated.  It behoves us, as legislators, to ensure we tighten up those loopholes.  That is the intention of the Bill.</p> <p>  I am conscious that my time is short.   I have a question for Mr. Berney and Mr. Light.  Mr. Berney stated that the Bill has his full support and that of ICTU.  That will be welcomed by the sponsors of the Bill.  When workers face redundancy in the context of an insolvency, is it the case that they cannot negotiate?  In some cases, they can do so but, in others, they cannot and, as Mr. Light observed, they find that the negotiating table is closed.</p></speech>

One is faced with the liquidators, who very much operate in a black-and-white world and state that they have no responsibilities beyond their very limited remit.  That is with what one is dealing.</p> <p>  With regard to the points the Deputy raised earlier in the context of concessions given, I make the point that the voluntary redundancy package that existed in Debenhams was part of an overall package.  It evolved out of an examinership process five years prior to the closure of the company.  Certain concessions were given by the workers and redundancy was offered on a voluntary basis.  The company availed of those benefits for up to five years before it decided to just walk away from the Irish business.</p></speech>

The legislation is needed in order to give the ability to shore up the position in circumstances where there is no one with whom to negotiate.</p></speech>

That is driven by a sense of frustration and anger and an inability to address the core issue of the unfairness of the circumstances that presented to the Debenhams workers and to other workers, but predominantly to the Debenhams workers who endured that industrial dispute for 406 days.</p></speech>

All present appreciate and feel the injustice of what happened in the Debenhams case and in previous cases.  It seems to me that part of what happened in those cases was that resources that ought to have been available to the company to meet its responsibilities were put beyond reach.  That is not what we are addressing here, but am I wrong in thinking that was the root issue?  The real issue was that the process one would normally expect employees to access to exercise their preferential rights had been undermined in that way.  I know there have been attempts to address that aspect of company law.</p> <p>  On the legislation, are there precedents, either in Irish law or in legislation in other jurisdictions, for an arrangement of the sort proposed in the Bill whereby the State, not having been party to the original agreement, would be bound in the event of insolvency?  It is not impossible to foresee situations where the State would feel it and the taxpayer were being unfairly exposed in such situations, not having had involvement in how the original agreement was put together.  I am trying to explore that.  Is there precedent for this sort of arrangement?  It seems to be an unusual solution to a problem that all present recognise has arisen in these cases.</p> <p>  What is the view of ICTU on the point being made by IBEC that the State normally legislates for all workers rather than creating a legal commitment on behalf of the State that differentiates in different situations?  This will eventually come from the State because it has to pay up.  Does ICTU consider that to be a valid argument?  How are we to take that argument?  It is worth trying to tease out, from both sides, what we are to make of the exceptional nature of what is being proposed here.  It is clear that it is a well-intended solution to the problem but is it workable in practice or does it have questionable elements?  I would like to hear more from both sides on that issue, and that of precedents elsewhere.</p></speech>

There is an enormous challenge, therefore, in terms of the liability that might ultimately rest with the State.  If the State had to honour collective agreements on redundancy payments or <i>ex gratia</i>payments in the case of the liquidation of a very large employer or many small employers, that could overwhelm the Social Insurance Fund very quickly.  It is important to remember that collective agreements are industrial relations agreements.  They tend to be of the time that they are negotiated.  They can be, and in many cases are, renegotiated as circumstances within organisations change.  It will be extremely difficult for the State to consider legislating for one aspect of a collective agreement that may contain many different clauses in respect of terms, conditions, rights and entitlements as they pertain within an individual employment in the normal course of operations.<br/><br/>The clear question in this regard and in the context of fairness and equity is whether there is a deliberate attempt to put the assets of the business beyond the reach of the employees so that they cannot access their statutory entitlements.  We know that in the vast majority of cases, that is not an issue.  These are legitimate liquidations.  They are legitimate redundancies that arise.  They are very difficult circumstances.  Unique circumstances can arise, and have arisen previously, but this is not an issue in the vast majority of cases.  My understanding is that in the case of Debenhams, which gives rise to our discussion today, there was no effort to put funds out of reach so that employees could not draw down their statutory entitlement.  We need to recognise that and consider the precedent that the Bill may set.</p><p>The unintended consequence of something such as that, of course, is that as employers see themselves struggling into a difficult circumstance, rogue employers may find themselves in a situation where they may negotiate agreements internally and privately with no reference to the State or the State&rsquo;s requirements to pay in any liquidation collective agreements and <i>ex gratia</i>payments that go way beyond what they might otherwise do in their existing financial circumstances.  Again, I am not suggesting that it would happen or that there would be a wholesale challenge to it but it may happen and it may be the unintended consequence of this type of legislation.  Ultimately, the biggest issue for any employer is that these are people who are being treated differently and the challenge of creating different classes of employees with different entitlements, depending on how they might be made redundant and not recognising the fact that no matter how one is made redundant, one is still in many situations facing exactly the same set of challenging circumstances.  However, some may be more challenged than others.  <br/><br/>When we come just to that question of preference, obviously, as we already outlined, there are preferences built into the existing legislation.  However, we have to remember that when preference is given to one creditor over another, and in this case, if it were to be employees in an insolvency situation, that money comes from somewhere, and the liquidator has to make those decisions.  In many cases, that will come in terms of not paying other suppliers to that business and where they are small firms and do not get paid, we in turn just move that misery of financial challenge down through other organisations as well.  There is already a balance in the legislation that tries to balance the rights of those who have preferential claim on anything that the liquidator has to adjudicate on in terms of who gets the payments that are being made through the current and existing processes under both company and employment rights legislation.  <br/><br/>On the ongoing discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy English, it is my understanding that the liquidator will now be obliged to have 30 days of consultation with the employees because at that point they supersede the employer in situations of liquidation to engage with employees who are being made redundant through a liquidation process.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Bruton for the question.  There has been an implicit line of argument this morning that necessarily, the taxpayer will fall the victim of or will have to pick up the debt for a collective redundancy agreement in a liquidation.  It is my understanding in the Debenhams case that the assets of the company that were left in the Republic of Ireland at the time of the closure of the business would have been more than enough to meet the terms of the collective agreement that was in place at that time.  It is not necessarily the case that the social welfare fund will be overwhelmed, as my colleague from IBEC said, by claims in liquidation for collective redundancies.  I do not think is necessarily the case.  The Social Insurance Fund will not have to pick up the debt because in many cases, there will be sufficient assets left in the business to meet the debt that is required.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee referred to discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy English.  Those discussions have been going on for quite some time.  We have had numerous promises from the Government about changes to the legislation and none of that has materialised.  The Bill we are discussing is a response to the fact that there has been enormous frustration about the lack of action in this area.  We need to have some action.  In fairness to Deputy Barry, this Bill is a response to ensure that we do not face a situation such as the one in Debenhams again.  For that reason, the Bill is very welcome. </p> <p>  I just want to make the point that it does not follow necessarily that the Social Insurance Fund will be left exposed in the way that has been suggested.  In the case of many businesses that find themselves in this situation, assets remain to pick up the terms of the collective agreement.  That was certainly the case with Debenhams.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this is a well-intentioned measure but, ultimately, our job is to perform scrutiny to see whether there are unintended consequences and how we deal with such if they arise.  I would like to hear a little more about the precedents for this sort of arrangement where the State, even if not in all cases, is underwriting something to which it was not party.  How do we handle that?</p></speech>

However, certainly, following the meeting, we will seek to provide him with that information.  We will do that directly to the Deputy following the meeting.</p></speech>

We have come across similar circumstances, particular from the trade union side, in the past, probably on far too many occasions, when we address the whole issue of precedent.  In response to Deputy Bruton, it is yet another example of whether we want to be leaders or followers.  Based on the particular circumstances of the Bill under scrutiny, what it is seeking and the circumstance that gave rise to it, we believe there is a valid case to be leaders in this regard, as opposed to followers.</p> <p>  To follow on from my colleague, Mr. Berney, in respect of the assets and the comments made by Ms McElwee in respect of the burden falling unnecessarily on the Exchequer, the State or the Social Insurance Fund, there are many things that can create a burden for the Exchequer and the State finances and we have seen that far too often, unfortunately, in the past number of years.  Workers are rarely the cause of that.  There are many other factors that have a much greater impact and potential impact than what we are talking about.</p> <p>  It was stated that nothing illegal was done in respect of the lead-up to it but there were many concerns in respect of the Debenhams business.  We lived that as part of the negotiating team.  I led the negotiating team back at the examinership process.  There were many concerns over many years in respect of how the company was being managed and how certain assets were being put out of reach of the Irish business, particularly, to give a specific example, in regard to the online business.  However, there were also assets retained within Irish business here as well &ndash; mainly the stock.  We had many a battle over many months trying to extract maximum value from the stock.  We even got liquidators into an unprecedented position to negotiate with us.  Going back to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s comments about whether there is a capacity to negotiate with liquidators, this was unprecedented that they actually sat down and started discussing with us the potential to access some of those assets.  There were assets and retained assets, but it is about prioritising the distribution of those assets.  That goes to the very essence of what the Bill under scrutiny is about.</p></speech>

When we look at this issue of assets and retained assets, while Debenhams has given rise to some of this conversation today, we are actually legislating for other events that will happen in due course.  It will not always be the case that there may be assets left behind.  While it will not necessarily be the State that will pick up the cost, in many cases, it will be and what is being suggested here is that the State would also pick up the cost for agreements to which it has not been a party to negotiating, in which case it is very difficult to see how the State could actually be bound to take up that statutory obligation.  To be fair to the Minister of State, Deputy English, this has been subject to a significant amount of discussion, consultation and engagement, the reason being it is enormously complex and highly challenging.  We have not had a whole lot of outcome on the basis that he is trying to balance the complexity, that is, the fairness in terms of the State obligation and the obligation to the taxpayer and protecting the employees from the perspective of not creating different classes of employees fairly and without undue potential for there to be unintended consequences.</p> <p>  That is the real concern in this regard.  We are looking situations coming forward and that will continue to be the case for many years ahead.  We will have redundancies and there will always be businesses that go into liquidation.  It is something we need to think very carefully about.  I am not aware of any other precedents.  We will obviously look into it and come back to the Deputy.  However, the likelihood is it is the complexity of this that makes it so challenging.</p></speech>

First, I pay tribute to the Debenhams workers for their struggle.  The very least the D&aacute;il can do is to rapidly work through and pass this legislation and to try to make sure that no future workers are put in the situation they were in.  We went through the Clerys situation and then with Debenhams everybody said if only we had done what we were meant to do after Clerys and that there must not be another group of workers like that.

I am speaking in the firm belief that the vast majority of employers act honourably and these circumstances arise in the normal course of a business environment.</p></speech>

A significant issue would also arise from recognising a voluntary agreement, which is agreed between an employer and employees, in circumstances that most likely do not envisage any situation of insolvency arising.  Most <i>ex-gratia</i>payments and collective agreements are negotiated to sustain and maintain a going concern.  Never in my personal experience have they been negotiated with an insolvency situation in mind.  Therefore, making that a statutory obligation on the State is a concerning move.</p></speech>

She has said that the effect of the Bill would be to change the order of creditors and that suppliers could, therefore, lose out.  It is also the case that the State did not have anything to do with the contract between suppliers and Debenhams in this case.  Why on earth is Mc McElwee insisting that it is a problem that the State did not have anything to do with these collective agreements, but the State also did not have anything to do with the agreements between other creditors.  Why is she suggesting that there is any sort of problem with the order of creditors being reordered?</p></speech>

I begin by saying that I am not at all an expert in company law.  There are priority orders in terms of how a liquidator distributes the assets.  I am simply making the point that when you change the priority order in one situation, then there are less assets to be distributed elsewhere.  One of those situations may well be that suppliers who are owed moneys as well will have less money and that will then impact on their employees and financial sustainability.</p></speech>

The State was also not involved in the contracts between the creditors, supplier and the company.  There is no basis for that position.</p></speech>

Otherwise, how does one mitigate against employers having very different <i>ex-gratia</i>payments and the State paying different amount of <i>ex-gratia </i>payments to different employees depending on the sector or industry they are in?  Therefore, by requiring the <i>ex gratia</i>to be included as part of a statutory redundancy payment paid through the Social Insurance Fund, people would still be entitled to different amounts depending on what their employer had negotiated.</p></speech>

It is the fact that there are industrial relation norms that apply to the negotiation of collective agreements in our industrial relations framework.

To be fair, the Minister has taken a great amount of time to look at all of the different issues that are arising and we, along with the ICTU and the trade unions, have engaged fully and comprehensively in addressing all the concerns in trying to look at all the challenges and ways in which this could be addressed.  Every time there is an issue that people raise, of course, it is a matter for concern and a matter for conversation.</p> <p>  The challenge that has been put to me this morning as a representative is to look at these two particular provisions in this Bill.  What I am trying to address this morning are the issues for the State, the taxpayer and for employees arising from the two specific provisions that are set out in this Bill.  I am trying as best I can to articulate the challenges and constitutional issues that arise with the way this has been framed and the fact that the State would ultimately end up underwriting payments and agreements to which it has it has not been party and how, in a liquidation situation, that could actually put a very significant strain on the insolvency fund.</p></speech>

As has been pointed out already, a reordering of creditors does not necessarily lead to that situation at all.  Would Ms McElwee agree that the Duffy-Cahill report has a central context here in terms of the issues we are discussing?</p></speech>

There are certainly considerable issues within the Duffy-Cahill report.  There are challenges with some of the recommendations on which we have engaged fully and consulted.  We have raised them with the various different officials and Ministers and most recently, the Minister of State, Deputy English.  All of the Duffy-Cahill report has been taken into account in the conversations that are ongoing in addressing some of these issues.</p></speech>

The Duffy-Cahill report was commissioned by the Government.  It made six specific proposals to help address this situation.  Our colleagues from ICTU and Mandate highlighted the lack of implementation of those.  Can Ms McElwee tell me how many of the six proposals from the Duffy-Cahill report IBEC supports?</p></speech>

I will tell the Senator, however, that we were very disappointed with the Duffy-Cahill report because we found that many of the issues that were addressed by the report were not practical and could not be implemented in many circumstances.  There was a significant challenge around the way some of those recommendations were framed.  I cannot tell the Senator it was one out of six or four out of six but we are on the record as saying we were very concerned with the recommendations.</p></speech>

Proposal 1 aims to "ensure that employees will have</p> <p>the opportunity to consult with their employer for a period of not less than 30 days before any collective redundancy ... [can take] effect ... whether the employer is insolvent or not.".   If that proposal had been implemented and had been a legal requirement in advance of the liquidation of Debenhams, perhaps we would not be here discussing the issues we are discussing today.  Perhaps the employer would have felt they would have had to come to an understanding with the employees about how the assets they had at their disposal could have been used to address the concerns of employees in that situation.  I simply wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

It is no longer within the gift of the employer to be able to have that conversation.

Therefore, we have a situation where we have liquidation after liquidation and workers left on picket lines for hundreds of days, and IBEC is here today not just to oppose this legislation, which is why I want to put it in context, but it actually opposed anything that was put forward by the Duffy-Cahill report to address the situation.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

Some of the issues the Duffy-Cahill report was trying to address would be much more appropriately addressed through company law than through employment law.  I would say to Senator Gavan that the main challenge around that issue of the 30-day consultation, for instance, was that as an employer representative, we would no longer be representing an employer.  An employer would no longer have the right in an insolvency situation to engage with their employees - that has been handed over to the liquidator.  The liquidator may engage but the employees are no longer being paid because the business is in liquidation and is insolvent.  How would one commit employees to that?</p></speech>

The answer to that question is "Yes".  If we look at legislation in Greece, France and Portugal, we will see that there is legislative provision for workers to be put at the head of the queue and be first to be paid in a liquidation situation.</p> <p>  I note as well that the representatives of IBEC would also like to make an international comparison.  I will not put words in their mouths; I will quote them.  They talk about how "our nearest neighbour and competitor, the United Kingdom", imposes a maximum statutory redundancy payment of &pound;17,130 and caps length of service in any such calculation at 20 years.  They say that we need to be competitive in relation to our nearest neighbour in that regard.  Therefore, the international comparison upon which the IBEC representatives would like us to focus is legislation introduced by a Tory Government in Brexit Britain that wants to create a bargain basement labour market.  Their Prime Minister has pointed to Singapore as an example.  There is no mention of comparison with European Union countries.</p><p>Deputy O'Reilly has mentioned Belgium and France, and I could mention many others, where workers have fought to improve conditions and they are now enshrined in law.  I want to make that point at the outset.</p><p> I have spoken to hundreds of people, perhaps thousands, about the Debenhams dispute.  Not all of them are people on the left and not all of them are trade union activists or even trade unionists by any manner or means.  I have to say that the first people I have met in the last two to three years who were not prepared to say that what happened in Debenhams was an injustice are the representatives of IBEC who are here this morning.  I believe their viewpoint is representative of the view of a mere tiny minority in Irish society.  The overwhelming majority of people feel there was deep injustice done in Debenhams and that it is a wrong that needs to be righted.  My first question is for Ms McElwee.  If she says that effective legislation provisions and mechanisms already exist under both employment and company law, how on earth would she prevent another Debenhams style situation from developing?  What guarantee could she give if the law is not changed, which is what is being considered here?</p></speech>

I do not see any situation in which we could ever prevent other businesses becoming insolvent, other redundancies arising and people having to avail of their statutory entitlements either through the liquidator or potentially through the Social Insurance Fund.  That is not something we could ever prevent.  Unfortunately, it will be the case that there will be other redundancies and insolvencies.  That is always a very challenging situation.  That is why we have legislation that makes provision for statutory redundancy and why we have the Social Insurance Fund to make sure that where somebody or a business is insolvent-----</p></speech>

That is a separate matter.

My understanding, and I will defer to the legal piece on this, is that in company law the idea of looking at this in a preferential staggering is that all creditors have an opportunity to be able to recoup some of their losses from a business that becomes insolvent, some of those being other smaller suppliers who also depend on some of that payment coming through so they can, in turn, pay their own employees as the businesses run through.  If we were to commit to a preferential order, and I am not saying we should not, I am simply pointing out the fact that if we made that commitment, there is less to be distributed elsewhere for other workers potentially in other businesses.  If we were also to commit to <i>ex gratia</i>payments, which are now voluntary and totally unregulated in terms of the agreements that any individual business can make, we might make very substantial impacts in that preferential order on any other creditor below.  I am simply saying there are other effects that run through, particularly if we were to legislate for those currently voluntary collective agreements to be made a statutory obligation to be paid.</p></speech>

I presume she accepts that legislators have the right to change the order of creditors in that regard.  If there was a circumstance, and I will conclude on this, where there was an outworking of this development and there was an increase on the Social Insurance Fund, I suggest the way we would do that is to end the position where the contribution to the Social Insurance Fund made by employers in the State is approximately a quarter of what would be the case in other European countries, end the position whereby the contribution from employers in this State is the lowest in the EU and have a more realistic and serious contribution from the employers as a class to the Social Insurance Fund, which can benefit working people.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I am talking in the context of no cost to the State assuming that there are assets left to distribute.  If it is the case that there is none, it may well come back to the State.  Maybe the preferential creditors in terms of staff get all their payment, but we may end up having to support other businesses which then suffer the loss of any payment coming through or any share of those assets if there is anything remaining.  It is simply just looking at the flow through.</p></speech>

Looking at collective agreements, they are agreed between employers and their employees, whether the employees are represented by an accepted body, for example, an internal representative group or a trade union.  They are agreed at the level of the organisation.  They may have been negotiated through the Workplace Relations Commission or may, indeed, even have been ultimately adjudicated on by the Labour Court and recommendations issued.  However, they are not legally enforceable.  None of it has force of law.  They have very strong moral force and they are agreements that have been made.  The challenge from that perspective is that one would be taking what is now not a legally binding agreement that an employer and its employees have signed up to and giving it legal effect by virtue of making any <i>ex gratia</i>element of that collective agreement a requirement to be paid in an insolvency redundancy situation.</p></speech>

It was not negotiated in the framework of understanding that this could ever be a legally binding agreement.  It is negotiated as best as possible and in the face of the prevailing circumstances.  As I said, very rarely would any employer sit down and negotiate a redundancy agreement it would expect to see in the event of a liquidation or an insolvency arising.  Typically, these types of redundancy agreements are negotiated with a view to making sure the business can continue to operate as a going concern, not with redundancy or insolvency in mind.</p></speech>

Would it make a difference if that were adjusted?  Our friends from the trade unions or Ms McElwee might like to comment on that.</p></speech>

As for collective agreements, we know that an <i>ex-gratia</i>payment, at the moment, if it is to be pursued, is done through the industrial relations mechanisms.  Any Labour Court decision made is not binding and cannot be binding because the Supreme Court has recognised that the Constitution is to be interpreted as recognising the right of an employer to disassociate.  Therefore, to put something non-binding on a statutory footing and to make an employer and the State bound by it presents constitutional issues because one cannot put something that is non-binding on a legal footing.</p></speech>

That is certainly one of the areas that could be explored, aside from what we are discussing today.  It could come under the remit of the parallel approach that has been adopted.  I think my colleague has already commented that there is a very distinct delay, notwithstanding the complications that have been alluded to, and one of the reasons we are here considering Deputy Barry's Bill is, I think, that delay.  The parallel process looks at company law and employment law.  Within that context, one of the promises that were given, particularly within employment law, was that, in the first instance, a non-statutory expert group be set up.  We are still waiting for that group to be set up, many months after the commitment was given by the Minister.  There is a combination of things here that can be looked at and that will improve the lot of workers in the future.  I would not rule out the suggestion Deputy Stanton has put to us as one of the areas that should be looked at.</p> <p>  Nobody in this room is a constitutional lawyer or an expert in that area.  As for the arguments being made about the right to disassociate, I would argue that you should not be in any way disaffected when it comes to your rights in respect of a claim under what you believe to be, and what some would argue is or consider to be, depending on the circumstances in which it arises, a contractual right within employment law to the effect that if a redundancy situation is enshrined within the collective agreement - as I said, in particular circumstances - it constitutes a contractual entitlement as well..</p> <p>  Those are all the things we need to look at.  Whatever comes from today's proceedings, we need to take a fresher and more intensive view of what is happening elsewhere with regard to trying to improve the lot of workers in circumstances similar to those we are discussing.  The message should go out to the relevant Ministers that we really need to get our act together regarding the changes that are required to favour workers in respect of both company and employment law.</p></speech>

Deputy Barry's point is valid.  For a long time now, the trade union movement has been attempting to shine a light on the area of employer PRSI contributions, in respect of which we lag far behind the European norm.  Whatever needs to be looked at needs to be looked at.  It is a suite of measures.  One of the very direct questions and one of the most important ones that were put today is how in the future we seek to achieve a situation whereby workers do not find themselves in circumstances similar to those in which the Debenhams workers and others have found themselves.  Deputy Barry's Bill is very important and a very good start and would be a huge development if it were to be passed into law.  There are other aspects, however, and I alluded to that in my submission and stated that we need to keep all the avenues open.</p> <p>  Today we got very close to an acceptance that we do not want a change in the current law.  The point has been made on a number of occasions that in some way, the implication is that the current law is perfect.  It is far from perfect.  If it were perfect, there would not be 3,000 individual cases awaiting hearing before the WRC that Mandate is pursuing on behalf of its ex-Debenhams members in the area of improper consultation.  That is in respect of both the former employer and the liquidators.  We need to take cognisance of that and to ensure that whatever we do across a whole range of measures, we improve the lot of workers and give some solace to those who stood on picket lines for 406 days because that is a very important part of why they stood there.  That is what they have told me and others.  They have told me, "We are not just here for ourselves, Gerry; we are here for others in the future as well."</p></speech>

I know that it has been proposed previously.  One of the questions we would have asked about how that would operate is who would pay into the fund.  Is the proposal that employers that have collective agreements and that have committed to <i>ex-gratia</i>payments would fund that, or is it funded by all employers?  In the latter case we have the constitutional issue of employers that have not negotiated collective agreements or do not negotiate collectively at all.  Then there are also perverse incentives in that if you are contributing to the fund, perhaps you also agree the largest <i>ex-gratia</i>payment in order that you get the greatest benefit in the event that you have redundancies that have to be negotiated and that <i>ex-gratia</i>payment has now become statutory.  Aside from all that, the largest challenge is still how to put a voluntary agreement on a statutory footing.</p></speech>

The Ryanair case has been cited, as has the question of the position, as decided by the courts, on a right of disassociation.  There seems to be an assumption that a collective agreement is a collective agreement negotiated by a trade union body.  Many collective agreements, probably a majority, are, and I would argue that this is a strong reason for workers to join trade unions to improve their position in the workplace.  It is not necessarily the case, however, that we are looking merely at collective agreements negotiated by trade unions here.</p><p>I believe registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and individual employment contracts would be covered by this legislation.  We could test it with legal opinion.  It may be tested before a court of law some day.  The argument that this is unconstitutional does not stand up in the context of the information I have shared with the committee.</p></speech>

This is an important committee meeting.  As somebody from Waterford, I have great sympathy for the position that Debenhams workers found themselves on.  Deputy Bruton asked earlier whether assets were put beyond reach.  I do not know whether they were but what was done to Debenhams workers was unacceptable.  We cannot have a repeat of that in the State.  That said, I have concerns in respect of IBEC's concerns, which Ms McElwee raised.  I wish to ask her about one situation.  Where a company is going into an examinership process and if it has a recognised collective agreement on a statutory footing, what is IBEC's position?  How might it affect an examinership process or the ability of a company to continue trading if it has preferential debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022070600002#K00400"><p>I may not have fully understood the question so please correct me if I am wrong.  In an examinership, in most circumstances, the ambition is for the organisation to come out on the other side as a going concern, so it would not necessarily be unusual for agreements to be entered into to facilitate downsizing or redundancies.  Agreements would be put in place about whether that would be done voluntarily and how that selection might happen.  An agreement on an <i>ex-gratia</i>payment or a collective agreement might well come into effect there because the ambition of coming out of examinership is that the business would continue.  The collective agreement works because it is an agreed dynamic with the examiner with regard to the management of the business and its resources so it can continue.  In an insolvency situation, the liquidator is challenged and charged with closing down the business and discharging its debts.  It is no longer a voluntary agreement.  There are no staff left to execute that agreement.  There is no longer an incentive to have <i>ex-gratia</i>payments to incentivise people to volunteer for that redundancy in many circumstances, because the business is closing and all of its operations will be terminated.  Any aspect of that which this legislation seeks to convert to a statutory payment then needs to be distributed, either from the assets or from the State fund.</p></speech>

Whether it is on a statutory footing or otherwise, is the collective agreement considered a hard debt within a business which is looking at an examinership process?  That is what I am trying to figure out.  If you are looking at examinership for a business and its total debt profile, where does the statutory agreement figure, not in the debt ranking but as an actual hard and fast debt?  Is it a fixed figure or can it be modified?  That goes back to a collective agreement.  Will Ms McElwee elaborate on that, please?</p></speech>

That is the challenge.  It is a voluntarily-agreed payment.  I reiterate I am not a company law expert but as I understand it, the liquidator is charged with discharging all of the legal obligations of the firm to the greatest extent possible.  Given that a collective agreement is not a legal agreement and is not a legally binding obligation on the liquidator, the liquidator must first deal with all the other assets to be discharged and does not take into account voluntarily-agreed collective agreements.</p></speech>

It is probably a little complicated and the ground may be uncertain at the moment.  I refer to the idea of a stand-alone fund and a collective agreement for enhanced statutory redundancy.  Would IBEC be looking at a situation where both employees and employers would look to pay into such a fund?  Could that be established as a separate insurance policy within a business, as opposed to falling back onto the State at a future point?</p></speech>

Perhaps the trade unions have a better view of whether employees would also be willing to pay into an insurable account.  The challenge will always be deciding who the beneficiary is.  People are paying into a fund from which they may never receive any benefit.  Many employees would probably say they already look after this type of thing in their individual insurance policies.  I do not know how open people would be to contributing.  It would be challenging.  Some organisations would be free to agree <i>ex-gratia</i>packages of eight weeks with no caps where others might be confined to two.  Who would actually manage, authorise or distribute it?  It would be the whole industry and it would be for a very small cohort of collective agreements.</p></speech>

I also have concerns about competitiveness.  I heard Deputy Barry talk about raising the ceiling for employers' PRSI payments.  He might like to look across the Continent and say that we are paying a very low rate.  This is about competitiveness.  If those rates rise, it will reduce our international competitiveness, which is a problem for Ireland Inc. in future.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  We need to look at this.  Workers' rights and redundancy have to be protected but it must be done in a way that does not damage our international competitiveness ultimately or create a two-tiered situation for those outside the collective process.</p></speech>

There is a priority order for all of the legal obligations that have to be met by the liquidator with regard to all of the creditors who have a claim on a business.  We are speaking about reordering what the legal entitlement is.</p></speech>

It is about the impact of restructuring part of that preference order.  We are trying to add a statutory element to a voluntarily negotiated agreement and then giving that a priority order.  This is the aim of the Bill as I read it.  My key concern is not about the priority order - any business is free to negotiate any amount of <i>ex gratia</i>payment - but about the fact we are trying to convert a negotiated agreement and make it a statutory obligation.  First and foremost there is a big industrial relations framework behind this that would need significant amending.  It would also give a preferential right to employees who have a collective agreement to the detriment of any employee who does not have a collective agreement and give priority to that payment.  There is an inherent unfairness-----</p></speech>

In fairness to the Chair and the committee, we have been speaking about this issue for years.  The previous Government promised action.  It had a report.  As Mr. Light has said, it has been sitting on a shelf ever since.  We are now six years on from the Duffy-Cahill report.  Why do the witnesses think there has been such a marked reluctance on the part of governments to deal with this issue given that we have seen the further tragedy of Debenhams since the Duffy-Cahill report?  There is every likelihood, given the challenges faced by the retail sector, that there will be another Debenhams and Clerys in the coming months.  Why do the witnesses think there is such a marked reluctance to go beyond, and again I will quote Ms McElwee, discussions, consultations and engagement?  Why do they think there has been no action from governments to tackle the disgraceful situation that workers from Debenhams and others have found themselves in?</p></speech>

I have been a practising trade union official and activist for almost 35 years.  To me it appears that when it has come to the interests of the State and those of many governments, the interests of workers have always been put second.  We have seen yet another demonstration of this in the years since Clerys.  There was every reason for swift action but it did not happen.  Covid happened and we have had the instances of Debenhams and Arcadia.  This must be the spur to look at the situation and ensure there is no repetition.  Workers have to understand where they lie in the priorities of the State and successive governments.  It is up to them to do something about it, whether through joining a trade union or other actions all the way to the ballot box.  There are ample examples to prove that the interests of workers have not been served well by successive governments in recent years for a variety of reasons.  We could probably spend the rest of this hearing going into them.</p></speech>

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

There are a lot of current issues.  I am aware that the Taoiseach has just arrived in Kyiv.  I acknowledge the Government's advocacy on behalf of the Ukrainian people.  The Minister is aware of the committee's endeavours in trying to develop a deeper understanding and knowledge of what is happening.</p><p>We have done that pragmatically, with delegations travelling to Georgia, Romania and Moldova in recent months.

I am glad to have it.  I hope that we will have another meeting after the summer when this conflict will be in a new phase.  Hopefully, it will be a better phase, but there is not a great deal of optimism that anything is going to change positively any time soon.</p> <p>  I thank the committee  for convening this session on the current situation in Ukraine and the European Union's response.  Russia's unprovoked, brutal and unjustifiable aggression against Ukraine began 132 days ago - 132 days of suffering and pain inflicted on the Ukrainian people.  We are witnessing their extraordinary courage and resilience and the inspiring leadership of President Zelenskyy and his Government.</p> <p>  I was the first foreign minister to visit Kyiv since 24 February when the war began.  During my visit, I met the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dmytro Kuleba, the Minister of Defence and the deputy defence minister, and I visited Bucha.  What I witnessed there was profoundly shocking.  I promised Mr. Kuleba at that point that I would report to the UN Security Council on my visit, which I did in April.  At that meeting, I called on Russia to stop this senseless war and brutality.</p> <p>  As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has sought to hold Russia accountable, urging it to end its war in Ukraine immediately, pushing for the protection of civilians and calling out Russia's cynical attempts to use the Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation.  Ireland has joined more than 40 countries in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Recognising the increased workload for the court, I approved &euro;3 million in additional funding to assist in the investigation of the situation in Ukraine along with other situations before the court.</p> <p>  The EU has demonstrated its ability to respond quickly in support of Ukraine and has displayed unity in its reaction.  Since February, the EU has mobilised over &euro;4 billion in support to Ukraine.  This is in the form of macro-financial assistance, budget support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid.  In addition, the EU has provided &euro;2 billion of support to the Ukrainian armed forces under the European Peace Facility.  Ireland has contributed &euro;44 million towards non-lethal elements of that fund.  Bilaterally, Ireland has provided &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including Moldova, predominantly through UN agencies.  I assure the committee that we will be doing more, including using our broader development budget to address some of the war's impacts on other parts of the world.  In March, the EU activated the temporary protection directive to offer quick and effective assistance to people fleeing the war.  Since then, Ireland has welcomed almost 40,000 Ukrainians to our shores.</p> <p>  Last month, the European Council decided to grant candidate status to Ukraine, which is an important message that Europe stands with Ukraine.  Ireland has been a very strong supporter of that position.  I am pleased to say that Ireland has been one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine's application as well as Moldova's.  We also want to see Georgia and the western Balkans on the road to full membership.  Ireland is probably one of the most vocal European countries in support of enlargement and an acceleration of that process.  Ukraine has been making good progress on reforms and we look forward to seeing this continue as part of Ukraine's path towards full EU membership at some point in the future.  Last month's ratification of the Istanbul Convention was a clear indication of Ukraine's commitment to aligning with EU standards.  To take that initiative as a priority in the midst of war says a great deal about what the Ukrainian Parliament and Government are trying to do.</p> <p>  Since 23 February, and with active Irish support, the EU has adopted the most significant set of sanctions in its history.  In total, 1,158 individuals and 98 entities in Russia and Belarus are now sanctioned.  Sectoral sanctions are targeting the financial, energy, technology, defence and transport sectors as well as Russian media involved in spreading disinformation.  The sale of EU luxury goods to Russia is prohibited, as is the import from Russia and Belarus of certain products.  As I have repeatedly stated, Ireland supports the toughest possible sanctions and we are ready to support a ban on Russian gas, building on decisions already taken in respect of oil and coal.</p> <p>  I do not know how long the war will continue, but we know that a global financial effort will be required to rebuild Ukraine after the war.  The EU will not be found wanting and will give significant leadership, and Ireland will continue to provide steadfast support to Ukraine and its people.  As some committee members may know, there was a conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine in Switzerland in recent days.  We had representation there, I believe through the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming.  A number of other countries have offered to hold pledging conferences one after another, so there will be a strong appetite within the EU to be central to the rebuilding efforts.  However, this conflict needs to end before that can be done for the majority of Ukraine.  As such, ending the conflict needs to be a major focus.  There is not much optimism that there is any appetite for a ceasefire or to consider the conditions that would deliver one.</p> <p>  For now, it is about trusting in the Ukrainian leadership, supporting the Ukrainian military where appropriate, supporting the Ukrainian people through humanitarian support, both within Ukraine and outside it, and supporting those who have had to flee the conflict, particularly those who have come to Ireland.  It is also about trying to address and respond to the extraordinary fallout from this conflict for other parts of the world in terms of cost of living increases.  While these are having a significant impact on a country like Ireland, they potentially have life and death consequences in other parts of the world in terms of the availability of food and energy.</p> <p>  This is a conflict that is extraordinarily tragic for Ukrainians from a human suffering point of view, but it is also having significant knock-on consequences, not only on geopolitics, which is now changing by the month, but also in terms of development, poverty, food security, energy security and a range of other pressure points that will need our focus and that of the wider EU in the months ahead.  This situation is complex and not easy to solve, but I am happy to take members' questions on what we are doing and how we are approaching it.</p></speech>

He touched on many key areas, so I will ask supplementary questions to the points he raised to elicit additional information.  I will begin in or around where he finished off, that is, the reconstruction conference held last week in Switzerland and the feasibility of future pledging conferences.  The Minister will be aware that our wider European political family, the European People's Party, called for a European Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Ukraine.  One of the central tenets of that is seizing the assets that have been frozen and using the at least &euro;36 billion taken from the Russian regime and its supporting oligarchs to fund that reconstruction.  Would the Government support such a proposal and is it prepared to start working on putting those assets into some form of escrow account for pledging?</p><p> I will briefly touch on two other areas.  The Minister stated that Ireland supports the toughest possible sanctions and is ready to support a ban on Russian gas.  That is extremely welcome.  Unfortunately, there are holes in the current sanctions - not due to their application by EU member states and certainly not in the case of Ireland - because of European partners and countries outside the EU.  I will not name those countries, but they continue to maintain relatively normal relationships with Russia and Putin's regime.  If we support tougher sanctions, will the Government push within the European Council to put more pressure on those countries outside the EU that are undermining European sanctions against Russia and sanctions by the wider world, including the US, Canada, Japan and Australia?  It is quite apparent that there are countries that are prepared to accept Russian money and accommodate Russian oligarchs, assets and everything else.  It is in defiance of the general will.</p><p> The Minister says Ireland stands ready to do more.  I fully agree with him.  I welcome all the work that has been done by officials across the Government.  However, I feel we can do more.  I reiterate that we need to look at our support for all European projects, including the provision of lethal military aid towards the Ukrainian army and the donation of surplus javelin missiles and other stock we hold here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for those questions.  The initial cost estimate for reconstruction currently stands at approximately &euro;750 billion.  We are talking about a very large country that has endured extraordinary levels of damage and destruction across multiple cities.  Some cities hardly exist anymore in light of the level of bombardment and destruction.  I witnessed some of that first-hand at Bucha but from what I am told and from the images I have seen, cities like Mariupol and some others are like Bucha multiplied many times over.  We are going to need something of a similar level of ambition to a Marshall plan.  Ireland will support that and I think many others within the European Union will too.  Many Ukrainians need the certainty and the hope of a journey to somewhere different to where they have come from, which is the journey to the European Union and all that comes with that in terms of stability, opportunity, economic development, diversity, and, most importantly, safety and stability.  Ukraine would be a member of a group of countries that have extraordinary solidarity with each other within the European Union.  We need to physically rebuild Ukraine but also help the Ukrainian Government rebuild institutional infrastructure in the image of what is needed for EU membership.  That is what the European Union wants to do in partnership with Ukraine in the future.  That is a source of extraordinary hope and courage and is what Ukraine is currently fighting for.  It is not only a possibility but a likelihood, if not a certainty, for Ukraine as a country in the future.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the level of ambition needs to be significant.  This should not just be about loans; it should be about grant aid as well.  It will be a combination of both, in reality.  There has been a series of discussions around how that might work, whether countries could adopt certain oblasts or regions in Ukraine and how to create consistency if we did that.  Ireland has been linked to certain cities in that context that have been severely damaged.  There is a lot to discuss there.  I assure everyone in this room, and anybody else listening, that Ireland will be more than willing to link with whatever structure is agreed between the EU and the Ukrainian Government for rebuilding efforts post conflict.</p> <p>  Regarding the impact of sanctions, our approach to sanctions is a maximalist one because we believe that the higher the cost of the continuation of this war for Russia and the Kremlin, the increased likelihood of it ending some time soon.  If there is not a cost, whether political, economic or military, it will continue.  The most effective weapon the EU has is sanctions.  The European Union is an economic superpower.  It has very strong links with Russia in the context of energy in particular but also for lots of other products too.  Significant sanctions are needed in order to bring an end to this conflict and I do not believe we have gone far enough.  We can go further.  The European Union must consider a seventh package of sanctions.  There are differing perspectives as to whether we should be bedding down existing sanctions and so on.  Unity is important in the European Union.  We need to listen to concerns, but Ireland will advocate to continue to raise the cost of the continuation of the war in an effort to bring it to an end.  The application of sanctions more generally requires a lot of debate because sometimes sanctions are totally ineffective but in this instance they are more than justified.  If you want to end something, you have to increase the negative cost of continuing it.  Sanctions can do that.</p> <p>  On the European Peace Facility, it is important to put the facts on the table.  Ireland was very involved in finalising the wording of the European Peace Facility to ensure every country in the European Union could be involved if they wanted to be.  That means NATO countries, non-NATO countries, countries that regarded themselves as militarily neutral and countries that were not.  We led efforts, along with Austria and Malta, to find a wording that could allow Ireland to fully contribute financially to the European Peace Facility.  It was never designed for a war like that in Ukraine.  It was designed for peace interventions that may involve some arms being supplied in order to facilitate stability around policing and so on.  Ireland traditionally has not supported the funding of armaments and we continue in that tradition.  Every time &euro;500 million is committed by the European Union through the European Peace Facility, &euro;11 million of that is Irish money.  It is 2%, which is our allocation.  We have made it clear that, within the funds being provided, we want to be funding the elements that are non-lethal weapons.  These elements are necessary.  So far, about 10% of the fund relates to non-lethal weapons and 90% relates to weapons.  The non-lethal weapons include everything from body armour to helmets, medical equipment, food parcels and fuel.  These are all things that are needed by the Ukrainian military.</p> <p>  We are playing our part in terms of the financial contribution, the same as every other country, but we limit our contribution to the element of the fund that covers non-lethal weapons.  That is the right approach because it is supported in the programme for Government.  It is an approach some Deputies have questioned.</p><p>I can understand that because if you ask Ukrainians what they want the most, the answer is that they want weapons to defend themselves.  Keeping unity in the Government and in the Oireachtas more generally is important in terms of the strength of response that comes from Ireland.  We maintain unity based on what was agreed in the programme for Government and what is supported by a strong majority in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</p><p> Additionally, for what it is worth, I have had this discussion many times with Ukrainian colleagues, including in Kyiv, and they understand where we are coming from.  Therefore, we are making a contribution to the Ukrainian military.  It is a significant contribution.  I never recall Ireland at any point contributing almost &euro;50 million to another country&rsquo;s military.  This is what we have done in the space of four months.  We will be contributing more, because I suspect there will be another round of European peace facility funding.  By the end of this war, therefore, we could have contributed support worth &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million to the Ukrainian military, outside of lethal weapons.  This is worth saying.  We are doing many other things as well but the question was around lethal military aid or weapons and ammunition.</p><p> It is also important to say that if we compare Ireland with other European countries, then we do not have much to offer when it comes to weapons.  There are some Javelin missiles in our military armament stocks, but not many.  We certainly do not have many to spare that we do not use for training and for our own teams on missions abroad.  We have some anti-tank weapons as well, but not large numbers of them.  If we were to support lethal weapons through the European peace facility, we would effectively be writing a cheque for other countries to provide those weapons, by and large.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution here then is not in the form of weapons and munitions.  Our contribution has come in the form of many other things to support the Ukrainian military and, of course, in the humanitarian, diplomatic, sanctions and EU enlargement and EU membership contexts.  We are trying to maximise our impact in all those areas.  It is important, though, to keep a sense of unity and direction in respect of our overall response to this conflict.  If we moved into the space of funding or supplying lethal weapons, we would fracture that unity and that would be a mistake.</p></speech>

I am also a delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE.  The Minister made two addresses to our recent plenary meeting.  There was great recognition of the role of the Minister and his officials in respect of the assistance provided to Ukraine since 24 February 2022.</p> <p>  We are discussing traditional weapons but the Russians are now weaponising things such as food, energy and information technology to pull in many more countries.  How is this new way of war changing the perspective or the approach of the Minister&rsquo;s Department and within Europe regarding how to manage this aspect?  The damage being wrought is horrific.  The people of Ukraine are at the most danger of suffering from that damage and many of them have lost their lives.  The damage inflicted, however, through weaponising energy and food is also going to be significant beyond the borders of Ukraine.  Coming back to the point made by Deputy Richmond, regarding confidence concerning rebuilding Ukraine, I endorse his point.  Given our experience with the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and its success, would this not be something for Ireland to lead out on?  I refer to using the proceeds of activities and funds being seized in the context of sanctions etc., to support the rebuilding of Ukraine.</p></speech>

Obviously, this has been reactive.  Is much reflection under way on how we got to this situation?  Is there much reflection on the fact that in 2014 we made a great deal of noise but did not take any action in respect of events in the Donbas and in Georgia?  I will not say there was acquiescence, but there was a kind of approach that it will be all right on the night in respect of managing Russia and Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s ambitions.  That kind of lax approach has ended up with us being where we are now.  Is any kind of reflection ongoing concerning how we got to this point and what is going to change to ensure we do not arrive at this kind of situation again?</p></speech>

It is, however, much more complex legally than might be thought.  We must be consistent with what is legally sound as well.  If we are calling out countries for breaching international law, then we must practise what we preach.  I am very much open to the approach suggested by the Deputy.  Russian aggression is causing all this.  We must rebuild a country on the back of what Russia is responsible for in Ukraine in respect of its deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure and all the other things that must be rebuilt.  Therefore, if we are seizing assets, it makes sense that the value of those assets would be used to rebuild Ukraine.  We asked the European Commission to work up some options in this regard consistent with our legal obligations.  I expect it to respond with those options.  I must be careful in giving out a figure in this regard, but we have seized somewhere between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion in funds.</p></speech>

It is not an insubstantial amount of money.  We must, though, be responsible here in respect of any action we take being legally sound.</p> <p>  Regarding the other question concerning the weaponising of food and energy, there is now, unfortunately, a communications battle under way concerning what is causing food insecurity in other parts of the world.  If you speak to many African leaders, for example, they would blame all sides for the increase in the cost of food that is having a devastating impact on some of their countries.  Russia has been quite successful in trying to convince countries that this situation would not be as difficult as it is if it was not for EU and US sanctions.  This is simply a misrepresentation of the facts.  The reason the price of grain has increased the way it has is because 22 million tonnes of grain are stuck in Ukraine because it is not possible to get it out of the ports there and into the Black Sea due to a Russian-enforced military blockade.  This is the reality.  We are trying to find a way of getting past this.  I was in Ankara a few weeks ago.   We spent a long time speaking to the Turkish minister regarding his conversations with the Russian foreign minister, which are continuing, on how to facilitate Ukraine safely getting ships carrying thousands of tonnes of grain out of not only Odesa but other ports in the general area and then out through the Black Sea.  Those efforts continue at a UN and Turkish level and involve Kyiv and Moscow in trying to find a basis of agreement to do that.  I am often asked what Ireland is doing in respect of diplomatic efforts to improve circumstances.  This is one of the areas where we are active, along with many other countries.</p> <p>  On Ireland and hybrid warfare were more generally, we are familiar with the use of cyberattacks and so on as part of hybrid warfare, but energy and food scarcity are relatively new phenomena in this space.  Ireland wants to apply for membership of the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, Hybrid CoE, this year.</p><p>In fact, I visited that facility a few weeks ago.  I think we should very much be part of it.  That would represent an important step in supporting efforts to further enhance the State's capacity to defend itself against, and respond to, existing and future threats posed by hybrid threat actors.  I plan to bring a memo on that to the Government in the autumn.  We are acting in that space.  We are going to be part of that centre for countering hybrid threats.  We are already a member nation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, located in Tallinn in Estonia, which I also visited in the last few weeks.  One is a NATO-led project and the other is not.  I think we should be very much embedded and part of both.  </p><p> On lessons learned, in some ways now I think many people look back and say that the EU did not respond strongly enough to Russia's invasion of Crimea.  These things are easy to talk about with the benefit of hindsight.  Efforts were made by a number of prominent EU countries in the two Minsk agreements to try to maintain peace and to keep warring factions apart, but then that collapsed.  I think serious efforts were made by the EU with Russia and Ukraine to try to prevent this conflict escalating.  In Ukraine, while they expected Russia to invade eastern Ukraine, even two or three days before the full invasion I do not think they expected that there would be a full-scale invasion of all parts of Ukraine in the way that there was on 24 February.  That was the perceived wisdom across the EU as well.  The US and the UK were saying something different.  Their intelligence was telling them something different.  To be fair to the US and the UK, I think they were right.  Clearly, they were proven to be right.  There are lessons learned there.  I was at a conference in Munich perhaps two weeks before the invasion.  Effectively, most of the defence ministers in the western world were there.  There were differing views on what was likely to unfold.  Certainly, I think that some lessons have been learned.  However, we need to be careful that there is not some sort of blame game with the benefit of hindsight.  Undoubtedly, this is about Russia trying to re-exert its influence in a country that unfortunately, many Russians do not respect as an independent country.  That is why this war has become so much more than simply a war between Russia and Ukraine.   It is also about the protection of sovereignty, international law and a whole range of other things that the EU and other countries are very invested in.  </p><p> One question that I did not answer earlier was about how we pressurise other countries outside of the EU to be consistent with our way of thinking on sanctions.  That is a lot easier said than done.  Every country makes its own decisions.  We have witnessed it over the last 18 months or so in our time as a member of the UN Security Council.  It is a big mistake to make the assumption that because we are passionate about something, another country in another part of the world sees it the same way.  Some countries see the focus on Ukraine as hypocrisy from the EU, given the lack of focus on other conflicts in other parts of the world.  Other countries see it as an opportunity to build closer ties.  I think that is pretty disgraceful, but it is reality.  We need to be clear-eyed here on what is actually possible.  However, we should not underestimate the influence of the EU and its partner countries in these efforts.  The combined influence of the EU, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan is significant.  It is a very powerful group of countries that I believe should be using all of that diplomatic and economic muscle to try to bring this war to an end.  One of the ways in which we need to do that is to influence other countries not to deliberately undermine the impact of sanctions if we believe that is prolonging this conflict, which I think we do.  Let us not be naive.  Countries will make their own decisions, often for very different reasons.  Of course, that is one of the reasons that make this such a difficult issue to resolve.  Russia is a very influential country in many parts of the world, and in some parts of the world where the EU is not that influential.  It is using that influence at the moment.  </p><p> The final point I wish to make is that different countries approach diplomacy differently.  Sometimes we interpret silence from a country as tacit support of Russia.  That is not always necessarily true.  The way in which democracy works in the countries we live in is that we have to stand over the statements we make, and they are covered in the media.  There is a lot more transparency around decision-making, decisions and justifications for those decisions.  Those kind of democratic systems do not operate in the same way in some countries.  In my view, there are some countries that have been a lot quieter on this conflict than they should have been, but that does not mean that they are not concerned about it.  We need to use all approaches to try to ensure all countries that have an influence in Moscow are using that influence to good effect to try to bring this war to an end.  There are a number of very influential countries that can be helpful here.  China, India and Turkey are three obvious ones.  Looking at what Turkey is trying to do, while not supporting EU sanctions it is trying to make other interventions which may have a positive outcome, particularly in the context of the work it is doing with the UN in trying to get grain out of Ukraine.  It is working with Ukraine and Moscow on that.  That is all I am saying.  These are not straightforward questions.  There are powerful countries and influencers that do democracy very differently, or do not do democracy at all, in fact, but run their countries very differently from how we do.  We need to be aware of that as we try to build pressure to bring this war to an end.</p></speech>

I do not normally do this because it is queue-skipping and I do not like to do that, but before I let Deputy Haughey in, I wish to make a point.  I do not want the Minister to respond to the point, but to keep it in the back of his mind.  Perhaps some of the other members might raise the issue.  On the question that Deputy Calleary put to the Minister on the lack of foresight, I do not want to use the term "diplomatic failure", so I will not use it.  The Minister stated that he does not want to get into a blame game, but he did say that lessons have been learned.  I do not want to jump the queue, but perhaps towards the end of the meeting the Minister could elaborate more on the lessons learned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#E00300"><p>On the last point that the Minister dealt with, I know that the Taoiseach has called out various countries on their lack of support for sanctions, and indeed, lack of support for climate change measures.  Presumably, he is showing his frustration with particular countries for their lack of support.  I want to go back to the issue of sanctions again, which was raised by Deputy Richmond, and the package of six sanctions.  I think the Minister may have answered the question, in that he said that more sanctions are needed, and a seventh round is certainly a possibility.  When we met with the chairperson of the foreign affairs committee of the Georgian Parliament, he was particularly negative about the response and the effect that the EU response will have.</p><p>He was not criticising the EU but just wondering whether it will be effective.  When I asked about the sanctions and whether they were having an effect on Russia and Belarus, he said they will probably have an effect in 15 years' time, which I thought was particularly negative.  Do we have any evidence to show that the sanctions are working and that they are having an effect?  It is creating hardship for citizens right across Europe.  I would love to know if they are, indeed, being effective and if we have any evidence of that or if that is discussed at EU level.</p><p> My second question relates to enlargement generally.  Obviously, Ireland is very supportive of the whole concept of enlargement for all sorts of reasons.  Coming back to Georgia, again, there was huge frustration in Georgia at the decision of the European Commission and, indeed, subsequently, the European Council.  It was put to us in very strong terms that Georgia is essentially a European country that is of strategic importance to Europe and there was certainly a commitment to try to deal with the 12 issues that were outlined by the European Commission.  There was a little bit of frustration with regard to some of the 12 points outlined, however, particularly in relation to, for example, increased polarisation.  It was felt by many of the people we met that this could not be quantified or, indeed, that polarisation is part and parcel of any democracy.  We see it right across the world, particularly in the US at the moment.  There was a bit of frustration that could not be quantified or that was a bit vague.  Similarly, in relation to the deoligarchisation - that is a new word - it was again stressed to us that the main oligarch has left politics and so forth and how that can be dealt with.  What I am trying to say is that it is unquantifiable with regard to many of them but, indeed, there is a determination to deal with them and for them to join the European Union in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p> Sort of linked with that then is enlargement generally and the whole question of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I heard the Taoiseach and, indeed, the German Chancellor and others say that perhaps unanimity should not be required for accession.  We had Mr. Emmanuel Macron talking about the European perspective.  He seemed to suggest that maybe a lot of these countries should not actually join the European Union, and that there should be some sort of two-speed Europe as regards enlargement or accession.  What are the Minister's views on that?  I know the Conference on the Future of Europe is outside our scope today but on that particular issue, maybe there is need for unanimity for accession of EU countries.  Obviously, as I said at the outset, Ireland is very supportive of enlargement.  It is of strategic importance to the European Union.  I think it is something we really need to get behind.</p><p> I will conclude by saying that Ireland has not been found wanting when it comes to Ukraine, and the Taoiseach and Minister have been very crucial in our response.  That is welcomed by all of us and welcomed at an EU level as well.  I say well done in that regard.  The Minister has really represented the Irish people in his response to the awful invasion by Russia of Ukraine.  Basically, my two questions are in relation to sanctions and enlargement generally.</p></speech>

I thank the members and Chairman.</p> <p>  I listened to the Minister's contribution from my office.  We are very proud to see the role Ireland has played in terms of our financial support and advocating for Ukraine's membership of the European Union.  In that context, could the Minister hazard an attempt to give some sort of timeline of a best-case scenario as to when he thinks it might achieve full membership?</p> <p>  My second comment is more of a point but maybe also a question as well.  We had a very interesting engagement with the French ambassador, whom I think made a really good point.  Actually, he was repeating the words of President Macron when he spoke of younger generations of Russians and the need to be very cautious not to humiliate Russia and leave a feeling among younger people in that country that may come back to haunt us in future years.  It is a really delicate balance to strike because, obviously, we have to act.  We have to be decisive and we must impose sanctions, as the Minister rightly said, because we have to make this a costly war so that Russia will stop what it is doing.  Are there conversations happening about how we try to ensure that at some point in the future, there is some sort of working diplomatic relationship with Russia to make sure we do not prolong the war, but also that we do not see a repeat of such aggressions by future generations?  I do not know what the answer to that is but we should be mindful that we do not nurture a feeling of hatred in younger Russians, the consequences of which we will still be dealing with in ten, 20, 30 or 40 years' time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#F00500"><p>Maybe I will answer Senator Chambers's question first if she has to run back to the Seanad.  She asked about the timeline for Ukraine membership.  I hope it can be done within a decade.  Given the scale of rebuilding and the challenges in terms of the benchmarks that need to be met to become a member of the European Union, that can be a very exciting ten years of investment, growth, reform and change within Ukraine.  The European Union will be there every step of the way to support them in that and that is the way it should be.  We need to be careful, however, that we cannot promise to deliver this within a couple of years.  The important thing here is that we set out a pathway that is achievable and then try to accelerate it, if we can, and do it in a shorter timeframe.  What we do not want to do is disappoint people who are working incredibly hard and currently giving their lives for this aim and dream by overpromising and under-delivering, which I think would be wrong.  We should set a ten-year horizon then see if we can do it faster.  That is what I think we should try to do.</p> <p>  In terms of the need to be cautious not to humiliate Russia, we need to be careful here.  Our signals need to be very clear and very blunt in response to what we regard as a complete breach of international law and a breach of the UN Charter.  I think most people would accept that we are seeing war crimes taking place almost on a daily basis.  When one spends a bit of time in countries that know Russia best, and what I mean by that is countries that border Russia or are very close to it, whether it is Finland, the Baltic countries or Poland, they will say that often concessions or diplomacy or softer language is seen as weakness.  Now is a time for clarity in relation to consequences for the actions that are currently taking place.</p> <p>  I take the Senator's point, though.  There is a need, of course, to maintain in my view diplomatic communication with Russia, which is why I have not taken the decision to close the Russian Embassy despite the fact that many people called for that at the start of this conflict over and over again, including some form my own party.  I think that would not have been the right decision.  We expelled four people working with the Russian Embassy here.  We felt it was appropriate to do that.  We felt they did not have a basis to be here in terms of being diplomats.  There was a consequence for that because two of our diplomats were sent home from Moscow with no justification, in my view, because they were people very much involved in diplomacy.</p><p>Even when we fundamentally disagree with a country, it is important to keep a line of communications open to be able to express that view and to hear.  Even if we do not believe we are being told the truth, sometimes it is important to have that line of communication open.</p><p> I take the point about the humiliation issue, but we need to build a relationship in the future with a new generation of Russians.  Russia is too big a country to isolate forever.  While the Russians are embarking on this level of aggression, brutality and illegality with very high consequences, our messages need to be very clear and blunt.  This is wrong and unacceptable.  Russia is isolating itself because of what it is doing.  It is also causing its own people considerable hardship because these sanctions would not exist if it were not for Russian actions.  While this war continues, those messages need to be firm and clear.  Any ambiguity on that will be seen as weakness from the other side.</p><p> Deputy Haughey asked if sanctions are working.  There is solid evidence that the military industry in Russia is having difficulty in maintaining production because of targeted sanctions.  That should potentially begin to have an effect in the months ahead if this war continues.  The impact on the economy is also beginning to be felt.  Yesterday, the Russian Parliament passed measures to compel businesses to provide goods to the military and force employees to work overtime.  That indicates some of the pressure points.  The Russian economy will shrink by between 3% and 4% this year according to some estimates.  The J.P. Morgan estimate is for 3.5% shrinkage this year.  Are these sanctions having an effect?  Ultimately, the test of the sanctions will be whether they contribute to shortening this conflict and bringing it to an end.  That has not happened yet.  Is Russia beginning to feel the impact of these sanctions in its economy and its ability to be able to continue to follow and supply this enormous war effort?  I believe they are starting to have an impact.  Ultimately, the power of sanctions is primarily the signal they send that if the Russians continue along this road, things will get worse, it will become more costly and therefore they look to alternatives - in other words to stop the aggression.  That is the role of the sanctions and only time will tell whether they have actually worked.</p><p> The other question we need to ask here is: what would be happening if there were no sanctions?  What signal would that send?  It would be a green light to continue.  The European Union is not a military union, it is an economic and political union.  It is using the ammunition it has, which is economic sanctions, to the greatest extent it can.  It is right to do it and it should be going further.  Whether we can get agreement on that remains to be seen.</p><p> I know a number of committee members visited Georgia recently.  I know Georgia is frustrated that it is not in the same category as Ukraine and Moldova.  The decisions made by the last European Council should be seen as the opening of a door to accession and candidate status for Georgia.  It now has considerably more clarity about what it needs to do to get that candidate status and that can be delivered.  Certainly from an Irish perspective, we hope it will be able to make that journey and that it has a clear target that it needs to achieve to get there.</p><p> Regarding Moldova and Ukraine, candidate status just means the journey now starts as a formal candidate, but there is still a long way to go.  I hope to be in Moldova the week after next.  We are planning to visit Moldova with several other ministers to discuss any further assistance we can give to relieve the pressures it is currently facing.</p><p> We need to be open to on the issue of unanimity versus qualified majority voting, QMV, for a number of decisions but we also need to be somewhat cautious.  With certain decisions that the European Union makes, we simply cannot ignore members even if only one of two of them are objecting.  On most big decisions the European Union really operates on the basis of consensus, solidarity, compromise and accommodating different perspectives.  If increasingly more decisions are taken on the basis of QMV, the concerns, particularly of smaller countries, can potentially be brushed aside in a way that could create resentment and build anti-EU sentiment if we are not careful.  We are open to that discussion but we are also somewhat cautious that on some core issues, particularly relating to security and defence and on issues such as enlargement, we need to find consensus to move forward.  A good example of that at the moment is an EU state which is preventing North Macedonia's accession moving ahead.  We need to find a solution to that issue.  We cannot just pretend it does not exist and vote past it.</p><p> As the European Union gets bigger, maintaining unanimity on everything will become more difficult.  On certain issues we should look to make decisions by QMV.  However, there are some fundamental issues.  I think security and defence issues and enlargement issues require unanimity.  I am open to persuasion on that, but certainly that is my view for now.</p><p> I think there is merit in the French idea of a European political area, but it should not be seen as an alternative to full membership in terms of the accession aspirations of countries like Moldova, Ukraine, the western Balkan countries and so on.  The European Union needs to offer full membership to countries willing to make the changes and sacrifices to meet the standards of entry.  Enlargement really is what the European Union is all about - the spreading of a peace project to provide stability and opportunity for countries.  That is what membership has done for us over the past 50 years.  It has been an incredibly positive influence on Irish society and our quality of life.  It has improved environmental standards and working standards.  It has brought gender equality and so many other things as well as, of course, economic opportunities.</p><p> It can also be the same for other countries that join.  For countries on the accession path and for countries which for whatever reason may not want full membership, the French are proposing to have a network of countries that have a relationship based on a European political area.  That is worth a significant discussion and it will get one in the autumn.  It should not be sold as an alternative to enlargement of the European Union.  To be fair, I do not think the French are proposing it as that.  Let us have that discussion and see where it goes.</p></speech>

I will do something I am not supposed to do and specifically thank the officials present.  All three have been very helpful to this committee in allowing us to understand a very changing Europe over recent months.</p><p>I will make one comment and then I will ask a few questions.  I fully agree with the Minister on the impact the European Union has had on Ireland.  However, we need a little bit more vigilance.  We cannot assume that core <i>acquis</i>, the core set of principles, will automatically be embraced as enlargement happens.  As we have seen from political developments in the United States, things that we assume are always heading in a single direction can alter.</p><p>I make that as a point of vigilance, rather than anything else.</p><p> Turning to the strategy of the European Union, will the Minister tell the committee his view of the strategic approach of the Union to the conflict, insofar as he can?  Obviously, the European Union is supporting Ukraine now militarily and financially, not with European troops but with a panoply of European equipment, defensive artillery and so on.  Is there another track or a vision for the endgame or is it simply to support Ukraine until these matters are determined on the battlefield?</p><p>  My question on sanctions builds on comments from Deputies Calleary and Richmond.  As the Minister is aware, I introduced the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020.  Deputy Calleary referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and how effective it is in seizing the proceeds of crime.  That Bill has passed Second Stage and has been approved by the Joint Committee on Justice but it could not proceed to Committee Stage last week because the Government refused to give it a money message.  I think that is a big mistake.  The sanctions that apply now, as has been explained to us, are political sanctions, not legal sanctions.  Goods and assets are being frozen not seized in the way that CAB seizes and disposes of goods from criminals and from the proceeds of crime.  I ask the Minister, and if he cannot answer I will make the point to him, that he might bring to the Cabinet the view that it should provide a money message.  A money message was never intended to be a device to stop the Oireachtas from enacting legislation.  It was supposed to be a simple economic device to ensure that the Opposition could not impose a charge on the State.  </p><p> I refer to Ukrainian refugees in Ireland.  Yesterday, the Ukrainian civil society forum, a collective of all the agencies and so on that are involved, came to the Oireachtas and made a presentation to us.  They made four recommendations about Ukrainians who are here.  One is the need to appoint a refugee response lead.  They made a written submission that there is a vacuum in overall governance, planning and communication around what is happening or available and communicating directly with Ukrainians in Ireland.  The three other points were first, to establish a national co-ordinating group inclusive of civil society, second, to publish a plan that articulates and sets out the State's approach and third, to ensure that all counties have appointed a director of service.  There is a full written submission and if the Minister does not have it we can get it to him but I want to take the opportunity to bring this to his attention.  I have dealt with refugees coming in at Rosslare and have dealt with Wexford County Council.  There are about 1,300 Ukrainian refugees in Wexford, my home county.  Much of the responsibility is being pushed onto the local authority and the level of national co-ordination is lacking.  That is their clear view.</p><p> The Minister said he was going to Moldova in two weeks' time.  The committee was in Moldova and Romania.  One thing we were a little jarred by was the presentation particularly by the Romanian authorities on the very significant expenditure they have undertaken to support Ukrainian refugees in Romania.  They have been told by the EU that they can spend their cohesion money on that first, that is their first port of call, rather than a new allocation of money to cover those costs.  It might have been expedient on day one to say: "You have money there.  We have to go through processes" but that cannot be a medium or long-term solution that they would spend money that had already been allocated for their own domestic economy in cohesion funding for this purpose.  Is there specific significant funding that will compensate totally those countries that are now using cohesion funding for this? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#H00200"><p>Funding is available from the EU Commission to support member states with costs now.  There is a new system in place.  I have spoken to the Commissioner responsible for it.  He was clear in terms of reassurance that funding would be available for countries like Ireland for accommodation costs and so on but also countries that are much more deeply impacted by numbers such as Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.  Four million refugees have come into Poland in four months.  It is unbelievable.  One million a month.  No conflict anywhere in the world has seen that kind of numbers in recent history that I can think of and some awful conflicts have taken place in recent decades.  They are extraordinary numbers in a  very short period.  There are other examples.  There is probably 5 million Syrians outside of Syria but that happened over a decade or so.  It is really unbelievable.  I suspect what is happening there is that while the funds were being finalised, put together, assessed and so on, the Commission told countries to use their Cohesion Funds that they could access straight away.  I suspect that is what was happening but I can come back with more detail on it.  I am not aware that we have drawn down any funds yet from the Commission.  I presume that applications will go in on some, but not all, the costs.  I remind people that we are putting in an Estimate to spend about &euro;2 billion on supporting Ukrainians in Ireland.  That is not a small amount of money.  We are more than happy to do it given the suffering and the plight they face but these are big financial commitments that the Commission has an obligation to help to fund and I think it will.</p> <p>  I refer to the four recommendations.  First, on the national refugee response lead, in truth it is the Taoiseach so far on this.  We have Cabinet subcommittee meetings specifically on Ukraine.  They are very punchy meetings in terms of hard questions being asked and an insistence on answers, timelines and so on.  They are led by the Taoiseach.  But the Deputy is right.  We need to build on that with someone who is permanently on the job and there are people who are.  The way this evolved at the start with pledges, allocations and management was very much focused around the Red Cross.  That has now shifted.  While there continues to be a role for the Red Cross responsibility for finding accommodation and supports and matching Ukrainian families up with Irish families and sourcing local accommodation, whether converting a convent, school or accessing student accommodation has now shifted to local authorities.  It includes temporary solutions but also finding more permanent solutions.  A huge amount of work is going on to support and facilitate 40,000 people.</p><p>It is a significant challenge.  We need to get better at it.  Some mistakes have been made and some things are not happening as fast as we would like them to.  A number of pilot projects are being rolled out.  For example, the purchase of 500 modular units is being managed and is under way.  We will see the benefits of that in a few months.<br/><br/>Much is taking place.  In some ways, we are learning as we go.  We have never had to deal with this number of people in such a short time.  To give some reassurance, this conversation is taking place at a senior level in government.  The Taoiseach chairs meetings, with all the key Ministers and State agencies feeding into them.  The benefit has to be felt in all counties and cities, where there are some real pressure points that need to be addressed.  The line Minister is Deputy Roderic O'Gorman but it would be unfair to leave it all on his desk.  All Cabinet Ministers have a role to play in providing supports, whether it is the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, the Minister for Education, or the Minister for Health.  This has consequences for hospitals, schools, sports clubs and community development.  The most difficult pressure point is housing and accommodation.  About 8% of hotel rooms in the country have effectively been block booked to ensure Ukrainian families have accommodation.  That is a significant number.<br/><br/>The medium-term and immediate needs of those families are the Government's focus.  We are ensuring emergency fallback positions and so on, which we have, with places such as the facility in Citywest and elsewhere.  I take on board those four requests.  I think there will be a director of services in each county.  That should have been there already.  If it is not, I understand that there should be a person to contact in each local authority about this issue.  The plan is evolving all the time.  It is not a question of just publishing a plan and implementing it, when one is dealing with people arriving every day.  We do not know how many people will arrive into the EU or Ireland next month.  It will depend on Russian actions.  We need contingency plans for different scenarios, which is what we are trying to develop.  We may need an established national co-ordination group for Ukrainian leadership whose members we could speak to directly.  The Ukrainian ambassador is often involved in that role.  She has been remarkably hands-on.  A more formalised structure may be helpful too.  The Ukrainians who I have spoken to are remarkably pragmatic and reasonable about trying to overcome the challenges we face with supports, accommodation and so on.<br/><br/>I will need to check with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, about the proceeds of crime legislation and the legalities that have resulted in a money message issue.  I take the point the Deputy has raised.  I suspect it is a legal concern and I do not want to stray into an area I have not been briefed on.<br/><br/>On the strategy of the EU regarding the conflict in Ukraine, the European Union has been very united on this, with some exceptions.  Getting agreement on the sixth sanctions package was not easy and it took longer than it should.  By and large, the European Union has been remarkably united.  There have been a number of miscalculations by Russia.  One was that the European Union would not be as united as it has been.  This is the case regardless of which country one looks at.  I have been involved in many debates with ministers whose countries have different relationships with Russia, but there has been a remarkable sense of solidarity and unity.  I think that will continue.  This has had a dramatic influence on the European Union.  It has questioned its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, what it stands for, why it is important and what its role in the world needs to be in the future, particularly on this Continent.  That has resulted in a real change in European politics.  I am not quite sure what that will end up looking like.  I think the appetite for enlargement has changed, as has the pace, the urgency and the willingness to make decisions quickly in the European Union.  The relationship between governments and the institutions of the European Union has changed for the better.  People like President von der Leyen have stepped up to try to lead opinion regarding policy change and so on in a way we have not seen before from the Commission.  That is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>At the moment, the strategy is to provide military, financial, humanitarian and political support to Ukraine, which is under attack and is desperately trying to survive that attack.  I do not believe the European Union knows how this will end.  Anybody who pretends to know is a bluffer.  All of the predictions about what will happen have proven to be wrong so far.  Most of the predictions were that this full invasion would not happen, which was wrong.  We then got a lot of military advice, as well as political advice, that this war would not last for more than a week and that Ukrainian cities would fold one after another.  It was viewed as a tragedy but that was where it was going.  Those people could not have been more wrong in underestimating the resilience, strength and unity of the Ukrainian people when resisting Russia.  There is now a brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine.  It is moving slowly.  Who knows where it will go?<br/><br/>Our position has to be informed by Ukrainian leadership and we have to support them in the judgments they make about whether conditions for a ceasefire develop.  We have an obligation to support that democratic Government in the difficult choices and decisions it makes in the future, as well as keeping a channel of communication to Moscow open.  The idea that we should cut it off entirely and not even talk to it is also wrong.  Ultimately, the European Union needs to try to find a way to end this.  We have to end it in a way that the Ukrainian leadership supports, given the extraordinary sacrifices Ukrainians have made in the face of this aggression.<br/><br/>I take Deputy Howlin's point about enlargement of the European Union.  We cannot assume that everything will stay the same because the European Union enlarges.  A concern for some countries is that there may be a change in the power balance which would shift power in the European Union to the east, but we have to find a way to manage that.  The European Union should never give the sense that our door is closed to countries that are willing to reform and change.  The Deputy's point is correct, which is why standards for full membership and accession have to remain high.  Those benchmarks are tough for political leaders to meet.  It is not easy to become a member of the European Union, but the rewards when one gets there are extraordinary.</p></speech>

We could see this at the Conference on the Future of Europe.  We saw how the language and some of the recommendations changed.  How could it be any other way?  The Minister talked about the commentary around the war and the fact that most of the expert commentators got it wrong.  Vladimir Putin must have been listening to the same level of commentary because there has been an illegal invasion, a huge level of war crimes and a huge level of bravery on the part of the Ukrainian people.  It is now being said by commentators that in the initial period, he had insufficient forces that were too spread out and he lost a huge amount of tanks that cannot be replaced in the short term.  I think a number of commentators have stated that Chinese tyres are not necessarily as good as ones that can be sourced throughout Europe or the US.  All these things have created their own difficulties but on some level, Russia has got its act together from a military point of view.  We have seen what it has done in the Donbas, which is that you bring superior force to bear and batter away until you win.  The question for the Ukrainians is what they can do in this set of circumstances.</p> <p>  We all agree that sanctions are what we can and must do but there is probably an element of reorganisation of supply chains and people falling into different brackets.  Russia probably had to do an element of this from 2014.  It is used to sanctions - perhaps not at this level - so there is now an element of selling to India, China or wherever.  With certain materials such as gas, it is not as easy to shift partners but an element of that is happening.  It is about what we do in that context.  Russia may end up being far more resilient no matter how much we pressure it.  It is one of those weapons we have to bear so we need to put it in play as much as possible.</p> <p>  I will follow up on some of what Deputy Haughey said about our trip to Georgia.  He spoke specifically about the chairperson of the foreign affairs committee of the Georgian Parliament.  Most other people said they were not happy, but saw it relatively positively that there was a roadmap towards accession.  He said we could be dealing with a different situation when we are back in six months time.  He said that to a degree, the Russians are in a better position militarily than they were and could be in a better position again within six months and that the impact across the western world in particular has been significant.  He mentioned the cost-of-living crisis and his fears that people will just be worried about ending their own pain and that whatever solidarity that exists may dissipate to a degree.  His point echoed the points made earlier by Deputy Haughey, namely, that you cannot necessarily quantify some of the moves, particularly as regards what is an adequate level of non-polarisation of politics or de-oligarchisation.  I knew that was going to be a struggle to pronounce.</p> <p>  In saying that, we had some very straight conversations.  I think there is an acceptance that Georgia has a hell of a lot of steps to take to be able to meet certain criteria.  That is where we are and where Georgia is.  We talk about the strategic economy.  If we talk about gas and oil, and we are talking about ourselves here, we have the Corrib gas field, the supply chain through Great Britain, North Sea oil and Norwegian and Danish involvement in that, so we believe we are alight.  Am I right in thinking, because it has been put out there previously, that we are all signed up to some sort of European rationing which ensures that if there is pain in Poland, there is pain throughout the EU?  I am right in thinking there is a requirement on us to put the pony up?  I have heard it in a number of places but I have not been able to get a definitive answer.  If I could get that, I would be very happy.</p> <p>  We have heard commentary from Emmanuel Macron and the likes of Henry Kissinger.  In Georgia, they remembered when he spoke about it being a different geopolitical place.  Europe has to make a determination regarding where the EU stops and starts geographically.  The Minister spoke about the difficulties of the eastward trend.  We all know about the rule-of-law issues that have existed.  It is a question of where we mesh all those things together.  The argument the Georgians and others would make is that if we went back to the time when this State joined the EU, we probably would not be as progressive as we are now.  An awful lot of people would say that the EU was probably beneficial in the sense that it facilitated social progress.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about hybrid threats.  He mentioned two things.  One was the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats while the other was the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn.  We got some sort of briefing on it previously but am I right in thinking that one of them is NATO-affiliated but not necessarily run by NATO?  Could the Minister provide some detail on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#K00200"><p>I take the point regarding some of the miscalculations from a military perspective at the start.  I am sure they will be analysed by military experts at different stages.  The expectation from many, including Russia clearly, was that Ukrainian cities would effectively fall one after the other - that there would be some initial resistance, but the scale of the Russian military would result in a relatively quick victory.  That clearly did not happen.  If anything, the Ukrainian resistance strengthened in the first few weeks of this conflict.  That was before they received support and assistance from other countries.</p> <p>  What is happening in eastern Ukraine is very different from that because it is almost a war of attrition that involves an extraordinary amount of destruction of property, massive displacement of civilians and some deliberate targeting of civilians to empty out cities.  It seems the only way to capture cities militarily is to raze them to the ground.  That is what we are seeing.  We saw that tactic in Syria and we are now seeing it in eastern Ukraine but it is incredibly brutal.  Some of the stories and briefings I have read regarding the human consequences of it are just awful for those soldiers involved and civilians.  It involves soldiers on both sides.  It is absolutely brutal.</p> <p>  We will have to wait and see.  This is now a slow war of attrition.  When I say "slow", that does not mean that it is not very large-scale.  It relates to movement forward for either side.  Nobody is predicting a ceasefire any time soon so we need not be naive about that.</p><p>Obviously, we should be looking for those opportunities when they arise, but the appetite is not there on either side.  Ukraine's determination to defend itself and its territory and to try to drive occupying Russian forces out of Ukraine, as well as Russia's determination to gain more ground in eastern Ukraine mean, unfortunately, a summer of a continuation of what we have seen in the last number of weeks.<br/><br/>Regarding Georgia, I am very conscious of the pace of accession, particularly if one looks at the western Balkans, for example, and a country such as Serbia.  If the process stalls, those who are advocating for accession, and the reforms and changes that are needed to deliver it, start to lose momentum too, where they are making changes but not making progress towards EU membership.  That creates a difficulty politically and it creates a vacuum that others, including Russia or certainly Russian influence, are happy to fill.  That goes for Georgia as well as for other countries.  That said, however, it is necessary to get the balance right and ensure one is not fast-forwarding, for political reasons, an accession process that then does not allow one to maintain standards or to insist on the benchmarks that are needed.  Trying to get that balance right is difficult.  However, in the context of Georgia, most of those I have spoken to in the European Union see this as an opening of the door, not a closing of the door.  It is just not opened to the extent that it was for Ukraine and Moldova, but it is certainly a very clear signal of what the EU wants to facilitate.<br/><br/>On the issue of gas, there has been no discussion of a rationing system <i>per se</i>yet, but we will have to work collectively across the European Union to support member states that face energy shortages this winter.  The idea that Ireland is okay and everybody else can fend for themselves is not how the European Union works.  That said, there is the way in which gas networks work.  We get our gas from Corrib and from the UK interconnection with Scotland.  The UK gets most of its gas from Norway and from the North Sea.  The UK does not source very much gas at all from Russia.  I believe it is in the low single percentage figures.  It is just the way the pipeline systems work that the UK does not source from Russia, whereas many countries in the European Union source a huge majority of their gas from Russia.  Undoubtedly, if that supply is either shut off by Russia or prevented from coming into the EU by sanctions, there will be a change in how the gas network system operates across Europe and, of course, there will be a change in pricing.</p></speech>

Some countries would say it is well for Ireland because it can push for a seven-sanctions package that includes gas because Ireland is not reliant on gas for heating systems through the winter and does not have the type of climate those countries have.  However, consider Poland, which is advocating for it.  It is not sourcing Russian gas any longer and it is adjusting, which will be very difficult for it.  However, it has a strength of feeling that it is necessary.</p> <p>  This is about energy solidarity across the European Union and about changing how the supply chains work.  Obviously, it is about doing a lot more shipping to compensate for pipeline gas and oil that may not be coming into the EU.  I note the European Union is now importing more energy from the US than from Russia for the first time.  That changed this week or in the past week or so.  That trend is likely to continue.  However, there are no easy answers here.  I do not want to pretend that there is some type of easy alternative to Russian gas.  There are alternatives but putting them in place will take time and is not easy.  I believe we will see an awful lot more liquified natural gas, LNG, infrastructure being built in the European Union as well, and for good reason in terms of energy security for gas.  We will see an acceleration of investments in renewables.  The European Commission has signalled that it wants to facilitate that in respect of permitting systems and fast-tracking the processes there.</p> <p>  This is a huge opportunity for Ireland.  Our offshore energy resource is almost limitless, in truth, given the scale of the resource we have in wind and wave, and particularly wind.  It is a question of how we harness that, the time it takes to do it and the interconnection that we have with the rest of the European Union to be able to sell it into the European grid, whether that is through hydrogen or interconnectors.  However, they are medium-term things and they certainly will not be in place for next winter.  That is why the question of sourcing gas and where it comes from will continue to be a big issue moving into the autumn.</p> <p>  On the hybrid threats, there is a centre of excellence on cybersecurity in Tallinn in Estonia.  That is predominantly a NATO-led project, but there are non-NATO countries also represented there.  The hybrid threats centre of excellence is in Helsinki.  Again, a lot of NATO countries are part of that, but there are some non-NATO countries too.  Like with many things linked to defence and security, often the benchmark or the international standard is a NATO standard, but that does not mean that other countries do not participate in or are not involved in benefitting from the knowledge and experience that are there.  Wearing my defence hat, the training standards, equipment standards and so forth that we aim at, whether it is our ships and how they operate or our armoured vehicles or our firepower, weaponry and so forth, are generally NATO standards, so we are interoperable with other EU countries if we choose to partner with them on peacekeeping missions or whatever.  It does not mean we are joining NATO.  We are not joining NATO.  It means that is the benchmark in the European Union for military standards of equipment and training and, therefore, for us to be consistent with what every other country is doing, we normally have to be consistent with NATO standards.</p> <p>  That is why there is a NATO presence in some of these centres of excellence.  It is a very useful presence from our perspective in terms of improving our skill sets.  We have to be confident enough to talk about that.  Just because one partners and co-operates with NATO does not necessarily mean there is some type of plot to join NATO.  That is not a terrible thing anyway.  Other countries are choosing to join NATO.  I am not proposing that we join NATO.  What I am saying is that we should be partnering with other EU countries and groups of countries, and sometimes NATO too, to ensure we have standards of equipment, training and operation that allow us to be interoperable with other EU countries.  Both of those centres of excellence are good examples of that.</p></speech>

I am not moving as fast as others as I have a crutch.  I will ask a few questions, but I will not be present to hear the Minister's replies so I will check them afterwards.</p><p>The first is about Ukraine's candidate status.  Like most Deputies, I am fully supportive of the Government's position in that regard.  However, I am wondering about the process, the Copenhagen criteria, the <i>acquis communautaire</i>and so forth.  That will be very challenging for Ukraine.  What supports is the Commission putting in place and what can be done basically in the middle of a war?  That is the situation we are facing.</p><p>My second question refers to sanctions.</p><p>Deputy Haughey spoke about the fact the foreign minister of Georgia said it would take 15 years for the sanctions to bite or impact.  I am not sure the Minister responded to that and I am looking for his perspective on it.  The Minister also spoke about the fact African leaders are blaming all sides, that one can understand why and that there is an information war going on here.  Given the EU has pledged &euro;1 billion to the Sahel and very significant amounts of money to the Horn of Africa around food security and food resilience, are the Russians engaged in providing, in real terms, food or aid, etc., or is this just an information war?</p><p> Moving to the third question, I will not expand about the civil society group on Ukraine that met yesterday because Deputy Howlin already did.  I heard the Minister's response and it is positive but I wish to add my voice to the Deputy's and to the call from the civil society group.  We need a lead within Government, a co-ordinating group or whatever, whose responsibility it is to be, if you like, in charge of what is happening because there is absolutely no doubt but that some local authorities, civil society organisations, local groups and individuals are beginning to feel somewhat adrift.  It is crucial that does not happen because the Minister and I know, as we hear the conversations taking place publicly and privately, that certain people and organisations are trying to use the current situation around Ukrainian refugees to stir up trouble for various reasons, political and otherwise.  Wherever there is any uncertainty it just adds fuel to the fire, so any work that can be done from the point of view of co-ordination, of a sense that somebody or some group is in charge and guiding this and that people can have confidence in it, is important.</p><p> I have a final question.  The Minister may or may not be able to respond to this.  If he cannot he may respond to me later.  I have written to him about it.  I have had communication from a small number of Ukrainians who wish to return to Ukraine but cannot because of the fact they cannot get papers.  They want to return to their families, husbands, elderly parents, etc.  I am not saying this is happening to all Ukrainians who wish to return; I only know the ones I speak to.  What is the story there?  Is there anything that can be done to allow people to return to their homes?</p><p> I will make one last comment.  We are talking a lot here about the EU moving eastwards.  When I was in Brussels, many people who live in the Baltic states, Poland and those countries see themselves very much as central Europeans and not eastern Europeans.  Perspective is everything.  I apologise to the Minister but I am up next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022070600002#M00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I know she has to go but I will try to answer her questions.  The first thing to say is there has already been a significant level of support for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia from the EU in relation to reforms and institutional support.  I think that will continue as they journey towards, in Georgia's case, candidate status in future and then on, we hope, to full membership in time and likewise for Moldova and Ukraine.  Of course, let us not forget about the Western Balkans because if we forget about them politically and allow tensions to build there, we could live to regret it.  Aspirations for EU memberships are a big part of stabilising the Western Balkans and relationships there.  It is something the EU needs to continue to focus on despite all the other pressures in terms of moving ahead, particularly on North Macedonia and Albania but also for others as well.</p> <p>  On the comment it will take 15 years for the sanctions to bite, sanctions are not a perfect tool and we know that but is anybody suggesting we should not have sanctions?  We are trying to measure whether the sanctions are working or not.  Clearly, the only real measurement is whether the war will come to an end and whether sanctions, in the form of creating a cost for Russia, have contributed to that.  We know there is a cost to Russia linked to those sanctions.  It is not as impactful as it otherwise would be because Russia is developing new commercial relationships with certain countries that help to compensate and open up new markets for product that would otherwise have been coming to the EU.  We know that is happening.  The price of oil and gas is such now internationally that if Russia can sell it to some parts of the world, and it can, it is doing so for a much higher price.  The sanctions are not perfect, therefore, but we are certainly better having them than not.  As for the idea you can set a moment in a future at which you can say the sanctions have worked, such as after 15 years or whatever, this is not an exact science.  This is about sending a clear signal that as long as this war continues the political and economic relationship between the EU and Russia is going to be very badly damaged and Russia will be isolated in its relationship with many countries in the world, that that has a serious cost and the cost is likely to increase as this war continues through new rounds of sanctions and so on.  In other words, there must be a deterrent that has edge to it and cost to it, which is what we are trying to do with sanctions.  It is not an anti-Russia thing but an anti-Russian aggression thing.  There is a difference.</p> <p>  On Africa, undoubtedly the EU is a huge funder of development and working with governments across the Horn of Africa and the Sahel.  It is doing so much more so than Russia is.  However, Russia also has security relationships with quite a number of African countries and has influence in that regard.  If you take what is happening in Mali and a number of neighbouring states in terms of the influence of Russia and Russian proxies on security through mercenary groups and so on, you can see there is a strong influence there and I suspect the Russians are using it.  To be fair, for many countries on the African Continent, a doubling of food prices has an enormous consequence in the form of potential instability and the impact on populations that are already under much pressure in a number of Sahel countries.  The Horn of Africa has seen significant drought this year as well, so the combined impact of a lack of harvest as well as a significant increase in the cost of importing food is having a big and very disruptive impact and many African leaders are very concerned about it and they just want it to stop.  They see it as linked to the war and sanctions and so on.  We must work hard, and we are, to explain what is really driving this, which is Russian aggression and of course a continued blockade of access in and out of Ukraine from the Black Sea.  Those efforts will continue.  The Deputy should not underestimate Russia's influence around the world.  It is a very big and influential country.</p> <p>  I take the point on the civil society groups.  We need to listen to that.</p> <p>  The final point I wish to make is on trying to see ahead a few months.  We are starting to see some political conversations driven by the pressure we are feeling with housing and accommodation and the blaming of certain people or categories of people.  We must work really hard to ensure that does not get traction.</p><p>The last thing we need here is political tension on the migration question.  I refer to taking what we are trying to do as part of a war effort to support displaced people from Ukraine, who are fleeing for their lives, and comparing it with the needs of Irish people who are on housing lists or families who are homeless and so on, and starting to blame people for the pressures that everybody is feeling.  The Government, State agencies and local authorities have to work really hard to ensure that this does not happen.  As Deputy Harkin said, we are already hearing some commentary that may get louder through the summer and into the autumn.  I think we need to be careful of that.  Ireland is one of the very few countries in Europe that has not allowed the issues of immigration, asylum and refugees to become a central point of division in politics.  We have worked hard to make sure that has not happened here.  We have to continue to make sure it does not, and to try to keep a consensus on the basis of decency of our obligations under international law, human rights and so on.  We can do that through this challenge too.</p><p> No Ukrainian in Ireland deserves to be blamed for housing pressures.  Those pressures are not their fault.  In many cases, they arrive here with no more than the contents of a rucksack for themselves and their kids.  We have an obligation to look after them while they are here, to provide accommodation as best we can and to show generosity, so that when all of this is over Ireland can look at itself in the mirror and we can say that we did our bit in a way that was generous and showed real solidarity at a time of extraordinary human suffering.  We need to remember that when we are trying to deal with these pressures at a local authority level around accommodation and moving people out of student accommodation into other accommodation and so on.  It is not easy when we are trying to deal with 40,000 people in the space of a few months.  It is important that we bring the conversation back to the truth of what is really driving that and the suffering behind it in order to make sure that we have the right context.  Otherwise, we will allow the debate to move into a very unhelpful and unfair space.  It is unfair on people who are at a very vulnerable point in their lives, who are now living here and who arrived with virtually nothing.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to provide an update on that.</p></speech>

A huge proportion of that would normally have come from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.  Likewise, in Egypt.  I stand to be corrected here, but, from memory, the UN World Food Programme would have sourced close to 60% of its wheat, which is a big part of the food stocks that is supplies, from Ukraine and Belarus.  It is having to find alternative sources now.  Of course, the World Food Programme is effectively the largest humanitarian organisation on the planet.  The war is having big knock-on consequences in terms of the World Food Programme having to recalibrate its programmes, for example, in Yemen.  We have heard David Beasley, the head of the World Food Programme, talk about having to take food from the hungry to give it to the starving.  That is the kind of conversation that is taking place.  These are extraordinary knock-on consequences, given the fact that we were talking about the knock-on consequences of Covid only a few months ago.  The combination of the impact of Covid and the current dramatic increases in the price of essential items like food and energy means that we are going to have to recalibrate our aid programme.</p> <p>  There is also a commitment in the aid programme to increase the spend on climate finance.  We are currently spending in the region of &euro;90 million a year on climate finance.  We have committed to increasing that figure to &euro;225 million by 2025.  That is only a few years away.  The combination of doing more on climate finance, as well as doing more on healthcare, means that recalibration will be required.  The impact of Covid on, for example, girls' education has been extraordinary.  It has set it back nearly a decade.  Many people were not allowed to go to school because of the fear of Covid spreading and so on.  Many of them have not returned to school since then.  We have a big investment programme in girls' education.  We will rightly be forced to try to re-evaluate how we spend on food and nutrition, hunger, and I suspect, on some very serious humanitarian catastrophes in the autumn linked to the unavailability of food and the combination of price and drought.  There are some pretty pessimistic predictions in terms of drought in some countries in the Horn of Africa later this year.  In addition, for the first time, we have over 100 million displaced people.  Many of them are in refugee camps.</p> <p>  I am flying to New York this evening for a UN Security Council meeting tomorrow at which we are hoping to get agreement to maintain, for another 12 months, humanitarian access through Turkey into north-western Syria, where approximately  4 million people rely almost entirely on UN operations for humanitarian assistance.  Around 1,000 trucks a month were crossing into the area previously.  This year, it has been about 800 a month.  That is still an enormous volume.  Between &euro;150 million and &euro;250 million worth of medical, food and humanitarian aid is going to displaced people in the Idlib province, most of whom have been displaced four, five, six, seven or ten times, having been moved on during the ongoing war in Syria.  There is an enclave in north-west Syria where displaced people, who have largely either been driven out or have been trying to resist the Assad regime, are now effectively encamped.  Most of them are living in tents.  Only about 20% of the children there are getting any form of education at all.</p> <p>  Ireland and Norway have the responsibility on the UN Security Council for getting humanitarian assistance into Syria.  It is one of the specific roles that we have.  We are what is called a penholder in UN-speak for that file, which means that we write the relevant resolution and try to get agreement.  To date, we do not have agreement with Russia to facilitate the extension of that resolution.  Should it fall this week or next week, then the UN operations at the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey into north-west Syria will effectively have to close.  There are 4 million people there, which is almost equivalent to the population of Ireland.  I know that we have a population of more than 5 million now.  The population being supported by that humanitarian assistance is certainly the equivalent of all of the women and children in Ireland.  That gives the members an idea of the scale of some of the things we are involved in at a UN Security Council level.</p> <p>  The Security Council is not always about intervening in conflicts and war.  Sometimes it is very much a humanitarian role linked to conflict, in this case, in Syria.  We are trying to get agreement from countries that are very sceptical as to whether or not this aid into Syria should be facilitated at all, because they think it compromises Syrian sovereignty, and so on.  I agree with the Chairman.  More countries will have to commit more to the food and energy security issues.  The EU has already put in place a food security fund.</p><p>This is for countries across the Horn of Africa and in the Middle East.  It will help to pay the difference in terms of the increase in price.  We have done something with Egypt on this also because it imports a huge amount of its food.  It is not only about preventing people from starving, which of course is pretty important.  It is also about maintaining stability.  If people cannot buy bread democratic systems collapse.  If we look at the Arab spring and where and how it started, it all began over the price of bread in Tunisia and then the whole thing spread.</p><p> This is about maintaining political stability as well as nutrition and making sure people can feed themselves.  I am rambling a little bit now but we are of course looking at it.  It is also why, despite all of the pressures we face in the budget in terms of our own cost of living, in my view a significant increase in our development aid budget this year is more than justified.  As a relatively wealthy country, we have a responsibility towards countries that are on a basic level trying to feed their populations.  We have our own problems here that we need to respond to but we have a moral obligation to respond significantly on some of the global issues.</p></speech>

I admitted the first adult patient on 2 March 2020.  In the first wave of Covid-19, with the original virus, it appeared that the lungs and heart would be the targets of damage.  Following the establishment of a long Covid clinic at the Mater hospital in June 2020, we became aware that the heart and lungs repaired themselves and that Covid-19 primarily affected the brain.  This was where residual damage persisted, and some patients, even a year after infection, had residual symptoms that were all referable to brain inflammation.<br/><br/>The UK established one of the first long Covid clinics.  Some 50 or 60 clinics have been established.  Their focus was primarily on heart and lung rehabilitation, as the first variants had led to many patients being hospitalised and in intensive care units, ICUs, with Covid-19 that affected those organs.  In the UK, however, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines warned that many of the post-Covid symptoms needed to be managed and not further investigated, as most investigations of long Covid patients did not reveal any abnormalities.  It appeared that abnormalities were below the level of detection of the tests done.<br/><br/>Early into the first Covid-19 surge, I received a Health Research Board, HRB, grant to lead a project on long Covid in the Mater hospital.  I did this in partnership with Professor Walter Cullen, professor of urban family practice at UCD.  We established our clinic at the Mater hospital to provide a research platform and a clinical care centre.  We developed a protocol called &quot;Anticipate&quot; and administered questionnaires to 155 patients over time to perform quality of life assessments on their journey with long Covid.  To date, we have seen approximately 1,000 patients.  We have followed up with more than 80 patients monthly, and 25 or more new patients are being seen monthly.  This was a snapshot of the early 155 patients.  <br/><br/>As stated, early in my clinical observation, and from observations derived from a review of the medical literature, the brain was the primary target of long Covid.  A review by Shin Jie Yong <i>et al</i>., published in January 2021, and I have these references, highlighted the pathogenesis of long Covid neurological symptoms.  We based our understanding and treatment of patients as early as April 2021 on focusing on the brain and the need for brain rehabilitation as accumulating information from not just the author I mentioned but also other medical literature supported this the approach where the money was.  The review by Mr. Yong focused on the posterior part of the brain being involved in long Covid, with ongoing tissue damage, possible viral persistence and chronic inflammation all emanating from the brainstem, which is the posterior part of the brain.  The brainstem contains numerous distinct nuclei and subparts that regulate the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological processes.  Indeed, brainstem dysfunction has been seen in other similar disorders, such as in chronic pain and migraine and myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.  UK NICE guidelines for the long-term management of Covid-19 recommends access to multidisciplinary services, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy and clinical psychology, with a range of specialist skills.<br/><br/>Based on our management of the long Covid patients and accumulating medical evidence in early 2021, we submitted an application to the Ireland East Hospital Group, IEHG.  It focused on neural aspects and on working in partnership with GPs nationally to support these patients.  This approach would include a range of specialists, but neuro rehabilitation and neurology would be critical.  We heard nothing further about this submission until I was called into our CEO's office in March 2022 and was told there were interim guidelines for the management of Covid-19 in Ireland.  This was the first time I saw this document, but apparently it was published in September 2021.  I received it in March 2022, just a few months ago.  <br/><br/>As I said, we had this study called &quot;Anticipate&quot; and we evaluated 155 patients.  We conducted questionnaires and this year there have been some treatments for long Covid patients based on the suspected central nervous system, CNS, injury of our patients.  As stated, after one year, many of our patients, including many staff members from the Mater and other hospitals who were referred to us for evaluation and GP referrals from the region, had &quot;brain fog&quot; cognitive issues, exhaustion, sleep disturbances and psychological issues they did not have before.  There were also blood pressure, pulse and thermoregulation problems.  It was a sort of dysautonomia, which is an abnormal signalling from the vagus nerve as it courses out of the brain.  It will be recalled that patients with Covid-19 get damage to cranial nerve 1 and 2, which concern smell and taste, but accumulating experience in my clinic and internationally has shown that many of the cranial nerves are involved, including the vagus nerve, which controls the fight or flight response that many long Covid patients experience.  We have published the results of our work in medical journals and offered to share our results with the national clinical lead and with the Minister for Health.  We had a dissemination event at the Catherine McAuley Centre in April 2022 to present all our results, as required by the HRB.  We invited the Minister to attend.  We have written to seek an opportunity to present our data as we see gaps in the current interim long Covid plan for Ireland.  We have offered to assist in rewriting the guidelines to reflect the current problems that patients are experiencing.  <br/><br/>I have had a chance to review the draft long Covid guidelines, using version 4 as set out on the website and dated 2021.  It outlines a plan that appears to be taken from the UK plan, and, indeed, most references are taken from the UK, with some from Italy.</p><p>By the time this document was completed, distributed and enacted, the goalposts had shifted.  It focuses on early post-Covid follow-up with a group of pulmonary specialists, and a cadre of dieticians and podiatrists funded.  Interestingly, there was no mention of psychologists.  However, as stated, for those of us managing patients in the hospital, the accumulating evidence at that time was that the lungs and heart were healing but the brain was not healing.  In addition, when I reviewed this long Covid document, I was surprised to see that the Mater infectious diseases, ID, clinic was not included as a site for follow-up, despite us generating most of the scientific data in Ireland on this subject and managing, I suspect, more patients with our clinical care follow-up.</p><p> I am providing the committee with many of the published articles on long Covid emanating from the Mater ID clinic in a separate communication.  I would also like to highlight the long Covid briefing paper for the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, from the office of the chief clinical officer in February 2022.  It still focused on the establishment of post-acute clinics, establishment of long Covid clinics and a tertiary referral for neurocognitive clinics for those with complex neurocognitive-neuropsychological problems.  It provides also a literature review but failed to include any of the Irish publications that were in the public domain at the time.  It also comments that the current plan is an interim model of care and, therefore, it will be an agile process.</p><p> To summarise from our publications, about one third of our long Covid patients still have significant neurocognitive defects at one year.  From our GP supported publications, 15% to 20% of people with long Covid have unexplained anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  In addition, some are experiencing problem alcohol use to cope with the challenge of long Covid.  These are problems that they did not have before Covid.</p><p> We have just published the first pilot on the use of low-dose naltrexone and its utility in treating long Covid.  It appeared to benefit patients with long Covid.  The group we treated had been unwell for an average of 333 days, with no improvement prior to this treatment.  Based on the current gaps in the Irish long Covid plan, I have met with the neurorehabilitation specialists who attend the Mater and who are part of the plan to staff the new trauma centre there.  We have discussed how to deal with the issues patients are facing.  Some are currently being discharged from the short-term post-Covid clinics because nothing is being found to be wrong with them, that is, they have no cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities.  Some have bounced from one specialist to another, with many thousands of euros worth of testing - such as pulmonary function tests, CT chest, CT brain, Holter monitoring - and been told that there is nothing wrong.  I had recent contact from a psychiatric nurse who has had long Covid for a year.  She has overwhelming anxiety and cannot attend work.  She has been referred to a psychiatrist privately.  The first appointment available is February 2023.  GPs do not have a clear referral pathway or guidance on the management of long Covid.  Patients are coming to me having been prescribed a long series of medicines that just control the symptoms, from pain killers, to nerve blockers, to sleeping pills and psychiatric medicines, and they are no better.</p><p> What we propose at the Mater is a centre for neurorehabilitation, with a national network to support GPs.  This is because there are so many patients throughout the country with long Covid.  Many of them cannot travel because they are too ill.  This neurorehabilitation centre will focus on brain rehabilitation because patients with long Covid act very much like patients who have experienced closed head injuries.  A group of neurorehabilitation specialists, neurologists, ID physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists and neurophysiotherapists need to be the primary team managing these patients because CNS is the problem with our patients with long Covid.  In addition, we propose to engage Professor Walter Cullen and team family medicine to develop a set of educational materials, guidelines and protocols that GPs can follow in order that they can better understand this condition and treat the patients in their communities.</p><p> Covid-19 is ever mutating and changing.  Ireland must be agile and adapt the long Covid plan in order to serve the patients who are being let down by it.  We have known for 18 months, based on accumulating scientific data, that brain damage is the issue with long Covid.  We need a new plan and new resources and staffing to support these patients to recover and return to being contributing members of society.</p></speech>

Does he think that society and employers need more assurance that this is something that is really impacting on people?  I feel that society has not accepted that long Covid is something that is real and impacting on people's lives and on their ability to perform in their jobs or live normal functioning lives.</p></speech>

Some of the patients have chronic fatigue syndrome, ME, as part of their long Covid.  For decades, so many patients have been told that there is nothing wrong with them and to just exercise more.  In some communities, both in the general public and the medical community, there is a belief that these patients are making up their illnesses and that if they try harder and be mindful, they will get better.  However, the reality is that most of the patients I took care of are healthcare workers who never missed a day of work in their lives.  They never missed a day of work in the ICU and worked long shifts yet here they are, coming down with Covid from an infection they caught in the hospital.  Two years later, they have done everything they possibly can, including private care, to get help and they are basically told that there is nothing wrong with them and that they should just exercise more and be mindful.  That does not work for this condition.  PET scans of long Covid patients for research studies have shown that there is brain inflammation.  Patients are not making this up.  It is real.  It is all in their head; there is damage to the brain and that is where the focus should be.  There should be an education campaign for employers, occupational health doctors and businesses to support these patients because they are not making up the problem.</p></speech>

Is it prevalent among any specific age cohort or gender?</p></speech>

Our studies at one year showed that 30% of people were still not right.  I would say that 1% were unable to work, function or get out of bed, so they were unable to return to work.  Looking at the number of cases in Ireland, which is approximately 5 million because some people have had the virus two or three times, each time you get Covid, you are at risk of long Covid.  If you calculate conservatively that 1% will be disabled by long Covid, that is 1% of 5 million.  Looking at people impacted by long Covid, lots of staff tell me that they got mild Covid three months earlier and that their brain is not working right.  They cannot remember their PIN or names at work.  It has a subtle effect on many people, and that is the 30% I was reporting from the studies that we did at the Mater.</p></speech>

Is this a recognisable medical condition that can be certified?  Is it accepted among medics?  People suffer from a range of conditions, but can a person be certified by a doctor or physician as being a sufferer of long Covid?</p></speech>

I do not know if that has happened in Ireland.  I hear from many of my patients that their benefits are going to be taken away shortly and they are told to return to work or find ways to cope on their own.  The challenge is that it is one of those vague conditions like ME.  Some people have pain syndrome, some pass out, some have exhaustion, some people have brain fog and are unable to concentrate and some have tinnitus.  There are so many different symptoms related to the brain and there is no magic blood test.  The scans that I spoke about to show the abnormalities, the CT brain and MRI scans of the brain, are normal.  It is PET scans that show up the abnormalities and those are not available in Ireland.  I think it has to be clinical diagnosis.  We have to believe the patients because my patients want to go back to work.  They are not malingering.</p></speech>

On the international evidence, Dr. Lambert has mentioned the UK and Italy.  Is it certifiable as a condition in those countries?  He mentioned the use of the PET scan, for example.  Is that something we can learn from and follow here?</p></speech>

On the community response, Dr. Lambert mentioned the need for occupational therapists, OTs, and physiotherapists.  Again, they are dealing with the backlog that is there anyway and the usual pressures within the health system.  This will add considerably to that pressure across the community setting.  Is that a fair assertion?</p></speech>

Even today, our health services have been cut back because we continue to admit patients to the hospital, we continue to have outbreaks of Covid in the hospital and staff out of work.  All of our healthcare services continue to be impacted by Covid.  For example, like I said one of the big gaps is that in the first year, we had a psychologist to support the patients, or staff patients, with long Covid.  Those services have gone.  In the long Covid plan for Ireland, at least the version published in September 2021, there was no provision for patients getting psychology or psychiatric support and that is a problem.  Psychiatric services in Ireland were deficient even before Covid so it is going to be an additional challenge but it is not optional.  We have a healthcare force here that is going to be affected if we do not start putting together some plans to get them rehabilitated and back to work.</p></speech>

Like I said, the first waves, the Delta wave and these other strains attacked the brain but they also attacked the heart and lungs.  The new strains of Omicron are not attacking the lungs and the heart to the same degree.  It is probably ten times less but they are ten times more contagious, so more people are getting long Covid.  You can still catch Covid even if you are vaccinated but there are not good data to show it significantly prevents your development of long Covid.</p></speech>

We have met a few times before.  I think it was mainly as part of media interviews so it is nice to see him in the flesh.</p> <p>  I want to go through a number of items in his opening statement because it chimes very much with a lot of what we heard in a submission we received from the long Covid support group, which is called Long Covid Ireland.  It is made up of patients who have long Covid who are telling their story.  Maybe we can have the group before the committee at some point as well.  It is important we hear from the patients suffering from long Covid.</p> <p>  In the very early stages of Covid, Dr. Lambert's organisation received a HRB grant and he led a project that established a clinic to provide, as he said, a research plan as well as a clinical care centre.  At the start, the project developed a protocol called Anticipate, where 155 patients initially consented.  To date, over 1,000 patients have been seen with 80 follow-up patients and 25 or more patients being seen monthly.  Dr. Lambert made an important point that was also made in the submission we received from the long Covid support group.  Dr. Lambert said it appears the lungs and heart were, in the early stages, the target of damage but the more research he did, the residual damage was actually brain damage.  Is that correct?  Is it a fair and accurate reflection of where he sees it now?</p></speech>

I have pictures of a lot of my consultants from the first wave with lungs that were whited out in the ICU, and their lungs healed 100%.  I was surprised.  I have pictures of cardiac function in some of the consultants and the non-consultant hospital doctors who had low ejection fractions following Delta and within six months it totally resolved.  That is really good news but then the bad news is the brain did not heal.</p></speech>

It is important because it chimes with what Dr. Lambert has said.  It says:</p> <blockquote> 	It&rsquo;s often the case that LC sufferers are so sick with one primary symptom that we may not have the ability to be able to mention all the other symptoms for months. One member in our support group explained she was so sick with respiratory issues that she couldn&rsquo;t deal with telling her GP she had horrendous upper body tremors. She eventually had no choice after 8 months of living in hell with many weird symptom&rsquo;s like suddenly taking a step sideways while she was standing at her kitchen counter, that she attended a Neurologist and has been diagnosed with a brain disorder ... There are thousands of others like her, and you must understand this is NOT a one size fits all scenario. </blockquote> <p>Is that something Dr. Lambert saw commonly in the thousand or so patients that came through his clinic?</p></speech>

The breathing centre is in the part of the brain that is affected by long Covid.  The Deputy will have heard of sleep apnoea, which comes from the brain.  The focus is really on the brain.  I have talked to a lot of my pulmonary specialists at the Mater and initially every patient with this shortness of breath and symptoms like that was being sent for pulmonary function tests and being put on breathing treatments to support them but they do not have asthma.  They have got a centrally-driven kind of air hunger.  It is not like asthma at all.  An awful lot of patients are out there with these breathing problems and they are not coming from the lungs.  Many of the cardiac problems are not coming from the lungs but from the brain, the vagus nerves and the inflammation from the brain is stimulating so we need to get-----</p></speech>

He says based on the management of long Covid patients at his clinic that he has accumulated a lot of medical evidence, and he certainly has because he has submitted it to us.  He says that in July 2021 he established a long Covid clinic that included a range of specialist care.  I am sorry, it was an application to set up such a clinic.  He heard nothing further about that submission until March 2022.  I want to go through some of what Dr. Lambert said.  He said he published the results of his work in medical journals and offered to share his results with the national clinical lead and with the Minister for Health.  Dr. Lambert then said he invited the Minister to attend a dissemination event he held in April 2022 and subsequently wrote to the Minister to get an opportunity to present his data.  Did the Minister respond?</p></speech>

As I said, of the 1,000 the patients that I have seen, I would say that probably 20 of them needed pulmonary support in the short term, but 1,000 of them needed neurological support.  I am not saying that there is not a need for cardiac and pulmonary physicians in some cases.  I am saying that looking at the document, it states that tertiary-level care for neurorehabilitation is going to be part of the plan.  That should be prioritised as the number one issue.  The other support services are minor issues compared to the need to support-----</p></speech>

I wish to make a final point.  I agree with everything Dr. Lambert has said in his opening statement.  He has stated that the accumulating evidence is that the lungs and heart are healing but the brain is not healing.  That is substantially where the problem is.  Even though a lot of clinics are being set up, if they are not dealing with the neurological issues then we are not treating patients in the way that we should.  Dr. Lambert has also referenced referral pathways from GPs.  There is a huge amount that needs to be done there.  The statement that we received from the support group mentioned difficulties in accessing some of the clinics.  For example, patients in County Donegal have to go to Galway to access them.  If Dr. Lambert has had the opportunity to engage with the clinical lead, does the plan he wants to submit to the Minister include the provision of more clinics, as well as more of a focus on the neurological issues?</p></speech>

Looking at the network that has been established, I think the current clinics need to be repurposed.  If there are 5 million people in Ireland and 30% of them are affected by long Covid, it does not matter how many clinics we have at the Mater, St. James's or St. Vincent's hospitals.  They cannot all be managed there.  Guidance must be issued to the GPs.  Right now, the GPs are being faced with these patients and they are putting Band-Aids on the problem.  They are doing the best they can but it is quite complicated.  They need better guidance to be able to manage the patients locally.</p></speech>

First, I fully accept that we should not be dependent on Dr. Lambert giving us information on what is happening on an international basis in relation to prevalence.  Is he aware of any variation in prevalence relating to particular variants?  Is he seeing anything of that as of yet, or is it too soon?</p></speech>

We have gone through the B.1.1.7, Delta, Omicron, BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.4 variants.  Now BA.5 is the variant that is even more infectious.  It is surging again in other countries.  There are cases of it in Ireland.  I suspect that in a week or two we will see the BA.5 variant as being top of the list in terms of the virus that is responsible for the new surge.  The virus is not going to go away.  It looks like it is going to cycle three times a year and infect everyone.  It will not kill them as it was doing before, but it will still affect them.  There is a certain disability associated with it.</p></speech>

It could be that people who have pre-existing autoimmune diseases, immunological conditions or things that have not previously been diagnosed are predisposed to it.  Perfectly healthy people can catch long Covid, but there are certain predispositions to it.  They have not been well worked out but there is probably some kind of immune predisposition.  For example, with Covid, we must ask why it is that some 45-year-olds get a cold and others end up with lungs whited out.  It is an immunological response of the body to the Covid infection, both in the acute setting and chronically.</p></speech>

I believe that the pulmonary lead from Cork was the lead on the first draft of the interim guidelines, which were published in September 2021.  That doctor has now apparently resigned from being national clinical lead.  This is just what I have heard from other pulmonary colleagues.  The lead in that document dating back to September 2021 was a pulmonary doctor.</p></speech>

I am not part of decisions that are being made behind closed doors, or wherever they are being made.  As I said, I am here on the basis of the fact that I take care of patients.  I try to develop best practice and publish the results to influence changes that will help the patients.  That is the reason we are here today.

This is the first time that the committee has dealt with the issue.  I suspect it is an issue that we will be dealing with on further occasions.  I ask Dr. Lambert to excuse us if he feels we are trying to glean information from him.  That may be unfair.  On the HSE response to Covid and the decision to locate one post-acute clinic and one long Covid clinic in each hospital group, does it make sense to separate the two approaches to the condition?</p></speech>

As I said, the Covid virus does not recognise hospital groups, it recognises patients.  We need geographically located facilities to serve the patients.  Of course, the population is bigger in the Dublin area, but there is a population in Ireland of 5 million people.  The facilities should be located based on the prevalence of Covid, not on the presence of hospital groups.  I would not have done it in that way.</p></speech>

The title of my submission to the committee is the Establishment of a Long Covid Multidisciplinary Clinic and GP Support Network in Ireland.  I chose the title because we really should be working together.  We have separate clinics for pulmonary and infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital.  I tried to get the clinics amalgamated.  However, I have dialogue with my colleagues.  Pulmonary doctors have actually changed their practices, recognising the fact that many breathing problems that patients are having are centrally-driven, rather than investigating and spending a huge amount of money testing patients for a problem that is not in the lungs.</p></speech>

I am not saying that we need PET scans to diagnose long Covid.  I am just saying that in research studies conducted around the world, PET scans have shown that there are abnormalities and hypoperfusion defects in the brain of patients with long Covid.  The message is that many patients are being sent for CT and MRI scans, and the results are normal.  They are being told that there is nothing wrong with them and their scans are normal.  We do not have access to the PET scans that are picking up the abnormalities.</p></speech>

As I said, until now PET scans have had limited utility.  MRI and CT scans performed the functions required in most clinical conditions.  It made sense to have limited access to PET scans for clinical use.  It is the case that studies have been done internationally using the PET scans to identify the brain inflammation that long Covid patients have.</p></speech>

They provided the committee with a list of guidelines for GPs with long Covid patients.  Some countries are ahead.  I have taken a look at the French documents.  France is further ahead in terms of providing rehabilitation for patients with long Covid.  The UK was the first country to put together guidelines and a lot of the guidelines from Ireland have been based on the UK model.  However, it failed to update them.  No country is perfect.  France is a model of being ahead of the curve in managing patients with long Covid.</p></speech>

He addressed the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party at the outset of Covid.  It was a very stimulating conversation and I have kept pace with what he has been talking about since then.  He could to some degree be considered a voice in the wilderness.  Maybe that is a pain in the neck for some people but he is a challenging voice all the same.  The paper he has presented today is very stimulating.  As other Deputies have said, I can see us coming back to that.  I will not go over any of the questions that have been asked because Dr. Lambert answered them comprehensively.  What is a PET scan?</p></speech>

Certain products are injected into the person's veins and then it goes to the brain.  If there are abnormalities or inflammation, they will light up.  It is a radiological scan that is different from a CT scan and it is different technology from an MRI scan.  It is positive electron tomography.  It lights up a different level of inflammation compared to a CT or MRI scan.</p></speech>

Many of the protocols I have put together for long Covid patients are based on my experience there.  Johns Hopkins has done studies using PET scans on patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease, called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.  When PET scans were done on the brains of patients with chronic Lyme disease, the scans lit up the exact same abnormalities.  This is a study by Aucott <i>et al</i>in Johns Hopkins University's research centre.  There are similarities there and there are some abnormalities being picked up with ME as well.  I am not aware of PET scan abnormalities in ME but with long Covid and long Lyme there are many similarities on the PET scan radiographic appearances.</p></speech>

It is beginning to act now.  Do the Department, the Minister, the outgoing CMO or the clinical health leads have similar information at their disposal, arising out of studies similar to the ones Dr. Lambert has carried out in the Mater and including the same kind of cohort of about 1,000 people?</p></speech>

I am just wondering if there is any other university or faculty in a university hospital undertaking similar studies with the same significant number of people, around 1,000.

There is only other study I am aware of.  We shared some of our data from the long Covid clinic with Paddy Mallon's group in St. Vincent's.  We have a list of all our publications here that the Deputy can pick up later.  One of the publications listed there is a joint publication coming out of St. Vincent's and the Mater looking at symptoms of long Covid in patients who had persistent symptoms following the onset of Covid.  Based on my review of the literature, I believe our group has taken a special interest in this and did most of the work on it.  Most of the publications are coming from our cohort.</p></speech>

That would be the accurate way of finding out.  I did not want to state that we are managing the most patients but like I said, I suspect we are.  I currently run an extra clinic and stay until 6 o'clock on a Friday afternoon.  I have two research registrars that I pay for out of my research moneys to help me run the clinic.  I was basically told that if I was not being funded to run this clinic to close it down.  I thought about doing that but it would not be fair to the patients.  The best thing to do is see if I can move this forward proactively and become a part of the solution.</p></speech>

There is an informal network of people.  The reason I said I suspect we are is that we are quite busy.  We are getting lots of referrals in and have all along.

I am just probing it.  Clearly, Dr. Lambert is a significant player, so why are the authorities not taking on board his findings?  Why does he think they have been so slow?  These are pretty significant findings.  I have done some minor reading around some of the literature Dr. Lambert sent us, which is fascinating.  You would need another life to read it all.  Dr. Lambert presents the information really well and I thank him for that.  Is there a closed shop when it comes to dealing with Covid?

Infectious disease representation was not wanted on the committee.  I had this conversation in 2020 and I have text messages and emails about it.  I asked who the clinician was and was told it was Dr. Colm Henry.  I said that he is a great geriatrician but that this was an infectious disease emergency, not a geriatric emergency, and that an infectious disease specialist was needed on NPHET.  Sometimes there is a reluctance on the part of the Government to get the right people or expertise on the right committees.</p></speech>

As Deputy Shortall said, I can see us coming back to it.  What kind of treatment is taking place in the long-term Covid clinics that have been established?  What kinds of treatments would Dr. Lambert like to see where there may be gaps?  What kinds of outcomes would he expect from international research?  Some members of the public will be watching this now, may watch it later, or may read the transcript, and there will be reports of this meeting.  They will be quite anxious to hear that quite a substantial number of patients get long Covid and that there are a range of symptoms, from anxiety to long-term depression to fatigue.  What kinds of outcomes could be expected with treatment?</p></speech>

It appears to work on decreasing brain inflammation.  There is a number of other medicines that help with long Covid.  There are devices that help stimulate the vagus nerve that are used in neurorehabilitation.  The National Rehabilitation Centre deals with many people who have head injuries from car accidents and such.  There is inflammation in those cases.  The therapeutics of many of the lessons learned from managing patients with closed head injuries can be applied to treating patients with long Covid and, indeed, long Lyme disease.  We just need to do more research into this and have a think.  We can wait five years, until new data come along, or we can be pioneering and take the lead in terms of trying to support patients in Ireland who have this condition and get them back into the workplace.</p></speech>

Most people who will listen in today will say that contracting Covid has changed their lives, because of the legacy of Covid-19 and so forth.  That cohort of people, which is large, will want answers about how their lives have changed from contracting Covid and the legacy with regard to chronic fatigue and all of the symptoms that come with long Covid.  My first question is on the evolution of the virus.  There was a period, from around February 2020 to March 2021, where nobody was vaccinated.  Is there a correlation between the period when the vaccine was not readily available and those who contracted Covid-19 and have symptoms of long Covid to this day?</p></speech>

They do not prevent infection, but they prevent one from progressing to serious acute illness.  Vaccines are a good thing.  The question is of whether getting a vaccine will prevent one from getting long Covid.  The answer is that getting vaccinated has not really decreased the number of patients who are at risk from long Covid.  That is not the way these vaccines work.  If there is a benefit, it is minimal.  The only benefit of vaccines, which is important, is that they keep one from dying if one gets Covid.  They do not keep one from getting infected and they do not necessarily keep one from getting long Covid.</p></speech>

It sounds as though the initial evidence is quite good.  Will he elaborate on the evidence thus far on the pilot project?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lambert" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022070600002#F00900"><p>LDN has been used for many years.  There were studies done back in the days of HIV and AIDS, when there was no treatment for them.  A placebo-control trial to treat people with LDN or placebo showed that LDN improved the quality of life patients had left.  LDN does two things.  It seems to decrease inflammation and it also has some immune-modulating effect.  That is the second problem, which we have not even discussed, in terms of the problems with long Covid.  It is not just the brain inflammation.  Patients have some kind of immune damage.  They have some kind of immune exhaustion, as part of this process, as well.  LDN is focusing both on brain inflammation and an immune-modulatory effect.  Based on the pilot that I have done, the next thing to do is some kind of a placebo control trial in a bigger study and then cross people over from treatment to placebo after a few months, to do a definitive study.</p> <p>  The reality is that at present people are just following patients with long Covid and bringing them back every three months.  Some of them are just not getting better.  My approach is to look at the literature and see what early information there is in terms of what is helping patients with long Covid.  We now have this study published.  These are preliminary data, but LDN has been used in many other situations before and is a safe product to use.  The study that we did showed clinical benefit to patients who had been sick for 333 days, on average.  Within two months, they started to show improvement.  I think it is out there that this is something about which we should start thinking, rather than just continuing to follow patients every three months, draw research bloods on them and tell them to come back in three months.  We have to start some interventions or start piloting some interventions to support our patients in Ireland.</p></speech>

I see patients who get a tick-borne infection and are unwell with it years later.  I see farmers, forestry workers and people from all over Ireland who get bitten by a tick, get a short course of antibiotics and come to see me two years later with many of the same symptoms in illnesses.  There are other conditions.  The whole issue that is being brought up now is that there is a big population in Ireland of patients with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, ME.  I hypothesise that some kind of infection might have triggered this condition years ago that we have yet to identify.  Lyme disease is one of them.  There are other tick-borne infections and now we have long Covid.  No money goes into Lyme research.  I hope the money that goes into long Covid research will benefit patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, ME, fibromyalgia and Lyme disease.</p></speech>

Obviously, everybody is different.  My question may not be completely scientific, but what percentage of people have made a complete recovery from their symptoms of long Covid and are back to what they were prior to having contracted Covid-19?</p><p>What does recovery look like and what is the rate of recovery among the patients Dr. Lambert has seen?</p></speech>

One of my doctoral students, Dr. Brendan O'Kelly, who is in UCD's Newman fellowship and studying long Covid, took the lead in many of these publications.  We are in the process of studying 155 patients from a year ago.  We will do a follow-up evaluation to see what percentage of those 155 are back to normal and what percentage are still sick.  We will do repeat questionnaires with them.</p> <p>  The good news is that, while the rate is 30% after one year, it is less at 15 months and less again at 18 months, but there is still a population of patients who do not get better or they sort of get better and try to return to the workplace only to crash again, with a relapse of all their symptoms.  Covid-19 is a scary virus - it damages the brain and the immune system.  It is not just the common cold virus.  I continue to wear my mask.  I do not want to catch Covid myself.  I do not want to be out of work.  I continue encouraging people to take this virus seriously.  We are still learning about it and it is not going away.</p></speech>

I have been on Twitter saying that we should not keep announcing hospital and ICU admissions, but the percentage of patients with long Covid.  According to the publications that we have put together, approximately one third of patients still have significant symptoms after one year.  The number who cannot return to work with those symptoms is much less, but 1% to 5% of people are still disabled with long Covid after one year to the point that they are not able to function as they did prior to contracting the infection.  Probably everyone in Ireland has got Covid, with some having got it twice.  That is 5 million people.  Even if only 1% of those are at risk of getting long Covid, it is a large population of people who are being disabled by this virus.</p></speech>

We can tell clinically that the signs and symptoms are coming from the brain.  We hear about anosmia and the loss of taste.  Two years later, one of my colleagues still cannot taste or smell anything and does not drink Guinness because it used to taste good but now tastes like a septic tank.  Some people have been impacted in that way, but it is not just those nerves that are affected.  All of the nerves are.  I have people coming in with hoarseness, repeated coughing and swallowing problems in what is almost a stroke-type syndrome that persists for months.  Some patients recover and some do not.</p> <p>  Research studies in other countries have examined brains using PET scans, which have shown abnormalities &ndash; hypometabolism, lack of blood flow to areas of the brain that control the respiratory and pain centres, the vagus nerve, which controls blood pressure, heart rate and thermal regulation, tachycardia and bradycardia.  These are the symptoms with which patients with long Covid are presenting.</p></speech>

Those are the people with the most experience in brain injuries, which are the residual problems that most of these patients have.  Under the current plan, neurology is almost a tertiary-level problem while the first-level problems are pulmonary and cardiac, which are short term.  I only have a dozen people out of a thousand with heart and lung problems, yet a great deal of research has been done on those.  We must move the resources around.  My ideal programme would entail a neuro-rehabilitation specialist and a neurologist working in a multidisciplinary clinic with pulmonary doctors and infectious disease doctors and, given that it is a significant problem, a range of psychologists to provide support.  Psychology is under-resourced under the current plan.</p> <p>  If 30,000 people have long Covid, not all of them can come to these centres.  We need to set up a network of GPs with a special interest in long Covid who can be trained and given a partnership with centres to be able to manage patients locally.  Currently, patients are going to GPs and GPs are doing their best, but patients are just being put on heart medicines, brain medicines, migraine medicines, psychiatric medicines, pain medicines or nerve medicines.  I am seeing them coming to my clinic.  We need to give GPs guidance.</p> <p>  My ideal model would be a central neuro-rehabilitation clinic that supports the more complicated patients and is able to treat them based on what we know about brain injury.  We would also develop a network of GPs who can manage patients locally and call a friend or refer patients to the clinic when necessary.</p></speech>

Subsequently, when I looked at additional guidelines it said they were going to start up long Covid clinics in Galway, in Cork and in one other location in April 2022.

The research has identified that this process is not happening to the same degree as in the case of a person who has not had Covid or does not have any other medical condition.

Dr. Lambert has focused very much on the neurological side.  If there is a scenario of a lower intake of oxygen than normal, does this have a neurological effect and could that be tied into what Dr. Lambert is finding?</p></speech>

They say there is a difficulty with the oxygen transferring into the red blood cells.  This is how I understand it and I may be incorrect in my interpretation.  I understand this is then having a detrimental effect on people.  They seem to be saying that this is an issue that needs to be looked at - if the oxygen is not transferring in, how do we reverse that process so we can bring people back to taking in the normal amount of oxygen when they breathe in and out?</p></speech>

My opinion, based on taking care of 1,000 patients, is that this seems to be a minor problem.  We check their oxygen every time they come to the clinic.  I have not seen hypoxia to be a significant part of the thousands of patients with long Covid.</p></speech>

Would it be in everyone's interest to look at other jurisdictions and try to tie in all of the best information in order to get the best treatment plan for every patient who has long Covid?  This is why I asked Dr. Lambert about the GP issue.  They seem to be confused, at this stage, about how to manage their patients, how to refer them and which is the appropriate clinic to which to refer patients.  Would we all be better off if the people who are heading up the existing clinics could all co-ordinate and work on setting out the best way forward?  It would put everyone, including Dr. Lambert, in a stronger position.</p></speech>

Covid started in March 2020.  We are now in July 2022.  Lots of data have become available during this time period.  A lot of countries have taken these data on board and provided a service that really meets the needs of the people.  I believe that the patient group submitted a position paper on their issues.  They included those countries that have GP guidelines on how to manage long Covid, including France, Spain, Ontario in Canada, Wales and the UK.  These countries have guidelines for the GP management of long Covid patients.  Many countries are ahead of the curve in managing long Covid.  I am not here today to say "This is the way it should be".  My suggestion during last July and August was that we really must put the brain at the forefront of the management of long Covid.</p></speech>

I am too busy taking care of patients every day in the hospital, among other things.  Perhaps the committee could commission somebody to take a look this.  I do, however, go over to the UK and I have seen patients with long Covid over in the UK because I am Scotland-based as well as Dublin-based.  While the UK was good in putting together long Covid clinics early, they are based on the pulmonary and heart model.  I do not believe they have caught up as far as that goes.  If the Deputy was to ask, I would say that France is the better model at this time.</p><p>Ireland could be the best model if we take on board what we put together, are agile and make the changes we are supposed to based on new science.  We need greater GP involvement, more support for the psychiatric and psychological issues of patients and more support of neuropsychiatric issues.  In January 2021 it was first identified that the brain was really the focus.  Every week I learn more and more about the brain as published in the international medical literature.  We need to move some of our resources around and provide guidelines to support GPs to be able to manage these patients.</p></speech>

The additional information has been very useful.  People regularly contact us about long Covid.  People explain their symptoms and sometimes feel that they are not being believed and that it is in their head.  It is great to have this session today.</p> <p>  I am interested in how long Covid relates to workplace issues and how we might manage that.  Some workers were working on the front line during the pandemic.  Organisations such as the INMO have questioned whether it needs to be a workplace injury and dealt with under an occupational injury scheme.  At one point in the earlier days, nurses made up nearly one in ten of people contracting Covid.  With what we currently know about long Covid, how should we manage people in employment?  Some organisations are considering having long Covid policies.  Some advocacy groups have pointed out that people will be out of work for longer than expected and that supports, such as employment and income rights, and guarantee of medical care need to be made available.  What approach should we take to employees with long Covid in the workplace?  What supports need to be made available for that?</p></speech>

As I said, 20 staff members from Temple Street were referred by occupational health a number of months ago because they did not know what else to do.  They were seeing them but they were not getting better.  My understanding is that the UK decided to provide people with disabilities with support if they had occupationally acquired long Covid.  I heard recently that the benefits for long Covid patients would be taken away in Ireland.  I do not know if that is true or not.  I do not get involved in that.</p> <p>  It is like asking how long a piece of string is.  How long will long Covid go on?  None of us really knows.  Some patients are not recovering.  It is a real medical condition.  I get asked to fill out forms from patients who are not healthcare workers, from some of the insurance companies asking to justify them continuing to be off on sick leave.  It would be a good idea for us in Ireland to identify certain criteria for long Covid - because it overlaps with other conditions - to be identified as a condition worthy of patients getting benefits until they recover if they ever recover which is the challenge.  Most people do.  I do not want to be disheartening to people by suggesting they will not recover.  It is almost two and a half years since March 2020 and I am still seeing people who have not recovered.  Not everybody has responded to the treatments I have given.  It is a moving target to know how long long Covid will continue.</p> <p>  We need to support the patients because the patients I see are patients who have never missed a day of work and are not malingerers.  They cannot be mindful and get themselves better.  They cannot do grade exercises and get themselves better because they crash.  It does not work.  This is a different disease from any we have seen before.  It has similarities to other chronic conditions we have seen previously.  It is a new disease and we are continuing to learn.  We need to support the patients in whatever way we can by providing medical services and providing assurances that their livelihoods will not be taken away as a result of contracting life Covid.</p></speech>

Should that be considered?  People contract long Covid either because they were on the front line or otherwise.  Does Dr. Lambert believe it could be defined as a disability or will it be kept in a separate categorisation?</p></speech>

As I am a medical doctor, I do not get involved in those decisions.  I am always hopeful that my patients will improve.  Usually if people are pushed back into the workforce they crash and they are back to square one.  I always say if patients are improving, they really need six months of rehabilitation.  I keep on extending patients' time by six months.  In those six months some of them are ready to go back to work, which is really good news, but some of them are not.  It should not be a permanent condition because, as I said, it is an unknown entity.</p></speech>

Many services were under-resourced before the arrival of Covid.  Psychology and psychiatric services are an example and the same is true of community physiotherapy.  Access for patients is quite limited.  Patients are spending a lot of their own money.  They are going to clinics here, there and everywhere desperately trying to get help.  It is a challenge for patients with long Covid and it is even more of a challenge for those who cannot afford to access private care.</p></speech>

The scary thing is that we all know someone who has long Covid.</p><p>Yesterday, I spoke to a person whose symptom was really bad migraines.  The advice is to take more exercise but a woman told me that if she does extra ironing or anything like that, she is exhausted for about three days afterwards.  If a person with long Covid attends a special occasion such as a child's birthday party, he or she pays for it afterwards.  Is that a common pattern among people in that situation?</p></speech>

That was based on a particular study but, two years ago, the NICE guidelines debunked that study.  The NICE stated that it is a bad study and not to follow that advice because if those patients do graded exercise, they crash.  I always tell people that it is three steps forward and four steps back.  Half of the patients I see coming in have been told by GPs, occupational health or others to do graded exercise.  I send letters to those medical practitioners to ask them to look at the guidelines and update themselves on the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome as the treatment they are recommending does not work.  This is another issue.  It has less to do with brain neuroinflammation.  When people with these conditions push themselves, they get an almost immunological crash.  They just crash.  We do not know whether it is mitochondrial or immunological.  We are focusing today on neuroinflammation but there are other conditions that are caused by Covid.  Graded exercise does not work in such cases and should not be used.  We need physiotherapists and neurophysiotherapists to send the message for people to build up their immune system and be able to listen to their body so that they do not push themselves to the point of collapse, which is what is currently happening with many of the long Covid patients.</p></speech>

People have touched on that.  Dr. Lambert referred to PET scans.  I have had a PET scan and know the format of it.  If there is technology that can prove a person has a particular illness, that would be a significant psychological boost for him or her.  It would dispel the doubt in respect of whether they suffer from the illness.</p> <p>  Part of the challenge at the moment is that, as far as I am aware, there is no medical term for long Covid.  It is called different things in different countries.  Its generic name is long Covid but there is no agreement on what that exactly means.</p></speech>

One cannot do a PET scan on everybody with long Covid but if a well researched list of symptoms, such as contact with Covid, symptoms following the onset of Covid and a list of various symptoms, was established, that would be of benefit.  It would be useful to have a definition.  Some people call it long-haul Covid.  Some places say that if a patient has had if for more than one month, it is long Covid.  The standard is that if it persists for more than three months, it is long Covid.</p></speech>

Dr. Lambert mentioned mask-wearing.  A lot of the measures that were introduced seem to have been put aside.  Does part of the challenge involve the need for society to face up to the fact that Covid is going to be here for the long term?  Dr. Lambert mentioned the different variants, such as Omicron and its subvariants.  Clearly, it is getting better at evading our immune defences.  As Dr. Lambert stated, the vaccines do not stop the virus but they may save people's lives.</p> <p>  I know a person who has had Covid three times.  Is it possible to keep getting reinfected with Covid?  Is one of the dangers that the vaccine does not stop the virus and a person can keep getting infected?  Is it the case that every time a person gets the virus, it attacks the immune system and the immune system keeps going down?  Is the real worry that as we, as a society and the world, move on in future, all these different subvariants are getting better at evading things?  Unless we come up with solutions to these variants or suppress them, we are going to be facing a very bleak future.</p></speech>

Studies that have been done on the common cold virus, a coronavirus, indicate that people can catch three infections in one year.  The antibodies a person gets from a first infection do not protect him or her from a second or third infection.  This is not new information.  This virus is smarter than the original coronaviruses.  I do not think it will go away.</p> <p>  As regards the Chairman's comments in respect of it affecting the immune system, that is real.  When possible, I look at the lymphocytes or white cells of patients with long Covid.  Many of them have low lymphocytes.  If a person has the flu, his or her lymphocytes go low but when the person recovers from the flu, a week later the level is back to normal.  With some long Covid patients, however, my observation is that patients are taking an immune hit.  This needs to be published.  They are taking a hit on the brain and a hit on the immune system, even if it was just a mild Covid infection of the type that most people seem to be getting now.  People are not wearing masks; they are taking a chance and saying it is just the flu.  I disagree.  It is not the flu.  We should get the message out that people need to continue to be careful about catching it because the consequences of catching it are unknown.  Anecdotally, I have patients who appear to be immunocompromised as a function of getting long Covid.  I have given the committee the data on brain inflammation.  Will that be permanent?

It may be that certain patients are predisposed to having these kinds of problems.  Another issue is that one's immune system goes down and one gets reactivation of other infections.  Everybody has infections in their body.  Lots of patients get shingles after getting Covid.  Why do they suddenly get shingles?  Shingles appears in the setting of immune suppression.  My brother got Covid in January in America and he broke out in a painful rash on three parts of his body.  He sent me a picture of it and I told him he had shingles.  He thought it was his eczema.  Mulitdermatomal shingles only occurs in patients who have really low immune systems, such as cancer, transplant or AIDS patients.  We have a lot to learn about Covid and the public should be aware that for some patients, it is not just a simple flu virus.</p></speech>

Part of my protocol involves providing immune support as well as the anti-inflammatory support for the brain that LDN is providing.

At one time people talked about how it was perhaps linked to anaesthetic or whatever else or the illness itself.  Brain fog is not unusual for long-term illness, is it?</p></speech>

Like the Chair said, if one gets the flu, one can be very critically unwell.  However, two months later, almost everybody is recovered.  Very few people have persistent symptoms.  There are analogies.  After getting chemotherapy, some people have what is called &ldquo;chemo brain&rdquo;.  It has done some damage and they have persistent central nervous system, CNS, symptoms including brain fog in the long term.  There are analogies with other disease areas.  Lyme disease patients can have persistent symptoms years and years after they have been treated.  The issue is that we know it is causing this, but how do we reverse it?  That is the challenge.  Patients do not want to stay sick for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

It is important to have a centralised structure - that one-stop shop element, or whatever - where all the elements to treat an illness are in one particular area.  How important does Dr. Lambert consider that to be?  I know he is very keen for the GPs to have a role in this because not everyone can be brought into the two, three or four clinics that we will be establishing around the country.</p></speech>

These infections affect many different organ systems.  The issue is that I have letters of referral in for health care workers, for example, who have gone to cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonologists and gastroenterologists because all of their different organs have been affected.  They all have a solution that is putting a band-aid on that part of their body, but that is not the issue.  The issue is that we need to bring it all together.  The patients are not benefiting from shopping from one place to another and it is hugely expensive.  It is expensive if the State is paying for all these tests.  I can give the Chair reports of patients who have had probably &euro;3,000 worth of tests done and no findings.  Patients are sometimes paying for those tests out of pocket and sometimes they have been paid for by the Government.  We need to relook at our strategy going forward.  Things have changed since March 2020 when Covid came along.  We knew much in March 2021 about the effects on the brain.  Here we are in 2022 and we have to put together a new plan based on this new evidence, regroup and better engage the GPs and give them guidance on how to manage these patients.</p></speech>

It may knock them back for two or three days due to the journey, the time waiting, the time being seen and the time getting back.  Again, that is pattern that people are telling me about.  That is the big challenge they have.  The fact that no one is coming up with a solution that seems to be easing or resolving their symptoms is hugely frustrating as well.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Cathal Crowe and apologise for delaying him.</p></speech>

I apologise as I was in a meeting of the Oireachtas transport committee.  Many meetings run parallel here.  I read Dr. Lambert&rsquo;s opening statement and I have been following some of the debate from my office upstairs.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Some of Dr. Lambert&rsquo;s counterparts, for example, The Ohio State University, used baseline information that they had on elite athletes.  Unlike most of the population, they are, probably on a weekly basis, checked for lung and heart capacity and regularly give blood samples.  They are very healthy people in general with a load of baseline information that can be looked at.  In particular &ndash; this was picked up in some of the Irish papers last year &ndash; they looked at 26 university level athletes, all elite, who had Covid, but four of them came out of Covid with myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, scarring of the lungs and damage that will probably or possibly remain with them for a long time.  In Ireland, in the past decade or two, we have also built up a kind of a capacity of screening our elite athletes.  Has any analysis been done of them in terms of knowing where their baseline health was at and where they are at coming out of Covid perhaps?</p></speech>

However, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I took care of all of the first cases of Covid at the Mater hospital, because they all went to the Mater originally.  Many of my consultants had what looked like very serious lung and heart damage and even abnormalities in the brain.  Everything healed in the heart and lungs.  I had non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, referred up from Cork with ejection fractions of 40%, which is bad.  It means heart failure.  People aged around 65 or 70 have that.  However, within two months, it went back to normal.  Most of the pulmonary findings show that those abnormalities healed with time.  I was totally off base in March 2020 thinking that the focus would be the heart and lungs.  I am not saying that some patients do not still have heart and lung problems.  However, that number is very small.  We still need to kind of continue to follow these patients longitudinally to see what will happen long term.</p></speech>

I think the first real insight we had behind the scenes in Ireland was an &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; special that went in behind the hospital scenes in Ireland and we could see the huge strain and stress on the front-line healthcare professionals.  That gulping for air image will haunt many of us for a long time.  Is that still a feature of the new variants?  Is long Covid less often an outcome of these new variants?  Are those we would classify as having long Covid mostly from the first iterations from the virus?</p></speech>

Has he seen anyone recover to a high level from long Covid?  I know the whole idea is that this remains and lingers.  However, surely some people have had a pretty good recovery pathway months and months after carrying this long Covid virus.</p></speech>

That is kind of the message.  Our data showed that in our clinic, of patients who were followed up with, 30% still had significant symptoms at one year.  However, with time, they improved.  The percentage of people who have severe symptoms, such as not being able to get out of bed, concentrate, focus or go to work, is a small number and it drops with time.  Still, I have some patients in my long Covid clinic who were infected in March and April of 2020 and they are still incapacitated.  They are showing some improvements, but not to the point they can return to usual activities.  This is a new virus that we are still learning about.  We need longitudinal studies, but we also need to find ways to support patients to speed up their recovery.</p></speech>

That is where most of those who get Covid find themselves.  I had it in March and, sure enough, on day nine or ten, my antigen tests were becoming negative, my energy levels were up and I was able to get back to some bit of normality.</p> <p>  Dr. Lambert may not have the answer to my question about those in the minority situation with long Covid.  They are believed by everyone in the medical body and profession.  However, more importantly, are they fully believed by their employers and screening bodies such as Medmark that employers would refer them to?  Is that an issue for some of these people?</p></speech>

I can just give the Deputy anecdotal comments from patients who have come to see me.</p><p>In my experience, the occupational health departments in the hospitals have been more supportive.  These are patients who were infected in the workplace.  I send letters to the occupational health doctors in the hospitals when they refer patients to me.  If people are infected in the community and have private insurance, they will get different benefits and there are different pressures from their employers to get them back to work.  There may be less occupational health support in some of the private networks and hospitals for these patients because some of them have not got better two years into their long Covid.</p></speech>

People just quit using masks.  We went too quickly to that.  It will be very difficult to get people to go back to using masks again.  I continue to use a mask, but I seem to be one out of 100 in the airport and one out of ten on public transportation doing that.  The message is that Covid is not going to go away.  It may not kill a person anymore, which is good, but I have so many people out of work, and that has an impact on people's jobs and employers.  It has an impact on healthcare workers.  We have had to cut back on many of our services in the hospital because some of our staff continue to catch Covid despite the fact that they wear masks at work.  They are catching it in the community.  Covid is not going to go away.  I do not want to catch Covid.  I do not want to be off work and I do not want to infect my family.  As a result, in certain situations I continue to use a mask.  That is just common sense.  We should be pushing that with the Irish public because we are going to see another wave and another one.  We need to find some way besides vaccines to get on with life safely.</p></speech>

I was on the train up from Limerick this morning and that is what I saw in shops, on public transport and so on.  The worry we all have is that if we end up in a particularly serious situation again in the winter, how to flip that on its head again in order to ensure public buy-in.  I do not know if we will ever get that buy-in again.  Most people have been through this and do not want to go through it again.  I am not talking about the virus but about the social response.  We had everyone on board in March and April of 2020 but it is the opposite now.  I thank Dr. Lambert for everything he is doing.  I apologise again for being late to the meeting.</p></speech>

Others are terrified that if they get Covid again, they will be back in that cycle.  Is that the pattern Dr. Lambert has seen emerge with many of those patients, or do patients recover and move on?  Is there any evidence on that?</p></speech>

However, taking a vaccine every three to four months for the rest of your life is not a sustainable strategy.  There are new vaccines coming along that are not mRNA vaccines but protein vaccines, similar to the flu vaccine that people get once a year.  Technology is developing.  I would push for populations that are severely immunocompromised, people who would die if they got Covid, to continue to get the mRNA vaccines.  For the rest of the population we need to look a new solution, namely, better quality and new generation vaccines.  Vaccines are important but they do not prevent people catching infection.  We need to get back to face masks and prevention through the other mitigation strategies we are tired of hearing about for the last two years.  We are in a new place.  We need to find a way to live safely with Covid.  I will not comment on whether vaccines are dangerous.  Vaccines are important but some people have adverse reactions, so it is a balancing act.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an siopa ar oscailt agus ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge &oacute; shin i leith.  Is ann don siopa f&oacute;s a bhu&iacute; le Conradh na Gaeilge, a sheasann an f&oacute;d ar son an tsiopa agus a chuireann an t-ionad ar f&aacute;il.  Ceapadh mise sa r&oacute;l seo in 2018.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12022070600002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to speak before it on the topic of encouraging the publication and reading of Irish language material.  As a bookshop, we will try to describe some of the issues which affect us and therefore the wider trade in stocking books in the Irish language.  In Dublin, there are very few bookshops that devote more than a shelf or two to Irish language books.  Ourselves and An Siopa Leabhar on Harcourt Street have a larger range than most.  Why is this?  Most bookshops have a very small surface area and must maximise sales per square foot.  Devoting a percentage of this space to Irish language books is a risk that some of these shops are not willing to take as the returns from sales may not materialise.</p> <p>  The next issue is supply.  Most books in the Irish language are distributed by &Aacute;is&iacute;neacht D&aacute;ileach&aacute;in Leabhar, &Aacute;IS, which does an admirable job in supplying the trade and beyond with Irish language books.  However, ordering can only be done by email and telephone.  The industry standard is to use teleorder, an electronic ordering system which uses sales or databases used by bookshops.  Not using this standard makes it time consuming for the bookshop to place orders as the data has to be transferred from the catalogue to email or even to read out over the phone.</p><p>It is just time-consuming for people to place orders and we are all pressed for time.  As was mentioned before, &Aacute;is also does not have a searchable website through which orders can be made.  That is one of the more important things it could do.<br/><br/>The international standard for the identification of books is the International Standard Book Number, ISBN.  It is essentially a product identifier used by publishers, booksellers, libraries, Internet retailers and other supply chain participants for ordering, listing, sales records and stock control purposes.  The ISBN identifies the registrant as well as the specific title, edition and format.  Not all Irish book publishers conform to this standard, which causes issues in reordering and selling of books through electronic point of sale systems.  Wholesale adoption of this standard would make it easier to reorder and identify sales.<br/><br/>There is vibrant and active publishing in the Irish language.  It is concentrated on children's publishing in the main, then on Irish learning products and then on adult publishing.  There appears to be a gap in publishing for those over the age of 10 with little being published for teenagers and young adults.  The teenage and young adult market is one of the strongest growing and, in some ways, bravest parts of English language publishing.  It tackles complex societal issues that are not tackled through the mainstream educational system.  Adult publishing is also not diverse enough.  There is a lot of poetry but fewer new fiction voices.  Investment to help publishers market, design and commission new work is necessary, as is support for the writers who choose to write in Irish.  Cover design in Irish language publishing has been poor but is improving.  It needs to appeal to a more visually conscious younger audience.<br/><br/>Some of the most successful books over recent years have been accounts of the joys of learning Irish and books telling of the influence Irish has had on the English language.  All of these books were written in English but never translated into Irish.  <i>Motherfocl&oacute;ir</i>is an example.  Established publishers in English, including Penguin Ireland, Hachette Ireland, HarperCollins and Gill Books, need to be encouraged to produce books in Irish as part of their offer and encouraged to do translations.  Some Irish publishers have produced fine translations of novels in English, French and numerous other languages.  This in one way to allow readers to experience the familiar in the unfamiliar.  Co-ordination is needed between curriculum developers and publishers to update the curriculum to keep it relevant.  Some texts have been on the curriculum for 20 years, for example, <i>Cith is Deal&aacute;n</i>.  It is a wonderful book but I used it in school in 1979 and I do not know if it has any relevance to children today.<br/><br/>Irish language novels should be submitted for international awards to raise the profile of the language.  We seem not to celebrate these writers by bringing them to a much wider audience outside of this country.  Considering the amount of space given to books in English in all media including print, television and radio, the amount given to books in Irish seems minimal.  It feels ghettoised, with the main review coverage in <i>Comhar</i>and once a year in <i>Books Ireland</i>towards the end of the year.  That is the limit of the review coverage of Irish language books.  National newspapers do not review Irish language books as often as they should.  Neither does TV or radio.  TG4's last books programme was in 2018.  Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta has some but not many.  The last local radio station coverage I know of was a show on Donegal's Ocean FM, &quot;Duilleoga&quot;, in 2019.  That was the only one I could see in recent years.  We also need to encourage the use of TikTok, Instagram and so on to promote the books to a younger audience.  Having looked at the Seachtain na Gaeilge website, it seems that it is primarily concerned with the spoken language.  The website does not celebrate the written word at all, with the exception of a paragraph saying that we have a long and glorious tradition of writing in Ireland.  Irish language publishing is active and vibrant but suffers from a lack of visibility in shops and libraries.  There is no reason that this cannot be reversed through a more dynamic relationship between the shops, publishers and libraries.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; fite fuaite i ngach rud a dh&eacute;anaimid agus in&aacute;r n-obair laeth&uacute;il.  Is &eacute; slu&aacute;n &aacute;r ngn&oacute;lachta "leabhair do chuile mheabhair".  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin os cionn an dorais nuair at&aacute; t&uacute; ag teacht isteach sa siopa.  Cloistear comhr&aacute; Gaeilge sa siopa gach l&aacute;.</p> <p>  Sna 1950id&iacute;, thosaigh muid ag easp&oacute;rt&aacute;il.  Chuir muid roinnt catal&oacute;g le ch&eacute;ile ag an am sin agus iad ar fad i nGaeilge.  &Oacute; shin i leith, t&aacute; daoine thar lear ag lorg leabhair i nGaeilge.  Mh&eacute;adaigh an saghas gn&oacute; sin nuair a thosaigh muid ag taistil do na St&aacute;it Aontaithe sna 1960id&iacute; ag tabhairt cuairt ar leabharlanna agus ollscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re sin agus go h&aacute;irithe nuair a chuaigh muid ar an Idirl&iacute;on.  Ceathracha bliain &oacute; shin, toghadh muid mar phr&iacute;omhshol&aacute;thr&oacute;ir leabhar Gaeilge agus leabhar B&eacute;arla don Library of Congress i Washington, an leabharlann is m&oacute; ar domhan.  Thosaigh muid an rud c&eacute;anna in an-chuid de na pr&iacute;omh-ollscoileanna sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe tr&iacute; na blianta, Notre Dame agus Harvard ina measc.  Mar gheall air seo, chruthaigh muid margadh t&aacute;bhachtach do leabhair Ghaeilge sna hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; seo agus i measc daoine pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha thar lear freisin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc againn an l&iacute;on leabharlann agus institi&uacute;id&iacute; seo a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.</p> <p>  In 1994, thosaigh muid ag d&iacute;ol ar l&iacute;ne.  Is muidne an siopa leabhar is faide ar an Idirl&iacute;on ar domhan.  Anuraidh, sheol muid leabhair chuig 160 t&iacute;r difri&uacute;la ar fud an domhain.  In&aacute;r siopa i nGaillimh, t&aacute; thart ar 25,000 leabhar Gaeilge ar d&iacute;ol.  Ina measc sin, t&aacute; seanleabhair, leabhair &aacute;thl&aacute;imhe agus leabhair nua.  T&aacute; seans ann go bhfuil an baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n is m&oacute; leabhar Gaeilge ar d&iacute;ol sa domhan againn.  Gach bliain, d&iacute;olaimid na m&iacute;lte leabhar Gaeilge do chustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; in &Eacute;irinn agus thar lear sa siopa agus ar l&iacute;ne.  In&aacute;r dtuairim, t&aacute; a l&aacute;n deiseanna ann n&iacute;os m&oacute; leabhar Gaeilge a dh&iacute;ol ach t&aacute; a l&aacute;n fadhbanna ag spreagadh muid &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh go h&eacute;ifeachtach.  T&aacute; mo dhearth&aacute;ir, Tom&aacute;s Kenny, chun caint leis an gcoiste faoi seo anois.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12022070600002#C00400"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an chuiridh seo.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm go mbeidh m&eacute; ag caint i mB&eacute;arla because this is something I am very passionate about and I would not be able to get my point across as eloquently in Irish.  I have been selling books in Kenny's for 21 years.  There are effectively three parts to the puzzle.  There is the publishing of the book, its distribution and marketing and its sale.  I will talk a little bit about each of the three.</p> <p>  There is very good State funding for publishers and there is an awful lot of books published in Irish.  It is almost comparable to the number of books published in English on the island, which is remarkable given the relative size of the two readerships.  However, there are issues with what is published.  To echo what everyone has said thus far, that fact that some publishers do not use ISBNs is a nightmare because this does not allow books to be inputted into book databases and the point of sale systems that nearly every bookshop in the world uses.</p><p>It just makes it awkward and more difficult for anyone to stock.  The books are generally more expensive than their English counterparts of the same size.  As Liam Donnelly has said, the design, the quality of the paper and the number of illustrations are to a lower standard than one would find in comparable English-language publications.  I suspect the reason for that is it is an awful lot cheaper to publish the way it is being published, because, in all too many cases, the publishers do not think they have a saleable product and do not particularly care about selling it.  It is more about getting the item published than it is anything beyond that.</p><p> Distribution is a very big issue.  &Aacute;IS's IT system is extremely poor.  It has a wonderful staff who do what they can.  It has moved very recently and has a better-functioning warehouse.  I would say it has moved from one old software system to a new software system and all of its data is corrupted.  The reason it does not have a searchable database - it has sent me a list of every book it has in stock &ndash; is it does not know what it has in stock.  For example, in the &ldquo;Title&rdquo; column, it has authors, ISBNs or data publication, which is a nightmare.  You cannot look through it.</p><p> For us, and for others, we want a scenario such as the Easons or Amazon websites where they have the books for sale.  It cannot be for sale if there is no database to work from.  There are approximately 6,000 books in &Aacute;IS at present.  We have approximately 1,800 of those on the site, because that is all we could extract from the data that it sent us, which is shockingly poor, but it is not a particularly difficult problem to solve.  We deal with millions of books, had this issue and solved it in months.  I do not see any reason it could not be improved with a bit more help for &Aacute;IS.</p><p> With regard to sale of the book, Futa Fata is the only Irish-language publisher in the country which operates outside of this &Aacute;IS system and it has a sales representative which is not directly linked with &Aacute;IS.  I get information about everything that Futa Fata publishes.  We stock virtually everything that it publishes.  Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in comes into me to tell me what Futa Fata is publishing.  With the exception of Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in, in 21 years I have not once had a publisher come in to me to tell me what it has for sale, what it can sell, how it can do it, that it could bring in an author etc.  There is not one day goes by that I do not have an English-language publisher come into us with regard to what it can do, how it can do it or to ask how it can improve.  There is a complete and utter lack of interest or effort from Irish-language publishers to get their books to a readership.  We have been lead to believe in our conversations that, effectively, they see us as a threat to a direct sale through them.  If we are based in Galway and they are based 20 miles away and we sell a book in our shop, they consider it a sale that could have gone to them.</p><p> In a similar sense, the discounts that Irish-language publishers offer, which are standard and have not changed in 30 or 40 years, are a little over half of what we would get from English-language publishers.  The bookshops that the committee has here today are all ideologically driven towards having Irish-language books, but if a bookshop is not so driven or is in a county that might not be traditionally considered a hotbed of Gaeltacht activity, there is no reason for it to stock these books.  They cost more, sell less and the shop gets less margin on each book sold.  There is no incentive whatsoever.</p><p> At the moment, all of the incentive is driven towards the publishers to publish the books.  I have no issue with that.  It is as it should be.  There is some effort going towards helping &Aacute;IS, but not enough.  It is effectively operating a 1970s or 1980s model in a digital world.  There are absolutely no resources whatsoever towards bookshops to bring in authors or to have events.  I suspect that the lack comes both from the State and the publishers themselves.</p><p> In the past three years, we have sold Irish-language books to 29 different countries and to every single county on the island.  There is an untapped market for these books that is untapped, but the current system puts obstacles to selling them in our way, instead of solutions.  If I can in any way facilitate a change in this or a solution, I am happy to offer any help I can.</p></speech>

Five major publishers run it.  They give the same discounts, returns terms and price increases.  I can almost guarantee the price will increase by 5% every January.  We left the textbook business 35 years ago, but I have experienced, when working with Easons and running its textbook division, that the same problems occur all of the time.  The cartel - I am sorry to say - I think is between Gill, CJ Fallon, Edco and Folens.  There is another one I have forgotten.  They run it the same way.  There are price increases every year.  They change their text books every two or three years, sometimes as a basis of curriculum change, but often not.  Sometimes, it is just because they can.  I have never understood why they were allowed to run it like this.<br/><br/>Easons, to be fair, is the main supplier of textbooks in the country.  Most bookshops cannot afford to do them.  The discount is 25%.  There is a 5% returns cap, which means that if one buys &euro;100 worth of books and sell &euro;50 worth, one can only return 5% and is still stuck with 50%.  One has &euro;45 worth of books in the shop that one can never sell.  The publishers might change the following year and the textbook will be different.  They run it that way and it is very difficult to make money.  Easons is the only one that has really made a good fist of it.  Some small shops are able to do it and, certainly, <i>textbooks.ie</i>has done a fantastic job of it online.  However, the changing over of textbooks is a real issue, not just in Irish.  It does not matter what the subject is.  That is probably beyond the purview of this committee.  I find it problematic how those publishers run their business.<br/><br/>Every bookshop has stock sitting on the shelf for years.  With regard to Irish books, we never return books to the Irish publishers, especially not to &Aacute;IS.  We buy them and we have them.  After two or three years, accounting wise, they mean nothing.  They have been written off.  I would sell them off cheap and get in new books.  We will price promote to sell the stock on.  Eventually, you will find it for &euro;1 in a bargain bin.  It will go and we will never buy it again.  We might not be able to identify it, of course, because it would not have an ISBN, but we can then buy fresh stock.<br/><br/>We will always keep our core Irish stock in place.</p><p>Some books of poetry by obscure poets, or very badly-produced books, just die.  The good ones, however, keep on selling, which is always encouraging.  The reason we stock the books is that they are good, especially in children's publishing.  It is fantastic.  Futa Fata does fantastic work.  Many of the mainstream Irish publishers, such as Gill, do some great books as Gaeilge, which we never return.  However, there is a real issue in adult publishing with bad books that people do not want to buy but we buy them because we do not know.  We have never read them.  We do not get a chance to read every book.  One has to make a judgment and we buy one or two.  If they do not sell, they do not sell.</p><p> We do not sell e-books.  That is not our business.  We are in the physical domain.  However, it is a cost issue for a publisher.  Producing a CD is very expensive.  Possibly the best avenue for publishers to release their material is through Audible or on the Internet, in order that it can be downloaded onto a USB stick, but not as a physical CD.  It is just too expensive to do it.  As Gr&aacute;inne N&iacute; Mhuilneoir said, many of the translations that are coming up are done by robots.</p><p> It is like many Irish texts one will find on the Internet if one looks for obscure, old Irish texts.  They are produced by photocopying machines.  They are terrible and they do the book industry a disservice.  It is very important that they should be produced and people should be assisted in providing the readers and making it happen, but not as a physical CD.  They should be produced via Audible, or through an Irish-language service for books as Gaeilge, in order that they do not get lost in the morass of English.</p></speech>

From an Irish-language point of view, as well as a problem with education textbooks, regular fiction books on the curriculum are quite often not in print.  When I was doing my leaving certificate, we did <i>Scothsc&eacute;alta</i>by P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire.  There was a P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire statue on Eyre Square, there still is kind of, and busloads of American tourists used to come in to say that their grandfather had read P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire and to ask to buy it.  I would say that all of my classmates wanted to buy it and cannot find it.  I remember that &Aacute;IS rang me.  I used to ring &Aacute;IS, because I did not know who had published it originally to ask if someone could reprint it, that we could sell loads.  Approximately two or three years later, I got a phone call to say it had found two pallettes of Scothsc&eacute;alta down the back that nobody had realised were there.  It is funny in a way, but it also goes back to what we are dealing with.  It is the case across the board.  Most of the top 20, 40 or 50 books in Irish, in the history of the Irish language, are not in print.  If one wants to come into buy a classic, it is difficult.  I am straying from the Cathaoirleach's question.<br/><br/>We do not deal with the e-book market.  I have no idea what the costs are.  There is obviously a cost involved with transferring it.  We sell CDs.  We obviously have nothing to do with Audible, or whatever, which is how most people would access audiobooks.  However, there is a market because much Irish-language reading that we encounter is aspirational in many respects.  Many people read aspirational audiobooks on long commutes, such as that difficult science book I will never read.  I imagine the same applies to Irish, but that is only a personal opinion.<br/><br/>In terms of stock on shelves, we have many leabhair Ghaeilge.  We have second-hand, rare and new books.  We have multiple copies of 80% to 90% of the books that were ever published.  I was saying to Gr&aacute;inne N&iacute; Mhuilneoir before we began, that we had Conradh na Gaeilge pamphlets from 1899, 1900 and 1901 that my grandad bought when Conradh na Gaeilge moved its shop on O'Connell Street in the 1970s.  We still have them 55 years later, but he probably thought it was a fantastic deal.  We would never get rid of or return them or return them because it as an ideological point.  It is also a point of difference, to be perfectly honest, from a commercial point of view.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  There are very few people who sell books in Irish.  It is good to do so because it brings people in the door.  There is a market there, even if people are not always aware of it.</p></speech>

The English-language publishers come into us to talk about their big titles that are up and coming for the coming season.  We will look at the ones we think will sell well and buy them into the shop.  We will work with the publishers to do promotions on some of those titles and to get some of the authors to come into the shop to do readings, interviews and signings.</p><p>We put videos up on our Youtube channel and put promotions for titles and authors on our social media.  We might send a press release to try to get an interview with the author on local radio.  All of that puts it to the forefront of the general public.  If the authors and publishers also contribute to that and do a marketing campaign, like the English language publishers do for all their titles, with interviews on national radio and with local media, that gets the books out into the media and onto social media, where a younger audience will view them.  That would do a huge amount.  None of that happens at the moment because we are not getting the engagement directly from the publishers as the incentive is not there for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12022070600002#G00200"><p>Far greater penetration into <i>The Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, TG4 or whatever is pointless if people cannot access the book after the fact.  That is part of the problem now because we are all at a loss as to knowing what is being published.  There is no point in TG4 having a new show unless the distribution side of it is fixed.  Sarah Kenny is absolutely right.  There are definitely possibilities.  <i>Madame Lazare</i>by Tadhg Mac Dhonnag&aacute;in won an EU prize.  That was published a year ago and won an EU prize for literature for the island of Ireland.  We were offered funding by that EU prize to put on an event and do marketing around it.  We have never, in 82 years, been approached by anybody in Ireland to do anything like that about Irish language books, whereas we have for English language ones.  It took an EU organisation to look to fund it in any way, shape or form.  Nobody is looking for handouts or anything like that but there is a recognition in English language poetry, for example, that it is not necessarily viable commercially and yet there are poetry readings everywhere because they are funded, rightfully, by the Arts Council.  The same is not true in an Irish language capacity, despite there being people out there who are willing, capable and able to do it.<br/><br/>There is a way forward for audiobooks.  The best way of spreading Irish might be podcasting as much as anything else.  I know we are talking about publishing and books but that is the way most people consume their media now, certainly for my age bracket and all my friends and family.  There are possibilities there.  The one thing there is no lack of is the actual creation itself.  There is so much material there to sell and to have and there are immensely talented people doing it on the writing and the publishing side.  The will is there from everybody, from &Aacute;is to Foras na Gaeilge, but as I said earlier, it is an analogue model in a digital world.  Hopefully that might change over time.</p></speech>

If we were to get to the stage where that was done right and increased demand, visibility and awareness, I would have thought more people would inherently want to engage with the product.  If that is grown, more people will, within the context we are operating in now, want to engage with it electronically, whether that is via their tablet or their audiobook. T&aacute; c&uacute;pla c&eacute;im ann le r&eacute;iteach.  N&iacute;or mhaith leis na finn&eacute;ithe go r&eacute;iteofar an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im, at&aacute; leagtha amach ag Sarah &oacute; thaobh na bhfoilsitheoir&iacute; de, agus cine&aacute;l borradh a bheith ann f&aacute; choinne r&aacute;chairte ach nach mbeadh na h&aacute;iseanna ann.

We are bookshops and then there are publishers and writers.  All feed off each other.  The disconnect, as Sarah rightly said, is in the fact that there is a lack of engagement from Irish language publishers with the physical shops.  Previously, &Aacute;is had the best representative in the world but he retired and since then &Aacute;is has communicated only by email.  &Aacute;is as an organisation and distributor does not communicate with us except by email.  There is no physical person there.</p></speech>

Some have four or five.  Penguin Ireland has five representatives and HarperCollins has three.  Hachette has three, with two more sitting in the offices as support.  &Aacute;is does not have the support.  &Aacute;is is only a distributor but it communicates most with us.  The individual publishers do not communicate with us.  The most successful event I have ever done with an Irish language publisher was with Futa Fata.  Its representatives were willing to come from Galway to do an Irish language event for children.  It was fantastic because they came but it is expensive for a publisher to decant five or six people.  This is simply about being in the shop and celebrating a book, not anything else.  Decanting four or five people from Galway to Dublin for the day and back is an expense and small publishers cannot afford to do it.  Big English and Irish publishers can but it is difficult for the smaller ones.  That is a very simple form of marketing without involving newspapers and stuff like that.  It is about getting to the bookshop with an author and celebrating the book.  That is an expense and some way or other English publishers are able to absorb that expense and make it an easy thing for them to do.</p> <p>  As Sarah Kenny rightly said, Irish language publishers do not engage enough with the bookshops.  If somebody came to me with a fantastic author and asked me to do an event, I would do it straight off.  That is a simple form of marketing.  Besides national press, radio, television and all that other stuff, having the actual physical body in the shop is the most important thing.  The publishers are not going to bring authors to me.  Every day I get requests from UK and Irish publishers in English to say they have somebody coming over and asking if we could we have an event.  We have three events a week launching books or celebrating them - it does not really matter what the event is - but they are all in English.  The one time I worked with Futa Fata, which was five years ago, it was fantastic.  We had 60 children and it was just brilliant.  It was a celebration of a book.  Since then there has been nothing.  It has been radio silence.  That is because they are either afraid or they do not want to spend a little bit of money.  Maybe that is something we could do.</p> <p>  With regard to overall marketing, even a poster in a window of a shop helps.  I have never had one from anybody except Futa Fata.  A simple poster in a shop window does wonders.  It is the simplest form or marketing.  People walk by and see it.  This is something I have never understood.  &Aacute;is could produce them but it does not.  The publishers are responsible for doing that.  They could even send me a PDF and I would pay for the poster but it does not happen.  I find it odd.</p> <p>  With regard to audiobooks, it needs to be an ecosystem.  It has to be encouraged somehow to get people to read the books and record them.  It is not an expensive process; it just takes time.  It takes 15 hours to read a book into a microphone and then it can be distributed all over the world but it is about getting people to do it, getting the right books and finding the right reader.  The reader is the most important thing.  If the book was read by me everybody would fall asleep but if it was read by someone who can engage properly in the language it would be fantastic.</p><p>However, that does not happen.  It is not our purview as booksellers but it is something the publishers could look at or club together to do.  A recording studio does not cost that much for 15 hours.  It is just a case of finding the right reader and the right book and using their skills, if they have them, in publicity to show people that it is out there.  As Gr&aacute;&iacute;nne N&iacute; Mhuilneoir said, you cannot find them if you go looking for them.</p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to seek the approval of the select committee to reallocate &euro;30 million in savings from subhead D3, which relates to the national broadband plan, to subhead B13, which relates to emergency generation capacity.</p> <p>  On 7 June 2022, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure around 450 MW of additional generation capacity for winter 2023-24 through to winter 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  In order for EirGrid to be able comply with this direction in the next few weeks, financial support needs to be provided by my Department to the company.  Legislation to ensure that EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for my Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas yesterday and is expected to be signed into law by the President in the coming days.</p> <p>  The level of financial support required in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and ensure that they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;350 million.  As the final level of financial support required this year will not be fully known until later in the summer when all the contractual arrangements in place, it has been agreed that approval of the allocation of funding for the emergency generation capacity will be requested in two tranches, namely, the current allocation request of &euro;200 million and a subsequent request later in the year for approval of the balance of the funding to be allocated.  The second Supplementary Estimate to be provided later this year will take account of the final agreed figures for the purchase and installation of the equipment and any further savings arising in my Department based on projected year-end expenditure.</p><p>As I mentioned, the overall purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;200 million to a new subhead B13, in the energy transformation programme, to fund the purchase by EirGrid of additional emergency generation capacity.  The &euro;200 million being allocated is comprised of &euro;110 million in additional funding from the Exchequer and &euro;90 million from a reallocation of savings within my Department.  Some &euro;30 million is being reallocated from savings on subhead D3, which is the national broadband plan, and &euro;60 million is from forecasted capital underspend in the energy transformation programme.</p><p> My Department has agreed an updated interim remedial plan with National Broadband Ireland to take account of the knock-on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the programme.  Under this plan, the revised target has reduced from 130,000 to 102,000 premises to be passed by the end of January 2023.  This has resulted in reduced 2022 projected expenditure with a mid-term forecast of &euro;30 million in underspending at the end of the year.  It remains the ambition of the Government to roll out the national broadband plan State-led intervention as quickly as possible in all areas.  To achieve this, National Broadband Ireland will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track.</p><p> Following the announcement by Government earlier this year of an enhanced package of measures to support the uptake of home energy upgrades, demand for the SEAI residential energy efficiency schemes has been strong, with double the number of applications seen in 2021.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications will result in high levels of delivery for the remainder of the year.  However, indicative mid-year results from the SEAI show a forecasted underspend at the end of the year on the one-stop shop and community energy schemes.  While the targeted number of houses will be started in 2022, it is anticipated that not all of these will be completed and certified for payment this year due to supply chain constraints.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications in 2022 will result in strong levels of delivery next year.</p><p> The &euro;400 million allocated to the electricity credit included a contingency to cover the possible cost arising from growth in the number of domestic household accounts in excess of the original 2.15 million forecast.  The final cost of the electricity credit was just under &euro;380 million, leaving a saving of &euro;20 million to be reallocated to the emergency generation capacity subhead.  I am happy to take questions from the committee on this Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

There is something Orwellian about the term "savings" here.  They are missed targets in the national broadband plan and retrofitting.  We were told that carbon taxes would be ring-fenced to retrofit homes and protect people from fuel poverty.  That carbon tax is being siphoned off to pay for backup electricity generated by fossil fuel.  That demand is induced by data centres and Government policy.  Customers, many of them living in poverty, will pay a premium for that.  It is a perverse scenario I find quite incredible and is a clear indictment of a failed Government policy.  It flies in the face of statements made by the most senior members of Government, including Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin himself, about the ring-fenced nature of the carbon tax.</p> <p>  We are dealing with a &euro;30 million transfer.  Will we have the same opportunity to deal with the &euro;60 million for retrofitting?</p></speech>

Has the Minister clarity about the extra cost of a residential electricity bill on the back of legislation?  The question was raised on Committee Stage.  I refer to the &euro;350 million bill.  I know there were differences of opinion.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities pointed to a figure of &euro;40 for each residential bill.  Has the Minister confirmed that at this stage?  Will he provide clarity about it?  We will have an opportunity to come back next week to address retrofitting.  I ask the Minister to address the cost per bill.</p></speech>

We have been upfront and honest.  National Broadband Ireland attended the committee last week to share what is actually happening.  These figures are not coming as a surprise.  We have been clear about the fact that, due to Covid-related complications and other challenges with the national broadband plan, the changed target should not be a surprise.  The committee debated it last week.  Everything is being done to address that and to get ahead of targets again.</p> <p>  The carbon tax is not being siphoned off.  For background to this issue, in the past week, the European Council made a decision.  It has to be ratified by the European Parliament but I do not expect it will be blocked.  The decision is that Europe will introduce a form of carbon tax in the transport and building sector.  If we are not applying our carbon tax and increasing it in the way that we have committed to, then the funds would go away.  We would not have the funds for retrofitting, social welfare increases and for farming.  To my mind, that completely changes the debate on carbon tax, unless we want to buck the entire European system and say we are opting out of it, which I do not think we could legally do.</p></speech>

That is part of the plan and we will need it.  It will use less gas because it is only there for back-up, but we need it.</p> <p>  We will not know the exact cost to the consumer.  There are all sorts of estimates, which depend on what one counts and how it is measured.  We could ask what the costs would have been had our auctions been successful in the first place.  This emergency generation seeks to catch up with that.  There would have been an underlying cost.  We would have needed this backup, but we were not able to deliver it in the auction process, so we are taking the purchase route.  Whether one counts that or not, the reality is that we will not know until we purchase the equipment, agree on the installation at sites, and know the related costs.  A cost of &euro;40 was mentioned on Committee Stage.  I think that will be less.  It depends on the purchase price of the generation equipment and the installation price at the sites, which will then accrue.</p> <p>  Any figures we mentioned do not take into account the plan that we would be able to get a resale value and clawback for households and taxpayers in the event that the equipment can be sold at the end of its use in this emergency way.  Other countries in Europe are going in the same direction as us, to use much renewable energy, and they will need the backup.  I am convinced that there will be demand, whether in Ireland or abroad, for our state-of-the-art Rolls Royce jet engine equipment.  Therefore, we will get a resale value which will lower any costs.</p><p>We do not have the figure.  Anything is speculation in advance of knowing what we pay for the equipment.  As soon as we have that, we will share it with the committee.</p></speech>

Going into the budget allocation this October, I know for certain that we will have an increase in the budget available for retrofitting, coming from the revenues from carbon tax.  The Department of Finance, very unusually and exceptionally - I cannot think of another example - has been willing to agree and hypothecate.  I do not need to negotiate that.  That is done.  It is agreed.</p></speech>

There may be a renewable element to the electricity generation.  It is an issue that has come up.  Has the Minister considered it?  It may be worth examining it in the context of reducing the cost for the end consumer.  It is technical in nature but, nevertheless, it may have significant import in terms of price reductions for the end consumer.</p></speech>

The price of fuel is exceptionally volatile.  This is an unprecedented time.  Two years ago, the price of gas was approximately 40 cent or 50 cent a therm.  It was at that level for 20 years or for as long as I can remember.  It varied slightly.  Yesterday, the price was more than 400 cent a therm.  That was the wholesale purchasing forward price for next winter.</p></speech>

That sent the price really high.  The price will probably come back down.  We are assessing this daily, particularly in terms of the forward market.  Brent crude oil is trading today at $103 a barrel.  It was $115 a barrel a week ago.  There tends to be a two-week lag.  That decrease will start to work through in the next week or two.  The price at the pumps should start to come down to reflect it.</p> <p>  The medium-term prognosis on gas is for continuing high prices.  As members are aware, the concern is that Russia has started to restrict gas supplies into Europe again, including through the Nord Stream pipeline.  It has shut off its gas connection to certain countries.  That action relates to the war; it is a tactic in that struggle.  The war is attritional at the moment and there is no end in sight.  Unfortunately, that is likely to mean continued high prices.</p></speech>

The situation in respect of oil is not as precarious for Europe because Russian exports account for 3 million of 100 million barrels a day in terms of the global market for oil.  Oil is a more fungible market product and there are alternative routes for it to get into the market.  It is difficult to be precise but, in a European context, gas security is a more significant issue than oil security at the moment.  That could change.  What we do in terms of budget measures will have to wait until September.  What I have been saying is that, due to the high price of gas and the likely high price of electricity as a result, as well as the ongoing high price of oil, we should be looking at as many targeted measures as possible to protect those at risk of fuel poverty.  Exactly what those measures will be and how we deliver them are matters for the budget in September.</p></speech>

The 20% reduction in public transport fares has been a great success.  My understanding from the National Transport Authority, NTA, is that there has been an uplift of approximately 15% in Limerick compared with figures pre-Covid.  It has been a resounding success.  There have been unintended consequences, however.  The 307 bus route goes from Limerick city to the University of Limerick, UL, and then up Castletroy College Road.  The 308 bus route goes out to UL and then to Groody Road and comes back via Ballysimon.  Those routes are important as they serve the university.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also has bus routes serving UL, namely, the 304 and 304A routes.  However, Dublin Coach has announced that, effective from close of business on Friday, it is discontinuing the 307 and 308 routes.</p></speech>

It is a private operator.  It is discontinuing the routes as a result of the 20% public transport fare reduction.  They are not public service obligation, PSO, routes.  I very much welcome that 50% reduction for students that will come on stream across all operators, public and private, in August.  Will the Minister consider extending the 20% fare reduction to private operators, possibly just on specific routes, such as commuter routes?  The NTA anticipated this issue and made a submission to the Department for &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million to deal with routes from which private operators will withdraw because they are no longer competitive, given the 20% reduction for PSO routes running nearby.  This is an unintended consequence of the 20% fare reduction.  Will the Minister consider extending the reduction to all operators, even just on specific routes?  Will he give support to the NTA in terms of the &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million it is seeking to deal with the fallout where private operators are discontinuing routes?  I have met with the NTA.  It is currently considering putting services into the areas to which I have referred.  Castletroy College Road, which is a highly populated area, Groody Road and Ballysimon will not have any bus service when these routes are gone.  There is commonality between Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Coach in terms of routes serving UL.  Is the Minister aware of this issue?  Will he consider it?</p><p>Will he give support to the private operators with regard to the 20% reduction and to the National Transport Authority, NTA, in respect of the &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million it is seeking to deal with that fallout?

There was no intention to disfavour commercial operators.  We expect that, from the autumn, it will be possible to apply the 50% discount for those aged under 24 and to include these operators in that scheme.  With regard to the 20% reduction, it was not a question of a lack of interest or desire to include to include the commercial operators.  There was a real practical difficulty in that we do not, in any way, set prices for such operators or monitor their fares.  There is no mechanism by which to record, assess, monitor, manage or ensure delivery.  We said that we would work with the commercial operators to see what could be done to overcome that hurdle.

I ask that, at a minimum, the Minister provide the &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million the NTA is seeking to deal with the fallout so that we can get these highly populated areas, which have no bus route, covered straight away.  There are schools on the Castletroy College Road.  It is a highly populated area.  Northern Trust has a location on Groody Road.  It is a big employer.

On commercial bus operators, I accept what the Minister has said, which is that an NTA proposal would be required and that he is not against extending the 20% reduction to such operators.  Am I correct in saying that the 50% reduction in student fares works by operators cutting their fares for such people in half and then getting something like 70% back?</p></speech>

This was raised with me by Matthews Coaches, which does a lot of commuter work, particularly between Dundalk, Drogheda and Dublin, although it also serves east Meath.  It provides services to colleges and the city centre.  Obviously, its numbers have decreased on what they were previously.  They are not sure what pool this increase will come from and believe that this formula may not work for them.  They are worried about their business model.  This needs to be taken into account with specific regard to that company.</p></speech>

It has a valuable and important role.  I would like to get back to that.  We are in the closing stages of agreeing how the exact mechanism of the youth reduction will apply to such operators but we do not know yet.</p></speech>

This firm had a foolproof business model that was impacted greatly.  We will not really know what the reality of hybrid and remote working will be and the numbers it will be carrying until September, October or November.  As the Chair said, with regard to students, it is about letting the operators know the realities as soon as possible so that they can tell their customers, including students, who may avail of their services.  That 50% reduction is a big deal.</p></speech>

We started with discussion of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and the &euro;30 million.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, this is not exactly a saving but arises from not reaching targets.  We recently had what was probably our best interaction with NBI.  Once it reaches or exceeds the targets, I do not believe anyone will complain.</p> <p>  With regard to the work and responsibilities of the Minister and his officials, can we change this from a seven-year project to a six-year project?  What is really being talked about is the self-installed product.  This relies on the outworkings of the court case between Eir and ComReg and completing negotiations as quickly as possible.  The only alternative is for Eir to increase its capacity for delivering make-ready infrastructure and I am not sure it is fit to make that promise so it looks like this is the only show in town if we are to deliver in six years rather than seven.</p></speech>

We will have to await the outcome of that decision.</p></speech>

At that point, there will need to be as much government intervention as possible to ensure a solution is reached as quickly as possible.  The negotiations between NBI and Eir could go on forever if either party was not very interested.</p></speech>

I made the point that it is in everyone's interest to provide this.  It should be remembered that this is about NBI's wholesale open access product.  Everyone can get access to it.  It is Eir's interest to be able to give its customers, of whom it has many in those rural areas, the very best and quickest connection.  It is not just about the outcome of the court case but, as I was saying earlier, the general speed and flexibility of the roll-out of this infrastructure.  It is in Eir's interest for this to be done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Nobody will complain about timelines being improved.  Deputy O'Rourke dealt with the issue of the money that was to be ring-fenced for retrofitting.</p><p>It has been brought to my attention that a number of medium-sized builders involved in installing heat pumps, dealing with retrofitting projects and so on have applied to be one-stop shop operators but do not fit the criteria.  Only a small number of companies do.  What is the situation?  Another complaint is that people can still approach some of these builders, who have built up a significant level of competence in this field, but they can only avail of a limited number of grants, for example, for heat pumps and insulation.  There are other grants for windows and so on that only fall within the gambit of those who can operate as one-stop-shops, for example, some of the large energy suppliers and a number of companies that seem like they have been set up very quickly.  The concern is that the work will still get done by some of these builders, but it will be subcontracted to them.  They are afraid that they might not necessarily be the beneficiaries of the contracts.</p></speech>

It was always going to take time.  This is a medium-to-long-term initiative.  Doing up your house is not a small decision.  The benefit of a one-stop shop where you get trusted advice and are helped through the process is real.</p> <p>  I do not see a disadvantage in there being contractors, be they subcontractors or contractors.  The main constraint at the moment is the lack of contractors.  From speaking to people in the business, the challenge for them is in getting workers and meeting demand.  There has been an explosion in public demand for their services.  That is right and good.  Numbers are increasing in terms of apprenticeships and other mechanisms, and the certainty around multi-annual funding is helping that further.  I do not see subcontractors working with a one-stop shop operation necessarily being at a disadvantage.</p></speech>

I am no expert in this field, but I am told that the criteria are very tight, for example, a turnover of &euro;1 million.  I accept that the Minister would not want the Chairman, Deputy O'Rourke and I setting up a company to become a one-stop shop operator, for example, but I am talking about people who have a history in doing this work, are sizable outfits regionally and could easily fit criteria, albeit not necessarily the criteria that have been set.  Only a small number of companies have been approved as one-stop shops.</p></speech>

Regarding broadband, many of the companies that I have spoken to down the years have said that when retail engagement starts, having the logistics and resources to provide a good front-of-house public service is the main criterion.</p></speech>

That would take a year off the roll-out.  I accept that this matter is before the courts and I believe that a decision is expected in July.  In considering what could be done around the edges, time could be shaved off if NBI was physically able to perform a self-install.  There could be added benefits, for example, fast-forwarding the work on gap intervention areas.</p> <p>  A major issue that the Minister is probably aware of is that people in rural areas, some urban areas and some near-urban areas are looking over the ditch at their neighbours who have fibre broadband when they do not have it themselves.  In many cases, the roll-out for them is three or four years down the road.  From our deliberations with NBI, self-install would not be a total game changer, but it could take a year off the time and we could look forward to 2025 instead of 2026.  Some people have spoken about the roll-out taking seven years.  We are nearly two years into the contract, so there are four years left, but we could reduce that to 2023.  If the bulk of the roll-out was completed by 2025, it would be phenomenal and make a real difference.  Will the Minister keep an eye on this matter?</p></speech>

I appreciate that.</p> <p>  What is the Minister's general view now of his putting the Army on standby as a contingency measure at Dublin Airport?  Aer Lingus is cancelling flights for various reasons.  What does he believe will happen with aviation over the summer period?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I had an in-person meeting with the board of Dublin Airport yesterday, which was useful.  We have effectively been having daily meetings.  The airport has got through a difficult period, with passenger numbers in the low 50,000s.  In recent weeks, 94% of passengers have been getting through airport security in less than 45 minutes.  That is the broad benchmark.  It is not satisfactory, and we want everyone flying through security quickly, but compared with what happened at the end of May or what is happening in other European airports where there are widespread cancellations, not because of Covid, but because of airports not being able to cope, Dublin Airport should be able to work its way through this busy period.</p> <p>  There have been significant cancellations by some of the airlines because of Covid.  The airport is not responsible for that.  It has not seen a surge in absenteeism due to Covid.  If it does, the Army is on standby and will be deployed straight away.  That will not be initiated unless there is a specific need, but I told the board yesterday not to hesitate and to apply straight away, at which point we would respond immediately as needs be.</p></speech>

It has good working relationships with SIPTU, other unions and the workers directly.  It will have to assess and manage that situation.  Yesterday, the Minister of State and I acknowledged that the workers in the airport had given everything in recent weeks, for example, working overtime and in different roles than they would originally have expected to be in.  They rightly have pride in the airport and in their work.</p><p>The airport will manage that.  It was right for the Government to have the Defence Forces on standby to deploy if they are needed, and that was the agreement.</p></speech>

If anything, with the cancellations by some airlines because of Covid that have occurred in the past week, the numbers are slightly below where might have been expected.  We are probably at the peak of the numbers, even though it would have been expected that the peak would have been in another two or three weeks, with the airport not yet seeing a significant increase in Covid cases.

The way it is looking, as of the meeting with the board yesterday, is that if we see what has happened in the past two to three weeks continuing, we will get through this.  One of the real challenges is more on the airline side, both in check-in and in baggage handling, and much of that is coming from problems in other airports.  It is arriving as a problem into Dublin Airport because other airports, particularly across northern Europe, are having real difficulty, especially on the baggage handling side.</p></speech>

We see a major role for the airports outside of Dublin, such as Shannon, Cork, Knock and Donegal, and we see those airports having a key role to play in terms of balanced regional development.  When does the Minister anticipate the review will get under way?</p></speech>

The immediate issue is making sure we get everyone off on their holidays and back home.  Coming out of Covid, there are significant changes likely in the aviation sector.  What I said to the board yesterday is we should be meeting again in the autumn period as part of our wider assessment of what is happening in aviation.</p><p>I noted at the weekend Mr. Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, on the front page of the <i>Financial Times</i>signalling significant changes.  Increased prices, Mr. O'Leary says, due to a variety of different factors, form one of the changes.  I think other changes will be, and this is happening across different supply chains, a reconsideration of and a moving away from just-in-time tight numbers and facilities to having a more just-in-case supply chain management so that there is a bit of a buffer and, if anything happens, there is not the cascading of difficulties we are seeing in some airlines at present.  There is a big change coming for sustainability in aviation.  We must plan that.</p><p>One of the lessons we have learned, and I said this to the Dublin and Cork airport boards yesterday, is it also behoves us to reconsider how we make use of the likes of Shannon Airport, which is relatively underutilised at a time when other airports are straining at the maximum of capacity.  That regional rebalancing is part of what we need to do.</p></speech>

To follow-up on the issue of the Defence Forces, the Minister states it is a piece of work on the outside perimeter.  Initially, the Minister and others had stated there is not a whole pile the Defences Forces could do in these circumstance and that there was no point calling them in.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, told the committee the DAA is a private operation and there are plenty of private companies it can avail of before we would even look at the Defence Forces.  Obviously, the big issue we have all heard about is the difficulties there may be with some of the other stakeholders and the unions that might not be particularly happy about this.  The Minister would definitely need to make sure all the i's are dotted and the t's crossed.  What has changed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.893" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022070600002#G02600"><p>What changed was real concern that, in the peak period of July and August, the last of the extra complement of new security staff would not be up to speed, fully in place, and up and running.  There was real concern, especially in the advent of a Covid surge.  It is hard to know where exactly we are on that but it is likely we are at the peak of that at present.  It was a real concern that it would materialise as it had during the Omicron wave in January last where a quarter of the workforce was out due to Covid.  It was a choice of going the way of other European airports and cancelling a significant volume of flights or looking to get the Defence Forces to help.  It is true that where the real bottleneck was, particularly that skilled work of screen monitoring baggage, was not something for which anyone, the Defence Forces or otherwise, could be trained up quickly, but the proposal from the Dublin Airport Authority agreed with the Defence Forces regarding perimeter duty played to the strengths of the Defence Forces.  As I said, it is only on a needs-be basis.  At present, that need is not there.  As I also said, I could not have been clearer yesterday with the board that if it is in any doubt, it should call them in because we do not want to disadvantage the travelling public.  I am sure no one does.  The trade unions and the workers in Dublin Airport are all committed to serving the travelling public in these coming weeks.</p></speech>

We all are in support of whatever can be done from the point of view of ensuring flying is as seamless as possible given the significant difficulties.  I will not labour the point that we probably could have done this piece at an earlier stage because it was stated by the Minister and others that there was not too much to be gained and, to a degree, there is nothing to see here.  Obviously, that has changed or maybe somebody looked into it to a greater degree and decided the Defence Forces could play that part in relation to the workings at the perimeter level.</p></speech>

As I said, we had the various options of either flight cancellations or getting the Defence Forces in.  That very much led us to make a specific immediate decision.</p></speech>

We have constantly spoken at this committee about regional rebalancing.  It would not come as any shock that many Deputies, and even Senators at the joint committee, would extol the virtues of Shannon Airport, which obviously would have nothing to do with their geographical location or whatever.</p><p>In fairness, despite some of the serious discussion that has happened here regarding that matter, until a point when a determination is made by the Minister for a State or so-called national strategy that builds it in, it will not happen.  It will be nothing but empty rhetoric or press releases at times of danger when we need to look at regional airports.  It has to be actually built in.  Otherwise, we will get what the DAA says, namely, that it is all well and good talking about that but, ultimately, if we lose slots or whatever, we will lose them in Vienna or Heathrow.  Until a point is reached when there is a determination at Government level to make this happen, it will not happen.</p></speech>

Looking to see could we improve connectivity to Shannon Airport is one example of where there are levers we might be able to use.  It is for us to review in the autumn how we capitalise on some of the benefits offered by Shannon, including the fact people get through security there in no time because there is very good security monitoring equipment and they do not have to open their bags.</p></speech>

It relates to somebody who lives in the North, who has a Northern driving licence and who may want to become a taxi driver in the South.  I am talking specifically about Dundalk, which will not come as a shock to anybody.  The problem is that this person is not able to take the small public service vehicle test because a Southern driving licence is required in order to do so.  If we go through what the requirements specifically state, someone with a licence from an EEA country, or a recognised state, needs to get the okay from the embassy.  When we contacted the NTA regarding this matter, however, we did not get a reply indicating how it is done.  The NTA just stated that it would refund the money on the basis that this individual had not been told he or she would not be able to take the test.</p> <p>  We all know that every town in Ireland is crying out for people to drive taxis.  We have a number of individuals who are willing to do it.  A number of people fall into that bracket and are licensed, but they will also fall into the Northern licence bracket in the next while.  The fact is that we do not need an Irish solution whereby people get a Southern licences on the basis of having southern addresses when they actually live in the North.  That is grand until they are stopped in their own vehicle on which there is a Northern number plate.  There are also a pile of difficulties relating to customs and all the rest.  What needs to be done to sort this out?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-06a.908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022070600002#H01200"><p>I will make the point that the autumn will be important for the aviation sector.  I am interested in seeing what those levers are.  I do not think they will be enough as regards connectivity.  We have a very liberal aviation market.  We will consider how that can be influenced to try to deliver on the regional balance we all want to see, but it needs to be more than that.</p> <p>  NTA representatives were before the committee for a very good session a couple of weeks ago.  I am very concerned about the taxi industry and late nights.  As a senior Minister, he needs to address the taxi industry in the first instance but also broader public transport services out of hours or late at night, as does his colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, in the context of the late-night economy.  I am not satisfied that the NTA is on top of the matter, is responding adequately or is prepared to respond adequately.  It needs considerable attention.  That will become more apparent as time goes by.  Maybe I am wrong, but it requires ongoing attention.</p> <p>  I am hearing concerns from colleagues throughout the country regarding some of the public transport services, especially some of those provided by Go-Ahead Ireland.  I have raised this with the NTA, as have my colleagues, but it is something that will require particular attention.  There are challenges across the board in delivering services because of driver recruitment and retention issues.  There are particular problems in that area that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

This is anecdotal, but we are hearing that prior to Covid many taxi drivers did late-night work.  Post Covid, the number doing late-night work has dropped.  That appears to be a factor.  I have noticed that in Dublin people are now waiting for taxis when a short time ago they were not.  The committee will probably do a body of work around this but I will add to Deputy O'Rourke's question.  I ask the Minister to address his comments.</p></speech>

It is like leaving a machine idle for two years.  It is not that taxi drivers were idle, but now that everything has started back up again full tilt, we are finding it is difficult for a variety of sectors to get back.  As the Chairman said, the pattern changed during that two-year period.  Many older drivers have left.  Many of those who previously worked nights are not doing so now.  My city of Dublin, as the Chairman said, it had a very large fleet.  We had a large number of licensed taxis.  It was meeting demand and need.  It is now out of kilter and needs to get back into kilter.</p> <p>  It is not just taxis.  One of the things we are seeing is that the roll-out of BusConnects routes is allowing for late-night services.  We need more public transport services at night.  It is not just the taxi industry that should take all the people.  One of the issues in the likes of Dublin Airport is that many of the commercial bus services that went to the airport have not come back for a variety of reasons, including the 20% fare reduction discount issue.  A complex range of issues is part of this.  Deputy O'Rourke is correct that what we are seeing as we come out of Covid is various sectors, such as aviation, the taxi industry and much of construction contracting, are finding it difficult to get staff so many of them are finding it very difficult to ramp back up.  We will have to make sure they do in order to provide the service the public demands. </p></speech>

I worry about the private operators, many of whom applied to the NTA for many years, and in many cases, pioneered the setting up of routes.  I would hate to see unintended consequences where customers are not getting the level of service they previously got because these private operators are finding it is not financially viable without the 20% reduction.  I know the Minister is open to this, and I will follow up on it with the NTA.  It is an area that needs a body of work from the Department, the Minister and the NTA.  It is something about which there is concern.</p></speech>
