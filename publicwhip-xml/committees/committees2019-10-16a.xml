    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Conroy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#D00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address them on this draft legislation. As the Chairman said, I am joined today by Helen O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal.<br/><br/>I hope to provide this hearing with the background to the Government decision to approve the General Scheme of the Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination, and Public Display) Bill, and to briefly outline the main provisions.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the human tissue Bill will create a modern legislative framework for consent for activities involving human organs and tissue.  The introduction of legislation in this area is a priority for the Minister for Health and it will give effect to two commitments in the programme for Government: to prioritise the passage of the human tissue Bill; and to propose legislation for family consent and an opt-out register for organ donation.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the Bill proposes to regulate the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons; provide general conditions for the removal, donation and use of organs and tissues from deceased and living persons for the purposes of transplantation; and provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation, and for an associated register.<br/><br/>The principles underlying the proposals are that consent would be the defining principle underpinning activities involving human organs and tissue; protection of the bodily integrity of the individual before and after death; respect for the autonomy of the individual and the rights of the bereaved; and, promotion of the public health benefits of organ donation and post-mortem examination.<br/><br/>The key recommendation of the report of Dr. Deirdre Madden on post-mortem practices and procedures<i></i>was that no hospital post-mortem examination should be carried out, and no organ retained for any purpose whatsoever, without authorisation.  The general scheme of the Bill will extend this principle to transplantation, anatomical examination, education and training and public display.<br/><br/>The development of this general scheme of the Bill has been a collaborative process.  Two public consultations on the proposals were held, the latest in 2017.  Stakeholders consulted through the drafting process included patient representative groups, the Medical Council, the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the State Pathologist, the Coroners Society of Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General.<br/><br/>The proposed legislation is designed to be compatible with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the coroners Acts.  It will repeal the Anatomy Act of 1832.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the Bill comprises six parts.  Part 1 deals with standard provisions such as interpretation.  It includes provisions for the storage, handling, transportation, disposal and return of organs and tissue.<br/><br/>Part 2 outlines provisions in respect of transplantation.  The general scheme of the Bill covers the transplant of both organs and tissues and outlines the requisite consent provisions in regard to deceased and living donors.<br/><br/>Transplantation is currently the only available treatment for end-stage heart, lung and liver failure.  It is the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage kidney disease and it brings enormous clinical and social benefits to patients who would otherwise remain on dialysis.  The success of transplantation, in terms of life years gained and improvements in quality of life for patients, as well as advances in treatment generally, has resulted in an increase in the number of patients for whom transplantation is considered to be a viable option.  At the end of September this year, 577 people were on transplant waiting lists in Ireland, 499 of whom were on the kidney transplant list.  Worldwide, the most significant problem affecting transplant programmes is the shortage of suitable organs to transplant.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the Bill proposes to introduce an opt-out system of organ donation.  This approach has been widely adopted across Europe.  Currently, the decision on organ donation in the case of a deceased person rests with that person&rsquo;s next-of-kin, even in cases where the deceased person had an organ donor card or had indicated their wish to be an organ donor on their driving licence.  Under the proposed opt-out system, consent will be deemed unless a person has, while alive, registered his or her wish not to become an organ donor after death.  The intention is to make organ donation the norm in situations where donation is possible.<br/><br/>A soft opt-out system is proposed.  Even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will, in practice, always be consulted prior to removing any organ.  If the next-of-kin objects to the deemed consent, the donation will not proceed.  Feedback from the public consultations, and from organisations involved, supports the continued role of the next-of-kin in the final decision on individual organ donations.<br/><br/>Under the proposed system, individuals who do not wish to donate can opt out.  An organ donation opt-out register will be established and maintained by Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, ODTI.  If an individual has opted out through including his or her details on the register, they will not be considered for organ donation after their death and the views of the family will not be sought.  The ODTI has commenced work on setting up the register.  Appropriate safeguards will be included to ensure that the information is correct, that it represents the individual&rsquo;s current views and that general data protection regulation, GDPR, requirements are met.  Only the individual involved will be able to include him or herself on the register.  Also, it will be possible for individuals to remove their name from the register at any time.<br/><br/>The proposed soft opt-out system recognises the practical need for family co-operation to obtain social and medical information about the donor.  Safeguarding a future potential organ recipient involves the completion of a comprehensive donor lifestyle questionnaire which requires the co-operation of the next-of-kin.</p><p>The introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation is part of a range of initiatives being taken to increase the availability of organs for donation.  They include the establishment of a national organ procurement service; the appointment of clinical leads for organ donation and organ donation nurse managers in each hospital group; the planned national organ retrieval service; and the retrieval of organs in more complex donor cases.  The legislative proposals will be accompanied by a publicity campaign, the aim of which will be to boost organ donation, ensure people understand the opt-out system and encourage them to share their wishes for organ donation with their families.  </p><p> The general scheme also provides for consent procedures and general conditions for the removal, donation and use of organs and tissue from living persons for transplantation and human application.  The Bill includes a provision to prohibit the trafficking of organs and the removal and transplantation of organs outside an official transplant centre, thus facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs. </p><p> Part 3 of the general scheme covers pathology practice or post mortems.  This involves hospital post mortems or non-coroner post mortems only.   The general scheme outlines the consent required for a hospital post mortem; who can undertake a post mortem; the purposes for which a post mortem may be undertaken; and provisions for the retention, storage, use, disposal and return of organs and tissue from deceased persons following a post mortem.  The legislation will stipulate that individuals may not be paid for organs and tissue that have been removed as part of a post mortem and that such organs and tissue cannot be used for commercial purposes. </p><p> Part 4 covers anatomical examination.  The Anatomy Act 1832 will be repealed and replaced with provisions appropriate to the current requirements of medical education.  Provisions governing consent for anatomical examination, as well as the practice, licensing and governance of such examination, are included.  The central pillar of these provisions is informed consent.  An adult may, prior to his or her death, consent to the donation of his or her body or body parts for anatomical examination.  Full and clear information should be provided outlining the nature of the anatomical examination activities, the length of time the donated body or body parts will be retained, arrangements for disposal and any other information deemed to be appropriate.  The general scheme provides that anatomical examination, for the purposes of studying the structure of the human body, may only be practiced in a licensed institution, one of the five anatomy schools in Ireland.  Anatomical examination, for the purposes of ongoing education and training in surgical and clinical procedures, may only be practised using a specimen loaned or transferred from a licensed institution.  The import and export of specimens for anatomical examination is also covered.   </p><p> Part 5 provides that a licence will be required for the public display of bodies after death and outlines the requirements to be fulfilled when applying for a licence.  The provisions also outline the consent arrangements required and stipulate that only individuals who are authorised by the Medical Council may import or export specimens for public display.  Offences and penalties are outlined in Part 6.  </p><p> Work has commenced on the drafting of the Bill in collaboration with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Department hopes to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Bill by the end of quarter 1 of 2020 and that, subject to other legislative priorities, the Bill will progress through both Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of quarter 3 of 2020.  </p><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  We look forward to receiving the committee&rsquo;s report which will make a valuable contribution in the further development of the legislation.</p></speech>

I am a consultant lung transplant physician based at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and the director of Organ Donation Transplant Ireland, ODTI.  I am also the chairman of the national organ donation and transplant advisory group, NODTAG, which informs and supports ODTI.  The NODTAG includes representation from the three national transplant centres and the intensive care medicine community.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Fiona Hammond, chief operations officer of ODTI.</p> <p>  ODTI is the delegated body for organ donation and transplant and performs the functions assigned to the HSE.  It is authorised by the HPRA in accordance with SI 325 of 2012, European Communities Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation.  It is the responsible national body for the independent co-ordination and safe management of organ procurement through the National Organ Procurement Service, NOPS.  This involves collecting organs and moving them to transplant centres.  The NOPS co-ordinates the organ donation process with the support of the three national transplant centres, namely, the National Renal Transplant Centre in Beaumont University Hospital, the National Liver and Pancreas Transplant Centre, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and the National Heart and Lung Transplant Centre in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital </p> <p>  ODTI works closely with the intensive care services throughout the country from the point of referral to the safe hand-over of donated organs for transplant surgery.  It acts as a confidential communication channel for donor families and recipients of organs.  It also provides access to supports for families who have donated organs. </p> <p>  ODTI is underpinned by robust quality processes and has a quality management system which provides for benchmarking against EU standards.  This ensures safety for the donor, families and transplant recipients.  </p> <p>  ODTI welcomes the introduction of the Human Tissue Bill and the inclusion of a &ldquo;soft opt-out&rdquo; approach to organ donation.  In Ireland there are 577 individuals listed for life saving transplant surgery.  Historically, organ donation in Ireland has functioned on the basis of voluntarism and clinical interest in organ donation.  Continual improvements in healthcare such as early intervention and enhanced treatments for stroke patients and a very welcome 60% reduction in the number of deaths in road traffic accidents in the past ten years have reduced the traditional organ donation events.  Therefore, organ donation continues to be a very rare event.  Of 31,000 deaths each year in Ireland, there is an average of 80 multi-organ donations per annum.  While Ireland performs well when compared to other European counterparts, organ donation rates are consistently dominated by those countries that provide for both opt-out consent and have robust organ donation infrastructure.  My submission includes a map showing the other countries that use a soft opt-out approach, to which the United Kingdom has recently moved.  Spain is widely acknowledged as having the leading model of a system that has increased the rate of organ donations.  It operates a soft opt-out system.  However, the Spanish national body for organ donation and transplant, ONT, Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trasplantes, emphasises the importance of organ donor infrastructure to support organ donation.  It entails the availability of key donation personnel, donor co-ordinators, to support families through the organ donation process.   </p> <p>  In 1989, 14 per million of the Spanish population donated organs.  With the changes to the approach adopted in recent decades, this figure has risen to 45 donations per million of population.  Significantly, 30% of donations in Spain are from individuals aged over 70 years which compares to a figure of less than 6% in Ireland.  While organ donation from older individuals is feasible, it is medically more complex and requires appropriate infrastructure in order to execute the transplant safely.  My submission includes a table which shows where Ireland sits in a European context.  We should acknowledge that, thankfully, Ireland has low death rates.  As we are in the business of saving lives, we are in the middle of the table overall, but there is room for improvement.</p> <p>  Recognising the many benefits that accrue from transplantation, the United Kingdom has invested substantially in organ donation and transplantation.  In 2008 in the United Kingdom an organ donation task force made a series of recommendations to enhance national organ donation rates.  They have resulted in a 75% increase in organ donation rates.</p><p><i>Per capita</i>, the UK spends significantly more than Ireland on organ donation infrastructure.  There is currently a significant infrastructure deficit in regard to organ donation in our health service.  In table II of our submission we have benchmarked Ireland against our closest neighbour, Northern Ireland and against the best in Europe.  As can be seen, we operate with about one third of the equivalent organ donation infrastructure.  There is clearly a spread across Europe in how in the infrastructure is deployed.  <br/><br/>Organ donation typically occurs with a diagnosis of brain death, which is actually a very uncommon form of death, frequently occurring as a result of injury to the brain.  An alternative, modern technique, which is called deceased cardiac donation, or DCD, allows organ donation after the heart stops beating.  This approach has allowed many EU countries to safely enhance their number of donations.  The UK has made significant progress by focusing on this form of donation.  Currently up to 40% of all UK donations occur in these circumstances.  Overall, in any population, cardiac death is the most common mechanism of death but because blood flow is interrupted, preservation of the organs is more complex.  Consequently, donation after the heart stops beating places extra demands on surgical retrieval staff, who are then displaced and unavailable for subsequent transplant surgery.  Therefore, in keeping with international experience, the combination of donations from older people and deceased cardiac donation, with the adoption of a soft opt out, should allow donation rates in Ireland to increase.  Appropriate organ donation infrastructure would save many lives and decrease the burden of costly interventions such as dialysis which costs around &euro;65,000 per annum versus approximately &euro;12,000 for kidney transplant surgery.  Table III illustrates the success of the renal services in this country, with an increasing number of people sustained on dialysis over the last decade.  ODTI will continue to work with the Department of Health in securing appropriate infrastructure funding for donation and transplant services in Ireland. <br/><br/>An organ donation opt-out register is central to the human tissue Bill which provides that such a register will be established and maintained by ODTI.  Spain does not operate a register and relies on organ donation personnel to support families through the process.  In contrast, the UK currently operates both a positive register, where people declare their desire to be a donor and a negative register, where people declare that they do not want to be a donor.  The British have invested heavily in that.  The proposed Irish register will be provided for those individuals who do not wish to participate in organ donation after death.  We anticipate this will represent approximately 5% of the population based on an analysis of what happened in Wales when it introduced a similar system.  ODTI is currently working to scope the operational and technical requirements of the development of the national register.  As this is a complex project, ODTI will have the support and expertise of the HSE's office of the chief information officer, OCIO.  The project will develop the operational processes that allows for a GDPR-compliant national opt-out register for organ donation, including the secure hosting of its national database.  ODTI will identify the safest and most cost effective electronic register for demographic identifiers of individuals who wish to register an objection to organ donation.  Working with the OCIO, ODTI will ensure the inclusion of an ability to link to a national individual health identifier, IHI, when it becomes available.  The register will also provide a mechanism to allow people to alter their information on the register or to revoke their objection should they wish to do so at a future date.  ODTI will ensure the register will not be open to inspection by the public.  As per the proposed legislation, it is intended that ODTI may share information only with relevant medical staff for the purpose of determining if the deceased person&rsquo;s family members may be approached to discuss organ donation.  This capability must be available to the entire acute hospital network, on a 24/7 basis, 365 days per year.  It is intended that target medical staff will include organ donation nurse managers, intensive care consultants with special interest in organ donation, intensive care consultants, intensive care nurses and emergency medicine consultants.<br/><br/>ODTI wishes to highlight the need for a robust national public awareness campaign to support the introduction of a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation and for the associated register in Ireland.  This will be required in advance of the introduction of a soft opt-out consent system.<br/><br/>Organ donation saves lives and should be the society norm.  Of 31,000 deaths in Ireland, donation occurs on average only 80 times each year.  There are currently 577 people awaiting transplant surgery.  The Irish health service operates with one third of the equivalent international infrastructure for organ donation and transplant.  ODTI provides a framework for organ donation and transplantation and each year publishes an activity report which is accessible to the public.  We have included some European league tables in our submission so that committee members can benchmark us against our European counterparts.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention this morning.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Watt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#F00500"><p>I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues in the Gallery, Ms Nicola Cassidy, Ms Nicola Hurley, Ms Ann Marie O'Dowd and Mr. Michael Geoghegan from the Irish Donor Network and various patient groups.  We are dedicating our presentation to former Senator, Feargal Quinn, who sadly passed away earlier this year.  He was a fantastic champion of organ donation and was very supportive of the soft opt-out system.</p> <p>  Organ donation is a precious gift that saves lives.  In large part due to a shortage of organs, people continue to die in Ireland unnecessarily while on the waiting list for organs they desperately need in order to preserve and enhance their lives and health.  One organ donor can potentially save seven lives.  There are also benefits to their families, Irish society in general, the Irish health system and the wider economy in promoting transplantation.  That is why IDN is committed to encouraging transplantation and to increase the numbers of donors and of lives saved.  In this context, IDN warmly welcomes the introduction by the Minister for Health and the Irish Government of the human tissue Bill 2019, and in particular the provisions to provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation and for an associated register.  We note that this change is also widely supported by most political parties in Ireland, the medical community and by the vast majority of relevant patient groups and the general public.  We also note that it is an important part of the programme for Government.  </p> <p>  However, we also wish to make clear in this submission that the ambition to make more organs available for transplant may be blunted or may not reach full potential if it is not accompanied by the necessary supporting resources and infrastructure.  In particular, we need more organ retrieval surgeons and donor nurse specialists in our major intensive care units in our hospitals.  We also need improved hospital infrastructure and staffing levels in the three transplant centres at the Mater, Beaumont and St. Vincents&rsquo; hospitals, including pre- and post-operative rooms and sufficient access to operating theatres.</p><p>We also need sufficient resources for a national public awareness programme and register, and some modest resources to help patient groups to support the public awareness campaign that will accompany the human tissue Bill. </p><p> The Irish Donor Network is made up of the following patient groups: the Alpha One Foundation; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Support Ireland; Children&rsquo;s Liver Disease Ireland; Disease Support Ireland; Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, which is my organisation; Cystinosis Ireland; the Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association; and the Irish Lung Fibrosis Association, which is represented here today.  Soft opt-out is also supported by the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Thoracic Society and the Irish Hospice Foundation and many other key stakeholders concerned with organ donation and transplantation in Ireland.</p><p> I will now turn to why the Irish Donor Network supports the human tissue Bill and soft opt-out.  The IDN strongly supports the introduction of a soft opt-out system for organ donation, which basically means an opt-out system with inherent safeguards.  The IDN has been campaigning for such a system for many years.  Under the proposed new system, the donor&rsquo;s next of kin would still be consulted, but deceased donors&rsquo; consent would be presumed unless there is evidence that they did not wish to donate.  An alternative approach is the hard opt-out system, which has been tried in other countries including Austria, where next of kin are not consulted.  This system has been shown not to work.  It was tried in Austria and it failed, so we certainly would not suggest that system be brought into Ireland.</p><p> While it is always challenging to make direct comparisons with other countries, the decision to bring a soft opt-out system into Ireland follows the success of soft opt-out in many other EU countries, including in Austria, Spain and Belgium.  There has also been a strong momentum growing in the UK to introduce soft opt-out in recent years.  In England, the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act has passed through the UK Parliament, with implementation due to start in April 2020.  This will replace the present on line opt-in and opt-out system that has failed to deliver and which should not be considered for Ireland.  Under the existing system in the UK, only 38% of the UK population has registered their wish to opt in on the existing online organ donor register, which is why most UK health bodies concerned with transplant are now seeking to replace this system with the approach that we are advocating for Ireland.  The IDN does not want to import an opt-in and opt-out system into Ireland, because this system has clearly demonstrated failure in England.</p><p> Donor cards, apps, and codes on drivers' licences are worthy additions to a programme, and we pay tribute to the work of the Irish Kidney Association in developing these excellent public awareness initiatives.  We believe there is no reason these initiatives would not continue into the future.  They are not, however, a substitute for a comprehensive organ donor consent legislative process and a system based on evidence.</p><p> In Scotland, a new Bill was enacted in July 2019.  In Wales, such a system has now been in place since 2015.  Of 160 organ transplants in 2017 in Wales, 39 were organs transplanted using its deemed consent system.  Only 6% of people opted out of the system in Wales.  Authoritative research published by the British Medical Journal concluded that the change in Wales had a positive impact on donation but stressed the importance of resourcing transplant and donation infrastructure.</p><p> The groups involved in the IDN have been involved in supporting organ donation for many years.  The IDN believes that, as part of a broader strategy, including improvements in organ donation and transplantation infrastructure with resourcing and organisation, a shift to an opt-out system will have a positive impact on donation rates.  Independent research carried out by the University of York, which I will go into in detail, showed four major methodologically sound studies comparing donation rates in countries with and without soft opt-out and found that the practice of soft opt-out has been proven to increase organ donation in three of the four studies.</p><p> Research undertaken in Ireland shows that 80% or more support organ donation but only about a third of us tend to carry a donor card.  The IDN supports the principle behind an opt-out system, that if people do not object to their organs being used after death they should be used to save lives.  Under an opt-out system, individuals have the same choice as in an opt-in system - to donate or not to donate - so individual autonomy and choice are protected and respected under this proposed new system.  The proposed new system is simply a change in the way people&rsquo;s views are expressed.  All organ donation is a gift and should be recognised as such in the future, irrespective of the model of consent in place.  Families are often comforted by knowing something good has come from their loss.  The expectation of IDN is that, under a soft opt-out system, organ donation would become the default position which, over time, would change expectations in society and so become the societal norm.  Thus, there would be a shift where donation is a natural and expected thing to do.</p><p> We would also point to other aspects of the legislation that are important, such as the introduction of a living kidney sharing scheme.  This has worked very well and is called altruistic donation.  This allows a stranger and people who are not relatives to donate a kidney.  This is working very well in Northern Ireland and 89 donors have provided such support in recent years.  We also strongly support the public awareness programme and patient groups should be involved in this too.</p><p> People continue to die waiting for a transplant in Ireland.  The submission from the seven patient groups of the IDN contends that the momentum in Ireland for change is growing, as it is with our nearest neighbours in the UK.  As with all major changes, however, the introduction of soft opt-out needs to be accompanied by a persistent, continuing and adequately resourced public awareness programme, an online register and a significant additional investment in transplant infrastructure such as organ retrieval surgeons and other key specialised staff.  We are delighted to continue to play a supporting role in this change.  We hope that the living kidney sharing scheme would come in under the new legislation also.</p><p> IDN wishes to acknowledge the work of senior officials in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland and Professor Jim Egan, the HSE, and the Department of Health, led by Michael Conroy.  We also thank the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and all of the political parties here today.  We urge that this legislation is enacted as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Our first mission was to introduce what was then the kidney donor card, raise public awareness about how kidney donation works and how it can be the gift of life.  As transplantation progressed to include more organs the kidney donor card became the organ donor card more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>  The role of the organ donor card has always been to prompt the organ donation conversation within families as informed consent is key to the success of the process.  Technology has allowed us to reach beyond the traditional card, as Mr .Watt mentioned, and we now also have a digital organ donor card app.  The same principle applies in that the app is there to promote conversation and as a reminder of the decision made.</p> <p>  For more than a decade we advocated for the introduction of an organ donor register.  This would offer a very clear call to action for the public and can be very easily established in such a way that facilitates the organ donation conversation.</p><p>With a register, Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, ODTI, would have for the first time a central record of an individual's decision to be an organ donor.  This would be consulted when a potential donor has been identified and knowing that a loved one had proactively recorded a wish to be an organ donor makes the family decision to consent a much easier proposition.<br/><br/>In putting an emphasis on soft opt-out with family consent, this Bill is misleading the public as it implies a change of practice, whereas the reality is that the practice stays the same.  Currently, a potential organ donor is identified, the family is approached and consent for retrieval is either given or not.  Under the proposals in this Bill, the public will have the opportunity to opt out of organ donation and if people do not opt out, they will be considered potential donors but the family will still be approached for final consent.  Where is the difference?<br/><br/>We want people to say &quot;Yes&quot; to organ donation but just as important, we want their families to also say &quot;Yes&quot;.  How do we do this?  We encourage conversation.  The public will only look at the headlines of this Bill and see that if they do not opt out then they are considered potential donors, the call to action will be removed along with the prompt for family conversation.  Do not just take my word for it as there are people a lot more learned than me who will say the introduction of a system of opt-out will not affect growth in deceased donors.  A paper entitled Comparison of Organ Donation and Transplantation Rates Between Opt-out and Opt-in Systems, which was published this year states, &quot;our data demonstrate no significant difference in deceased donation or solid organ transplantation activity between opt-out versus opt-in countries&quot;.  This other barriers to organ donation must be addressed even in settings where consent for donation is presumed.  The author concluded that greater emphasis on education and informing the general population about the benefits of transplantation is the preferred way to achieve an increase in organ donation.  These findings have important implications for transplant clinicians and health policymakers like this committee when considering the merits of organ donation strategies.<br/><br/>Another paper entitled Opt-out Legislation, the Mysterious Viability of the False, was written by Dr. Rafael Matesanz and Dr. Beatriz Dom&iacute;nguez-Gil, the retired and current leader of the most successful organ donation organisation in the world, Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trasplantes, ONT, in Spain.  It states:</p><blockquote>In summary, the evidence does not support that shifting towards presumed consent will solve organ shortage.  But still today, this measure is seen as a magic solution that departs from conviction that low deceased donation rates result only from a negative public attitude and poor contribution from society.  It results from ignoring that the key to success lies within the healthcare system.  We should never blame the population.  If people donate less, it must be something we have done wrong.</blockquote><p>This is from the leaders of the donation organisation in the most successful country in the world in this practice.<br/><br/>Head 19 of the Bill focuses on an opt-out only register and is a major missed opportunity.  Give the public an opportunity to opt in also.  The register would go from being viewed negatively by wider society to being a useful call to action and decision aid for families when their consent is sought.  The United Kingdom has had a register for 25 years and it also has detailed donor audit reports, which we do not, that show the evidence of the value of the register and the role of specialist nurses for organ donation.  Again, we have very few of them.  Only 30% of families consent when no specialist nurse is involved in the formal organ donation conversation with the family.  That increases to 57.5% consent when the specialist nurse is involved but the potential donor has not signed the donor register.  This increases again to 94% of families consenting to organ donation if a specialist nurse is involved and the potential organ donor has signed up to the register.  It is hard to argue with such statistics, which is raw evidence for the committee.<br/><br/>With respect to developing a &quot;Yes&quot; or opt-in register we are actually already in a very strong position, with 957,000 people who have the new format driving licence or driving permit choosing to have the code 115 added to their licence to indicate their wish to be an organ donor.  These data can easily be transferred to the Department of Health if the desire is there to make it happen.  We have a number of edits for the committee to consider.  My colleague, Mr. Whelan and I, worked on this for quite some time.  We have plenty of supporting materials that we believe will help the committee make a truly informed decision on the future of organ donation in Ireland.  I thank the committee for not presuming our consent to this Bill.</p></speech>

It was never a device to give consent but it is a reminder of one's wishes.  We ask that the next of kin sign the card but the British version does not require this.  Our card was developed seven years after the United Kingdom card and we sought that the next of kin would countersign.  It is a reminder to the next of kin that he or she agreed to this.  That was in 1989 in the case of the Chairman.  The decision is still valid, as the Chairman still has the card.</p> <p>  In 1989 that might have been the only card in the Chairman's wallet but now there is pressure on cards to be included in a wallet.  We have many cards, whether we like that or not.  I suspect if the Chairman has the new format of driver licence, it has code 115 on it.</p></speech>

The donor card, which has been championed laudably by the Irish Kidney Association for four decades, is a call to arms.  It is a foil for discussion.  The register is potentially a more formal structure but, at the end of the day, the register in many ways ends up speaking to the converted.  With the infrastructure that the UK has put in, they at best get 40% of their population.  We would anticipate 5% to 10% of folk are not into this.  Then there is the population who will carry their donor card and will give.  We estimate that at best that is 40% of the population.  The remainder, 50%, are too busy and absolutely appropriately not thinking about organ donation.  The core issue is to have the medical staff and nursing staff there to support the families in the decision, an education programme, a public awareness programme and infrastructure to support those families.</p> <p>  There is no magic bullet.  It is about building a system like a jigsaw so that one has a comprehensive approach to organ donation.  As Mr. Murphy said, the Spaniards have achieved this over three decades.  We have made good progress since the European directive in 2012 but we are some way behind the sophistication of other jurisdictions.  We need to build that.</p> <p>  I emphasis that there is no magic bullet.  The legislation is not a magic bullet.  I was at pains to emphasise, while we have no legislation, that probably the jewel in the crown is the infrastructure to support the families.  We are in the business of saving lives and every effort is made to prevent somebody from dying.  In tragic circumstances, we hope to have the infrastructure in modern medicine, as compared to when I started in the business.  The intensive care units, the quality of care and the sophistication that goes on is breathtaking.  We hope that in the general population, underpinned by the legislation, the mood music will be that people will consider donation after death because it saves lives.</p></speech>

That will happen anyway.  That happens and it will happen.  The only difference is a "No" register.  The intensivists are a little worried that they will have to arguably waste valuable time consulting that register because the Bill insists that they consult the register before they proceed to ask the family.  They must check that the person is not on the register.  The Intensive Care Society is quite annoyed that its members will asked to do this, which, if one looks at the statistics, will probably turn out to be valid in 2% of the cases.</p></speech>

If we had a register of all the people who said "Yes", it would make many more decisions easier because the vast majority will say "Yes" to organ donation and the family would be able to be shown the data that Johnny registered ten years ago that he wished to be an organ donor.  One would be able to show the family.  Rather than having the donor card in someone's pocket and leaving it to chance, it would be there on the register.  The family, in the vast majority of cases will follow the decision, and studies from the UK prove that it is so in almost 99% of cases.</p> <p>  Regarding I stated earlier on the statistics, Professor Egan is correct.  In the middle, I have the nurse specialists who are the ones we do not have.  We need infrastructure to make this happen.  That relates to the conversion rate.  Being on the register and the nurse being present improved the data considerably to conversion from potential donor to actual donor, which is all about the consent.  Making it easier for the family at every stage and ensuring the specialist nurses have the data means I expect we could get half the population's data.  The UK has failed to do that.  Before we conduct a campaign, we will have 38% from the driver's licensing system.  Before we advertise, we will, therefore, have 38% of the adult population registered.  That is a gift that we must use and it would be a significant lost opportunity not to do it.</p> <p>  The consent systems are the same.  It is only a rewording of them.  I see no difference and I do not argue about it.  I only argue that having a "no" registry on its own is a lost opportunity.  We should have a "yes" registry.</p></speech>

It was stated that 80% are shown to support organ donation yet only one third of them carry the card.  Is it that they do not get around to doing it?</p></speech>

In fact, we would support it going forward as a public awareness initiative.  The key aspect of the change is that the expectation is that people would donate.  It is a societal shift.  That will become the default for society.  The expectation is that people will.  At the time, God forbid,  where there has been a road accident and next of kin are wondering about donation, if those involved from the medical perspective can say that donation is the expectation, it would be an important shift.  However, the family can veto it if they want.  It will take a few years for that to come through.</p> <p>  Mr. Murphy is arguing for the introduction of the current English system, which the English have now thrown out as they are bringing in a new system.  They have an opt-in and opt-out system and, as Professor Egan stated, only 40% have signed up to that.  This system means that there would be a much higher percentage of people consenting.</p></speech>

We think it is the best way forward.  The opt-out in and of itself is very important in that it gives a clear option to a person to opt out.  The thrust of the legislation relates to consent, and the background to it is the Madden report and issues relating to organ retention and so on.  That is very important on the one hand but, on the other, the idea of an opt-in register would have little status.  There was a conversation about the donor card, which is very worthwhile but does not have the status of a guarantee.  Much of the public thinks it does.  Contrary to some of the commentary, we think this legislation, with the publicity that will be needed and which was covered previously, will bring clarity to the public and encourage people to talk to their families.</p> <p>  Regarding the question of how many people might register if there were opt-in and opt-out options and the number of people in the middle who would not avail of either option, we think there is a big fear, shared by a great many people in the donation transplant world in Ireland, that non-registration could sow a doubt in the minds of the next of kin and family members about the deceased favouring donation.  Someone might say an option was available to opt in and that the deceased did not avail of it so perhaps that was a purposeful decision.  This gives rise to a further element of doubt.  That is one of the major reasons we are not in favour of both.</p></speech>

I echo what Deputy Murphy O'Mahony said.  Part of me thinks we should not have pre-legislative scrutiny on this and that we should just do implement it.  I will put my cards on the table.  There is cross-party consensus on this, as all parties are agreed on the need for it.  I am willing to be corrected on that, but that is certainly my understanding.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  One relates to the kidney sharing scheme.  My preference was for the hard opt-out option until I began to look into and read up on it.  Perhaps there is a bit of brutal efficiency in me or something.  It seemed to me that it would work a little better, but I take on board what has been said.  Mr. Conroy mentioned the kidney sharing scheme.  Could he take us through what that is, how it works now and how it will change if this legislation goes through?</p></speech>

They cannot give a kidney up for sharing into a pool.  In the general scheme, it is proposed that provision will be made for non-directed altruistic kidney donation.  This is where a donation is to be made into a transplant pool.  There is no direction such as, "I am not giving it to my brother" or "I am not giving it to my wife".  The donor is just putting it into the pool for the common good.  In this situation, the donor cannot specify the recipient's race, gender or sexual orientation and, therefore, the donor makes the donation as an altruistic action.  While everybody around this table is in favour of increasing organ donation and transplantation, we want to ensure we are not unduly hasty in taking organs.  An independent panel, which will include psychologists, ethicists and so on, is being set up to improve such donations such that a potential candidate would in the first instance interact with, say, Beaumont Hospital if he or she thought there was a potential there.  If things were going in the right direction, the matter would be referred to the panel.  The panel would then go through a process to ensure there was no pressure of any kind on the donor and that he or she was in good physical and mental health.  These are just safeguards to protect the donor in these situations.  Such a process has been used extensively in other countries, including Northern Ireland, which has a successful living kidney donor programme.  This will bring us into line with the those countries.  We hope it has the potential to increase the number of living donors.  We just want to ensure that it is done properly and that no impression is given of pressuring anybody to give-----</p></speech>

I have a friend who is a successful living donor.  It is a marvellous thing to do.  We need to ensure that the supports are in place for a person who has to take time off work or a person who attends to caring duties in the home to enable them to do this.</p> <p>  That brings me on to my next question, which concerns infrastructure and supports.  Let us imagine that tomorrow morning we snap our fingers, the legislation goes through and there is a massive awareness campaign.  However, we would not have the infrastructure in place if suddenly there was a massive uptake, and that is very much regrettable.  This legislation on its own will not make any changes.  I was very struck by the massive increase in the number of families willing to consider donation following a conversation with a specialist nurse.  I have represented for some time the transplant nurses in Beaumont Hospital.  They are the most amazing people but we just do not have enough of them.  They are brilliant at what they do, and I would be happy to put them in front of any family.  Nobody wants to have that conversation, but those people are the people to have it.  What kind of infrastructure deficit is there?  Are skilled personnel available but just not working in this jurisdiction?  Are they available and working elsewhere?  Would a specific training programme be needed?  Are advanced nurse practitioners needed?  I am not asking Mr. Conroy to put a figure on the deficit in personnel but I ask him to give us an indication of what is needed.  The last thing we want is to do what we believe is a good thing - and God knows precious little of what we do in here is ever perceived as good outside of here - only for it not to be matched by resources once it leaves here.  Will he give us just an indication of the resources needed and the lead-in time for them?  I refer to the education needed and so on.</p></speech>

We are now in a position where we need to develop a lot more.  I mentioned in my opening statement the procurement service through ODTI, which was a whole new ball game on that side.  We have had a number of developments in the transplant centres in the Mater, St. Vincent's and Beaumont.  I will not go into the details, but there have been a number of investments over recent years.</p> <p>  Regarding intensive care, I mentioned the clinical leads and organ donor nurses, but quality officers have been brought in.  I tend to think of this in terms of three legs to a stool.  We have improved very much on the procurement side.  We are reasonably well served on the transplant side.  We could do with more resources.</p><p>We do not think the legislation on its own will cause a jump in numbers.  The combination of all the things we are doing and the publicity will do that.

The bit that is not resourced as well as it could be is the retrieval service because people have to retrieve outside their ordinary jobs.  This causes a lot of disruption in hospitals for the people involved and because of knock-on effects on scheduled care, adding to queues and frustration among patients outside the transplant area.  The idea is to bring in a dedicated organ retrieval service, made up of people whose first priority will be retrieval.  They will work in hospitals in the normal way but when a retrieval opportunity comes up, that will be their first call.  There have been tensions in hospitals over this but a dedicated person for this purpose would be a huge step forward.  Our hope is that the legislation will bring pressures on us in terms of resources and we recognise that some necessary resources are coming next year.</p></speech>

We have made progress since the European directive in 2012 but we are some way behind the UK, which had a human tissue Bill in 2004, 15 years ago.  Other jurisdictions have been working on this for a long time and the Spaniards started in 1989.  We have got stuck into it in the past few years but we have a way to go.  We need at least &euro;2.1 million, in new money, to target organ donation and transplantation.  That would be distributed to the specialist nurses and the retrieval teams and would underpin the education of the relevant stakeholders.  I do not count the money for the register in this figure, nor that for the public awareness campaign.  I am talking about infrastructure money to support those extraordinary families and the extraordinary work that goes on in intensive care units on a 24-7 basis, 365 days a year including bank holidays, August, New Year's Eve and Christmas night, whenever the work goes on.  We need an infrastructure that covers 32 hospitals across the country.</p></speech>

They would be a mixture of doctors, retrieval surgeons and nurse specialists.  Other jurisdictions have invested heavily in this area because there is such a benefit to the health service, particularly in dialysis because we save patients' lives, such as that of Orla Tinsley.  We all know about Joe Brolly's altruistic donation and there is extraordinary, but welcome, downward pressure on organ donation rates as road traffic accidents reduce but it is much more complicated than when I started 30 years ago.  We need the infrastructure to support the transition from donation to transplant.</p></speech>

The lung transplant programme in the Mater Hospital for cystic fibrosis, with which I am familiar, is fantastic but at the moment most patients have to go to England, mostly to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.  This requires travel by aircraft, which is actually dangerous for people with reduced lung function.  It makes perfect sense for protocols to be put in place, and hopefully this will happen when Stormont is up and running again, so that the Mater hospital is at least a choice for people.  Other people might opt to go to England.  Clinicians in Belfast City Hospital in the North would be very much in favour of such a development.</p></speech>

A paired programme was mentioned and there is a paired exchange programme that is nothing to do with altruistic donations.  Where a husband or wife is not compatible to donate to the other, they can go to the British paired exchange system.  In this case, the husband may give his organ to a stranger and the stranger gives his to the man's wife.  It is a great system and the British have invited us into the system.  They benefit because they get a transplant out of it as well.  The system was to move to Northern Ireland about three years ago but it has not been able to do so because there is no one in Stormont to sign off on it.  The Irish travel to Coventry and expenses are paid by the Department for the transplant but it would be far easier for everyone if they could go to Belfast, and there would probably be no air travel.  The programme there is very successful and we would love it to be available.  The idea of a whole-Ireland procurement and transplant service makes so much sense that it will probably never happen.  This is nothing to do with Brexit but I do not expect to see it in my lifetime.  The EU has very little to do with it, and Brexit also has little to do with the health service.  We are not expecting the health service to be interfered with.  Our children's hearts, lungs and livers are transplanted in the UK under its deceased donor programmes and we are very grateful for that.  There is no expectation that it will change whatsoever.</p></speech>

My section in the Department works very closely with colleagues in the Department in the North who are working on the Altnagelvin radiotherapy project.  With the same group of people, we organised two workshops which Professor Egan and a number of clinicians and nurses from the South attended.</p><p>Both occasions in Belfast and Dublin were very well attended and there was great enthusiasm on both sides around the potential for co-operation.  It is certainly something that we are open to and I think they are too.  How it transpires over time remains to be seen.  Professor Egan may correct me, but I think there have been some patients from Northern Ireland who have had lung transplants in the Mater.  There is an openness to sharing and there is potential and it would be very beneficial.  </p><p> Only kidney transplants are done in the North, they do not do hearts, lungs etc.</p></speech>

I can testify that we work very closely with NHS Blood and Transplant, NHSBT.  It has formally invited us to support its retrieval services in Northern Ireland.  Regrettably, we are hampered because we lack the sufficient infrastructure to support that level of activity.  The infrastructure for retrieval is very challenging.  We have had detailed engagement with Mr. Conroy on this.  It is a crucially important goal to achieve.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that the donation rates in Northern Ireland are perhaps the strongest in the UK because it has a very robust publicity campaign.  We have met them and sought to learn from what they have done.  Mr. Murphy is correct, it is so sensible it probably will not happen.  We are working and have shared goals in the area.  We have a process around a memorandum of understanding, with Brexit looming, with NHSBT and around the kidney exchange programme.  We continue to work on that.  </p></speech>

When we met them yesterday, along with the Minister for Health, they were very careful not to attribute any of that to themselves personally.  As a neutral observer, however, I acknowledge the work that has been done by the family in particular.  They have been indefatigable in their efforts to highlight it and it has had a positive impact on organ donation for which they should be given credit.</p> <p>  Finally, is the register possible without a unique patient identifier or will it be made more challenging, to use a diplomatic phrase, by the lack of one?</p></speech>

It is a technical piece of work that would be built so that in the future it could be linked to a unique identifier.  The idea that an individual would register themselves is outside of whether an identifier exists or not.  It would be outside of the hospital or medical environment.</p></speech>

Before I leave, I think we should note the families who, in tragic circumstances, give an absolutely irreplaceable gift.  We owe them a debt of gratitude as we do to people such as Nicola McKenna and Enda Fanning who are living donors.  Everything we are doing here is to enhance and add to the work that they have done.</p></speech>

The success or failure of any campaign depends entirely on public confidence in how this is done and the degree to which that is satisfied.  Professor Egan mentioned the hasty retrieval, responding to a point around the Chairman's donor card - not that we would ever wish that.  Following the last speaker's observations, we must be particularly conscious of the donors who in very trying circumstances over a long number of years have made donations.  That also applies to live donors.</p> <p>  In the event of an accident, what are the procedures to ensure that there is not a hasty retrieval while living up to the expectations of the legislation?</p></speech>

All the resources that would be focused in trauma are around resuscitating the patient and aiming to secure his or her survival.  Clinically, then, the doctors have indicators as to the likelihood of death.  Only in those circumstances would folk consider organ donation as a possibility.  If the situation is deemed to be futile, then organ donation may be considered.</p></speech>

The death of the brain is defined very clearly according to clinical circumstances.  The doctors do specific tests to see if the brain is functioning.  They can use additional testing such as CT scans, imaging of the brain and so on to ascertain whether it has functional capacity for the future.  That is brain death.  It is an uncommon event but might happen if a person fell off a ladder and banged their head.  The more common definition of death is when the heart stops.  The general public has a greater appreciation of that mode of death.  It is only after those events, if I understand the Deputy's question correctly, after the definition of brain death and after the heart stops that the donation process would commence.</p></speech>

Some years ago, I was a member of a committee in Brussels when there was some animation around the unauthorised retention of human tissue.  It caused quite a stir.  Returning to public confidence in the system, we must be absolutely certain that these things do not happen because then the system will not work, public confidence will erode and it will break down.</p> <p>  A Bill on human tissue retention, the Title of which I cannot recall, was going through the Houses although it has not yet passed.  I think it related to maternity hospitals.  That is apropos of nothing other than the issue of public confidence.</p></speech>

However, we found organs were also being stored in Dublin.  That did rock the public's view of organ donation and the donor card and was damaging.  That is the reason for this Act 20 years later.  The previous Act, the 1832 Human Anatomy Act, that we are rescinding here had an element of presumption of consent.  Now, we are introducing a presumption of consent within this Bill, which I think is dangerous.  As a consequence of the old Act, and the retention of children's organs in Dublin maternity hospitals and children's hospitals, we have this Bill some 19 years later.</p><p>The legislation was talked about for over a decade.  Now, in the legislation, we are introducing a presumption of consent, which we have already found was dangerous and inappropriate.  Here we are introducing it again but we are not actually because the wording is a presumption of consent but the practice is not so.  We are just worried that the public will get the wrong view.  Indeed, it is the confidence of the public that we want to retain and that is why we want the "Yes" and "No" bits included, which fixes the matter for us and restores the public's confidence in this process that we are doing today.  </p></speech>

In terms of underpinning public confidence, we have a Government structure.  For example, if somebody rings us and says he or she is unhappy with something then we log it, record it, meet our quality managers and we seek to address any concerns that come by way of phone, email or formal complaints and then effect actions to support any imperfections in the system.  The process reassures people in terms of public confidence.</p> <p>  There had been a lot of debate on whether the soft opt-out would be a separate piece of legislation.  Maybe I am stealing Mr. Conroy's thunder here but we have distinct sections in the legislation to address that so Part 2 relates specifically to transplant.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Conroy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#N00700"><p>The piece that has been recalled is on post-mortems and the retention of organs and tissue in the 1990s.  I mentioned previously the Madden report and that is the background of a Bill on consent for human organs and tissue, which is covered in this.  The provisions about post-mortem specifically covers the issues that appeared at that time.  It is separate to transplant and they were linking in with anatomical examination, public display and so on.</p> <p>  On transplants, in the commentary on the ethical importance of consent, which accompanies the World Health Organization's guiding principles on human cell tissue and organ transplantation it states that people should be fully informed of the opt-out system and be provided with an easy means of opting out.  That is one of the objectives on the transplant side of this Bill linked to the past - that people will have an opt-out system.  There will not be any push on taking organs from a person.  We do not want the impression given that that might, at any stage, be done so we want a very clear opt-out where a person can opt out and the family will not be approached.  The ODTI representatives can speak more on the details of the register.  It is envisaged that there will be a renewal of an opt-out.  In other words, a person will be contacted periodically to confirm that that is still his or her wish.  It will not be a case of going on a register when one is 20 years of age and maybe having a totally different view at 45 years and forgetting one is on a register and so on.  </p></speech>

We have spent a lot of time engaging with our European counterparts and have developed memorandums of understanding, MoUs, with Eurotransplant.  Geographically, and because time is very short, when an organ is out of the body we end up working closely with the UK.  That goes back to the discussion point about Northern Ireland.  The reality is we must work very closely with the UK, particularly around organ sharing.  The UK has strengths and weaknesses as do we but we will continue to work with other jurisdictions.  Europe is very healthy because it brings a lot of good quality benchmarks to be achieved.  We will work both with continental Europe and the UK in that regard.</p></speech>

The people in the HSE who run the treatment abroad scheme have been in contact and they visited all of the hospitals that interact on organ donation here.  There is a willingness on both sides.

They have also given a sense of purpose and achievement to the unfortunate people who became donors due to accidents or whatever the case.  There was something for those unfortunate people where otherwise there might be little satisfaction in the midst of their sorrow.

I, too, pay tribute to the families who have in the most awful of circumstances given the gift of life to complete strangers.  I pay tribute to the late Senator Feargal Quinn who championed this case long before it was popular, and long before people were aware of the consequences of not having a functioning organ donation system, which we currently do not have because this legislation is the first legislation on organ donation in the history of the State that is Irish legislation.  The only legislation we have was brought in by the European Union, which the head of the Spanish transplant authority said was the worst implementation of the organ donation directive in the European Union.  Therefore, we took our one chance but did not do it well for all sorts of reasons that I shall not go into today.</p> <p>   We are now faced with an opportunity to create a better system.  We are way behind where Spain was because that country started in the 1980s and even Croatia, which has not been mentioned today.  The issue of presumed consent has not been discussed.  We had two days of hearings about presumed consent.  Everyone walked out the door and said that presumed consent was the way to go and then the view changed to one of presumed consent in addition to which one must ask the families.  The latter scared people because people thought Ireland was bringing in the Austrian system that has presumed consent.  The option did not work anywhere.  Spain brought it in, it did not work and they eventually figured out what works.  Information works as do systems that are properly resourced, as Professor Egan and Mr. Conroy have pointed out.  One can have presumed consent.  One can also have required request, which is in America.  I am surprised the option is not in the legislation but it needs to be inserted.  The option has been introduced in Wisconsin and other jurisdictions.  Professor Egan might answer my next questions.  What hospitals have failed to provide organ donors in the last ten years?  Has he a hospital in mind?</p></speech>

The legislation does not address this issue.  That is why pre-legislative scrutiny is important.  The Bill should have a section to require hospitals to have a system in place.  I admit that not all hospitals have the same level of resources.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy might enlighten us further.</p></speech>

The hospital needs to have a bed available in the intensive care unit.  I will offer a good example which involves hospitals not too far from the Senator's constituency.  The worst year for organ donations was 2010, when there were 58 donors.  In that year Bantry hospital had three organ donors, while Cork University Hospital, CUH, had one.  Bantry hospital is now incapable of managing an organ donor because it no longer has an intensive care bed.  There are differences and quirks.  The quirk in CUH has not been repeated.  It had never previoulsy had fewer than eight organ donors, but in that year it had one.  I went ballistic when it became obvious.  The hospital has not had such a low figure since.  It was astonishing that a small hospital in Bantry had three donors, while CUH, the second biggest head trauma hospital in the country, had one.  It comes down to the individuals working in the intensive care units of hospitals and it is not somehting that will be changed by legislation.  The infrastructure must change in order for donation rates to increase.</p></speech>

The situation has changed slightly since the appointment of a donation nurse to each of the six hospital groups.  One can argue that is not enough, but they have had an impact, on which we hope to build.  I agree with Senator Mark Daly that spikes were evident in small hospitals where, obviously, a person was spreading the message of organ donation and it was having an impact.</p></speech>

We accept that there are quirks, but it should not come down to the fact that one hospital has an enthusiastic nurse or consultant and another does not.  There should be a properly resourced system in place.</p> <p>  Will the position on the issue related to cardiac deaths change under the legislation?  Does it need to be changed?  Professor Egan referred to brain injury.  Will that aspect be provided for in the legislation?  Will there be clear guidance for consultants on how it will work or will things be left as they are?  It would be helpful if they were.  As Mr. Watt, Mr. Murphy and the other delegates are aware, the cost over a decade of people awaiting a transplant is nearly &euro;10 billion, which is big money.  How much would be saved if we were to put in place the system Professor Egan, Mr. Conroy and all others in the health service want?  We would save millions of euro.</p> <p>  Croatia had a system of presumed consent for kidney transplants and so on, but it did not work.  It realised that what was needed was nurses and a system for retrieving organs and transplanting them into people who needed them.  That is how we will save the health system money and it should be the aim of every health committee.  It is possible to achieve it through this legislation because people wait too long for a transplant under the current system.  Does Professor Egan know the number of people who died having been taken off a transplant list because they had become too ill while waiting for a transplant?  They died because the system was not working.</p> <p>  My driving licence has the code 115 noted on the back such that my niece will know to donate my organs when my time comes.  I will have nothing else to give away.  The roles of the committee and the delegates are so important because what matters is what works.  The Spanish health service discovered that what worked was nurses who specialised in organ donation.  What also works is knowledge, that is, a family knowing that their loved one wanted to be an organ donor.  Carrying an organ donor card is one way to impart that knowledge, if one is lucky enough to find it.  A person can also discuss the matter with his or her family.  If the video of my stating I wish to give away my organs can be retrieved, that is fine.</p> <p>  The system being proposed will not work.  The evidence shows - correct me if I am wrong - that 29.8% of families consent to donation without knowledge of their loved one's wishes or being asked to donate by a nurse.  The families just offer to donate the organs, which is great.  Some 57% give consent if they have no knowledge of their loved one's intentions but are asked to donate by a specialist nurse.  That is why we need specialist nurses.  That is why they were put in place in Spain.  Some 93.9% of families who they know what their loved one's intentions are and are asked to donate consent to the donation.  That is the success rate we want to achieve, but the legislation will not bring it about.  All it will do is create an opt-out system that will tell the families of people among the 2% to 5% - it is 6% in Wales - who will choose to opt out that their loved one did not wish to be an organ donor.  It is a negative measure.</p> <p>  Some 1 million people have indicated on their driving licence that they wish to be an organ donor.  I twice asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, whether he would give that information to the Department of Health.  He initially told me that he would not do so, citing data protection concerns.  I pointed out that the Department shared the information on persons' driving licences with eFlow, private clamping companies, car parking companies, the Garda, the Courts Service and approximately 15 other organisations, but he was not willing to share it with the Department of Health.  He has changed his tune and claimed that the Department of Health does not want the information.  The information that would help families to make the decision is often contained on a person's driving licence.  It is held by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but the Department of Health does not want it.  If it was handed over such that the family would be aware of their loved one's intentions and they were asked by a nurse to consider donation, it would increase the rate of organ donation to 93.9%.  Much of what we can do is available to us, although hospitals need further resources for nurses, which is important.  It is a systems failure.  The committee should suggest the legislation require the Department of Health to receive the information.  If the committee decides to approve the opt-out system, that information should also be available.  In potential cases of organ donation, the staff should make one telephone call to discover whether the person had opted out and, if not, another to ascertain whether he or she had indicated on his or her driving licence that he or she wished to be an organ donor.  I note Mr. Watt's observation that only 38% people in England indicated their wish to be a donor.  However, every inch we can move people along to make that decision will make a difference.  I ask that arising from this meeting the committee recommend that the information held on driving licences be utilised.  It is available, but the Department of Health does not want it, even though it would help families.  All it would take is a simple telephone call to the licensing authority under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

One point on which I disagree relates to the academic research on the issue.</p><p>In 2017 the <i>British Medical Journal</i>carried out a systematic review of all published data worldwide to determine whether there was a positive association between opt-out legislation and higher rates of donation.  In five methodologically sound studies which compared donation rates in a single country, it found that there had been an increase in donation rates following the introduction of such legislation.  Welsh, Scottish and English legislators have all carried out systematic reviews to back their choices to introduce soft opt-out legislation.  They have looked at the evidence in that regard.  Our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament have looked at the international evidence which clearly shows a positive association between soft opt-out legislation and higher donation rates.</p></speech>

The other potential threat is that it is unlikely we would have a 100% penetration rate across the population.  People are, naturally and appropriately, not in this zone.  We have heard informally that in other jurisdictions in cases where people had not put their names on the positive register, their families inferred that they did not support organ donation and that they, therefore, should not go ahead and donate.  There are some threats in that system.  Let us emphasise again that nurses' support for families and education are the jewels in the crown.</p></speech>

We all accept that a family's knowledge of the potential donor's intentions is crucial.  I also accept the Senator's figure of 93%.  We accept, as would everybody, that if a person's name was on an opt-in register, in whatever form it would take - moving from one system to another in respect of use of the driving licence would create technical problems, but that is not my point - it is likely that the next of kin would honour his or her intentions, although that would not be guaranteed.  The problem is that a large proportion of the population will be on neither one register nor the other, regardless of the means by which the register is run.  Many are of the opinion that it could sow doubt in people's minds and potentially lead to fewer donations.</p></speech>

It is essential to have a "No" registry along with a "Yes" registry.  In that way, those who have made a decision would be captured.  As the others would not have said "Yes" or "No", one would not be able to say they had said "No".  If there were both "Yes" and "No" registers, both options would be available.  Using the driving licence does not give an the option to say "No".  Therefore, a "No" registry is needed.  The two registers should be merged.  They should cover both choices.  More than 50% of adults in some US states have indicated their wish on their driving licence.  Perhaps more Americans than Irish people drive, but it is a fact that the rate has reached 50%.  That should be the target.  If 50% of the population have made a decision, organ donation rates will increase.</p></speech>

There may be a number of them, of whom the vast majority may be in favour of donation.  There cannot be any element of coercion, but in that situation every opportunity should be given to the family.  Professor Egan may wish to talk about some of the details, but the idea is that there must be no push.  However, one hopes they will come to a consensus in favour of donation.  There cannot be a push and I do not think it is a weakness.  At the end of the day, the Bill is about consent which we must achieve in an agreed format.

I have been listening very carefully.  I thank the Chairman for a moment to say a word from the patient's point of view.  I am a patient, just like my colleague Mr. McCutcheon, and I have been through the system from the inside.  I have listened to this debate for the last two hours and heard many interesting points of view.  It seems at the end of the day that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet and all have the one aim, which is to increase organ donation.  I look back at my experience as a patient.  Some 11 years ago, I was called in and a family had been asked the crucial question.  The right approach had been made.  I went through and here I am now, in perfect health.  If my donor had been in a different hospital, the result clearly would have been different if that approach had not been made.  It seems to me that all the suggestions that have been made have been useful and constructive but the key one from the patient's perspective is that there must be the right connection in the hospital at the coalface, at the crucial time.  If that happens, organ donation will be increased.  The infrastructure must be there, with a coterie of properly and fully-trained specialist nurses who are able to communicate with the family.  One cannot expect the intensivists or intensive care unit nurses to do it.  They do it and what has happened is wonderful but by how much could it be increased if the real specialist nurses were located in all relevant hospitals?</p></speech>

The Irish Medical Organisation would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to discuss the critical issue of medical workforce planning and the crisis in medical staffing, which is having a significant impact on the delivery of healthcare services in Ireland.  The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, is the trade union and representative body for all doctors in Ireland and welcomes the opportunity to highlight the issues of recruitment and retention that exist across our health services in both the acute and community settings.</p> <p>  The main point we wish to make today is that the crisis in medical manpower this country is facing is having severe adverse effects on patients with growing waiting lists and inability to deliver appropriate and timely care.  During the austerity years we repeatedly warned that cuts to our health services would lead to a reduction in services, longer waiting lists and an inability to recruit and retain medical practitioners.  It gives us no pleasure to say this has now come to pass but we again use this opportunity to call on this committee and the Government to seriously address the deficits that exist in our medical workforce as to do so would improve the overall health of our nation. </p> <p>  The key contributing factors to the current crisis in medical manpower can be identified as including the absence of planning and investment for the number of doctors required to meet the health needs of a changing demographic of patients.  Also, Ireland's population is growing but the key factor in terms of planning is the increase in the rate of growth of those over the age of 60.  In order to meet the increased but expected needs of the population we need more doctors.  To put that in perspective, up to 2008, one in ten patients were over the age of 65, between 2008 and 2028, one in five patients will be over the age of 65 and, by 2040, one in four patients will be over the age of 65.  That gives members an idea of the scale of the problem that awaits us down the road.  The latest OECD figures show that with 1.44 specialists per 1,000 population, Ireland has the lowest number of medical specialists in the EU, with the EU average being 2.48 per 1,000 population.  The HSE's national doctor training and planning, NDTP, office shows approximately 520 consultant posts remain unfilled or filled on a temporary basis while figures obtained by the IMO show that almost half of consultant posts advertised by the HSE in 2018 received few suitable candidates or qualified applicants, or none at all.  The demographic of the workforce at specialist level is very challenging with a high level of expected retirements in the coming years.  More than 700 general practitioners are due to exit the system in the next five years, a quarter of consultants are due to retire in the next ten years and 50% of our public health specialists are due to retire in the next five years.  The direct consequences of this lack of planning are that in many areas such as consultant staffing levels, the staffing levels fall well below the recommended ratios by the national clinical programmes and colleges.  In orthopaedics, paediatrics and psychiatry, the consultant staffing levels are 50% below recommended staffing levels while in ophthalmology the staffing levels can be up to 70% lower than what is recommended.  More than 770,000 patients are currently on hospital waiting lists.  In many areas of the country patients cannot register with a GP due to lack of capacity which has a negative knock-on effect of increased presentations to an already stretched GP out-of-hours service and in emergency departments across the country. </p> <p>  A significant factor is that a poorly resourced health service and a hostile overly pressurised work environment are leading to high levels of emigration of doctors.  More than 700 graduates enter basic training each year in Ireland, however, we are training are doctors for export.  Since 2015, the number of voluntary withdrawals from the register has almost doubled from 828 to 1,453 in 2018.  Data from the Medical Council show that approximately a third are Irish graduates while almost a quarter leave the specialist register.  While a small percentage leave to retire, the vast majority, almost 70%, leave to practise medicine in another country.  Reasons cited include understaffing, expectation to carry out many non-core tasks, lack of respect, limited career progression, higher earnings abroad, family reasons, more flexible training options abroad, lack of support from employer, longer working hours, poor quality of training and the list goes on.  There is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that doctors are suffering from burnout due to the highly pressurised working environment and this, coupled with a lack of support from the employer, is a significant contributing factor to emigration.  Doctors are trained over many years to deliver high quality and appropriate care to patients.  The lack of investment in our public health services makes it almost impossible for doctors to deliver that care in a timely manner due to the lack of beds, understaffing, poor access to diagnostics and access to other healthcare professionals, including counselling services, occupational health services and physiotherapy.  This starts with GPs being unable to access timely referrals for patients and carries on through to the hospital system or community system with intolerable and dangerous waiting times for outpatient appointments and then in many cases long delays before the prescribed treatment can be delivered.  The health capacity report clearly identifies the deficits in terms of infrastructure within the system yet the policy of the Government is to significantly increase investment in the private system through the National Treatment Purchase Fund while starving the public system of the required investment.  Our GP workforce is also emigrating.  A survey by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, of GP trainees and graduates in 2017 revealed that one in five recently qualified GPs had already emigrated, while a further 30% of newly qualified GPs were considering emigration.  While more than 50% of GP trainees envisage themselves as GP principals in a partnership or group practice in ten years&rsquo; time, and that signifies intent, concerns about the viability of general practice, financial prospects and quality of life are the key factors influencing their decision to migrate.  It is important to note that the recent GP agreement merely provided a pathway to reinstate the funds lost during the years of austerity and what is required is significant planned investment in the development of GP services for patients. </p> <p>  Another factor is the failure to make our public health services an employer of choice for medical professionals and a culture of disrespect of doctors by the employer and the Government.  Our doctors continue to emigrate to health systems that pay more, offer better supports and reasonable working environments and that value doctors.</p><p>Over the past five years, the IMO, on behalf of its members, has been forced by the Government and the HSE to take legal action to enforce legally binding contracts entered into by the employer.  This has been necessary to ensure doctors work safe and legal hours and to allow doctors to be represented in respect of contractual matters.  This does not assist in the development of a culture of respect in which employees are valued.  Consultants who were employed prior to 2012 were denied their contractual payments.  Those payments were eventually secured on foot of legal action.  Consultants who were employed after 2012 were subject to a discriminatory and unilateral cut of 30% in addition to the cuts applied across the public service.  The impact of this policy has been the HSE's inability to recruit consultants, which has led to more than 500 vacant posts and more than 100 non-specialist doctors working in consultant posts.  Examples of this shortcoming can be seen throughout the country.  It has been most recently evidenced by the inability to recruit sufficient consultants for the opening of the first phase of the national children's hospital and the increasing problems in psychiatry services.</p><p> Rather than increasing our consultant staffing levels, we are becoming increasingly reliant on foreign-trained doctors.  More than 40% of doctors who are registered in Ireland received their training overseas.  Research shows that most foreign-trained doctors intend to move on by returning home or migrating onwards.  They are concerned about deskilling and are disillusioned by the lack of training and career opportunities.  In effect, we are creating a transient workforce in perpetuity.  That is not good for the health service or for patients.  NCHD contracts are routinely breached by hospitals.  Doctors are forced to work in excess of legal hours and are not paid for all the hours worked.  Many of them have spoken of poor and inflexible training with poor career progression options.  Our research suggests that two thirds of NCHDs perceive pay to be the principal reason for emigrating.  Some 83% of them believe the pay disparity at consultant level will be a factor when they are deciding whether to apply for consultant posts in Ireland.  The pay disparities between consultants who were employed before and after 2012 are up to &euro;50,000 a year.  These colleagues are doing the same job and carrying the same level of responsibility.</p><p> Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries because specialists in public health medicine are not remunerated on an equal basis to other consultant specialists in the health system, even though they are required to be on the specialist register and must undergo specialist training.  If they were properly resourced, public health doctors could play a pivotal role in commissioning services, analysing health data, conducting needs assessments, assembling the evidence base for interventions, monitoring services and quality-assuring parts of the health service such as screening services.  The development of general practice is the cornerstone of many reform proposals, including Sl&aacute;intecare.  Until recently, GPs have been left to shoulder the burden of reduced funding while delivering a greater level of service.  There is no clear strategy or funding for the development of general practice.  All the factors that have led to this crisis have been much publicised and highlighted by the profession and the IMO for many years.  Lack of commitment, investment and respect by successive Governments and the HSE have led to low morale among the existing workforce and high levels of emigration.  There is an inability to recruit sufficient doctors to deliver existing levels of care or develop new services.  We are at a tipping point.  Unless we seriously address this problem, doctors fear for the health service and the safe delivery of care to patients.  More reports and promises of reform are not required by the health service and patients.  It is not helpful to talk about black holes in the health budget.  Contrary to the spin about high levels of health spending, the budget is insufficient to meet the needs of the population.  It is time for politicians and policymakers to be honest about this.</p><p> Immediate steps must be taken to resolve the medical manpower issue.  The discriminatory pay issue for consultants must be resolved.  Until this has been dealt with, there can be no new contract discussions, which are required for any reform measures, and we cannot hope to recruit consultants to our public health services.  There is no defence for the current policy.  The impact of this politically motivated 30% cut has been disastrous for patients and services.  There is a need to invest in capacity and supports within general practice to allow it to develop and deliver a fuller range of care in the community.  Eligibility for medical cards and doctor visit cards should be expanded on the basis of means or medical need, rather than on the basis of age.  The long-held tradition of successive Governments using medical cards as vote-getting exercises must stop.</p><p> The training of doctors must be modernised to reflect changes in the practice of medicine and in the demographics of doctors in training.  Initiatives are required to bring arrangements for the duration of training into line with international norms.  A differentiated model, which provides clearer career paths with greater predictability of training arrangements, responsibilities, locations and working conditions, must be developed in line with the recommendations of the report of the strategic review of medical training and career structures, which is known as the MacCraith review.  In excess of 700 doctors enter basic specialist training every year, but an average of just 484 doctors enter higher specialist training.  We are just about training enough specialists to replace the number of specialists who leave the register each year.  There seems to be a mismatch in the number of posts on offer.  Approximately 55 higher specialist training posts are not filled each year in other specialties.  There are insufficient training posts on offer to meet demand or the shortage of consultants in that speciality.  Vacant posts in public health and community health are putting health planning and the delivery of vital vaccination and screening programmes at risk.  The Crowe Horwath report, which was commissioned by the Department of Health, must be implemented to improve the role and function of public health specialists and the training and career structure of public health medicine.  Its implementation is required to ensure public health specialists are valued and offered contractual terms in line with other specialists.</p><p> Doctors want to work in a system in which they can care for patients.  That is why we became doctors.  Care delayed is care denied.  The cost of denying care has never been assessed in terms of the personal cost to the patient's quality of life, the cost to the system of delivering more expensive and complex care at later stages and the cost to society of days of work lost and benefit payments as many patients await care that will allow them to live full and productive lives.  We need reform that makes a difference to patients.  Any reform is simply impossible in the context of the current medical workforce crisis.  In the absence of significant and appropriate investment, reports and reform proposals are making the situation worse rather than better.  There can be no hope of reforming the system, or developing new and much needed services, if the current level of understaffing in the system persists.  We must have a system that cares for patients and values doctors.  We have seen the consequences of a system that does neither.</p></speech>

It is difficult to know where to start with his statement.  It is pretty damning stuff.  It depicts a healthcare system and a workforce in crisis.  How many doctors are we short?  Dr. McGarry might start with the hospitals before moving onto GPs.  There are meant to be approximately 3,300 hospital consultants, but we are approximately 500 short in terms of full-time posts.  Even if an additional 500 consultants were recruited tomorrow, Ireland would still have the lowest number of hospital consultants anywhere in Europe.  It can be estimated that to get to the European average, the additional 500 consultants we are currently missing would need to be hired as well as another 2,500 thereafter.  If the Government is ambitious about our healthcare system, it must admit that the shortfall is approximately 3,000 consultants rather than 500.  Given that we have approximately 3,000 hospital consultants, the Government needs to double the current number to get to the European average.  We should probably be a bit more ambitious for our country and for our people than to be at the European average.</p> <p>  Dr. McGarry has given us worrying figures relating to to public health specialists.</p><p>Up to half of them are due to retire in the next five years.  We have about half the number of orthopaedic surgeons, paediatricians and psychiatrists we need and 30% of the number of ophthalmologists.  There is a crisis with the shortage of hospital consultants in particular hospitals and specialties.  For particular towns, villages and cities, it is even worse.</p><p> Do the witnesses know if there is a plan anywhere in the HSE or the Department that states this is the number of consultants required per hospital, per specialty or per hospital group, or even just for the country, over the next five to ten years?  Is there a workforce plan which states the number of consultants needed to be hired, including all those we know who will retire, which will get us to an agreed figure, say the European average?  Does that exist?</p></speech>

In my speciality, psychiatry, we have A Vision for Change.  There are models of care in different specialties.  There is a variety of documents which state the numbers needed for the population.  Some 17 years ago, we had the Hanly report, which stated how many consultants were needed for our population.</p> <p>  The problem is that it is disparate.  There does not seem to be one single document or one single plan.  While I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s point, when one looks at the statistics from the Central Statistics Office, the population increased by 64,000 between April 2018 and April 2019.  Even if we have a document stating how many consultants we need now, if that rate of increase continues, then in five years&rsquo; time the population will have increased by 300,000.

Currently, we are training approximately 180 per year.  It is expected that should rise to 280 to deal with the requirements.  That is in the expectation, however, that if one trains 280, they will be retained within the system.  Our problem is that they are not being retained in the system.  It is difficult to put a plan in place from a numbers point of view if one does not know how many will stay.  The problem is that they are not choosing to enter general practice in Ireland.  Instead, they are choosing to do so in other jurisdictions.  There is a notional number out there of how many are needed but that does not reflect the situation on the ground.</p></speech>

At the end of that level, one would expect to arrive at the numbers needed.  That is what is on the ground.  The problem, however, is that we are not retaining them and, unfortunately, they are going elsewhere.  The underlying problems causing the lack of retention are the real issue.  One could possibly retain them through creating the right environment.  Many GPs have left Ireland  If the environment in which GPs work was brought to a more favourable position, one could see a return of numbers which may make up the shortfall.  At the moment, that is not the case.</p></speech>

We got a provision for its reversal this year.  It was not done as quickly as we wanted, but we achieved it for the IMO.  Is it working?</p></speech>

The first amount was paid in July.  While it is elcome to see the reversal, it is very early days.  There has been a history among younger doctors of looking at older doctors struggling under the FEMPI legislation and they have almost been conditioned to be beaten down.  The change of attitude will take a while.  I hope the reversal of the  FEMPI cuts will bring it about.  It behoves us to educate younger GPs coming on board that there is a future because of the reversal.  One must remember that it is not additional money, that it is only restoring what was taken off in the first place.  The top line cut was 38%-----</p></speech>

Interestingly, I use as a barometer talking to reps because they all see GPs.

Having sat where they are on more than one occasion, I know that they are not health economists and I do not expect them to be, but they have given the committee a very interesting and important perspective from the front line, to which we would do well to listen.</p> <p>  One of my questions relates to the production of reports.  I am aware that people might say, "If we just had another consultant's report," or that if we just fling another few million euro at one of the big consulting firms, somehow a solution will fall out of the sky.  I share Dr. Sadlier's aspiration to have a fully staffed team in north Dublin, but I do not think it will come via the few million euro spent on a consultant's report.  Sinn F&eacute;in asked about issue this recently in a parliamentary question.  Millions of euro are spent by the Department of Health on reports.  One could line the walls of this place with them.  They possibly could do it to provide extra insulation and it would provide value for the money spent.  Nothing is done.  A Vision for Change is a great strategy, but not if it is not implemented.  I contend that there is a lot of evidence that more implementation plans or another consultant's report are not needed, that what is actually needed is the political will to get on and get the job done.  The first moratorium on recruitment in the health service was brought forward two years ahead of everywhere else in 2007.  We cannot ignore the fact that while the moratorium had a detrimental impact on every Department, for the Department of Health and the HSE the impact was felt two years earlier.  Sometimes this is forgotten when we talk about the overall health spend.  It is a large amount of money, but Dr. Sara Burke, for example, has said we are just plugging a gap and trying to make up for decades of under-investment, with a population increase.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on whether another report might help.  I do not believe it would, but I am open to hearing from the representatives if they think one is necessary.</p></speech>

There is definitely a phenomenon of reform fatigue among people like us on the front line of the health service.  We need incremental improvements on the front line, not overarching structural changes to the structure of the health service.  I did not start my working life in the HSE, I started it in the health boards.  I have worked for 19 years in the HSE, health boards, community health organisations, integrated care areas and the National Hospitals Office.  Again, we are to have another set of reforms and another set of structural top-level reforms.  Will they, however, deliver an extra occupational therapist in Mulhuddart?  Will they deliver an extra clinical psychologist in another part of the country?  The point is that we are advocating for front-line services.  We know where the deficits are and hat the problems are.</p></speech>

The report was commissioned in 2015 or 2016 and presented to the Department of Health in 2018.  We had to threaten industrial action to see it, not even to implement it.  Do we need more reports?  Perhaps we might get on with discussing and implementing the reports we have received, rather than going for more.  The current consultants' committee chairman has said there is one iron law in health - no report has ever been fully implemented.</p></speech>

We often hear people say if there was another report by a consultancy firm, it might crack it, but I cannot see it.</p> <p>  The IMO's colleagues from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association were before the committee last week.  I have also spoken to colleagues who are members of both unions and neither and they have referred to the revolving door created by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  They have outlined a scenario where the person who has waited the longest will be offered an appointment in the private health sector with a consultant, with the patient then being returned to be added to another list for treatment.  Is that the delegates' experience of how the system operates?  It appears to be a very cynical exercise in waiting list manipulation which does not necessarily move people any closer to receiving the treatment they need.  I am interested in hearing the views of the delegates in that regard.</p></speech>

However, I have heard from those involved in other specialties that some of the movement of patients to the appointments with the NTPF takes place under the triage system.   There is no doubt that some of those on waiting lists will be removed by use of the triage system to be assessed.  Some patients who need surgery or a procedure to be performed, as the Deputy said, will join a further waiting list.</p></speech>

In the case of community mental health teams, for example, often there will be a waiting time to be seen by the team, but once a person is seen, he or she is put on an internal invisible waiting list to be seen by a psychologist, an occupational therapist, a social worker and so on.   There are internal waiting lists within the system that are blind when it comes to the public figures.</p></speech>

The figures that we are being presented with seem to show that we are on the cusp of compliance with the working time directive.  These are HSE figures but anecdotal evidence and evidence from the Medical Council's own surveys suggests that we are quite some way from compliance.  We are conducting a survey at the moment, which is still open.  We have had several hundred responses so far, which is pretty good in medical terms because doctors are suffering from survey fatigue as well as work fatigue.  Approximately half of those who have responded to us are still working in excess of 24-hour shifts, with a slightly smaller number working in excess of 48-hour weeks.  The Your Training Counts survey suggested that one third of respondents were working in excess of 60 hours per week.  This is not good.  We are not there yet but we are better than we were previously.  There is still some way to go but we cannot begin to crack the nut until we see accurate and transparent figures from the HSE and other employers.</p></speech>

If every NCHD worked his or her rostered hours, we would not have been sitting in the room.  The issue is the additional hours that are worked on top of the rostered hours.  Hopefully, that will be reflected in the Medical Council's survey because it is important.  I am not seeking to undermine or contradict the HSE figures but it would be wrong to believe that the problem is fixed.  Admittedly, it is closer to being fixed which is very welcome.</p> <p>  On the issue of those who are not on the specialist register but who are practising as consultants, I have seen correspondence from the HSE advising that no specific supervision arrangements are in place for that group of doctors.  My reading is that there could not be specific, one-to-one supervision because if there was someone available to do such supervision, he or she could do the work.  I have had conversations with people in the HSE about this issue.  There does not seem to be any target in terms of converting these people.  I would not try to interfere with any person's lawful entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration but there does not seem to be any major push from the HSE to get these people onto the register or to intervene.  When a person has a lawful entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration, there is nothing that can, or should, be done about that.  Does the Medical Council have any information to suggest that there is any effort being made to tackle this?  I also ask the witnesses to comment on the supervision arrangements.</p></speech>

Ultimately, that is the problem, in terms of trying to fill posts.  We have doctors who are not on the specialist register but who should be on it.  Some of those doctors are qualified and experienced and come from countries where they had difficulties with registration.  That is a legal issue and we will not get into that here.  Some of those doctors are operating in places where they probably need some supervision.  There are local supervision arrangements in place but, at a national level, there is no supervision policy of which I am aware.  The solution to the problem is to reverse the 30% pay cut for new entrants.  That pay cut created this issue.  It has created a cohort of agency-paid consultants who are probably costing the health service more than a reversal of the pay cut would cost.  However, for reasons that I cannot understand, this system has continued since 2012.</p></speech>

There has been a suggestion, with which Sinn F&eacute;in agrees, that if the facility to order diagnostic tests is extended to GPs, this will have a positive impact on waiting lists.  It is one thing to extend that facility but it is quite another to ensure the services are available.  Has the Medical Council had discussions with the Department of Health on facilitating GPs to order diagnostic tests directly, which they currently cannot?  Some of the logjam is caused by the fact that patients must be referred to a consultant before they can access diagnostic tests.  In the event that the ability to order such tests is extended to GPs, the services and the physical infrastructure must be in place.  Apart from that, are there other barriers?  Has the Medical Council had any discussions with the HSE on this?  Did it come up, for example, during the discussions on the revision of the GP contract?  </p></speech>

One gets to a stage in general practice where one can no longer progress a patient's investigations beyond one's own ability or the availability of services.  Hence, one gets into this referral system that goes on<i>ad infinitum</i>.  Clearly, it is a no-brainer that if GPs can access diagnostic services locally or in a timely manner, we can remove half of the referrals in the system.  Small pilot studies have been done in various places, including in Waterford, where a study was done in the context of heart failure clinics and so on but there have not been specific discussions on diagnostics.  It is something that should happen but access, availability and appropriate standards are essential.</p></speech>

It is a classic example of something that works on the ground.  She met the Minister for Health when he visited our health centre last year.  He was massively impressed by her set up.

I am not sure if that is as a result of my hair going white or if I am missing something.  I have tabled numerous questions to various Ministers about the cost of our health services and the adequacy of the annual budget to meet the requirements throughout the country each year.  I have always been assured that adequate provision has been made but every year, without fail, a Supplementary Estimate has been required to meet the budget overruns.  Two things happen at Estimates time.</p><p>Each Department must supply its requirements, whatever they are.  This entails an evaluation of what is being delivered, how it is going to be delivered and how it was delivered last year.  For some unknown reason, we do not seem to be working in the health services.  We do not seem to be connecting.  This year will have the lowest overrun in several years by the end of the year but I remember having the same problem when I was on the health board.  We had the same problem during the boom.  We have had a continuous problem.  Nobody can tell me what the actual requirement in the delivery of health services is in financial terms.</p><p> Reference has been made to the operation of the delivery of the services.  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme was supposed to do that.  That is the prototype and we have been told that it will deliver.  The witnesses' colleagues appeared before us last week.  Their opening statement was that politics should be taken out of the health service.  Mind you, they were quite political themselves when they elucidated further and there will be another debate on that as well.  I asked a question and was not given an answer.  What is the cost of delivering?  What more is required in terms of budget?  Is it &euro;5 billion, &euro;10 billion or 30% of the existing budget?  It would appear to be that.  If it is 30% of the existing budget, I am afraid we are in the wrong place because the HSE appeared before us some time ago and told us that with regard to all appointments of consultants, GPs and specialists of all descriptions, it must compete with New York, London and Sydney.  New York, London and Sydney have not been through the kind of economic crash we have been through by a long shot.</p><p> The question arises as to what we do.  Can the witnesses tell us, based on their involvement inside the system, what percentage of an increase in the health budget is required and to whom do we give it to get delivery of the services that are now required?  We have an increased population but that is not the only problem.  We have an increased number of taxpayers as well.  We also have an increased number of young people.  The ageing cohort is referred to all the time as being the reason for the problems we have.  This is not entirely accurate for the simple reason that a significant number of people who have come into this country in the past five years are young people so it is not all tilting towards the elderly.  This is balanced by a young population.  Based on their knowledge of the system, can the witnesses quantify what is needed?  Reference has been made by my colleague to OECD countries and charges levelled at us at all times, and we are only members of this committee, to the effect that we are the third or fourth highest spender on health in the OECD so what is going wrong?</p><p> During the boom, things were better, although I am not sure, but the country was broke.  We can very easily go back to that spot and it could happen overnight because trends can emerge very quickly, the budgetary situation can go wrong overnight and we are back to square one and will do the same thing again in ten years time because there will be more cuts.  We all hear the witnesses with regard to what happened in 2012.  The alternative was not going to be nice.  Everybody everywhere would have been let go.  There was no money to pay anybody.  Pensions and all the rest of it would have been cut.  There were cuts at that time that were harsh.  I assure the witnesses from a Government perspective that these cuts were very difficult to sell but they were the lesser of two evils because the alternative was everything collapsing in which case we would not be here at all.  What is required to be spent to deliver a comprehensive health service?  Could the witnesses tell us whether they think we should have to compete with New York, London, Boston and Sydney for consultants?  I have a follow-up question.  Does the Chairman want me to put it now?</p></speech>

I will address his question about the cuts to salaries in 2012.  The Deputy is right.  We were in a financial crisis but we imposed a 30% cut on new entrants.  The day that was introduced, it saved zero money for the country because there were no new entrants.  Within the first year, it saved a tiny amount of money because savings are only made when people are appointed.  The argument that this cut did anything to help the financial status of the country at the time of the crisis does not make sense because it was imposed on staff who had not even started working in the service.  Agency fees are way beyond what we would pay if we just paid the doctors the salaries that were agreed.</p> <p>  I go back to my experience of working in the health service.  The Hanly report was published within a year of two of my graduation.  Ultimately, the question of how much the health service will cost to run is a political one because it depends on what sort of health service we want.  Do we want small hospitals around the country or do we want all the hospitals to be in one big city?  The Hanly report spoke about cost savings and economies of scale of moving to large centres.  The question arises as to what sort of health service one wants from a political perspective.  One must then cost how much it will cost to deliver that health service.  We keep making comparisons with other European countries but they run their health services very differently.  One could argue, probably correctly, that certain European countries have very urbanised populations, do not have the low population density we have on the west coast, can run larger hospitals and have economies of scale.  However, ultimately, once we have worked out what sort of health service we want to deliver, we must then work out the cost of delivering that.  </p></speech>

As Dr. Sadlier said, what service model are we going to go for because that is not clear?  If the Government decided tomorrow that it was going to run a fully State-funded general practice service, I do not think the State could not afford it.  I have certainly not seen any appetite for going in that direction within the HSE.  However, we hear from other sections that this is where we need to go if we are to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Deputy Durkan asked a question to which, unfortunately, there is probably no straight answer.  We are not prevaricating.  There are a lot of variables that do not allow us to give a straight answer to that question.</p></speech>

The demographics show that we have an ageing population.  While not all elderly people are sick, they do represent 50% of the expenditure on our system.  The elderly population is growing rapidly and funding is not keeping up with it.  We are constantly playing catch up year after year so it is very difficult to say exactly what funding is needed.  Based on the current model, we would be trying to catch up with current waiting lists and the increased demand on emergency services and GP care so there is a lot but we need to look at what model we want and what investment we need and we need capital investment, something we have been very short of for the past number of years.</p></speech>

In addition, we are competing with Toronto, Calgary, Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne and all of these places, including sites across the UK.  To the extent that we are competing with them, when we think about the salaries on offer, the working hours and the access to study time, training time and supports, we are not competing on the same level.  It is the same level as the match last night.  Ireland were playing against Switzerland but we were never in danger of winning.  That is us.  We are losing our young doctors to these places at the moment.</p></speech>

While this is not a reflection on anything that Mr. Owens has said, there is something wrong.  We educate to a high standard and we export our graduates afterwards.  Do the graduates feel they have any sort of moral responsibility to give the first year or second year to their native country?  Would that help?  Would it be of any benefit if they stayed for a specified period?  I do not know.</p> <p>  Those delivering at the coalface in the health services should be able to give us some indication as to how much money is required to provide the service.  This is notwithstanding the fact that, before and during the boom, we had waiting lists and we still have them.  The witnesses say they are growing but if we are exporting our medical professionals, they are going to grow.</p> <p>  Incidentally, the way we operate, there are backlogs everywhere and waiting lists for almost everything.  This has been the case for years and we have become accustomed to it.  That is the culture.  It is a misleading culture and it is damaging to the system, in particular to confidence in the system.  We start off with long waiting lists of hundreds or thousands.  When do we expect to overhaul them?  It can never happen unless we have a doubling of the expenditure on health for X number of years.  Do the witnesses think that is possible?  I do not think it is. </p> <p>  To return to the first point, the population is aging but people are now working longer than they ever did before, and they have to do that because of changes in legislation, which were necessary.  However, everybody avoids the cohort of new people who have come into the country, of whom there are a very large number.  I am sure they are as healthy as the now aging population were when they were younger.  Therefore, there is a missing part to the explanation and we are not getting it.  I do not know if the witnesses are in a position to be able to give us that information.  However, if we are talking about a 30% increase in the health budget, we are talking about &euro;5 billion in a year.  I do not think that kind of thing is going to happen, or not easily and not quickly, so we have to find another method.  We are still stuck with the allegation that we are paying more for the service than most other OECD countries. </p> <p>  There are places in Australia - the outback, for example - where it is fairly expensive to deliver services over vast areas of territory but people get a service, and it is the same in parts of the United States and in Canada, which are massive countries.  This economic notion that has been brought forward over the years, that we will build bigger hospitals in high population locations and will forget about the rest, does not stand up anywhere else except in this country. </p></speech>

The first is that idea of tying medical graduates to remaining in the country for a period of time and whether that would help our system.  The answer is that it is very unlikely to help.  In their first years after graduation, medical graduates are in training towards specialisms.  If we were able to provide the adequate specialist training, people would not leave.</p></speech>

That takes investment in medical education and investment in making sure we are compliant with the European working time directive, which we know we are not.  It takes investment to get protected training time for trainees and to get access to the correct equipment and resources, and also to have the required posts available in all the various specialties.</p> <p>  Ultimately, Ireland is a small country.  Nobody has ever won a Nobel prize in medicine for research done in Ireland.  We will always be dependent on a certain cohort of doctors going abroad to learn new skills and new innovations because we are not a country that produces new innovations in surgical techniques or medical techniques, largely due to our size.  We will always depend on doctors going abroad to train and then bring skills home, and that is a fairly logical proposition. </p> <p>  If we were able to provide adequate working conditions for junior doctors, similar to what they get when they move to Australia or Canada, and to provide the adequate training opportunities they get in those countries, I do not think we would be talking about doctors leaving this country in any way, shape or form. </p></speech>

In regard to general practice, a good percentage of those who complete graduate entry medicine tend to go towards general practice, and those groupings tend to bring a considerable loan with them after they qualify.  Unfortunately, the terms and conditions do not offer the realistic ability to repay debts in a timely fashion so they tend to go abroad to try to mitigate that.  We have suggested for those groupings which have taken on board such loans to get through medicine, and who enter into general practice, that perhaps some sort of tax rebate could be considered because they would then stay in the country, earn money in the country and provide the service.  Carrot or stick - the question is which way to do it.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, as we all know, and we do not have to reiterate over and over again, it is not a great environment to work in.  This is a legacy issue and it will take time to wash out.  However, if we can provide some incentives for people to stay, rather than trying to press-gang them into staying, we might get a better return. </p></speech>

I hope the witnesses' replies will not be too negative or the students might find they have to leave the country because we are getting too negative here about a lot of things.</p> <p>  I want to refer to Medical Council figures.  I am intrigued by how we are commenting on medical practitioners in this country.  My reading of the Medical Council figures is that, five years ago, there were 19,046 medical practitioners on the Medical Council register, and the latest figures for 2018 show there are 22,996, which is a 20.72% increase.  I am intrigued because all of the media focus seems to be about the shortage of doctors yet there has been a 20% increase in the number working here, or who are on the medical register, most of whom I presume are working here.  For instance, the number of junior doctors has increased quite substantially in the hospitals because of the working time directive but no one is talking about that.  Much of what is being said is very negative and one negative creates a second negative.  I am concerned about the negativity in regard to recruitment.  I accept there are issues in regard to some of the doctors coming in, such as those relating to their previous training and experience, which I fully understand.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to consultants.  I would like clarification on the number of consultant posts five years ago and the number now.  Taking the number of consultant posts now, how many are occupied permanently and how many are occupied by agency or locum consultants?</p><p>My understanding is that five years ago, approximately 2,500 permanent consultants were working in the system but that number is now approximately 3,000 while another 500 posts remain unfilled.</p><p> We can go back 20 years regarding recruitment as there was a system in place where a consultant was reaching the age of 64 or 65.  It was flagged within the hospital system that it needed to plan to replace that person, organise advertising and ensure somebody would be committed to taking up the job when the consultant retired.  That all seems to have collapsed as the process was absorbed into the HSE.  It is astonishing that positions after being advertised after a person has retired.  This relates to agency and locum staff as the people who have retired may have to come back to act as a locum.  Has the IMO approached the HSE about fast-tracking the process and planning?  There is a lack of planning within the HSE with respect to the recruitment of consultants, which is adding to the overall problem.</p><p> Agency and locum staff cost three times as much as employing someone on a contract.  I disagreed at the time with the 30% reduction that has been mentioned.  I did a report in 2012 about graduates from that year.  We interviewed them across all universities.  A total of 60% indicated that they would leave Ireland within 12 months once the intern year was done.  That report was done in addition to a report by the health committee but I am astonished there was no take-up on it by the HSE with respect to forward planning.</p><p> Retaining junior doctors is a major issue.  Allowances were cut back so what has been restored?  This is not about salary or anything else but rather simple elements such as days allowed for study.  How much progress has been made in restoring what they had previously?  What more could we be doing to make it attractive for junior doctors to stay here?  We are not doing enough about that and the HSE's approach is not correct either.  The approach from certain elements of HSE management is to tolerate junior doctors but if the position was made more attractive than in other jurisdictions through the provision of allowances and study leave, we would have a greater chance of retaining them in the system.  What simple measures could be taken?  There would not be a major cost.  There are more than 6,000 junior doctors in the hospital system and many of them want to study in various other areas.</p><p> I raised a matter with the Medical Council last week about doctors dropping out of the system and I was a bit taken aback by the response.  I was speaking to a medical practitioner recently about two people doing obstetrics and gynaecology.  One had done nine years of training and the other had done six years.  They have now dropped out and returned to GP training.  I am not saying the GP system is easier but there is not the same level of stress.  We discussed adverse events and the lack of support within the hospital system for doctors and nursing staff.  I have heard about nursing staff facing an inquest without being given any support before or after the hearing.  It is not that anybody did something wrong but that the experience is traumatic.</p><p> There are 135,000 people working for the HSE and the number of whole-time equivalents has increased across the board, including nurses, doctors, administration and management.  I have a major issue with administration and management.  That means an additional 16,000 whole-time equivalents are working in the HSE compared to December 2014, which is a 17% increase.  I am surprised by the lack of challenge from the medical organisations to the disproportionate increase in administration and management compared with medical practitioners and nursing staff.  I had to extract this information over a period.  I am very much ploughing a lone furrow on this.  There was a 24% increase in administration and management but an 11% increase in front-line nursing staff.  I am a bit concerned as we need to have a bit more joined-up thinking across the board but there must be a challenge from within the system as well as outside.</p></speech>

That now represents 40% of our population.  We are in contravention of WHO guidelines on ethical recruitment of healthcare professionals by recruiting doctors from developing countries where doctors are needed more urgently.  Doctors traditionally come here to get experience and training but they are not even being offered those opportunities in the system.  We can see them leaving again for fear of becoming deskilled or disillusioned with the opportunities in the system.  It is a very transient figure.</p> <p>  We must examine the figures on the Medical Council register in depth.  For example, 70% of doctors are working in Ireland only and many of them could remain on the register here but they have emigrated.  A cohort of doctors also has come in and out as locums.  We need to delve into those numbers a little further.</p></speech>

There is also the question of restoring allowances and making work more attractive.</p><p>When we talk to non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, typically, they tell us the issues are working hours, access to protected training time, support for training and training funding, family-friendly policies and reasonable working hours.  Those are the non-salary issues that would incentivise doctors to stay in Ireland.  As Dr. Sadlier said, if we were training people comprehensively, they would not leave Ireland.  They are going, in part, because they are not getting the training here that they need.</p><p> In that regard, we recently agreed with the HSE a programme called the training support scheme, TSS, which will put a figure of approximately &euro;10 million per annum behind NCHD training.  It is applicable to all NCHDs regardless of whether they are on training schemes.</p><p> The Senator mentioned allowances.  That arose from a High Court case on the living out allowance, which was abolished.  That scheme is up and running now.  It is not a silver bullet in that it will not make everything as it ought to be but it will help.  The scheme is currently in place and we did much work with the HSE to get it in place.  It was money we had to get and put behind training.</p><p> There are many measures we can take to do with working hours and, for example, family-friendly policies.  Some people on training schemes are sent all around the country.  They may have a spouse who is based primarily in one location while they travel around the country in pursuit of their training.  Two doctors may be in a relationship and one is sent to one end of the country by a training programme and someone is sent to the other end by a training programme.  These are the issues we should be thinking about resolving.  They are not easy to resolve but it should be done.</p></speech>

Like any workforce, the HSE should be supporting its own workforce and it should have a system of welfare in place for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.

Senator Burke has made his point.</p> <p>  Regarding manpower, which is the subject of our meeting, to what extent are the gaps in manpower leading to the increase in waiting lists?  Last week, we heard from witnesses from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  They spoke about the added value a permanent member of staff brings to a department or practice in that they deliver their service and training but they are also involved in research and developing that department or practice.  Not having a permanent member of staff in a department must diminish it.  There is no added value to an agency locum.  Dr. Sadlier might address on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly asked about the amount of money it takes to run the system.  What is the level of inefficiency in the system currently that is leading to a waste of resources?</p> <p>  Regarding general practice, there is a maxim that for every euro invested in general practice, &euro;5 will be saved in secondary services because secondary services will not have to be sought if there is a properly-resourced and funded primary care service.  Dr. Sadlier might respond to those questions.</p></speech>

On the added value of an agency locum, I do not want to be disrespectful to my colleagues.  There is a value in having agency doctors who, on the whole, are very well trained and very well qualified medical practitioners.  It is better to have a doctor in the post than not have one in the post but I have experience of a service where we have not been able to fill a post permanently for a number of years.  Somebody will come in on a three-month contract but they cannot work beyond that because they have other commitments elsewhere.  It is very difficult, therefore, to plan whether to book patients for the three months following that contract.  We then get a backlog of referrals which are put to the side.  If we manage to get the post filled, those patients go on the waiting list and so on.  It is absolutely the case that the uncertainty in terms of being able to plan and run the service leads to a backlog in the waiting lists.</p> <p>  Specifically in psychiatry, where we may have community psychiatry departments with one or perhaps two consultants covering a small area, if there is a gap or absence in that area referrals become completely backlogged.  We have seen that in child psychiatry services across the country, specifically outside the major urban areas.  There are waiting lists in the major urban areas also but we have major problems with waiting lists outside those areas.  They are services that had a small number of practitioners and if one is missing out of a team of three, the service is down by 33% but if one is missing out of a team of one, there is a 100% deficit.</p> <p>  On the issue of inefficiencies, I have said in this room on more than one occasion that it is to do with electronic patient records.  If the Chairman asked me during the Sl&aacute;intecare hearings or hearings on whatever the report was before Sl&aacute;intecare, as a person working on the ground, the biggest difference that could be made to the Irish healthcare service, it is not Sl&aacute;intecare or any of that.  It is whether we can have an information management system that is not based in the 1990s.  One could walk into an Irish hospital in 1890 and walk into one now and one would have the same information management system.  Our outpatients records are paper-based.  We receive letters, names have to be written into a diary, which is transcribed into another diary.  One of the reasons for the delay when a patient comes into the emergency department is because it takes six hours to get that patient's charts from medical records.  I work in north Dublin.  For various reasons, people might go to Connolly hospital or might end up in the emergency department in the Mater hospital and to get their records from one hospital to the other we would need to hire the Secret Service.  From my perspective, if there was anything that could be done to improve the efficiency of the medical service in this country it would be to have a proper information management system.  That would definitely improve the efficiency of our service.</p></speech>

Part of the negotiations for the reversals of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, was that very issue.  We have agreed that summary care records of patients should be available for hospitals, outpatients or whatever.  In other words, where a patient turns up at an accident and emergency department or an outpatients' department, access to the medical record - the summary records on medications and allergies - including a set amount of information is available to the doctors attending him or her.  That will bring significant efficiencies.  That is expected to be expanded into an electronic record whereby everybody could be able to access a certain amount of necessary and relevant information.  That will bring forward a significant benefit but, as Dr. Sadlier pointed out, the hospital system needs to catch up.</p></speech>

Our consultants are very highly trained, very highly specialised and very highly sought after across the world but we sometimes forget that they are also trainers.  They are developing the next generation of consultants.  If we do not have people in the posts now developing the next generation of consultants, we are simply storing up another set of problems, which will manifest themselves when we do not have the people coming through.  One reason we are losing the non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, which we have discussed quite a bit today, is the difficulty in getting high-quality training in an overwhelmingly service-driven environment.</p></speech>

Certainly, that was one issue we always have had in mind when we went to discuss chronic disease management within the negotiations.  I am glad to see that movement has come on that, whereby we have an agreed set approach to managing patients who probably are more appropriately to be seen in general practice as opposed to secondary care.  There has been investment in chronic disease management, which will roll over the next number of years.  It is expected that should be ready in January but that will depend on a functioning IT system at that time.  The Chairman will be aware that will bring great benefits to patients.</p> <p>  Further investment is needed as not only does one need chronic disease management, one needs the allied services such as the public health nurses, the practice nurses, the dietitians etc. who will be able to make that function.  That certainly is in the plan.  Hopefully, it will be acted on.  The Chairman touched on it earlier in reference to access to diagnostics.  If it can be done in general practice at an appropriate level, of course that will be efficient and give pay back.</p></speech>

We will be brief.  I have many questions.  I will ask them quickly and if the witnesses can answer them quickly, we will move through them as fast as we can in five minutes.</p> <p>  NCHDs and consultants have stated repeatedly how poor the working practices are.  I fully agree and I fully accept that.  It begs the question as to why.  The other healthcare systems where our doctors go have sorted this out.  Other parts of the public system in Ireland can be great places to work and there is a bunch of good companies in Ireland which are fantastic places to work.  It begs the question, why, in the modern age?  Do the witnesses have a sense for what is wrong with our system?  What is wrong with our hospitals?  What is wrong with the HSE that it allows this toxic work environment to continue?</p></speech>

At the Deputy can see, the number of specialists per head of population is quite small.  Invariably, one works in small teams, which means that one is running to catch up on the service demands of the post and the training demands of the post get put into second place.  On the NCHD question, the ability to have protected time to engage in training, both as a consultant as a trainer or as an NCHD as a trainee, is a difficulty.  As for how that has evolved, as we talked about, there has been chronic underfunding for many years.</p></speech>

The &euro;50 million last year got 21,000 procedures done.  That &euro;50 million comprises 0.33% of the health budget.  For 0.33% of the health budget, 21,000 people, who would still be waiting today, got seen.  The IMO cannot be ideologically opposed to it because it represents GPs, who are private sector workers.  Given that for a relatively small amount of money tens of thousands of people are being treated, what is the IMO's opposition to it?</p></speech>

I will put two together.  The witnesses said we need to invest more in GP support and capacity.  I fully agree.  Could they give us the top one, two or three things that they would do?</p> <p>  I am really concerned by the issue they raised of insufficient specialist training posts.  If that is the case, we are setting ourselves up to fail.  It seems such a glaringly obvious thing to not get wrong.  Why have we got that wrong?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we still do not have the resources within general practice to attract additional nurses into the system at present.  We would be hopefully taking them from the HSE but, unfortunately, the perks that would be involved in normal employment within the HSE simply cannot be matched in the sector.  We would like to see an additional resource supplied to provide that.</p> <p>  Second, the transition of general practitioners who are trained into full-time general practice and into being principals is a huge issue.  Interestingly, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, indicates that up to 50% of trained GPs would see themselves as principals in a ten-year period but there is a sort of transition period in between.  We would like to think a support, similar to the practice nurse support, could be brought in to bring those GPs into a practice, get their feet under the table, see what it is like and, hopefully, allow a smoother transition into general practice.  One may solve some of the retention problems in that way.  One needs to get them engaged first to see what it is like.  We have that problem where they are just not getting engaged at this point in time.</p></speech>

Although we have 60 people leaving basic specialist training, very few of them can get onto higher specialist training because there simply are not enough posts.  Many of the approximately 30 posts that exist are being filled by people referred from previous years.  Only six posts are left open this year to that cohort of 60 people leaving basic specialist training.  There is, therefore, a great need to increase the number of higher specialist training posts.</p></speech>

Seeing as this is such a glaringly obvious failure, however, why is it happening?  It is deadly serious if we are not even training future consultants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#CC00300"><p>Several reasons explain why this is happening.  The first aspect concerns the vacant consultant posts.  Most college rules state that a trainer needs to be a permanent consultant.  Consultants who are rotating might be there for the duration of training, but equally they might not.  Extra supports are also needed for such posts, however.  The problem is that our service is struggling to survive; it is running to keep up.  The problem with a training post is that it requires a doctor to be engaged in non-service provision for a certain percentage of his or her week.  That is especially the case in the higher specialist training, where the percentage might be as high as 20% to 30% of the week.  That is a luxury that cannot be afforded when there are huge waiting lists.</p> <p>  All of this comes back to three major aspects.  I refer to this being a numbers game, the difficulty with the recruitment of consultants and trainers and, as I mentioned at the start, the ongoing difficulty of Ireland's rapidly increasing population.  That accounts for many of our problems in general.  Some 64,000 people were added to the population last year and it will be similar next year.  Our population has increased by 50% in just over 20 years.  That is a great thing, but there is a requirement for the provision of the requisite extra infrastructure and services.  The situation at the moment means that we can set our target figures for this year, but they will have shifted by the time of delivery.  </p></speech>

Regarding the NTPF, we never agree on it over on this side of the House.  We are not, however, necessarily talking about 21,000 procedures but 21,000 appointments.  Not all of those appointments result in subsequent procedures and, indeed, I believe many do not.  I have two questions.  One concerns doctors and consultants working abroad.  We know  that the 30% pay cut, and the resulting disparity, is a barrier to those people returning home.  This issue was not resolved in the budget. If it was to be settled, however, how far away are we from those doctors coming home?  What is the lead-in time to that happening?</p> <p> My second question is for Dr. McGarry and is on practice nurses and other staff working in primary care centres.  He referenced the need for additional practice nurses.  Would he see that increase happening in conjunction with an expanded role for those practice nurses, or would he simple see more practice nurses doing the same things they do now?  We all agree that is a bit of everything and they do it very well.  </p></speech>

One of the absolutely necessary things mentioned is the advent of chronic disease management being brought into general practice.  That is a more appropriate location and that is where one of the major roles for practice nurses will be, given the present set-up in those general practices.  Many things can happen and it should never be carved in stone that someone does the same thing <i>ad infinitum</i>.  If it is possible for some people to do different things, then so be it.  It may be that an administrative assistant could be trained up to do various things such as phlebotomies, ECGs, etc.  That would allow the practice nurse greater availability.  I am not adverse to that idea at all.  Provision has been made for more practice nurses in the context of chronic disease management.  It has yet to be decided how that will be implemented.  The intention exists, however, and it should be expanded.  For the first time, the plan for chronic disease management sets in place the requirement that any additional work needs to be resourced.  That has to be expanded upon.  The other thing that needs to be done for general practice is the addressing of the inequity of the out-of-hours arrangements around the country.  That needs to be addressed urgently.  The Department commissioned its own report on this matter about two years ago, but it has never been released and nothing has happened.  This issue presents a major barrier to people going into practices, especially in rural areas.</p></speech>

The first and primary impact concerns junior doctors.  A person coming out of medical school, after finishing his or her internship, may look at Irish consultant posts and think those are unattractive.  That person is then almost forced to emigrate in order that he or she can plug into the training system of another country and be in line to get a permanent post there.  One of the knock-on effects of the pay cut, therefore, was the emigration of doctors at the start of their careers.  That was because taking up permanent consultancy posts in other countries may require extra exams and qualifications in that country.  It depends on the location, but there can be slight differences in training and speciality.  If the pay cut were reversed, therefore, we would see many more interns staying within the health service and taking up posts here.</p> <p>  Regarding the vacant consultant posts, many of them would be filled within 12 to 18 months.  From my own friends, I know of four doctors working in Australia who are constantly in contact with me about when the situation will change.  If they were to return, they would, of course, have to untangle themselves from their current posts abroad, given the needs of notice periods, advertising and recruitment.  The current problems have pertained for seven years, though, so a waiting period of 12 to 18 months is not a bad result.</p></speech>

Immediately after that cut was reversed, I guarantee that only about 40% of interns would leave instead of the current 70%.  The 40% who leave, however, would also return to Ireland the year after.  Some 70% of newly-qualified doctors leave at the moment and perhaps only some 20% come back.</p></speech>

There was a slight increase from 2015 onwards, when the IMO negotiated a new-entrant pay scale.  There was an increase from one person per post to two people, or thereabouts, per post.  Those are the facts that we know.  We can also surmise that the longer this situation continues, then the more people will put down roots abroad and may not come back.  We need to get this process started, at the very least.  As Dr. Sadlier said, there will then be a lead-in period involved in getting back the people we lost abroad and who we need back to Ireland.</p></speech>

I am thinking again about what I learned over the years.  One of those things was the argument about Ireland having too many hospital beds.  We heard that argument being made until about five years ago.  Every time we had a meeting anywhere, it stated that there were too many hospital beds.  That was the lead-in to the notion that nobody wanted to be a consultant in a small hospital down the country.  The idea was that they all wanted to be in a big urban centre in a hospital with all types of specialties.  I can understand that because job satisfaction is important.  How much of medicine now consists of a vocation?  That used to be high on the agenda.  There was a view that a particular type of person was suited to the role and would be committed to it.</p><p>We also had the district hospital doctor, who was perhaps the second or third generation working in the same hospital and taking personal pride in his own patch.  I believe that has shifted now and it is more of a job.  The same thing happened in the local authorities, an area we know well, where the county manager was a permanent fixture.  The manager took full responsibility and pride in delivering to what he or she saw as his or her patch.  That is gone now because it is now a contract.  The same pride is not carried with it because it is a job.  It is a route towards promotion somewhere else.  I am not suggesting that I know more about this than the IMO representatives, but I am deeply concerned about it.  In medicine in particular there is a need to have that unique vocational commitment.</p></speech>

I do not think anyone could do this job without a vocational attitude.  There is no such thing as watching the clock - it is a continuum.  I do not see that has majorly changed.  Perhaps people want to be a little more organised, but I do not see a lack of vocation in the job.  People want more of a work-life balance.  When a doctor is in front of a patient, he is dealing with the patient's problem there and then.  That is how he deals with it.  I do not think a doctor can switch on and off just like that.  A person either has it or does not have it.  I do not see any change in the new doctors coming out in that regard.  That is what I can see.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#DD00500"><p>The number of hospital beds is related to the population.  The population is expanding so our need for beds is expanding.</p> <p>  I wish to come back to the core issue about vocation.  I would not consider myself old but there has been considerable change from the time I graduated in 1999 to now.  If a person had a stroke and came into a hospital 20 years ago, when I graduated, things were different compared to now.  The possibilities now include thrombolysis or trying to melt the clot and restore the blood supply to the affected part of the brain so that the patient has a limited deficit from the stroke.  If a person had a heart attack when I qualified the management of those procedures was markedly different.  In the first days, it was pain relief and then into cardiac care and hope for the best.  Nowadays, a patient can have angioplasty or have the clot removed.  The damage to a patient's heart muscle can be minimised.</p> <p>  I am unsure whether the county manager job in the past 20 years has moved with the technical changes we have seen in medicine during the past 20 years.  That has led to a difference.  I agree 100% that this has had to lead to a difference in how doctors work.  We have had to become a little more specialised.  We have had to become more specialised towards individual skills and procedures.  If I was a patient and had someone sticking a needle into my groin that would go all the way into one of the arteries in my heart, I certainly would want someone who was doing that procedure every day of the week, and not a general county physician who was doing it every third Tuesday.  The difference in medicine in recent years has been phenomenal in terms of the benefits we can give to patients.  The treatment survival rates in cancer care, cardiovascular disease and stroke have been phenomenal.  We want everyone in the country to benefit from those technical changes.  They should be available not based on where a person lives but available to everyone in the country.</p></speech>

The other question related to continuity of care and having people in the post long-term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-16a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. P&aacute;draig McGarry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019101600002#DD00700"><p>Certainly, the essence of general practice is continuity of care.  That is what is seen as the best outcome.  In fact, the independent practitioner model has that continuity of care and that is probably the most favoured.  We see it being fragmented perhaps where corporates are entering the scene.  We may well have doctors coming in for a transient phase and we lose that continuity of care.  In recent years, because of the way general practice has been allowed to come under threat there has been a vacuum.  Corporates have come in and filled that vacuum.  There is a serious danger with that type of model.  Whereas it serves a purpose, it certainly will not go across the board.  It certainly will not go into rural Ireland or into the smaller deprived areas.  It will cherry-pick particular areas.  Continuity of care will be lost under that type of model.</p> <p>  We need to support the independent practitioner model, including the doctor who works for 30 or 40 years.  You understand that only too well, Chairman, because you have been in that role.  I am unsure whether it should be passed from generation to generation, but people tend to follow in that regard.  Children of garda&iacute; become garda&iacute;, children of publicans become publicans and children of farmers become farmers.  Children of doctors tend to understand what is involved, especially in general practice.  This is because, by and large, the practice is in the house so the family know what is involved.  That was certainly the case in my house.  Then, when someone from the next generation goes into it, he understands what is involved and has bought into it.  It becomes part of the DNA.  Things evolve, as Dr. Sadlier said, and nothing stands still but I believe we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p></speech>

I will go back to the idea of vocation.  I work a good deal with non-consultant hospital doctors, who are doctors in training.  They are the next generation of consultants and GPs and so on.  A series of issues arise for them year after year, including long working hours, lack of access to training time and lack of family-friendly policies.  Their working hours often require them to stay very late at very short notice, but it has to be done.  Oftentimes, they do not even get paid when they stay late.  Then, we get involved in a protracted row with the hospital and eventually get them paid.  Eventually, we might get them paid one year later.  I do not know about vocation, but as far as I am concerned it is a wonder we do not lose more of them.</p></speech>
