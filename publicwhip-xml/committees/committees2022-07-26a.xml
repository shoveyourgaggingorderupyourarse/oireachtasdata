The purpose of this meeting is information gathering.  The committee has done substantial work on aviation and more specifically on the area of passenger aviation.  We are grateful to the witnesses for coming.  The experience of the travelling public has been the main focus of many of our meetings.</p><p> I welcome Ms Lynne Embleton, CEO; Mr. Donal Moriarity, chief corporate affairs officer; and Mr. Peter O'Neill, chief operations officer, Aer Lingus; Mr. Vincent Harrison, managing director; Mr. Gary McLean, deputy managing director; Ms Louise Bannon, head of marketing; and Mr. Kevin Cullinane, group head of communications, DAA; Mr. Tony Tully, director of ground operations, Swissport UK and Ireland; and Mr. Darren Moloney, managing director; Mr. Gerard Kenny, operations manager; and Ms Lorraine Daly, group head of human resources, Sky Handling Partner.  I thank all the witnesses for making themselves available.</p><p> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> If attending in the committee room, members and officials are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p><p> I invite Ms Embleton to make her opening statement on behalf of Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

Before we get to substantive matters, I will briefly refer to the commentary that surrounded our inability to attend the committee&rsquo;s planned meeting last week.  As members will be aware, we were invited to that meeting at short notice.  Not surprisingly, we had commitments that we were unable to change at short notice.  We did, however, tell the committee we could attend at a future date or respond in writing to questions, if required.  Therefore, we were somewhat taken aback at the comments concerning what was stated to be our refusal to attend on the original date.  I am, though, happy to be here.</p></speech>

This is Aer Lingus&rsquo;s fifth time attending this committee since the pandemic started.  On this occasion, we are here to discuss the operational issues associated with the sector&rsquo;s recovery.</p> <p>  I will take these issues in turn, starting by putting the disruptions in the aviation sector in context.  Doubtlessly, passenger experience has suffered across the aviation sector this summer and some Aer Lingus customers have had their travel disrupted.  While Aer Lingus has had cancellations, our flight completion rate was 100% in May and more than 98% in June.  Therefore, the vast majority of our customers and their baggage were successfully delivered.  Indeed, Aer Lingus operated one of the most robust schedules of any of the European network carriers.  We planned, for example, to operate 8,353 flights in June, and we operated 8,130 flights.  Therefore, if we compare Aer Lingus' cancellation rate of 1.8% in June with rates elsewhere among large European network carriers, we can see that Lufthansa cancelled 10% of its operations, Air France cancelled 7%, KLM cancelled 11% and EasyJet cancelled 14%.</p> <p>  Aer Lingus apologises to all customers caught up in disruptions and we assure them we are doing everything we can to resolve the issues.</p><p>Aer Lingus is incredibly frustrated with the operational disruptions this summer and our staff are doing a remarkable job under significant pressure.  I publicly thank the Aer Lingus people and team for what they are doing to look after customers over this summer, with the very many challenges that we are facing.</p><p> I will first comment on the readiness of Aer Lingus for the summer.  Last October, we published our schedule.  We were clear, at that point, of our intention to operate 90% of the 2019 level by the peak summer.  We made our schedules publically available.  We put our schedules on sale.  After the Omicron wave, at the end of last year and beginning of this year, we reiterated our intention to reach 90% of pre-Covid capacity by the summer peak.  Aer Lingus planned for this.  We planned, recruited and adjusted contracts, where necessary, to ensure that we had the right resources going into the summer, and the right resources with more of a buffer than we would have had for any normal summer.  Indeed, in terms of staffing levels, for what was 81% of passengers last June, we had 91% of our staff.   There was a significant increase, therefore, in the buffer that we would normally have to accommodate and support any disruption that we might see.  Nevertheless, the level of disruption in the system has been significant, which has had an impact on our customers and I will discuss this matter shortly.  The readiness of Aer Lingus was not matched by airports and ground handling companies around the network.  If every airport and handling agent was as ready as Aer Lingus, then we would not be facing the scale of disruption that passengers are seeing across the network.</p><p> I turn to airports and later I will more broadly discuss airports around Europe.  In terms of Dublin Airport, I will not cover the specifics of the issues at the beginning of the season as I think that they have been well covered at this committee.  Undoubtedly, we have seen an improvement, particularly in screening, at the airport as the summer has progressed and as resources have come on board with the DAA.  Aer Lingus acknowledges that those improvements have been in place.</p><p> We need to see improvements not only in security screening but also in bussing services, which move passengers and crew around the airport, and in passenger mobility services, which enables passengers to get on and off an aircraft in a timely manner.  We need to see improvement in all of those sectors and, indeed, in the cleanliness around the airport as well.</p><p> The advice for passengers to arrive at the airport 2.5 hours before departure for a short-haul flight and 3.5 hours before departure for a long-haul flight remains problematic for us.  Passengers check in or drop off a bag during the early morning peak so they compete with passengers who are flying later in the day.  That situation causes a level of congestion at the points of check in and bag drop, which would be unnecessary if the recommendations were not in place.  We need to see further improvements but there has been significant improvements so far this summer.  We trust that the work is under way to permanently address these issues.  Please note that these issues are not unique to Dublin, which I will discuss in a moment.</p><p> More generally, we feel the impact of the infrastructure deficit at Dublin Airport in operations today.  That situation will become more critical in the future.  Therefore, it is really important that these infrastructural deficits are addressed in a timely manner as the airport and airlines grow passenger numbers into the future.</p><p> I refer to the wider aviation system pressures that we are seeing and experiencing.  Our operating model of network carriers like Aer Lingus requires significant passengers flows from other airlines and short-haul flights on to long-haul flights.  It is inherently more complex than that of a point-to-point airline.  We operate to nine out the ten European airports that have been most impacted by disruption and we see that in our connecting traffic, and through the impact on connecting customers in the Dublin hub.</p><p> I would like to outline some of the pressures that the system is experiencing.  We are seeing an under-resourcing at airports, particularly across Europe.  We are seeing under resourcing with ground handlers and other airlines across Europe.  That has been a failures of those parties to plan for the return in demand that we had expected for this summer.  As a consequence, we are being told to do mandatory cancellations, particularly from Amsterdam airport and Heathrow airport, to reduce our flights and the number of flights that we had planned.  We are seeing security screening issues and baggage system failures in these airports, particularly at Amsterdam Airport and Heathrow Airport.  Where airports have closed terminals, and not yet reopened them, so the terminals where we are operating are incredibly congested and the infrastructure struggles to cope.  We are seeing stand and gate availability problems when we arrive in these European airports.  In addition, there has been industrial action, particularly by French and Italian air traffic control, which has added further disruption to this summer.  Finally, we have not seen the end of Covid sickness, which has impacted Aer Lingus in recent months and also has an impact on many of the resources around the European system.</p><p> These are a unique set of challenges as Aer Lingus and other airlines ramp up into the summer.  I will now explore about what that means for our operations and for some of our customers.  The reality is that the operational challenges make it impossible for Aer Lingus to deliver the experience that we would like for some of our customers.  The vast majority or more than 98% of flights are operating as planned and the vast majority of customers are getting to their destination as planned.  However, we are seeing impacts of the delays in the system.  These effects include: queues at check-in areas as passengers arrive early, as we have seen at Dublin Airport, for security screening; delays at security screening, thus passengers are late getting to the aircraft for boarding and departure; delays elsewhere in Europe for passengers with reduced mobility and the airport services provided to get those passengers on and off the aircraft; delays in bussing across the European system in moving passengers and crew around the airports; and delays having an impact on stand availability at airports around Europe for incoming aircraft, which causes knock-on delays.  This means that we can start the day ready with crew, aircraft and ground handling resources but as the day progresses we see the following: poor punctuality as all of these issues around the European system play out; customers and their bags miss connecting flights; and as delays compound matters over the course of the day, our crews reach their duty hour limits and that can have an impact on their availability for the next day's rosters.  These issues are compounding.  Due to all of these factors we must occasionally cancel flights, which leads to further disruption. </p><p> In terms of baggage issues, for the point-to-point journeys such as simple journeys like Dublin to Malaga, the vast majority of passengers and bags travel there with no issues at all.  Where we see particular problems is with connecting bags.  I mean connecting bags that come from big European airports that are experiencing problems.  In fact, 60% of the issues that we see with out bags stem from connections from other airlines so interline connections on to Aer Lingus.  In many cases, we have never seen nor touched those bags, and those bags do not make it to Dublin to be reunited with the passenger.</p><p> The huge increase in the number of misplaced bags across the system puts significant strain on our resources in Dublin.  Mr. O'Neill and his team are working incredibly hard to locate bags and reunite them with passengers, as much as we can.  They are clearing bags every day but we find more bags are misplaced every day as we continue to operate to these airports that suffer from these problems.</p><p>There was a peak of 1,800 open files associated with baggage in mid-June.  That figure has now been reduced to 1,200.  We are still clearing bags and experiencing further bag problems on a daily basis at the main hub airports of Heathrow, Amsterdam and Paris, in particular.</p><p> These issues compound to affect customer experience and customer care.  As a consequence of everything I have outlined, our customer call centres are inundated with queries that relate to ticketing, baggage issues, cancellations and missed connections.  Over the last four weeks, the volume of calls to our call centres has increased massively in comparison with pre-pandemic levels.  The time is it taking agents to deal with each issue has increased fourfold due to the complex nature of customer queries.  For the most part, the issues are outside of our control and therefore difficult to resolve for customers.  That is resulting in an unprecedented increase in demand on our call centres.  Given the volume of demand we are now dealing with, we are unable to provide the level of care we would like to provide for each and every customer who has experienced disruption.  As I said, every cancellation and missed bag hurts.  We apologise to every customer who has had a less than satisfactory experience.  We are doing everything we can to try to mitigate the issues, most of which are outside of our control.</p><p> On our schedule, we have leased aircraft and crew to provide extra backup in the case of cancellations and disruption.  We have extended connection times between flights to try to minimise the number of bags and customers caught up in delays or having problems making their connecting flights.  We have continued to recruit staff.  Even though we were ready for the volumes of the summer, the extra disruption issues are putting a further burden on our resources.  We have continued to recruit staff in light of the disruption being experienced.  We have deployed technology and new processes to try to locate bags.  We are using third-party transport operators to try to get bags to customers as quickly as possible.  We have added more staff to our call centres.  We deploy volunteers from head office and the support areas of the business to the airport every day to try to help our operational teams with the issues and to expedite the resolution of baggage issues, in particular.</p><p> I trust this gives members some indication of the challenges that Aer Lingus is facing in what is a very disrupted summer for the industry and the steps we are taking in response to those challenges.  As I said, the pressures to which I have referred are pressures in the wider aviation system.  Dublin Airport is by no means the only airport at which they exist.   Despite the challenges, Aer Lingus is performing strongly in managing the issues that are within our control.  We are also doing everything possible to influence and address the many matters that are outside of our control.  I reiterate my thanks to Aer Lingus staff, who are going above and beyond to help customers as they work through this very challenging summer.</p><p> To conclude on a more positive note, I wish to put the scale of the increase in passenger numbers into context.   In June 2021, a mere 300,000 passengers travelled through Dublin Airport.  The figure for June 2022 was 2.8 million.  While the recovery in traffic has brought many challenges, it is critical to the wider Irish economy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-26a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Harrison" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022072600002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the DAA to attend today's meeting.  When the DAA last appeared before the committee on 1 June, we addressed the very challenging events of Sunday, 29 May, which saw 1,400 passengers miss their flights as a result of lengthy queues at Dublin Airport&rsquo;s security screening areas.  While there is no room for complacency, I am pleased to report that seven weeks on, the airport's security screening processes are now on a far more robust and sustainable footing.</p> <p>  At our meeting with the committee in June, the DAA outlined the substantial capacity challenges we faced as we sought to bridge Dublin Airport&rsquo;s resourcing gap and meet the demands of a rapid spike in air travel across the globe.  We also acknowledged a number of key shortcomings with respect to the airport&rsquo;s operations on 29 May and laid out our plans to address these challenges and restore confidence for our passengers.</p><p>As a result of the implementation of these plans, the wait times at the airport&rsquo;s security screening areas have now improved significantly.  During June, Dublin Airport served more than 2.8 million passengers in total, and more than 90% of all passengers were processed through security in 45 minutes or less.  During July, we have continued to see exceptional levels of growth at the airport.  Over the full month of July, we expect that the airport will serve almost 3.1 million passengers, an average of 100,000 passengers every day.  Despite this rapid growth, further improvements to the airport's security performance have been successfully achieved.  To date in July, more than 95% of all passengers have been processed through security in under 45 minutes.  More than 85% of passengers have queued for 30 minutes or less.  Prudent contingency measures have been put in place by both the DAA and the Government to provide safeguards should any external challenges arise.  However, these measures have not been required to date given the operational improvements made.</p><p> At present, Dublin Airport continues to advise passengers to arrive 2.5 hours in advance for a short-haul flight and 3.5 hours in advance of a long-haul flight.  This advice remains prudent in the current circumstances.  As outlined, while positive progress has been achieved with respect to security queue times, we are advising passengers that they should continue to allow up to one hour to clear security screening.  In addition, they then need to walk to their gate and board their aircraft.  The current advice allows sufficient time for this.  If a passenger is checking a bag, this requires additional time.  As a result, we continue to advise that, where possible, passengers should allow up to one additional hour where they need to do so.  We also recommend that they confirm specific opening times for the airline that they are travelling with.  Airlines can also communicate directly with their own intending passengers to provide more tailored advice, should they wish to do so.  While the early presentation of passengers remains a feature across the industry, we believe this has arisen as a result of general anxiety levels with respect to international travel.  This trend is therefore unlikely to abate until the overall narrative regarding air travel becomes more positive.</p><p>  The airport&rsquo;s recruitment programme is also continuing at pace.  When the DAA last met the committee, we indicated that we intended to bring a further 70 security officers into our business during June, with no upper limits placed on recruitment in the period beyond.  In fact, during June we recruited almost 100 new airport security unit officers.  During July, we have brought more than 50 further recruits into the business.  This means that since October 2021, we have now delivered a total increase of 356 security staff in our terminals, net of exits.  Security staffing levels have almost returned to 2019 levels, while recruitment is continuing.  Recruiting, retaining and training such a large number of new staff members to the very high standards required is challenging.  This will continue to have our full focus over the weeks and months ahead.</p><p> Over the past seven weeks, we have also been engaging very closely with all passengers impacted by the events of 29 May.  As of this week, more than 75% of all claims received by the DAA have now either been closed out or are at an advanced stage of processing.  Additionally, our teams have put significant focus on improving standards for our passengers across all other areas of the airport.  This includes the critical area of cleanliness of airport facilities, where we acknowledge standards have suffered.  Through significant engagement with both our teams and third parties, we have now materially increased cleaning resources.  This has enabled a series of deep cleans at night and other targeted actions across the terminals.  Since we last attended the committee, almost 4,000 further task force shifts have been worked by our management and office-based teams, with more than 500 of these focused specifically on cleaning.  In addition, we are working closely with third-party food and beverage concessionaires to enhance their focus on cleaning.   We are also placing strong focus on services for our passengers with reduced mobility, and we continue to work very closely with our third-party provider with respect to this area.  Our aim is to ensure that these passengers have a positive experience and that service standards are maintained despite the significant volume growth.</p><p> The airport clearly still has a journey ahead to rebuild trust with our passengers and to restore all aspects of our operations to the standards that we routinely delivered pre-Covid.</p><p>However, it has been very encouraging to see our passengers acknowledge the marked improvement in the airport&rsquo;s operations in recent months.  As a result of the steps taken and the plans in place, we are confident that we will maintain a safe and stable operation and deliver improving standards over the days, weeks and months ahead.</p><p> I take this opportunity to express our huge gratitude to all members of our team for their outstanding efforts in delivering these improvements.  The passion, commitment and resilience they have shown have been simply incredible.  They have shouldered huge responsibility to deliver for the travelling public and have taken strong initial steps to restore pride and trust in Dublin Airport.  I also thank the travelling public for their patience and understanding during this period.  In particular, I thank them for their very many positive messages of support, both directly and through social media, which have been hugely appreciated by our colleagues across the business.</p><p> While airport operations have seen considerable improvements over the past seven weeks, a range of other significant challenges have emerged across the wider international aviation network.  This has been reflected in the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights to and from Dublin Airport during July to date.  Many of these cancellations have taken place as a result of flight caps imposed at other airports or due to capacity constraints experienced by airlines as a result of Covid-19.  Passengers have also experienced a range of other impacts, including luggage delays, both in Ireland and abroad.  As the challenges in these areas have intensified, I believe there has been a growing understanding among passengers of just how complex the causes of these issues are.  There has also been increased awareness of the respective responsibilities and interdependencies that exist within our industry.</p><p> As the committee is aware, as an airport operator, DAA has direct responsibility for the airport&rsquo;s security operations, the airport infrastructure and the overall experience passengers have within our terminals.  As outlined, since the challenges of 29 May, significant work has been undertaken to address the difficulties faced in these areas.  While challenges remain, I hope our passengers are now seeing the impact of these actions.  However, as an airport operator, DAA does not control areas such as airline flight cancellations or the handling of passengers&rsquo; baggage.  The responsibility for these specific areas sits with the airlines and their ground handling agents.  Similar to DAA, they are taking considerable steps to address the challenges they are currently facing in this respect, which I am sure they will outline to the committee in more detail today.</p><p> Passengers are becoming increasingly aware of the global nature of the issues currently facing the sector.  There are few countries that have not been impacted by the current challenges.  From the UK to Europe, the US, Australia and Asia, the issues relating to flight cancellations, delays and passenger baggage are dominating headlines right across the globe.  In recent months, airports such Heathrow, Gatwick, Frankfurt and Amsterdam Schiphol have been forced to implement flight caps as a result of severe challenges faced by their passengers.  This in turn has impacted on the holiday and travel plans of millions of people.  This is a course of action that we have worked extremely hard to avoid at Dublin Airport.  Our aim has been to ensure that our passengers make their flights and get to take that long-awaited and much-deserved holiday.  Through the implementation of our plans, we have succeeded in avoiding the types of flight caps and cancellations that are now in place at many other European airports.</p><p> Looking forward, the industry will remain challenged over the period ahead.  All industry players, including airports, airlines and ground handlers, will need to address their own specific challenges in order to restore the high standards that passengers expect of us all.  Ultimately, however, every single player within our industry is united by one key factor - the passengers we serve.  If any one element of the ecosystem faces difficulties, whether it is the airport, the airlines, the ground handling services or any other player within the supply chain network, the overall passenger experience is impacted.  As a result, industry collaboration will be more important than ever as we look to the future.  This is something we are totally committed to over the period ahead.</p><p> I thank the committee for extending the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting to DAA.  I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-26a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022072600002#H00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak at this meeting.  As one of several handlers operating in Dublin, and with around 80% of flights being self-handled by airlines, I must be clear that we are not able to speak on behalf of all ground handlers or the aviation industry as a whole.</p><p>While we will outline a number of significant hurdles we have faced as the demand for air travel has returned, Swissport itself has consistently seen good outputs in baggage handling and on-time performance.  Some 85% of flights handled by Swissport have left on time or early from Dublin Airport.  We acknowledge that this is lower than we would expect and that there is work to be done but we are pleased that we have maintained a stable performance.  This has been achievable thanks to the incredible support and flexibility of our employees and the co-operation our customer airlines.</p><p> We understand that many passengers travelling through Dublin Airport have had an unacceptable experience over the last few months.  While Swissport will always take responsibility and apologise for any occasion where it has played a part in disruption, we are proud that we have managed to deliver for our customers despite some very challenging circumstances.  Swissport has put significant effort, finance and planning into our readiness for the summer at Dublin, bringing in over 300 additional employees so far this year.  This has meant we have been able to provide additional handling support and requests within the airport, outside of initial programs of work and schedules.  This is one example of how we all, across the industry and in government, need to continue working together so passengers can fly with confidence.  We have also used the global Swissport network, as the largest provider of ground handling services worldwide, to fly in experienced and highly trained personnel from other Swissport locations across Europe to support the skills and experience gap.  There have been a number of hurdles in reaching this position.</p><p> It is important to remember that the pandemic had a severe impact on the aviation industry, worse than any in living memory.  Globally, aviation was brought nearly to a standstill.  Aviation experts across the board predicted that it would take years to recover.  It is positive news that flight volumes are now returning but this rapid return in demand, after long uncertainty, has exacerbated resource challenges across the board in aviation.  While we are pleased that in Ireland, thanks to a collaborative process with our trade union partners and being able to make use of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, we were able to hold off redundancies.  However, two years of travel bans and restrictions have resulted in many knowledgeable and experienced employees making a tough choice to leave the sector for more stable employment.</p><p> Also in Ireland, the newly introduced enhanced background checks in January 2022 resulted in a complete standstill in the approval and issuing of airport ID passes, effectively resulting in no employees being recruited in the first three months of the year.  Approvals now take an average of around four weeks but we have found some prospective recruits cannot wait for the time it takes for this process to be completed.  Security checks are of course vital to the safety of all airport users but we must be clear that this has delayed our ability to effectively train and deploy new employees.  In the UK, we have been able to use temporary escorted passes to enable new employees to support operations and complete essential training.  However, this was not an option in Ireland until recently.  We and other airline partners lobbied the DAA and the Department of Transport to consider making use of this initiative.  It is a key opportunity to provide an immediate injection of critical manpower while waiting for security checks to be completed.</p><p> A key part of the ramp operations role is being able to drive the airport vehicles used to transport luggage to and from the aircraft and terminal buildings.  However, with the rules brought in by the Department of Transport and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, preventing non-EU licenceholders from driving for work purposes on airport grounds, we have a significant deficit of equipment operators at Dublin Airport.  With a wait of between three and four months for the Irish driving examinations these workers are required to complete, they will not be fully utilised until Christmas 2022.  This will continue to impact operations until then.</p><p> These issues, combined with knock-on delays from other parts of the journey, such as security, check-in, baggage, flight schedules and air traffic, have led to very challenging conditions over the last few months across the UK and Ireland.  At Dublin Airport we have specifically seen an adverse impact from the significant queues at security, continued volatility in flight schedules and infrastructure challenges.  The short-shipped baggage volumes in Dublin for Swissport and handled by Swissport have remained very low and within normal parameters.  We have helped where we can to tackle the disruption caused by short-shipping from the major hubs that feed into Dublin.  Ultimately, baggage is one of the more visual parts of the complex process behind every flight.  People should understand that because of its position at the end of the process, it is often the baggage handlers who have to absorb the knock-on effects of delays further up the chain, so they are already facing a delay before they get to start on their part of the process.  This is not to deflect blame onto any one party but a reminder that aviation can be viewed as an ecosystem where delays in one part combine and escalate to cause delays in another part.  It is not just about how quickly baggage is loaded on and off the aircraft.  Nevertheless, we reiterate that despite the challenges outlined, Swissport&rsquo;s own operations have held up remarkably well.  Our preparations have resulted in us being in a strong enough position to support our airline partners, as previously described, with our staff working extremely hard with these partners to minimise the impact on passengers.</p><p>I must be clear that we can only speak for our own operations and remain proud that we have been in a position to provide this additional support at Dublin Airport and minimise disruption.  We will continue to work with industry partners and the Government to facilitate long-awaited flights for passengers so they can be assured of a smooth experience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-26a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Darren Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022072600002#K00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting Sky Handling Partner, SHP, to appear.  SHP provides third-party ground handling services to airlines at Dublin Airport.  The observations and opinions my colleague, Mr. Kenny, and I will offer are solely those of the company; they are not expressed on behalf of airlines, other ground handling agents or any other airport community member.</p> <p>  During the pandemic, it was appropriate and entirely justified that public health was prioritised.  The restrictions imposed on international travel resulted in a 75% reduction in our activity at Dublin Airport.  Inevitably, a contraction in our workforce took place as valued teams members opted to seek employment in industries they considered more secure.  The exodus of skilled experience and expertise in 2020 and 2021 will take time to replenish but robust progress is being made.</p> <p>  SHP is mindful and conscious of the travel experience of passengers at Dublin Airport this year.  The rapid rebound in international travel has presented significant challenges for aviation globally.  Dublin has been no exception in this regard.  Our service standards simply have not returned to the pre-pandemic level.  On-time performance sits 25% below where it was pre-pandemic.  SHP accepts and acknowledges responsibility for shortcomings in our performance standards in 2022 and sincerely apologises where this has resulted in disruption and inconvenience for passengers.</p> <p>  As a company, we have invested substantial resources to increase our workforce, with financial incentives to promote recruitment and retention.  Post pandemic, it is critical that ground handling can attract the best and brightest to our industry.  I am pleased that SHP has managed to recruit 280 employees who are either live on current operations or due to complete training within the next fortnight.</p> <p>  It is important to point out the difficulties associated with recruitment in the first three months of 2022 due to the implementation of the EU regulation in respect of enhanced security background checks.  Although security and safety are paramount in any airport environment, the processing time to perform these additional checks was excessive, with it taking several weeks for airport IDs to be completed, ensuring there was no material uplift in resource levels for quarter 1 of 2022.  Formal correspondence was sent to the Department of Transport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 10 March, outlining our concerns and referencing the potential impact on operations at Dublin Airport this year.  The current airport ID processing time has reduced to three to four weeks, which is a more reasonable and manageable timeframe, and this is to be welcomed.  The recent increase in airport escort IDs, to 14 days, provides an opportunity for our new employees to undertake additional airside training.  Again, this is to be welcomed and acknowledged as an example of relevant stakeholders working together to address the unique challenges for summer 2022.</p> <p>  A source of frustration as we embark on a significant upskilling programme of current staff is the number of non-EU licence holders who are restricted from driving at the airport.  A key element of our operation is having sufficient numbers of drivers trained to operate vehicles that ferry passenger baggage and cargo to and from the aircraft side.  It is important that the Department of Transport and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, revisit these restrictions as this would immediately provide a large increase in the driving pool available to SHP.</p> <p>  Short-shipped baggage volumes from international hubs that feed Dublin Airport have been at an unprecedented scale and continue to prove extremely challenging.  Some European airports have imposed passenger or flight caps to minimise disruption for the remainder of the summer season.  Likewise, there has been curtailment of certain airline schedules and it is expected that this will help alleviate, but not eliminate, the instances of short-shipped baggage.</p><p>In the meantime, SHP, with the support of DAA, has managed to secure a landside location adjacent to terminals 1 and 2.  This location enables us to move baggage to a secure site where our teams can work on processing bags for local delivery by courier, or reflighting if necessary.  More important, it also permits passengers to attend and claim lost baggage directly.  This is a critical development as passenger access to airside locations is limited by security protocols.  In addition, airlines are extensively supporting the repatriation of baggage by sending support teams to Dublin.</p><p> SHP has a strong and proud record of achievement through the past two decades.  We are a proactive and valued member of the airport community and have engaged constructively with all relevant stakeholders to mitigate the impact of disruption at Dublin Airport this year.  We are committed to contributing to an improved passenger experience at Dublin Airport.  It is important that I publicly commend the effort, flexibility and commitment demonstrated by SHP front-line staff and support teams in recent months.  I am very proud of each and every one of them.  Equally, I am grateful for the excellent collaboration and partnership of our airline customers during these exceptional times.</p></speech>

We will now move to questions.  Members will have ten minutes each.  There is a significant number of members present, which is great.  The ten-minute slot is for questions from members and answers from the witnesses.  In the interest of clarity, I ask members and witnesses to keep their questions or answers as brief as possible.  The travelling public has come to us with queries and we are duty bound to follow up on those queries.  We have a rota system and I am first up this week.</p> <p>  I will come to the witnesses in the order they gave their opening statements.  I want to deal with matters in real time.  We are fast approaching the bank holiday weekend.  Does Aer Lingus have an indication at this stage whether flights to or from Dublin, Cork or Shannon airports will be cancelled?  When will that be made known?  How does Aer Lingus contact passengers in such situations?  Can they get alternative flights?  If so, how quickly can that be done?</p> <p>  I ask Ms Embleton to deal with the impact of the Heathrow cap.  Obviously, there are Heathrow routes to Dublin, but also to Shannon and Cork, and some of those flights have been cancelled recently.  She referred to the Heathrow cap being mandatory.  We are hearing that some airlines are ignoring the mandatory nature of the cap.  I ask her to feed that into the response of Aer Lingus in those areas.</p> <p>  During the pandemic, Aer Lingus gave vouchers to passengers.  We have received queries from the public on this and our understanding is that the vouchers can only be used on flights out of Ireland and in euro currency.  Will Aer Lingus consider, post pandemic, that the vouchers could be used on any Aer Lingus flight into or out of Ireland, or elsewhere, and in a currency other than euro?</p></speech>

As regards cancellations, we always try to give customers as much notice as possible.  When we have to make mandatory cancellations, we make that public and contact customers as soon as we can.  There are occasions when we have more short-notice cancellations, which are typically sickness-related.  In such circumstances, we are unable to give customers as much notice but, every time, we try to accommodate customers, put them onto other airlines and-----</p></speech>

Sickness levels have been running at approximately four times what they were in 2019.  As I stated, we have had more resources than normal but that extra buffer gets eaten into.  Our sickness level is tracking consistently with the level of Covid cases in Ireland more generally.  The majority of cancellations are not caused by that but, rather, by the restrictions put in place by other airports.  In such cases, we try to give customers as much notice as possible.</p><p>Of course, we are in the summer peak-----</p></speech>

This is frustrating for us.  We have sold those flights.  We have customers who have made their plans around those flights.  We are complying where we need to take flights out.  The majority of the flights we have taken out have been Dublin flights, not Cork and Shannon.  We have had to take out some from Cork and Shannon.  When we look at this problem we look at how many customers are affected, how we can rebook customers ideally on the same day to get them to their destination, how many connecting passengers are involved in that and indeed the slots at the various airports, which are key for us going into next summer to make sure that we retain the slots that we have.

For example, on Friday and on Monday, which are the two busiest days, we expect there will be in the region of 105,000 passengers through.  In fact, there were 104,000 passengers last Monday and about the same last Friday.  While I think people naturally associate bank holiday weekends with additional throughput and perhaps travel throughout the country, we do not anticipate it being materially different to what we have been facing for a number of weeks now.</p></speech>

However, as we committed to in our previous session, we have focused in particular on the highest priority areas.  In the early stages, that was ensuring that people did not miss flights.  Progressively we have been in a position to improve and we continue to do so, particularly in regard to cleaning.  Again the focus has been on the highest priority but we have been in a position to allocate far more resources recently.</p></speech>

People are obviously being impacted greatly.  Anybody who has been in the airport recently has seen the stacked up baggage.  Even when you make a flight, it is generally late.  You make the connecting flight on the basis that it is also late.  I accept that there is an international dimension to all of this.</p> <p>  If we could deal with Aer Lingus first.  The initial problem started before Heathrow had put the cap in place.  Could Ms Embleton explain what caused the problem at that stage?  Was it largely cases of Covid-19 among the staff of the airline?  Ms Embleton stated that there is an impact in the context of Heathrow and Amsterdam.  I am assuming that she cannot really tell what the problem is until it occurs.  What sort of timeframe does she have in the context of making decisions?</p></speech>

However, the problems across aviation have been ramping up over the summer.  There have been one or two extraordinary events, such as the baggage system failures at Heathrow's terminal 2, where we operate, and in Amsterdam.  These caused particular spikes.</p> <p>  We started the summer with enough aeroplanes, crew and ground staff to allow us to be ready for a normal summer, with some extra disruption.  The flight departs, it picks up delays because of the need to wait for customers to get through screening and for passengers with restricted mobility to come off aircraft.  It also picks up delays because stands at other airports are congested.  Those delays mean that passengers miss connections, and crew have extended hours and can come up against their duty limits.  The delays have been prevalent all the way through the summer and it is those delays that have started to impact significantly on our operations.  I come back to the point that the vast majority of our customers are still travelling with their bags.  It is only in the case of a small number of passengers that the process gets disrupted.  However, when it gets disrupted, it does hurt.  This has been increasing as the summer has progressed and has culminated in the mandated cancellations from Amsterdam and Heathrow.</p></speech>

Is Ms Embleton saying that the majority of problems with lost baggage relate to connecting flights and have not been caused by Aer Lingus's operations?</p></speech>

In the context of the vast majority of simple journeys with Aer Lingus, customers and bags travel successfully.  The main issue relates to the transferring of bags, in particular from other carriers to Aer Lingus.  That is where we are at the end of the chain trying to deliver those bags to the customers.  As stated earlier, in many cases we may not have touched those bags.  They are likely to be in a European airport elsewhere.  The vast majority of Aer Lingus point-to-point bags and customers travel successfully.</p></speech>

We have added hundreds of agents in order to try to deal with customer queries.  Given delays, cancellations and baggage, the volume of customer queries has increased.  The time it is taking to try to resolves those queries has increased.  They are not simple to resolve because they are out of our control in many cases.  The overall demand on our call centres and customer care has therefore increased manyfold.  Even though we are adding resources, we simply cannot respond to every customer in the timely way that we would like.</p></speech>

The real dilemma is the ones are ageing, that have come in having being mishandled some time ago in some cases, and often arriving to us with very little information.  The procedure is that the bag is rushed from one airport to another.  In doing that, the bag arrives but some of the original documentation can go astray.  That means it turns into a bit of detective work and the processing time around that gets quite involved.  The other industry-wide problem is because, as some of the other contributors have pointed out, the industry generally is under strain so the information coming from other airports and handlers around bags that they have on hand, is quite constrained.  They are not necessarily getting to update systems.  We may have a bag in Dublin and we are looking for the details of it.  If the missing bag report has not been filled elsewhere, we have nothing to trace that against-----</p></speech>

We get a lot of applications from non-nationals for roles such as baggage handling and driving.  Essentially, they have driver's licences, for example, from Brazil and Mexico, and they are here due to having a stamp 2 immigration permission.  They can work full time during the summer and they can drive on national roads but not in the airport even though it is deemed to be a national road, which is a bone of contention and one we are trying to address through the Department of Transport.  The Airport Identification Card or AIC centre as it is known said, "No, that the matter is not signed off", and referred the matter to safety in the DAA, which came back and said, "No, these people are not permitted to drive".</p></speech>

I also want to put on record the work of the DAA.  I am absolutely blown away by how quickly the DAA has dealt with the problems and queues for getting through security.  My experience the first time was such that I had to wait about two and half hours to get through fast track and through security and last Saturday, 16 July, I went through fast track in 15 minutes and left myself sitting in the airport for three and half hours as a result so the DAA is doing a great job.  However, and there is always an "however", a great job has been done on security but the cleanliness is diabolical in every corner of the airport and something must be done.  The food situation is also diabolical and something must be done.  I understand that with the massive numbers of people arriving early and hanging around the airport that these are challenging areas for the organisation but I know that the DAA will step up to the plate.  At the worst of times my experience of Dublin Airport was comparable with what I experienced in London and at Berlin airport in Germany.</p><p> I wish to say to all of the delegations that the interaction with staff has been amazing.  All staff have been under huge pressure yet I have never been met with anything but good humour and people willing to push themselves the extra bit both on the ground and in the air.  I compliment all the people involved.</p><p> I do not have a huge number of dealings with baggage staff other than I get back any baggage that I did put in, which is the important thing for me.  I will deal with the issue in a couple of minutes.</p><p> I assume that the DAA will bring in somebody to deal with the cleaning and food issues.  I appreciate that people must deal with very large numbers but the DAA must do something.</p></speech>

As the Senator will appreciate, with the volumes of people in each of the areas, particularly airside, and the fact that previously the airport operated without people airside for the early hours of the morning, we now have people on the premises at all times, so that situation has really got in the way of our ability to deliver some of those services, in addition to resource constraints.  Those constraints are being alleviated but by no means eliminated.  I believe that having had our intense focus on the security issues, which were a major concern to our ability to maintain operations and I thank the Senator for his comments about our response to those, we are absolutely turning our energies to each of the areas in which standards are not at the level at which we would like.</p></speech>

I observed the queues for Aer Lingus flights and observed families with young children who were 25 minutes in the queue.  The Aer Lingus staff checked them in straightaway because they recognised that it is difficult to keep children controlled and I give the staff full compliments for that action.  However, on Sunday afternoon I had to sit in terminal 2 for quite some period and during that time I observed the noticeboard for arrivals, and observed how quickly bags were moving.  One would see when bags got on to the belt, when they were delivered and when the flight was closed.  For the Malaga flight that arrived at 19:09, the bags were cleared at 20:25.</p><p>That is almost an hour and a half.  It is a long time to be hanging around for a bag.  It is not as long as Mr. Tully&rsquo;s and Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s staff are waiting for bags, but it is a long time to be hanging around.  </p><p> On missed flights, if I miss a flight, say, to London with Aer Lingus and the next flight out is full, do they take somebody off that flight and let me in or must I wait until there is a vacant slot?</p></speech>

We went through a two-year period where we had to deal with Covid.  Out of all the governments in Europe - I am not a member of the Government party - the Irish Government laid on significant supports for companies to retain staff.  I do not accept that staff went off and found new or better jobs, because there was nowhere to go to get a better job.  I think the witnesses&rsquo; strategy was wrong with respect to laying off people or making people redundant.  I want to ask DAA representatives whether they would accept that strategy was wrong and whether in the future they need to think more long-term in respect of staff retention.</p></speech>

As I said, we did not enforce any redundancies.  We looked to keep everybody on board.  However, cargo and logistics is very aligned to our business and that is where many people went.  They went into cargo and logistics because there was a high demand and they could pick up extra hours.  Some 80% of our business disappeared during Covid, so that is the same impact it had on our staff then as well.</p></speech>

We also lost permanent business as well, such as the collapse of Flybe just the before the pandemic in February 2020.  Some operation just pulled out of Dublin completely.  There was obviously Stobart in 2021 as well.  We lost permanent business that was not potentially coming back after the pandemic.  Therefore, there as an element of downsizing with that.  However, we retained a core group of staff.  We retained them above-wing at 100% and below-wing we retained a core group with key skills for us.  However, some individuals took the opportunity to look at the industry and move.  Another reason for that is we were potentially opening, getting airline schedules coming in that looked quite strong and then we were getting cancellations because of restrictions in place in Ireland and in different jurisdictions around Europe as well.  It was very hard for us to give any certainty to our staff and tell them in two or three months we will essentially be back to pre-pandemic times and, therefore, individuals made decisions and exited the business.</p></speech>

I will not dispute that.  However, during the pandemic, there were many months in which we were operating with fewer passengers in the month than we might process during the three hours of the committee meeting today.  Particularly, in areas such as security screening, when there are no passengers travelling, there is literally no work to be done.  The people who left our organisation left by means of voluntary redundancy.  Nobody was required to leave the organisation.</p></speech>

The Chair mentioned the Defence Forces.  As a former member of the Defence Forces and one that was nominated to the Seanad by the Defence Forces, among others, I take grave exception to the Defence Forces being requested to go in and dig these organisations out of a hole.  I fully understand the needs of the public and the needs of the airport to maintain itself.  I know it was not the witnesses who invited the Defence Forces in.  They went to the Minister, who asked his colleague, the Minister for Defence, to provide the Defence Forces.  I just think it is an insult to the Defence Forces.</p><p>That is not what they are in this country for.  That is not their role and we should never let that happen again.

It has been very informative and it brought us up to date.  It was important that we had this meeting.  It has also given our visitors the opportunity to convey to the public how the airport works.  The DAA was taking the brunt of everybody&rsquo;s criticism.  Everybody thought it was the cause of all the problems at the airport.  Obviously, the running of the airport and the aviation industry is a complex operation.  There is a level of interdependency and collaboration that makes the system work.  As we have heard, I think the public is now more aware, because they never been under more scrutiny.  There has been huge media attention.  As a result of that, people now understand how the system works.</p> <p>  In terms of the collaboration, it is at a high level at this time because everyone has to work together to overcome the difficulties that are there.  What is the hierarchy?  Is there a system or are there procedures in place?  Do the witnesses meet regularly?  Do the heads of each group meet?  How do they, in a normal course when the airport is running well, interact?  Is there a formal procedure or is it simply a case of acting or connecting with each other when it is necessary?  </p> <p>  When we had the DAA in last time, we had many prophecies about doom and gloom.  The DAA responded splendidly.  It did an exceptionally good job under difficult circumstances.  I have been through the airport on a number of occasions and the arrangements that were put in place as a result of the overcrowding and delays have worked particularly well.  It would not have worked without the focus and concentration of the workforce.  Going through the airport, one sees the same people doing the same job.  It is so repetitive.  They have to remain in good humour and handle so many different people.  Obviously, the public gets agitated and it is not an easy job.  Today, we should compliment them on the work they are doing and hope that they continue to do that.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that 2.8 million passengers went through the airport in June.  Many of them had baggage.  We got the answers regarding how much baggage has been delayed and what have you.  We have here today Swissport, SHP and Aer Lingus.  What proportion of baggage is handled by whom?  How much of the business is handled by Swissport, SHP and the airlines themselves, respectively?</p></speech>

We are always encountering a problem with the processing of identification and clearance with the vetting office.  The vetting office happens to be in my constituency and it is under enormous pressure.  The workload continues to increase.  It is high time that our committee brought in the Garda and the Department of Transport and had a full and open discussion about the vetting process and the resources required so that these people can get an adequate response.  It is so frustrating to have people trained and ready to go and then not be able to put them on the job because they are waiting for ID.  This committee needs to take that on.  I mentioned it previously and I think we have to do it at an early date.</p> <p>  On the claims that have been made, it was mentioned that 75% of the claims have been addressed.  Can our witnesses give us an indication of what those claims involved?  Obviously, they were for tickets.  Were there hotels involved?  What is the estimated cost?  The witnesses have now got through that process.  What is the estimated cost and what has been the cost to date in settling those claims with the public who were discommoded as a result of a breakdown in the system?</p></speech>

The DAA may have a more accurate figure on the exact customer numbers and their breakdown.  I expect Aer Lingus accounts for more than one third of the airport's operations.</p> <p>  Disruption is certainly an expense for us this year.  We are compensating passengers for bags, cancellations and delays, and that cost is running into millions of euro.  On the question around the procedures and collaboration across the airport, first and foremost, the collaboration is within our teams.  Are we ready and joined up across all aspects of our operation?  We have regular meetings with the DAA, which Mr. O'Neill can elaborate on, and we also have meetings and dialogue with our airline partners with which we have codeshare and connecting flights.  There is collaboration across the system and with other airports.  We have said a lot of these issues are driven by major hubs around Europe.  Those airports will bring airline and handler community calls and all the players together to discuss the issues.  This is quite often done in a retrospective manner rather than a proactive manner in those airports.  Wherever we are invited to join those conversations, we ensure an Aer Lingus person is involved.</p></speech>

On average, we handle about 120,000 bags a month through Dublin.  As regards collaboration and consistent meeting, the airport operators committee holds a meeting every single month but, in fairness, key partners such as the DAA are always available and we meet them weekly on any issues because there are various dynamics that can change.  There are no issues on that side from our perspective.</p></speech>

Ryanair manages its operations in Dublin Airport and Aer Lingus manages its operations.  In many of the other stations in which they operate the other leg of a journey, they are reliant on these companies or other providers to provide the handling service in those airports.  In Dublin Airport, however, they manage their operations themselves.  Roughly 80% of the business is managed between the two based carriers and, as Mr. Tully and Mr. Moloney said, the remainder-----</p></speech>

In the same way as Aer Lingus has said, the simple operation of the point-to-point system, which predominately pertains to the Ryanair network out of Dublin, is not affected to anything like the same extent.  I think that is their experience.</p></speech>

There is a perception out there, which is heard through the media, that Aer Lingus is cancelling flights.  I think Aer Lingus cancelled 1,000 flights this week.  Will the witnesses address the perception that Aer Lingus is cancelling flights while Ryanair is not?</p></speech>

We are cancelling only a small percentage of flights for July.  If we compare that with other airlines, we are seeing cancellation rates of 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, and, in the case of EasyJet, 14%.  Relative to the broader European landscape, Aer Lingus is cancelling very few flights.  Similarly, as regards bags that are going on a simple point-to-point journey, which are typically short-haul flights, I would say 990 out of 1,000 bags handled by Aer Lingus are transported with no problems whatsoever.  It is the connecting flights in other airports that are causing us issues and causing the extra workload we are trying to deal with.</p></speech>

If people have to pay for flights, in the event that flights are not rebooked by their airline free of charge, incidental expenses, food and drink are the predominant expenses.  Staff have been working closely with anyone affected.  Sometimes it takes a little bit of toing and froing in terms of getting receipts, etc., but we are working through all those claims very quickly.  We have found people to be very reasonable and that has helped to expedite the clearance of claims.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.  I listened to and watched them contribute during the to and fro.</p><p>Quite a number of my questions have been answered.  Deputy Lowry made the point that the two baggage handling companies that have been brought before us each deal with about 10% of the overall volume of baggage.  We have Aer Lingus here indirectly through Ms Embleton, Mr. Moriarty and so on, but the two baggage handling companies are a relatively small part of the overall baggage handling that happens at Dublin Airport.  On that point, would it be fair to say that the vast bulk of the problems involve transfer flights, that is, flights that are not direct flights - for example, people coming from Greece to Dublin via Zurich or Istanbul who arrive at their destination but whose bags get lost somewhere <i>en route</i>?  Ms Embleton referred to point-to-point travel.  Is it the same with that?  Do Air France flights from Dublin Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport not cause similar problems?  Do transfer flights account for most of the bags on Aer Lingus flights that are caught up?</p></speech>

Effectively, to carry bags on board, people have to pay a surcharge.  It is free to put bags in the hold.  Passengers have to turn up that bit earlier, check in their bags and then, potentially, lose the bags.  I accept the point about point-to-point flights being less problematic than transfer flights.  Effectively, however, people are being charged more for the privilege of carrying bags on board than they would be charged to have them put in the hold, which potentially creates other problems for both the airline and the passenger further down the line.</p></speech>

I could put my liquids and everything else into my hold luggage and just travel through the airport with a phone, a laptop and whatever else.  There is a benefit to that but, effectively, Aer Lingus is incentivising people to put their bags into the hold, and that may then cause a problem for baggage handling.</p></speech>

If the customer is in Ireland, we will dispatch locally.  We are using the facility landside for that as well.

The new control tower is there, which is great, and the new runway will be opened in the next month or so, which is also great.  I was talking to a country manager of one of the long-haul airlines who said it would love to bring in a couple more flights a week and the airport has the slots but it does not have the baggage handlers, the check-in agents or the air bridge operators.  How is that hindering Dublin Airport's ability to sell itself as having the handling partners required?  Equally, do Sky and Swissport have the staff to bring in new business or accept new business if it is looking to be here?</p> <p>  I have a final question.  The committee visited Shannon Airport .  We saw the new cabin baggage screening, which, I am aware, is extremely expensive and heavy.  It is a game-changer, though, because it can deal with larger liquids, is much quieter, there is less confiscation, fewer bags needing to be pulled and so on.  When does the authority see that baggage screening coming into Dublin Airport?  The other point is about how can DAA handle new business.  Is there a capacity constraint on Dublin Airport, and where is the authority relative to that?</p></speech>

We are in discussions with airlines all the time about opportunities.  In terms of the level of demand, the summer activity has taken everybody by surprise.  While we would always be grateful for more business, the capacity challenges we have already experienced have been part of the reason some of that capacity has not been delivered, whether that is because of cancellations or particular airlines changing their plans.  As a result, our focus will be on ensuring we can bring about that additional business next year and in the years after.  The way capacity is managed at the airport is through the slot allocation process which is supported by a number of capacity triggers that are available.  Runway capacity is typically the most constrained of those so that determines the level of activity within an hour.</p></speech>

Aer Lingus has aircraft on order.  We want to grow, and we want to build a hub.  It is absolutely fundamental the airport facilities are able to accommodate that growth.

We need to see the capacity of the airlines expand as they try to bring more passengers.</p></speech>

It is a very worthwhile meeting.  I return to the mandated cap in Heathrow and the impact that is having, especially on Shannon Airport.  As I understand it, we have 23 different slots that Aer Lingus holds for use in Heathrow.  Is that correct?  How many of those slots are allocated to Shannon?</p></speech>

Recently, because of the mandated cut, that has had to be reduced to two per day.  Typically, we are trying to reaccommodate passengers who are disrupted by that cancellation of services on the same day and we are largely managing to achieve that, so the disruption is minimised in that respect.</p></speech>

We have figures up to 20 July.  Due to the mandate and other issues, we cancelled 43 services on the Dublin route, 12 on the Cork route and 11 on the Shannon route.  That has moved on a little bit since 20 July but that is a sense of scale.  As to how we the decision, it is an operational decision based upon what will discommode the least number of passengers and what is our ability to reaccommodate them most efficiently.  The lens we use is the customer lens and trying to accommodate the customers as quickly as possible on the earliest available service.</p></speech>

We have fewer flights, as Mr. Moriarty will understand.  Dublin is taking the biggest hit, followed by Cork and then Shannon, but it is our lifeline to the world.  It is our connection to the massive hub that is Heathrow.  When that is removed or disrupted in any way it has an impact on business, tourism and future investment.  I ask that Aer Lingus take that into account to minimise the impact.  I acknowledge some of this is out of the airline's hands.  A remark was made earlier that other airlines are not taking this mandated cap on board at all.  It appears Aer Lingus is best in class on it.  It does have, and is having, an impact on the region.</p> <p>  When we are discussing slots and Heathrow, there was a deal brokered between the Government and Aer Lingus back in 2015.  A number of caveats were built into that and number 1 was the protection of those slots and that vital link.  Growth was also to happen in Shannon, Cork and Dublin as well.  That deal comes to an end in September of this year.  I would like to get the airline management's thoughts and plans on Shannon and the use of those slots going forward.  Will any account be taken of the two years those flights were not used?  During Covid, Aer Lingus's decision was to axe the Heathrow service.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right; that period will expire in September.  However, we resumed Shannon-Heathrow services post pandemic in September of last year, and we added services shortly after the runway closure at Cork Airport.  We maintained those services at three a day since then. Obviously, these are impacted by the mandate.  Our services to London Heathrow go beyond September.  Today, a person can buy a ticket to fly to Heathrow from Shannon for next June.  Commercially, those services are simply continuing as normal.</p></speech>

We mentioned next June.  Aviation has undergone a significant and welcome resurgence, and we are dealing with the fallout of that such as cancelled flights, lost bags, and whatever else, which we have been discussing today.  On the region I represent, Mr. Moriarty has given strong assurances that it makes sense commercially to have a strong presence between Shannon and Heathrow.  Going forward, can he give a stronger commitment that the Shannon-Heathrow route will be there?</p></speech>

We resumed our transatlantic services from Shannon in April this year after nearly a two-year gap.  On what the Deputy mentioned earlier, the cancellation of services during the two years was not something we wanted to do.  It was something we had to do because there were travel restrictions in place internationally, but, more specifically in Ireland, that simply meant those services could not operate in that period.  We resumed those transatlantic services as quickly as we could.  They are up and running now bringing tourist to the west of Ireland on a daily basis and they are operating successfully.  We will continue to do that and we see no reason why those services would not continue and prosper into the future.</p></speech>

Given the problems experienced by Aer Lingus passengers at Dublin Airport due to the loss of bags and cancelled flights, and with the sheer capacity that is in Shannon and other airports as well as the convenience afforded to the passenger, are there plans to improve or add services in Shannon?</p></speech>

This should be a temporary issue.  As I look at our aircraft coming into the fleet, they are primarily long-haul aircraft that we are going with.  Generally, between 30% to 80% of customers on long-haul flights will be transferring and that is where the hub dynamics really matter.  Usually, there is insufficient point-to-point demand to operate a breadth of services.  JFK Airport is a good example where point-to-point will justify the filling of a commercial service.  Boston is another.  However, when one gets beyond those big markets, connecting traffic is needed to fill the aircraft to sustain the service.  Typically, a breadth of services is obtained from the hubs because they can draw on the short-haul network to provide enough onward passengers to supplement point-to-point passengers and make a service viable.  There will always be a much easier case for going long haul out of a hub than there would be out of another airport.  Having said that, every time we get an aircraft in, we will look at where we think we can deploy it profitably.  As a result, I would not rule anything out at this point.</p></speech>

That fleet is not being restored immediately because we are looking at the balance sheet and capital constraints that the airline is facing.  We will have less short-haul growth in the near term.</p><p>As we come out of Covid and rebuild the business, we will look at that again.  Once we get new short-haul aircraft, we will have the pleasure of looking at where can best deploy them.</p></speech>

All areas in Aer Lingus have been resourced for the schedule we intended to fly.  In terms of cancellations, I refer to the number we mentioned earlier, namely, ten round trips in a week.  We are cancelling much fewer than other network carriers.  As was said earlier, the network and connecting impact of disruption at hubs are causing the issues.</p></speech>

The reason that decision was made was to ensure the financial viability of the routes out of Shannon Airport - Shannon to London Heathrow and transatlantic services.  That decision was crucial in ensuring the resumption of services out of Shannon Airport.  Looking at the requirements for those services, closure of our cabin crew base in Shannon was essential.  As the Deputy mentioned earlier, those employees were given the options to redeploy to Dublin or Cork, or take voluntary severance.  All of that was successfully implemented.  We were able to give those employees the choices they wanted at that time.</p></speech>

I would like to kick off with a few points.  It has been a great political failure on the part of Shannon that Aer Lingus was sold and that there was a tied-in agreement that a landing slot at Heathrow would be retained until the autumn of 2022.</p><p>We are on the cusp of that time and we have absolutely no certainty.  A few moments ago,. Mr. Moriarty stated that it is commercially viable.  People are buying tickets and flying on the route, but certainty in respect of the route will be gone from the end of September onwards.  Can the witnesses give us any certainty that they are committed to retaining dedicated and ring-fenced Heathrow slots for the Shannon service?</p></speech>

Now that we are coming out of Covid, we have absolutely no intention of changing them.</p></speech>

I know the Shannon route is because of an agreement with the Government.  Do IAG or Aer Lingus have ring-fenced, dedicated and committed slots at Heathrow that they do not deviate from?  I refer to Dublin, for example.</p></speech>

The commitment Aer Lingus made was that we would replicate the services that were operating in 2015 for a period of seven years .  As the Deputy said, that period expires in September.  We also committed, as part of the transaction in 2015, that if we are to dispose of or encumber any Heathrow slots, we require the consent of the Government, essentially the Ministers for Transport and Finance.  Slots cannot be disposed of without that consent.  The commitments in terms of the specific operation of those slots expires, as the Deputy said, in September.  Again, we are selling and operating those routes in their current structure, they are viable and we see no reason why that should change.</p></speech>

It is a commercial company and will make commercial decisions.  Right now, and for the foreseeable future, it makes commercial sense to operate the Shannon-Heathrow route.  The witnesses should not blame themselves.  There may come a time when that may not happen and our worst dreams and nightmares might come true.  The reality is that Shannon and the mid-west region was sold a pup, in that there would be a guaranteed service from Shannon to Heathrow until September 2022.  We are at the door of that.  Aer Lingus has committed to it, but we cannot hold it to any commitment.  There is no legal basis for the Government to hold something over Aer Lingus at the moment.</p> <p>  The decision to close the Shannon base was taken in the darkest days of Covid.  During a meeting with the committee on Microsoft Teams, Aer Lingus said there was a cash burn of &euro;1 million a day, if I remember correctly, and it was talking about the company's survival and said it needed to make very harsh decisions.  That did not go down well with the workers, but sin &eacute;.  That has happened.</p> <p>  People are now looking at aviation taking off, quite literally.  The recovery rate is quite high, in particular in Dublin, but also in places like Cork and Shannon, which is in my constituency.  Given that Aer Lingus is performing well and the next 12 months should, it is to be hoped, bode even better for the company, has it given consideration to the reinstatement of the Shannon base?  How viable has bussing cabin crew from Dublin been over the past 14 months?</p></speech>

A decision was taken during the course of the pandemic, but it was primarily taken to ensure that Aer Lingus could restore and resume services from Shannon Airport, namely, services to London Heathrow and, critically, the transatlantic service to New York and Boston.  Without having taken those decisions, the viability and prospect of the return of those services would have been significantly damaged.  At the time, we offered all of our cabin crew based in Shannon the choice to redeploy to Dublin or Cork or take voluntary severance.  All of their choices in respect of that were accommodated.</p><p>We have closed the cabin crew base, but have ensured the resumption of the services which, the Deputy will acknowledge, are critical to the mid-west region.</p></speech>

That is good.</p> <p>  Aer Lingus Cargo is something we in the mid-west pride ourselves on.  During the dark days of Covid when the whole world was flipped on its head, I was particularly alarmed to see large cargo crates from Boston Scientific, each of which was small but with a monetary value of around &euro;1 million, being trucked overnight from the apron of Shannon Airport down the motorway network to Rosslare.  They were then brought on a ferry and flown from Heathrow over the skies of Shannon to the United States.  That is a very cumbersome way of transporting cargo.  How has cargo in Shannon changed?  Are there any future plans to improve cargo facilities and use wide bodied jets to get more cargo out of Shannon Airport?</p></speech>

A passenger aircraft with belly hold space for cargo needs to be filled at many times the normal yield in order to break even on that flight.  Using a passenger aircraft for cargo purposes only in very extreme circumstances can make sense.  In Aer Lingus, we need to make sure that where we have passenger services we use them as much as possible, but also fill the cargo part of the aircraft.  We do not have any further plans for Shannon in terms of cargo.  Where we can operate passenger services supplemented with cargo we will do so.  We do not have cargo specific aircraft in Aer Lingus, and we do not intend to move into that space.  It is about utilising the network we have and ensuring that the belly holds of passenger aircraft are filled with cargo as much as we can.</p></speech>

I will leave Aer Lingus alone and I thank the witnesses for their answers.  I hope some of what I have asked about will remain subject to review.  The mid-west is viable and it has been very good to Aer Lingus.  I hope the cabin crew base and the routes serviced out of Shannon will be kept under positive review.</p> <p>  I want to finish with some questions for the DAA.  I cannot leave it off the hook on this one.  Has it been complicit in damaging Ireland Inc. in 2022?  We have extortionate hotel prices.  We have price gouging in hotels.  We have had images of people queueing at Dublin Airport in marquee tents in the car park, people missing flights and people crying on television.  It came home to me a couple of weeks ago when a traditional Irish music group from New Jersey won a qualifier round to compete in the all-Ireland fleadh.  They got a trophy and a plate but they were told the price of hotels and flying into Dublin would not work so they stayed at home.  They are champions in New Jersey but it means nothing to them.  Do the witnesses believe that Dublin Airport has been damaging to Ireland Inc.?  As we head into the autumn how do they propose to reconcile this and improve relations?</p></speech>

The witnesses have said overall staff levels are at 91% of pre-pandemic levels.  Aer Lingus has increased the number of pilots by 6% and call centre staff by 90.  I am not sure what the percentage is.  Proportionately speaking, cabin crew and ground staff must have taken a big hit in the number of staff that has been lost.  Will the witnesses comment on what percentage of staff have been lost in this area?</p></speech>

We have 3.7% fewer cabin crew today than we did in 2019.  I keep referencing that our capacity is 90% of what it was in 2019 and passenger numbers are 81% of what they were.  With regard to ground operations, it is closer to 10% lower than it was in 2019.  Again, this is reflective of the shift in capacity numbers.  Having said this, we continue to recruit on a constant basis to deal with the increased level of disruption we see.  Normally we complete recruitment for the season earlier in the year but we have continued our recruitment process to help deal with the continuous disruption that we have described.</p></speech>

The lead time for training pilots is the longest lead time among all of our work groups.  As we look at our growth plans and future aircraft we make sure we have sufficient pilots in the system to fly them.  At present this gives us more pilots than we would normally need to have for the level of operations.  It gives us an extra buffer in the number of pilots.  As we have said, we have more cabin crew as a percentage than the relative operations.  Where we took the biggest reduction in staff numbers was in head office functions.  In our front-line functions we were ready with the right resources for the schedule.  When we noticed the disruption occurring throughout Europe in particular, rather than stopping recruitment because we had met the requirements for our schedule we took the decision to continue to recruit because we could see how much extra pressure it was putting on our ground teams, crew teams and call centre teams.</p></speech>

Taking the guidance issued by Airports International Europe, ACI Europe, the group representing airports around Europe, it was expecting passenger numbers to return to approximately 70% of 2019 levels in 2022.  It is always important to understand the currency we are dealing in.  The aircraft movements may be there, but then there is also a question, especially when it comes to security screening, concerning how full those aircraft are going to be.  Potentially, aircraft can operate viably with relatively lower load factors, although there will always be a cut-off point regarding that viability.  In general, therefore, the industry would have expected, and when we started to see statistics in Dublin outperforming those averages, that was on the high side.  What has definitely taken us by surprise, and I will not speak for others, has been the sustained level of demand that has been pretty much filling all the seats put on.  Therefore, where capacity is back to 90%, the load factors are back to 90% and more in the peak summer season as well.</p></speech>

The security workers are being lauded by people going through the airport for the great work they are doing.  Turning to the training provided for new workers coming in, some of them went on the job with a couple of weeks of training.  I understand they need to do a few more weeks of training to get accredited.  There are also incumbent workers who need to have their accreditations extended.  What is the plan for those cohorts of security workers?</p> <p>  I also understand that a collection of bags is being held in the terminal buildings.  The environment in that room and its surroundings is not great due to perishable items in these bags, and other stuff, to be honest.  I would like a comment on this aspect.  Whose bags are these?  Are they the responsibility of Swissport, SHP, Aer Lingus, Ryanair or all these companies together?</p></speech>

As we have brought staff in and as we were short of numbers, we needed to bring people up to a particular standard, in some cases, so they could be deployed and utilised, as opposed to being held on extended training periods.  Of course, that approach was also required to free up the ability to continuously train existing staff.  This is still in process as we bring staff into place.  We are not, though, changing our <i>modus operandi</i>in the overall environment.<br/><br/>Turning to the question about bags, we have seen statistics, as this issue has grown, concerning the volume of baggage coming in broadly matching the volume going out.  This means a big dent is not being made in the situation in the existing facility.</p><p>We have worked with the handlers to effectively relocate these bags into a more convenient area for processing.  Initially, in many cases, the bags are everybody's.  They need to be separated by airline and by handler.  Then the tracking and matching to individual passengers can occur within the systems of the respective airline or handler.</p></speech>

I will pick up the point concerning Aer Lingus's projections again, because it was one of the key features of discussion the last time the representatives of the DAA were here.  In fairness, they were able to then and have again today pointed to several industry and departmental indicators in this regard.  In this context, did Aer Lingus - and I presume some of its competitors because they seem to be on a similar trajectory - have additional information, such as market information or survey information?  How did its projections fare?  The airline had planned for a 90% recovery.  Has that level been reached or what percentage has been reached?</p></speech>

Having been effectively grounded for two years, we were not entirely clear what the demand was going to look like.  What we wanted to do, however, was to get Aer Lingus up and running and flying again and, therefore, we committed to that schedule.  As I said, we planned and resourced for the schedule.  It was never our intention, though, to fly empty aircraft.  We expected those aircraft to be filled, particularly during the summer peak.  We had less confidence around the shorter periods, but we were confident that there was built-up leisure demand.  Our assumption was that we would provide the capacity to service that market.  We were looking at other industry data that showed a 100% industry restoration was unlikely to happen in 2022.  We took the view, however, that a 90% recovery was going to be a fair assumption for 2022.  I reiterate that we were never intending to fly empty aircraft.  With the capacity came the expectation we would fill it.  Last week's load factors, that is, the percentage of seats filled, was around 90%, which is healthy for this time of year.</p></speech>

The airlines provide the service, but they also induce the demand to some degree.  People avail of services when they are there.  There is certainly at least an opportunity to improve in respect of market and demand projections.  There is an opportunity here-----</p></speech>

Turning to the representatives of the DAA, and regarding the approximately 1,400 people affected by the issues encountered on 29 May and who missed flights, it was stated that 75% of those people have been dealt with.  What advice would the representatives of the DAA give to someone who has sent 13 emails and filled in the requisite forms but has not seen progress made on the request?  Might many people be in that situation?</p></speech>

I am aware of one or two people who sent in emails and who felt they were not responded to quickly enough.  Being honest, however, what we are getting now is positive feedback from people regarding how quickly they are being dealt with.  We have a team working tirelessly on this issue and trying to expedite refunds.  The rate of refusals of applications is less than 1%.  We are working our way through these requests.</p><p>If there is anyone in that kind of situation, he or she can contact me or Mr. Cullinane directly and we will deal with it.

First, what is the full picture regarding baggage handling and lost luggage?  We are hearing that this issue will continue to arise at least until the end of the summer.  Is that the case?</p> <p>  Second, what is the amount of lost or unclaimed luggage on site today and what is the throughput of that luggage?  Is the number being added to or reduced on a day-to-day basis?  I am wondering whether it is an accumulating problem or a reducing problem.  What advice can the witnesses give to people who have travelled to Dublin Airport and are now in Ireland and want to pursue their lost luggage?  I am aware that some of that baggage is airside, some is landside and some of it will be couriered.  People are not being encouraged to go to the airport to collect it.  The witnesses from the DAA might take those questions first.  I do not know whether they have oversight of the Ryanair end of the things and an overall picture.</p></speech>

Ryanair checks in few, if any, bags because it is a point-to-point service.  Aer Lingus has 1,200 baggage claims still outstanding, Swissport has 100 and Sky Handling Partner has 2,897.  That amounts to 4,197 baggage issues at Dublin Airport, or approximately 4,200 people at the moment whose baggage is outstanding.  Is my quick calculation reasonably accurate?</p> <p>  Aer Lingus has capacity to do 700 baggage items per day and there are 450 coming through, so it has capacity to pull back 250.  As I work it out, that means it will take five days to clear 1,200.  The number for Swissport is very small and the witnesses reckon it will be done in the next week.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Will the Aer Lingus witnesses indicate how quickly they can pull back the 1,200 items and the Sky Handling Partner witnesses how long it will take to deal with the 2,897 outstanding claims?  Will they indicate who passengers should contact in order to get access to their bags?  I would also like to know the age profile of the baggage items.  Of the 1,200 outstanding items at Aer Lingus, the 2,897 at Swift Handling Partner and the 100 at Swissport, how long are those items of baggage in storage at this point?  Deputy O'Rourke might indicate which witnesses he would like to respond first.</p></speech>

It is not particularly a Dublin issue, <i>per se</i>.  In terms of the ageing of bags versus new intake, it is quite complex because some of the items that are there longer are the ones I referred to earlier, where there may be missing documentation.  It is more like an investigation process-----</p></speech>

These are not transfer passengers.  It depends on whether there were strikes in certain out-stations which obviously have their own resourcing challenges.  In fact, some airlines choose on a daily basis which flights they are not going to load because they do not have the resourcing capability.  Thankfully, that has not occurred out of Dublin to my knowledge, certainly from us.  It makes the job in Dublin like trying to climb a sand dune.  As soon as we start to make some progress through baggage, another aircraft could come in missing 60 bags or potentially missing all of its bags.</p></speech>

Providing an online facility is fair to a point and there is an opportunity to improve it.  I know of people who have engaged with the online option and they found it frustrating.  They have presented in person and been doubly frustrated with that.  Can the online interface be improved to let people know how they might pursue this?</p></speech>

I will begin with an example.  I received a letter this week from a person who said that their family, ten people in total, were to fly from Dublin to Faroe yesterday, 23 July at 7.45 a.m.</p><p>They arrived at the airport at 2 a.m. and checked in their luggage.  At 7.30 a.m., they were informed that the flight was delayed for technical reasons.  At 8.30 a.m., they were told the flight was delayed due to technical issues.  At 9 a.m., they were sent to a different gate and told to wait for further updates.  At 11 a.m., four members of the group were called up to the gate and given new boarding passes.  On speaking to a staff member, the lead traveller managed to get on the flight to Portugal.  The context of this email is that this left a member of the travelling public distraught and upset.  I am a supporter of Aer Lingus and to be fair to the staff of the airline, they deserve huge credit and praise.  However, the point I find most upsetting is this traveller reports that the staff could not have been ruder or more nonchalant.</p><p> I am not here to beat anybody up.  I am a former chairman of an Oireachtas committee so I understand the Chairman&rsquo;s job and our job.  However, we have had a summer of discontent.  Has any of the witnesses in this room spoken to, met with or called a member of the travelling public who has been discommoded?</p></speech>

The same people who are trying to help customers with their cancelled flights are also being asked about missing luggage.  The compounded effect of the issues we have spent the morning discussing is that we are not able to give the level of personalised care that we would like to give.  It is in the DNA of everyone in Aer Lingus to care.  Every bag matters.  Every customer who is disrupted matters, which is why we have been adding resources, calling on volunteers and doing everything within our power to try to make the experience of customers better and when they are disrupted to try to look after them.  However, the scale of the challenges means we are inundated with contacts.</p></speech>

Clearly, the majority of contacts we get go through our normal channels but in many cases people reach out to me or to other members of the executive with their individual issues.  Just yesterday, I had a very positive response from somebody who had contacted me in May with a high degree of anxiety in regard to a trip that had been made and issues with a passenger requiring assistance, who then having made a second trip reverted to confirm that the experience was much better and very different.  One of the challenges we have as an airport, which has been highlighted today, is that we are often viewed as the last resort for communication.  We certainly deal with all issues with sympathy but in many cases we need to refer people to other players.</p></speech>

I also meet passengers regarding lost baggage, in particular where passengers have arrived into the country for critical personal events such as weddings where the bag has been in the hold.  We have managed to locate those on several occasions.  However, I am aware of the distress and concern this causes those affected.</p></speech>

On foot of what we have all said this morning, I wish to say that clear communication and personal interaction is what people crave in this case.  It is important that the witnesses do that and instruct their staff to do it.  Ms Embleton shouted from the rooftops, to use the words of the Chairman, in terms of being ready for this summer.</p><p>None of us anticipated the level of pent-up demand that would exist.  By my tabulation up to the first week of July, Aer Lingus accounted for 72% to 73% of cancelled flights out of Dublin versus 2% or 3% for Ryanair and perhaps 26% for British Airways.  If that was the case and given that the company was supposedly in a state of readiness for this summer, how is it that this week we are now in the current position with Aer Lingus flying out of Dublin Airport versus other airlines?</p></speech>

If we were a point-to-point model right now, I do not think we would be having the summer that we are having.  As I said earlier, we compare incredibly well to Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and some point-to-point carriers such as EasyJet.  Our numbers compare very well, but every cancelled flight and every missed bag hurts and we are trying to minimise the disruption where we can.</p></speech>

To be fair to Ms Embleton and her management team, they have had a series of negotiations with staff on new contracts and so forth.  Some of us are being told that the atmosphere within the airline at present is toxic.  That is according to an email I have, and I will not name the person who sent it to me.  Another email I have received says that worker relationships in Aer Lingus are at an all-time low.  These are from staff members.  What is the current position with the latest rounds of negotiations with staff on the new proposals regarding rostering and staffing?</p></speech>

For most of the two years they were not able to fly and do their jobs and look after customers.  More recently, with the disruption we have been seeing, every day is a difficult day for our staff and they are going above and beyond at every opportunity.  It has been incredibly difficult for them and for everybody in Aer Lingus.  To the Senator's point, we are in discussions with all our work groups at present.  Those discussions have been very productive in the main.  Mr. O'Neill might wish to add to that.</p></speech>

There is no underestimating the pain.  We talk about it in respect of the airline and the finances, but the individual financial pain that all employees in Aer Lingus took is not forgotten by any means.</p></speech>

I welcome the base being retained, but what are its plans for increasing the number of aircraft?</p></speech>

I know Cork very well, I know Cork Airport very well and I know P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh very well, so I am happy to visit at any time.</p><p> As regards the number of aircraft based in Cork, this refers back to the answer I gave a little earlier about Shannon.  It relates to our short-haul fleet size and the seven aircraft reduction we had to implement as a result of Covid-19.  The Senator will be aware that we have a strong level of service from Cork Airport.  On the Cork to London-Heathrow route we normally have four per day.  With the mandatory capacity reduction imposed by Heathrow Airport, it is typically three per day at present, but we are trying to re-accommodate those passengers on other flights usually out of Cork within the same day.</p><p> We are always open to the possibility of additional services from all our airports, but that is dependent upon aircraft availability and it also has to be assessed from the perspective of what is most viable and what is the most profitable deployment of the aircraft once we have it.  However, currently we are constrained in terms of our fleet size.</p><p> Does Ms Embleton with to add anything?</p></speech>

Can she comment on its relationship with the regional airports, not just Cork?  Regarding Cork Airport, services to Lisbon, Nice, Barcelona, Paris, Brussels and Geneva have ceased.  The winter preparedness or winter planning is a little bare, from what I can see from a Cork perspective and perhaps from the perspective of others.  I am concerned about the winter plans of Aer Lingus for our regional airports.  The piece regarding Emerald Airlines, which we have not mentioned, is important as well.</p></speech>

When Stobart Air went out of business, Emerald Airlines stepped up very quickly.  We have worked extensively with Emerald Airlines over the past six to nine months to help it get ready and ensure it is ready.  It has done an amazing job in getting its aeroplanes and crew in place.  That has enabled the resumption of a lot of services that would have been lost otherwise with Stobart Air's demise.</p> <p>  Looking ahead to the winter, we know how seasonal the demand in and out of Ireland is.  Where we see demand for the winter we will fly that demand and, again, we will be ready from a resource perspective.</p></speech>

During Covid-19, Aer Lingus gave vouchers to passengers.  Members are being told these are restricted only to people being able to get departing flights out of Ireland in euro currency.  Is Aer Lingus looking at allowing that to be flexible so that people can use those vouchers coming into or out of Ireland?</p></speech>

What happened of course over Covid-19 is that vouchers were almost invented as a solution to the extreme levels of disruption.  The IT systems needed to be build to accommodate these vouchers.  The more straightforward redemption of these vouchers is for those which are in a currency that is easier for the system to handle-----</p></speech>

We would deal with the National Transport Authority as to whether they are going to encourage those operators or to retender those routes.  Then there are frequencies that need to return to viability.  The DAA will be looking to put incentives in place to facilitate that.</p><p>Where BusConnects is being introduced, we are actively promoting that the Swords corridor and access to the airport be accelerated.  I recommend this to the committee.  In relation to car parking, the primary capacity issue has been the removal of a car park not operated by Dublin Airport.  This facility is now for sale.  We expect it to come into operation at some point when that concludes. </p></speech>

The advice is still two and a half hours for short haul, three and a half hours for long haul, plus an hour for bag drop or whatever else.

We have customers trying to fly in the morning and they are behind customers in the queue who are flying many hours later.  That clearly causes queues and congestion in check-in and in security that would not be there if everyone turned up in sequenced time for their flights.  It is causing us an issue and causing congestion.  It causes customer angst when they arrive at the airport and see a queue.

In virtually all of those cases they have extended the time.  We have the difficulty of giving a one-size-fits-all message which needs to cover passengers who might be leaving early in the morning when times are very busy, and in the early afternoon when they are not.  The airlines have the individual contact mechanism with passengers if they want to issue bespoke messages at different times.  For example, if you are checking a bag in or not checking a bag in, your process through the airport is quite different.  We need to give a consistent message across all the carriers and all of the passengers.  There is scope for tailored messages if any of the airlines wish to do so.</p></speech>

We are elected by the public to represent them.  What has come across today is that this is an ecosystem.  This is why it is so important that the representatives of the airline, the DAA and the baggage handlers were here today.  It enabled us to get a full understanding of this issue.  What we would like to see regarding baggage handling concerns communication with people.  I think it is fair to say that many of the 4,100 bags in Dublin Airport now have been there for a while.  This is a reasonable statement.  We, therefore, ask that there be further engagement, preferably by phone, to address measures in this area.  The DAA has made great strides.  There are other issues that need to be addressed but we acknowledge the improvements that have been made.</p> <p>  We see Aer Lingus as one of our national carrier.  It is exceptionally important to our connectivity.  Can we take it that once the Heathrow cap lifts in October that Aer Lingus will be back to flying at full capacity and that there will be no restrictions at that point?</p></speech>
