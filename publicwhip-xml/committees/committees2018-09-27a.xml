Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  The minutes of the meeting of 20 September have been circulated.   Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There is a small change to be made to the minutes of the meeting of Tuesday, 25 September, which we will clear next week.  There are no matters arising from the minutes.</p> <p>  I move to correspondence.  There are no external witnesses before the committee today.  We are using this as an opportunity to consider correspondence received since the meeting in July, which numbers well in excess of 100 items some of which are routine.  People who have an interest in certain matters should watch proceedings as some of the items that we will publish today contain very interesting information.  We will not get to discuss them all in detail, inevitably some will have to be held over, but we will attempt to clear as many as we can.  This meeting should conclude at the latest by the time the series of votes comes before the D&aacute;il and so we would not return in the afternoon.  I propose that anything that is not dealt with is held over.  </p> <p>  The first item is No. 1479 B from Dr. Graham Love, Chief Executive, Higher Education Authority, dated 11 July 2018 providing the following information requested by the committee.  It is a comparative note on the financial position in terms of annual deficits-surpluses of all institutes of technology; and an update on the financial position of the accounts of Waterford Institute of Technology which has a substantial deficit of &euro;4.4 million.  Dr. Graham Love has indicated that he will leave his post soon.  At last week's meeting we asked him to come before the committee before he leaves the post at the end of October.  That request is in the system and we are waiting for a date.  We are keen for that meeting to happen.</p></speech>

My understanding is that they are not meant to be in deficit.</p></speech>

We have drawn attention in the audit certificate for several years past where any material deficit emerges.  A small deficit which is frictional from one year to the next would not be of concern but a number have built up cumulated deficits to which we have drawn attention.</p></speech>

There is a direction from the Department that the institutes of technology should not be in deficit yet some of them have accumulated deficits over a long period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01300"><p>Yes, over a number of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01400"><p>How does the Department allow that to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01500"><p>That is one of the reasons that we want to talk to Dr. Graham Love.  The Department should not accept that.  Just because they know of an infringement does not make it correct.  We will return to this topic.  The expectation would be that steps would be taken by the relevant institute to rectify the position and ensure that a deficit position does not continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01600"><p>I know that we are dealing with the deficits only now, however at the last meeting I did ask that Dr. Graham Love and the Department would be here to discuss Dr. Love's departure.  There are reports, although they are only in the media, that raise question marks over the relationship between the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department which form part of questions that we have put in the past around who is responsible for what, whether or not the HEA is getting the support from the Department that it needs to drive the reforms that we have been looking for and that we have been pushing the HEA to get.  I do not expect Dr. Love to say it in those terms, that would be unfair on him, but it would be responsible for us to follow that logic.</p> <p>  We have called the HEA in several times and have put it under pressure in relation to the need for reform in several areas and the kinds of governance structures that are in place.  What is the relationship between the institutes, the HEA and the Department?  Dr. Love is telling us that he is trying to drive reforms.  If it is the case that the HEA is being met with resistance from the Department, then surely that is a problem that should be examined. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01700"><p>If one has a deficit, one must fund it from somewhere.  There would have to be approval within the organisation's board to raise a loan from a bank or whatever.  Is there any common denominator in that?  Are there governance issues about which there are obvious problems?  How are the deficits funded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01800"><p>Most of them, as I recall, would have cash in the bank.  It is just the way that cashflow works in the organisations that they are not in a position where they do not have funding - this is their trading position, if one likes - however they do have cash.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B01900"><p>Reserves?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02000"><p>I would say cash rather than reserves.  If they are in an accumulated deficit position, then they do not have reserves, that is what has happened over the years, however they have sufficient cash to keep going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02100"><p>However their governance would require them not to operate with a deficit.  That must be approved somewhere, I presume?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02200"><p>They should not be operating with an overdraft.  They are two different things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02300"><p>In other words, the accounts will include charges for depreciation on assets that will create a loss but depreciation is not a cash outflow.  Therefore, even though the profit and loss account may show a loss due to charges like that, there could still be cash in the bank.  Just because there is a trading loss does not mean that an entity will be in overdraft.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02400"><p>There are creditors and people one owes money to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02500"><p>Some of the unpaid creditors have not yet been paid.  An organisation can be in deficit but still have cash in the bank.  It is a subtle accounting difference but an important one.  They will be the same in the long run but at any time a body can be in deficit but have cash in the bank.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02600"><p>Deputy Catherine Murphy asked whether, if the boards are in deficit, they are signing off on them.  However, there might be nothing to sign off on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02700"><p>The whole point of the financial statements is to give a true-up of one's trading position in a year.  The board is signing off and declaring that it has been in a deficit position in a particular year.  The whole point of the financial statements exercise is that one does know what one's position is at the end of any period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#B02800"><p>I appreciate the clarification about deficits.  Following on from Deputy Cullinane's comments, we need to prioritise Dr. Love coming in here.  We need to really prioritise it and put it at the top of our agenda.  I found the letter saying that he was going to be very alarming.  Its tone suggests that he possibly needs to talk to us.  It would be a good exercise.  As we saw from the discussions, we really need to tease out the issue of the relationship between the HEA and the Department.  There are obviously problems there and issues that would be of concern to this committee.  These issues fall back to the report that we did on third level which appear as though they are not being cleared up.</p><p>The demarcation lines, responsibility and who does what are unclear.  Obviously that raises a range of issues relating to accountability and expenditure.  We should invite Dr. Love to appear before the committee.  There are also specific issues relating to some of the third level colleges and issues relating to WIT on which he needs to speak.  Furthermore, there are considerable issues relating to Carlow Institute of Technology, CIT, and a number of other institutions as well.  When we do our work programme we should prioritise this and invite Dr. Love and representatives of the Department of Education and Skills to appear before the committee at the same time.</p></speech>

The invitation was only issued arising from our last meeting.  He is leaving by the end of October and we will try to facilitate a time that suits him.  If it involves an out-of-sequence meeting we will do that.  We have had Dr. Love appear before the committee with representatives of the Department together.  Is your request that they both appear together or separately?</p></speech>

Apart from the issues we have in correspondence that we wish to pursue and raise again, and there are other items in correspondence that may relate to him that we will come to later, the committee would do the State a service by having exit interviews when somebody is leaving an organisation such as this.  Obviously there might be personal reasons associated with somebody's exit and that is fine, but to get somebody's view of, perhaps, necessary improvements and so forth on their way out is very useful.  I concur that it is a priority, notwithstanding the other issues that are relevant, and a line of questioning that day could certainly be: "You are on your way out and as you leave if you had a magic wand what would you change, what would you do, what is missing, what is good, what is bad and so forth?".</p></speech>

We will return to the third level sector.</p><p>The next item is No. 1481 B<b></b>from Mr. Timothy Owens, chief executive, Cork ETB, dated 12 July 2018, providing information requested by the committee regarding whether the ETB as part of any settlement agreement with a claimant imposes a condition on the individual prohibiting the person from applying for work with the ETB.  Mr. Owens states that the ETB does not do this.  We can note and publish it.  He said there was a legal agreement with legal representatives on both sides.  It is a short letter.  Is there any comment?</p></speech>

The letter says the ETB does not do this, but it does and did do this.  The tone of the letter implies to me that the ETB viewed this person as troublesome.  Whether that is right or wrong, the ETB inserted a clause in a contract that the person would never again apply in the ETB sector.  It is obliged to answer questions about that.  It is not reasonable to suggest that it does not do that as a matter of policy except when it suits it.  If that was only on one occasion so be it, but such arbitrary clauses need to be prohibited in the public sector.</p></speech>

The first sentence in the letter states that Cork ETB does not have a policy or practice prohibiting people from applying for employment or re-employment.  When he continues the entire substance of his letter deals with the individual concerned.  He identifies that person and makes comments on whether the person was successful at other interview processes.  It was unfair to put this on the public record.  We should say in our letter that he should have stuck to the specific issue and that he made some injudicious remarks about the individual concerned, who can be identified, and he should not have done so.  I want a letter in that format to go to the chief executive and to the chairman of the board, to be brought to the attention of board members at a subsequent meeting.  I am not happy that he went into that detail about the individual.</p> <p>  The committee will note that letter but not publish it.  I would be conflicted if I put that letter in the public domain.</p></speech>

The issue here is that I hope we do not live in an authoritarian state where if I decide that somebody is troublesome, a thorn in my side and not capable of job A, I have a right to exclude the person from applying for job B at some stage in the future.  As a practice for a democratic state it is fundamentally wrong.  If we do not invite Mr. Owens does it fall under the remit of Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, the Secretary General, or the Minister?</p> <p>  We need to take a position on this and to see if there are other matters in terms of Department circulars which are left open-ended and can allow for the discretional adoption of individual policies or issues that might be included in exit clauses for people.  It is a little too loose.  In fact, when these end up in the courts, because they state there is an element of discretion following circular X or circular Y the courts are left with no option but to say the process has been followed in accordance with the criteria laid down.  However, there is a level of discretion permitted within that, with no guidelines or definitions of what that discretion will include in terms of process and procedure.  There is an issue here, and it might not just be this instance.  I seek the committee's view on who we should address on this.</p><p>This happened and regardless of whether it is a repetitive policy or a one-off, it should be prohibited.  That is a personal view; we will see what other members think.</p></speech>

The letter is noted but will not be published.  The matter will be followed up on further.</p> <p>  No. 1482B is correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 13 July 2018, providing an information note requested by the committee in respect of the structures in the public service for dealing with pre-payments, the risk associated with such structures and the lessons learned from the Dublin Institute of Technology case whereby &euro;700,000 was lost on pre-payments for library services to a company that went into liquidation.  The Department accepts our recommendation on the need for appropriate guidance in respect of this matter.  I have read the letter closely and the contents of appendix 1 are extraordinary.  In the context of the pre-payments issue, reference is made to section 24 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of 1866.  If that is the legislation the Department is operating under, we will have to write to Mr. Watt and ask whether, in the intervening two centuries, anyone has considered whether it is still fit for purpose.  If that is the basis then it is no wonder there is an issue here.  That legislation was written long before the advent of things like cyberfraud.  We will write back to the Secretary General to ask his views on this matter.</p></speech>

We will note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>No. 1483B is correspondence from Mr. Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland, dated 11 July 2018, providing an update on the ConnectIreland dispute with IDA Ireland.  An arbitrator has now agreed to deal with this matter.  Mr. Shanahan has been told that the substantive matter will probably not be heard until 2019, so on it goes.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>No. 1484B is correspondence from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 13 July 2018, providing information requested by the committee including data on cases under appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission, cases of seizures of tobacco products, the 289 cases published in the 2017 quarterly list of tax defaulters and a note on good citizen reports.  I wish to make a number of observations on the detailed contents of this letter.  I draw members' attention to appendix 3 which outlines unpaid amounts, an issue that has been raised at this committee on previous occasions.  There was always a presumption that defaulters on a published tax defaulters list had paid the taxes owing, as detailed in the list.  However, we now know that the list only details the taxes due and does not necessarily mean that the tax was ever paid.  Appendix 3 provides a breakdown of the data relating to cases in 2017.  Of the total amount of cases published in 2017, the total debt as published at that time was &euro;53.13 million and the amount that remained unpaid was &euro;25.96 million.  Essentially, only 50% of what was published had actually been paid.  The most recent information relating to the unpaid &euro;25.96 million at the end of June 2018 is that &euro;11.64 million is not collectable, &euro;8.4 million of which relates to cases of an inability to pay due to liquidation.  There is still a balance that the Revenue Commissioners believe is collectable of &euro;14.1 million and this is being actively pursued.  We would like an assurance that a special effort is made by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the moneys owed by those on published tax defaulters lists.  Mr. Cody has said that of the total debt of &euro;53.13 million, an outstanding amount of &euro;14.1 million is collectable and is being pursued.  We would like to see a greater effort being made in this area.</p><p>The other part of the letter to which I draw the attention of members is that relating to the issue of the Tax Appeals Commission.  We asked for a detailed breakdown on the level of tax in dispute and the amounts settled by the Tax Appeals Commission.  Mr. Cody summarises the position by stating, &quot;The wide range of practical and operational complexities is such that it is not possible to forecast the proportion of the debt under appeal that is likely to be collected&quot;. <i></i>There is definitely a lacuna in the information available from the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax Appeals Commission.  Nobody seems to be able to provide a clear cut figure on what is collectable as a result of the Tax Appeals Commission process.  That is something that we will have to include in a periodic report.  We do not have a full breakdown of the figures yet.  I just wanted to make those two points about this correspondence from Mr. Cody.</p></speech>

They referred to computers going on fire, moving office with only two week's notice and so on.  If we do not have a proper system in place  we should not be surprised that we are not getting information in a timely manner.  In actual fact, investment in an organisation like the Tax Appeals Commission is needed in order to enable Revenue to obtain the relevant information and to follow through on collecting the taxes.  We need to find out if circumstances have changed at the Tax Appeals Commission.  It might be appropriate to write to the commission seeking an update, if we have not obtained one already</p></speech>

Separately, we have received a very strong letter from the OPW expressing dissatisfaction with what was said here.  Representatives of the OPW are due before us in two weeks' time so we will ask them about their interactions with the Tax Appeals Commission.  As I have said, there is a letter from the Department of Finance dealing with the staffing arrangements and when we come to that, we will take it into account.  We will note and publish this correspondence for now, bearing in mind that there is further correspondence relating to the Tax Appeals Commission.</p> <p>  No. 1486B is correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 July 2018, providing an update requested by the committee on the review carried out by Dr. Richard Thorn into Kildare Wicklow ETB.</p><p>There is further correspondence on this exact copy, where he provides a copy of the review on the Kildare Wicklow ETB.

They were not in a position, to put it mildly, to answer questions but they did say they would come back to us once the report was finished.  It is somewhat complicated by the fact that the report is now subject to a criminal investigation.  That needs to run its course.  There were other issues with regard to other ETBs.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor's office doing a follow-on audit?</p></speech>

The audit was suspended.  We have resumed it and I propose to include a report attached to the audit certificate in relation to this.  The draft of that is with the ETB for comment, which I am expecting back by the end of next week.  Hopefully we will then be able to proceed fairly quickly to complete the audit and present it.  This is the 2015 audit.</p></speech>

We are going to look at financial management maturity in ETBs.  It is interesting that the Thorn report as presented to the committee this morning contains recommendations about the governance systems in place, which will have an implication for all ETBs.  The cover letter from the Department also indicates the steps that are being taken to address weaknesses that have come to light as a result of the Kildare Wicklow ETB issues.</p></speech>

One of the issues at the heart of this report is procurement, the rules around procurement and the non-adherence to procurement rules.  We touch on this aspect every week when this committee receives audited opinions from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In some 50% of the audits there appears to be some comment about the lack of adherence to procurement rules.  It is rampant in the health sector, the HSE, the Department, and in education.  We need to look at the consequences of it.  Sometimes there are extreme manifestations of it such as in this case, which is subject to a criminal investigation.  There are other consequences in that there are risks to the organisations themselves if they do not follow the rules because there are always opportunities for those who feel they have been hard done by in the procurement process to take a case.  For example, when the Garda was in about the IT system, those concerned just got there too late.  When they looked at the new contract, they did not plan and not enough time was given to the organisation with the staff they had and-----</p></speech>

It is a huge issue.  There is no sanction in place whatsoever.  There is frustration .  I am aware there have been changes and the Comptroller and Auditor General has noted that.  This committee comments on it and there has been some progress.  Perhaps more cognisance is given by organisations than was given in the past, but it is still pretty much just a rap on the knuckles and that is it.  The issue of procurement is such a problem that I believe we should examine it in its own right as part of our work programme.</p></speech>

How do we get to the point where we can isolate what we can do and what is subject to the Garda investigation?  We should not simply bypass the totality of the report by virtue of the fact that there is a Garda investigation.  There are other aspects of the report that merit scrutiny.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is right.  I will ask the secretariat to do this in order that the committee knows and agrees the aspects we will and will not look at.  The Garda investigation could go on for a long time.</p></speech>

I welcome the Thorn report.  I have read it.  I would like the direction put into context.  A direction was issued by the Minister.  Can someone put that into context? Is that the first direction or is it the first of many to different organisations?</p> <p>  The report refers to effective governance and accountability as crucial.  I believe it is premature to go down the procurement route.  I agree with my colleague that the issue of procurement comes up repeatedly but there is a bigger picture here.  Effective governance and accountability is crucial.  The report outlines, in relation to Government procedures, that adequate arrangements to manage procurement and conflicts of interest were in place according to the documented procedures, however it highlights the shortcomings on an operative basis.  And so we are back again, and it was the same last Tuesday with the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the President's Establishment, notwithstanding any attempts to deflect from the issue.  On paper we were learning in the reports that everything was fine but in practice it was not.  Here we have the same thing; on the ground everything is in place but on an operative basis it is not happening.  The Department has issued a very strong directive, has issued recommendations and has set timescales.  They had two weeks to respond to this but have they responded? I do not know.  When the Department issued this letter and direction they had two weeks to reply to it.  As there are many recommendations with timescales, we need to ensure those timescales are being complied with.  The committee should not be doing this, the Department of Education and Skills should be ensuring these timescales are complied with.</p> <p>  There is so much in this that one would despair.  Now they need an external agency again on this.  It is only thanks to those people who took a great interest, and to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office which deserves the main praise, and to the other people who paid attention to this, that we waded through all of this as best we could.  Now we have this direction and outside help is needed again.  There is also the role of the Institute of Public Administration to consider, a concept for which I have great admiration.  I served on a previous vocational education committee, VEC, for ten years and I am aware that one can be left struggling.  There are many general serious issues in this regard.</p> <p>  I have sympathy for the secretariat if, after one week of looking at it, they have to try to tell me what this committee should be discussing.</p></speech>

I have a request for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Every week this committee notes accounts and regularly, a procurement issue is mentioned.  From the last full set of accounts in the last year I would like to see a list where there were procurement issues and the value of them.  As some of them were on a sample basis, it might only be a fraction of the issues.  Is there any way the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General could go through the appropriate accounts that have been published in the last year to summarise the procurement issues to give a schedule or a summary?</p></speech>

There is a process which we see repeatedly that all public bodies are expected to go through, but there is another issue with procurement in terms of value for money.  We saw this with the library services, for example.  They were bundled together and in fact what happened was that we lost the local jobs and local availability and they were outsourced to other jurisdictions.  We are an outlier in respect of the number of tenders that go to other jurisdictions when one looks at France, Germany and so on.  There is a value for money issue with this as well.  Is it within our remit to look at this?  Is it within another Department's remit?  There is a very valid issue there that has an equal standing in terms of value for money.</p></speech>

All the countries on the Continent are well able to look after businesses within their own jurisdictions to a greater extent than we are.  I find the whole concept quite contradictory.  We will consider it again.  We will discuss it as part of our work programme if there is a mechanism for us to do so, but the issue is broader than the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will come back to it.</p></speech>

That does have an implication for the value for money achieved.  The theory of it is that the bigger the scale on which one operates, the more one benefits from an economy of scale.  That then militates against small suppliers, however, so what one is looking for is a kind of happy medium.  With greater aggregation there are also longer chains of supply and one is more dependent on one supplier and can kind of get locked into a big supplier, so it is a very complicated process.  I think the Office of Government Procurement is very expert in all this and should be able to provide information to the committee and have a dialogue with them at the strategic level as to what they are doing, why they are doing it and what is needed.</p></speech>

Does anyone want to comment?  Generally, she says unclaimed prize money can go back into promotion of the national lottery and other lottery games.  I do not know whether sufficient detail is given, but we will note and publish that.  If any member wishes to pursue the matter separately, he or she may do so.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1488 B from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, providing information on staffing requests from the Tax Appeals Commission and the response from the Department, and information on other resourcing requests.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 1585 B is from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, advising that he has commissioned an urgent staffing, governance and operations review of the Tax Appeals Commission by an independent reviewer.  We will await the outcome of the review.  In the meantime, we will note and publish the correspondence.  Essentially, what he says is that the Department received a very comprehensive request for additional staff.  It says it would involve doubling the budget for next year if it were to be fully agreed to, as a result of which the Minister has commissioned a staffing review.  I think we will get that fairly quickly, so we will note and publish both items and ask the Department to keep us updated.  We will keep it on our list of matters to follow up with the Department if it does not come back to us.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1489 B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, regarding accommodation for the Tax Appeals Commission.  He takes great issue with what he believes was a misleading impression given by the Tax Appeals Commission that the OPW had forced the commission to move to substandard accommodation.  We will note and publish this.  We can discuss the letter with the OPW when its representatives are here in two weeks time, and there will be many other issues for the OPW.</p> <p>  The next item is 1490 B, which is from Mr. Stephen Blake of the Government accounting unit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, enclosing a minute from the Minister in response to our periodic report.  We will take note of this but we will not complete our work on this yet.  Whether there are two or three reports back on our previous periodic reports, we will just hold them all over until everyone has had an opportunity to study the full contact.</p></speech>

This was a report on a variety of issues but one of the substantial ones was the opening and reopening of Garda stations, which we gave a very good hearing here.  It was quite obvious to this committee that decisions were being made to reopen certain Garda stations that did not chime with the priorities of senior garda&iacute; on the ground, and we made a number of recommendations in this regard.  I am not at all satisfied with the responses we have got back on this.  They are parliamentary question-type responses that go through the motions but do not say anything, really.  It seems they will continue with the course of action on which they have embarked.  Some people have called this stroke politics.  That is how I see it, to be honest.  It is not good practice; it is bad practice, in my view.  That is the first issue.</p> <p>  There is also an issue I was following up concerning the IDA and the methodology used to verify the number of jobs created.  It does not accept the recommendation from this committee and is still holding to the view that it should be self-assessment.  I do not think that is right because we deserve to have the accurate figures.  Everybody benefits from having accurate figures, not figures that are based on self-assessment and a questionnaire that goes out to a client company asking how many jobs were created, with no verification process and a request to take at face value what is being said.  I do not think that is any way to make an evaluation because policy decisions arise from these figures as well.  They are also used, as we know, for propaganda purposes, which is fine as well.  Notwithstanding that, I am not happy with that response either.  The Chairman is saying to hold off on the matter.  My question is, given that we are doing periodic reports and getting responses - and it is good that we have got a response as at least they are reading our stuff and have to respond to it - should we have another leg to our work?  Do we follow up with the Accounting Officer to say we are not happy with the response?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly has indicated.  We have a couple of these responses from a couple of our periodic reports received over the summer period.  We will put this as a specific agenda item the next day and discuss it.  The last time we got a report from them on this specific issue was concerning the total investment by the State in respect of some of the companies, not specifically the one in Waterford.</p><p>They keep telling us if that they sell off-----</p></speech>

We asked for the details of the public funding put into them at all levels and they said it was not possible to provide them.  We rejected that and said it was an insult to say the public service could not account for what was put into various spin-off companies.  They came back a month later with very detailed information.  Sometimes if we are willing to accept what they send us, they will be happy with this.  Most of what they send us is probably as good as they can do, but that is not always the case.  My first observation is on a report we sent last January.  It took quite a while to receive a response.  We listed a couple of the reports as agenda items next week.  If members are not happy with any of the recommendations of the Department, we will go back to them before we sign off on the response.</p></speech>

In advance of representatives of the OPW coming here, can we ask for all cost and expenditure figures on the announcements made to date on all of the Garda stations outlined at the committee by representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality?

There is a note on the money accrued as a consequence of appeal cases taken for 2016 and 2017; a note on the legislative changes that have taken place and further improvements; and a note on the number of cases in hand and the age analysis.  For the information of the public, there is very interesting information in this document and I will ask for it to be put up on screen in order that people will see to what I am referring.  </p> <p>  Question No. 1 relates to a note on the money accrued as a consequence of appeals received in 2016.  It is alarming.  We are told that there are three cases under active appeal and that the amount of tax involved is &euro;361 million in respect of these three cases.  That means that there is an average sum of &euro;120 million involved in each of the three cases.  We ask that these matters be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.  They are cases that were lodged in 2016 and 2017.  They were not lodged this year.  </p> <p>  The next line deals with cases over &euro;100 million.  We asked that question and I am surprised to note that there are three still in the system, with an amount potentially due to the taxpayer of &euro;361 million.  </p> <p>  With regard to cases involving amounts greater than &euro;10 million, there are 14 cases, with a total value of &euro;350 million, which gives an average figure of &euro;25 million for each case.  With regard to cases involving amounts greater than &euro;1 million, there are 61 cases involving a total sum of &euro;166 million.  </p> <p>  In total, there are 78 cases with the Tax Appeals Commissioner, with a potential value of &euro;878 million in outstanding tax.  Whatever the issues are, we will write back on foot of them to ask what special measures are being taken to bring the 78 cases to a conclusion.  It is fine to talk about the 342 cases in which the amounts involved are less than &euro;1,000 each.  I hope it does not have a system under which it deals with matters in date order and that instead there is in place a system of streaming and prioritising, especially when there are three cases involving a sum of &euro;120 million each.  Some of the cases involve a dispute about a tax clearance certificate and there might be no money involved.  We want a detailed report on the top 78 cases.  We do not want to identify the people involved, but to know what special measures in the interests of the taxpayer are being taken to resolve them as promptly as possible.  Are we agreed on that point?  I think people will be surprised by the extent of the moneys involved in that handful of cases.  The point has been made.</p> <p>  The next item is-----</p></speech>

It is correspondence from Mr. Neil McDermott, system funding, Higher Education Authority, providing an update on our request regarding the review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology.  It appears there are ongoing legal issues.  There is another item of correspondence, No. 1557C, which was received from the Waterford branch of the Teachers Union of Ireland.  It raises concerns about the delay in the completion and publication of the McLoone report on Waterford Institute of Technology and spin-out companies.  We will note the correspondence.  Does the Deputy want to comment on these two issues?</p></speech>

I have raised this issue half a dozen limes.  When we had Dr. Love here before us, he spoke to the committee in private session about this issue and explained some of the reasons the report had been delayed.  I am beginning to get very frustrated because I do not think we can tolerate a situation where an independent report has been produced on institute of technology and simply because mistakes were made by the HEA, as it seems there were, there is no report coming out at the other end.  The letter from the TUI is a cry for help and assistance from the many people who came forward in the institute at the request of the person carrying out the report who wrote to all staff members asking them to come forward if they had any information and meet him in confidence and they did.  I received a lot of protected disclosures and never put them into the public domain.  We went through the structures appropriately and brought in the Accounting Officer.  We put questions to the HEA which put a process in place.  We were to produce a report which was to be published last September.  One year on there is no sign of it.  There are very wealthy and influential people who have a right to defend themselves if they believe they need to legally challenge the report.</p><p>I have no difficulty with that but it should not hold up the report forever and there is no sense at this point that we will ever get a report.  That is unacceptable because there were strong findings in that draft report according to the information that I received.  How can we have a situation where there are strong findings against the institute and practices within the institute after a thorough examination only for the report to not come out?  People have come forward to tell me that they are now going for interviews for promotion and they are concerned about whether they will get the promotions.  There is a lot at stake here in terms of the reputation of the institute and the protection of individuals who came forward and because the HEA did not carry out due diligence in compiling the report, we are constantly told that it is being pushed back to the extent that we may never see it.  That is not acceptable and I do not know how we will remedy the situation but it must be remedied because we have to get a report, we have to get answers to the questions we put and we have to do justice to the people who came forward.</p></speech>

It seems to me that there were issues around the scope and terms of reference that were set for the person who compiled the report and it seems that mistakes were made by the HEA in establishing the terms of reference for the person who was doing the job.  There may have been mistakes made where perhaps the author strayed outside of the terms of reference, I do not know.  In any case a range of mistakes were made which have resulted in us not getting the end product so should we just accept that?</p></speech>

If we call a spade a spade, the HEA report was probably too broad as well and that was one of the problems.</p> <p>  In any event, I am aggrieved because many people came to me in confidence and made protected disclosures.  They also went to Mr. Michael McLoone and spoke to him in confidence while people in senior management positions were given draft copies of the report due to their senior positions.  They could easily identify the individuals who came forward.  That is not a good culture to have within an organisation.  It is not fair to people to put them in that position where they come forward and a draft report is sent to the management of the institute whereby they can work out who has been talking to Mr. McLoone and then they are just left there.  That is what the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, is saying in its letter.  It is saying that these people have been left hanging with no back up and no report.  I accept that we have to wait for Dr. Love to come in but I am not sure what he can do considering he is leaving in October.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran states that there has been no settlement in the case but he will keep the committee updated.  The clerk to the committee was informed recently that there have been no significant developments over the summer on this.  I will call Deputy MacSharry because he raised this issue the last day.  The correspondence is from the Secretary General who is the Accounting Officer and we asked the official from the Department who was here at the previous meeting to follow up on a specific issue that the Deputy raised.  I understand that we were asking the Secretary General to respond to that issue rather than the particular official who was here the last day.  I ask the Deputy to comment on this.</p></speech>

They are taking issue with correspondence between parties in a case and that is a matter for them.  We have to play with the deck that comes our way and some of those cards did come to us.  The only interest I had - and the committee was in general agreement - was in whether there was a role for us there to prevent a court case being taken and for us to ultimately get what we wanted in our report back in January, which was the establishment of a committee of inspection to provide relevant oversight.  I take Mr. McCarthy's point that it might not be correct for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be on that committee of inspection for different reasons but there certainly seems to be an absence of oversight.  As I said previously, this may already be in the process of being handled in the manner that provides the best value for money going but it is the most expensive liquidation in the history of the State and probably close to being the biggest in Europe, if not the biggest.  Because of the money involved, any perception of it being on autopilot due to the lack of a committee of inspection is an issue.  The applicant in the case before the courts appears to have the same motive as us, except that it is costing us all money there.</p> <p>  Correspondence that was shown to me - and I put this on record at a previous meeting because I Deputy Cullinane had been asking if I had been shown correspondence that I did not share with the committee - showed that the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, had made an approach to the solicitors for the applicant asking if they would withdraw their case if the CSSO were to defer to the Committee on Public Accounts, which is something that I would agree with if it was possible for it to happen.  I have a problem with us being used as a pawn in somebody else's game.  If they want us to be involved, then they should involve us but it is not within the gift of the CSSO, any more than it is within the gift of the Department or of the Taoiseach to offer the work of this committee as an olive branch to anybody else, notwithstanding the fact that I would agree with that happening.  I do not know where it is going.  We have put it on record that we would like to engage and we have noted the importance of appropriate oversight in our report on what is heading for &euro;300 million in costs so far.  It could rise as far as &euro;1 billion by the time it is finished.  Nobody knows, but we have KPMG here, which I am sure is doing a fantastic job and paying itself from recoveries.  Those amounts, while agreed in terms of the lower rates negotiated by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, would be questioned by a committee of inspection as to whether two partners, four juniors and a technician are needed for a specific course of action for example.  That level of oversight would be there with such a committee.  We do not have that now and while the Act theoretically vests a lot more power in the Minister than a committee of inspection would, Ministers are busy people and they depend on officials.  Despite the excellent work of Mr. Carville and his team, it is a relatively small team and following our exchange with him on the matter, we established that there was not a lot of legal expertise on the team, even though that was something that had just been rectified or was about to be rectified at the time.</p><p>There is a lot of concern about the moneys involved and the lack of public oversight.  I put in the rider that perhaps everything is in order and better than it could be with 40 committees of inspection.  However, it may not be.  That is why we should continue as a committee to promote the establishment of a committee of inspection in line with our report in January.  Perhaps we can write back to the Department to say we stand ready to assist it if there is a way to avoid wasting taxpayers' money through the Department defending this.  To the best of my knowledge, however, the Department has not issued a defence, which itself is the subject of a court hearing in early October.  That is more money being cost to the State whereas we all want the same thing here.  Can no one sit around the table and crack heads?  In any legal proceedings in which I have had the misfortune to be involved, legal teams tended to communicate through the back channels.  Perhaps we could save the State some money and get the level of oversight the committee, on behalf of the people, yearns for.</p></speech>

It is very unsatisfactory that this is still going on.  I echo the points made about the person taking the case.  He is trying to achieve exactly the same thing we would want to achieve by having the kind of oversight which has been suggested.  It is unusual for the Department of Finance to be the supervisor in a liquidation.  Notwithstanding the size of the liquidation, if I recall correctly one or two people in the Department were supervising it.  This was Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society and we all know the cost that has had to be carried following the collapse and the assumption of the debt by the State.  The idea that there is no full scrutiny or full visibility on the scrutiny is completely unacceptable.  I am concerned that this is not only adding to the costs, but that there is delay.  All year, assets are being disposed of and, as this goes on, the problem is reinforced.  There was a very poor relationship between the Department of Finance and IBRC before the liquidation.  The rules around how assets are sold changed post liquidation but I want to see, as a member of the committee and as a citizen, exactly how that is working.  It is completely unsatisfactory.  When Deputy MacSharry raised this first, it was simply a question of asking whether we could have a conversation and to see if it would be possible in terms of the court case.  That was months ago.</p></speech>

It has been clarified that we do not and the question that has arisen is whether the Department has written without telling us.  The Chairman is going to clarify that.  When this was discussed following the issuing of the plenary summons, the Department accepted that the questions were justified.  Certainly, my understanding was that the issues raised in the plenary summons were practical questions on the overall supervision and monitoring.  We asked at that point if those questions would be answered clearly because the Department had a duty to answer them.  We asked why we had to go through a plenary summons and a statement of claim.  At that point, the official said he did not disagree with that interpretation.  I emphasise that this is my understanding of it.  However, he said the Department needed a statement of claim to see the issues teased out more clearly before it would look at it.  A statement of claim has been served and that should be clarified.  Deputy MacSharry says a defence has not been served yet.  Our role was to ask whether the issues raised were legitimate and whether there was any way they could be answered because we wanted them answered.  I was waiting for the official to come back on that once the statement of claim was served.  This was without discussing the proceedings, but on the issues being raised, which is a role for all of us.  At this point, we are getting silly letters as to who says what as opposed to on the issues.  I support the concerns around the lack of accountability in relation to the matters which have been raised.  I will not repeat them.</p></speech>

That was the official position.  The discourse of the day was very much that the Department had a great story to tell but was not allowed to tell us it.  Of course, we were frustrated with that and pointed out that the Department could tell the High Court but could not tell us.  It was then said that the Department did not even have a statement of claim.  The statement of claim is long since in and there would not be much in it that we have not sought here ourselves.  To the best of my knowledge and the last time I checked, no defence had been lodged but there is a hearing on that.  I defer to Deputy Connolly on the legal term.</p></speech>

The Department using us as a tool in its arsenal without consulting us is a matter for a slap on the hand certainly, if it happened.  However, the Department's ambition is perhaps no different than ours in having the matter resolved and providing for appropriate oversight.</p></speech>

I asked Mr. Carville the last day what the Department's position was on the formal recommendation of this committee in its report in January on the establishment of a committee of inspection.  He was not in a position to answer that.  As such, it is a reasonable question to ask now.</p></speech>

It is an extensive letter from which I wish to highlight a couple of points.  Deputy Connolly has an interest in some of this also.  Regarding to the 2002 indemnity agreement, which takes us back 16 years at this stage, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; refers to table C and says &euro;4.21 million remains to be realised from that 16 year-old agreement.  He refers to appendix 2 in relation to the 2002 agreement and the position in relation to Mounthawk in Tralee and says it is not possible to provide a timeframe for completion in that regard as it depends on the resolution of litigation.  The property is being used as a primary school currently and, as such, we have the benefit of it, if not yet the legal title.  The same applies to Waterpark, Newtown Road, Waterford, where the estimated timeframe for completion is the end of the third quarter of 2018, which is this weekend.</p><p>He also says that he will have the matters concerning Coisc&eacute;im, Cappoquin and the Sacred Heart Centre in Waterford cleared by this weekend.  The estimated timeframe for completion of this is the end of this week.  This is the letter we received from him in July.  I propose we give him ten days and write to confirm the day.  The timescales he gave us of his own volition in July have been upheld.  Concerning the second agreement, that is, the 2009 voluntary offer, there are still outstanding moneys.  A cash contribution of &euro;8.8 million remains outstanding from the Christian Brothers.  The contribution is expected to be completed before the end of this year.</p><p> Appendix 3 concerns properties to be transferred as part of the 2009 voluntary transfer agreement.  Some items are still outstanding.  I refer to St. Bernard's Group Homes, Fethard, Tipperary.  The estimated time for completion of that transfer is this weekend.  The transfer of the adult education centre on Ozanam Street in Waterford is to be completed by the end of this year.  The transfer of lands at Convent Road, Cahir, County Tipperary is to be completed by this weekend.  Lands at Ballyjamesduff in Cavan are to be transferred by the end of this year.  Also to be completed at the end of this year or possibly next year is transfer of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p><p> The following items have an estimated time for completion of the end of the year; the Blaith&iacute;n childcare facility at Gracepark Road, Drumcondra; St. Patrick's primary school, Altamont Street, Westport, County Mayo; and St. Anne's Industrial School for Girls and Junior Boys, Lenaboy, Galway.  In ten days we will want a report on the commitments that have been made to completing those by the end of September, outlining whether these commitments were met.  We will want a report in January on whether commitments have been met to complete projects by the end of this year, bearing in mind that the most recent are nine years old and the older projects ones are 16 years old.  We should not be here talking about matters that should have been resolved 15 years ago.  However, we will not let them go.  Unfortunately it is the nature of this committee.  We will write to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on that basis. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#K00200"><p>I recall that I raised this issue in connection with the redress board and the very detailed report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We realised then that there were outstanding moneys and there were two different agreements.  The 2002 agreement is legally enforceable.  Some 3%, &euro;4.21 million, of what was agreed under that has yet to be realised.</p> <p>  The Ryan report was then published, with all its stories of pain and horror.  I will not go into it.  In a different life I was there and had the privilege of seeing it first-hand.  As a result of that, the 18 congregations were again asked to contribute.  Some 15 of them did.  They came forward with a new agreement in 2009.  I want to thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; for doing his best with all of these letters.  It has certainly improved the detail.  It has taken some time and I thank him.  I hope that level of clarity will continue because it will help us get our heads around it.  Even with this level of clarity it is difficult, because the Christian Brothers are thrown in there with &euro;127 million.  I am sure Dublin TDs will have a particular interest in that.  </p> <p>  Where am I going with this?  We were unaware of this except for the general assurances that these two agreements were in place, one legally enforceable and the other not.  In Galway there is a particular property which is symbolic.  It is an industrial school in Taylor's Hill that by the Department's admission has been empty since 2011.  My knowledge tells me it has been empty for even longer.  It was functioning as a childcare centre.  It has been empty since.  Why I am zoning in on this?  Galway 2020 made the very positive announcement that the nuns had contributed this building as a gift to the city.  That upset me and a lot of other people.  There is no place for emotion on this committee, but that was wrong.  It was not a gift.  It was part of a package from 2009.  As such, the narrative continued to be a false one right up to 2017 and 2018.  That is the difficulty about openness and accountability.  If the city council had announced that this was not a gift but part of a redress package, particularly the 2009 one, it would have been very helpful to the narrative and to healing.  Had they put the survivors at the top of the list, that would have been very helpful.</p> <p>  I notice that there has been a change in language today.  I note the property I have mentioned has still not been transferred.  The report states that if the city council assumes ownership of the property it plans to renovate "this will include consultation and engagement with interested stakeholders, especially persons who were associated with the property in its many previous guises".  That is the first time this has been recognised. </p> <p>  I will come to a general point in a minute if members will bear with me.  This is one example where a building has remained unnecessarily empty since 2009.  Whatever value it had then has depreciated because it is has become dilapidated.  While there is a positive story, in that the city is going to gain, no explanation has ever been given for the building being empty from 2009, despite the fact that the city council tabled a motion at the time asking for it to be transferred.  That is just one example of how these agreements are implemented, or not implemented, without monitoring.</p> <p>  I refer to the second agreement in 2009, as part of which 15 congregations came forward.  Somebody may correct me here, because I am not an expert in figures.  Some 53% of that has yet to be realised.  That is outlined on page 1 of the report.  This is subject to a few small considerations.  That is totally unacceptable.  This is 2018.  Notwithstanding that it is not legally enforceable, the congregations came forward willingly on the basis of what was set out in the Ryan report, the results of that report and the amount paid by the State for the redress board.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might remind me.  I think it was &euro;1 billion but that may be clarified.  The congregations came forward with a contribution of which 53% still has be implemented in 2018.  </p></speech>

That was a dreadful experience for those coming forward.  We have gone into the governance, or absence of governance, in detail.

There are costs involved in all of that, so I will ask him who is dealing with it and from where it comes.  We can deal with the matter separately.</p><p>No. 1496B is correspondence from Trinity College Dublin.  We wrote to John Coman, secretary to the college, recently seeking details regarding an incident of cyberfraud that cost the college &euro;790,000 and also in respect of an associated cost of &euro;184,000.  This matter relates to the Trinity Foundation.  Mr. Coman states that there is still a considerable amount outstanding.  What I find extraordinary is his statement in the final paragraph to the effect, &quot;I would also like to clarify the previous statement that the University has covered the loss from its commercial revenues&quot;.  There is one set of accounts, including the State revenue and commercial revenue, yet Trinity is stating that this only came from the other half.  It gets worse.  Mr. Coman goes on to state:</p><blockquote>... and therefore there is no loss of donor funds and no impact on the projects supported by philanthropic funding.  To be more specific, the amount will be funded from revenue generated by visitors to the campus to view the Book of Kells and the Old Library.</blockquote> <p>He is saying there was a loss and that the money collected from visitors who viewed the Book of Kells and the Old Library was used to offset it.  That is an extraordinary accounting process.  I am just putting on the record that this is how Trinity says it recovered the loss.  I do not know whether the college is increasing the charge to see the Book of Kells but it is kind of pathetic, and that is all I would say about that reply.  We will note and publish the letter.  It deserves to be published.</p><p>No. 1498B is correspondence from Michael Nolan, CEO of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, on the report of both project reviews that have been undertaken in respect of the national public private partnership, PPP, projects.  We will note and publish that.  I was almost skipping over that is because the file is so big; there are 546 pages in the report.  People are welcome to review it but we have said we will come back to the issue of PPPs as part of our work programme.</p></speech>

There are different motorways throughout the country.  I suspect everyone will have a close look at the motorway that relates to his or her own geographic area.  If we did that among ourselves, we would probably cover them all.  We will note and publish that large file of documentation.  I do not know how much is in it or the conclusions.  There are 546 pages, which we will look at, and we will come back to that broad issue as part of our work programme.</p></speech>

That amounts to a significant sum.  I do not know whether we were in correspondence about this after the question was raised or whether I read it in a newspaper but it amounted to a lot of money.  I am interested to know how that is treated in terms of taxation.  Are the companies allowed to keep it as profit or should we be prevailing upon them to make it available to charitable organisations?</p></speech>

The money goes into the company's revenue.  It is treated as revenue in terms of corporation tax but I believe the private sector toll booths are subject to VAT.  There is a VAT issue in respect of the private operators and an element of that would have to go through VAT.</p></speech>

Arising from that and in terms of what it has learned, the Department states that has been working to ensure robust project management structures are put in place for the European Capital of Culture Galway 2020 project, drawing on what it has learned from the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema project and the Limerick designation.  I do not need to go into the rest of it.  I have serious concerns about the robust governance structures but, importantly, many people on the ground have serious concerns also.  I welcome that the Department is saying this, but what robust governance structures are already in place for the money paid out?  There is &euro;15 million committed.  A substantial amount has been paid out.  I tabled a question on that previously but I am sure money has been given since.  What robust governance structures are in place?</p></speech>

I want to know what is in place now, what will they improve on, when is it going in and so on.  We sit as a committee so often, and we were here on Tuesday.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema project did not have robust governance structures in place.  That is why the cost went from in the region of &euro;6 million to approximately &euro;8 million over a period from 2006 to 2018.  Regarding this one, I checked this today.  Let us stick to the facts.  The latest person to resign was the chief executive officer.</p><p>Yesterday I received an invitation to an event which was signed by the personal assistant to the CEO.  The website for the Galway European Capital of Culture still lists Ms Kiely as CEO.  One might say these are minor details but they are a reflection of the situation.  It sends the wrong message if the website still lists her and letters are being issued on her behalf by her personal assistant inviting people to an event in spite of her having left her post over two weeks ago.  There are many other issues which may not be within the remit of the committee, such as the lack of an Irish language officer and so on, but in the context of value for money, what robust structures are in place to safeguard the spending of the &euro;15 million being allocated by a Department?  What will be delivered for that money?  What service level agreement is in place?  A performance level agreement is now under discussion.  At what stage is that process?</p></speech>

What is his or her role and should he or she be on the board?  Should there be a hands-off approach involving the situation being properly monitored with proper accountability?

On the "This Week" programme on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 last Sunday, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, again defended the scheme in spite of the fact that only six communities across the country have taken up the CCTV scheme.  He put the onus back on local communities and did not address the fundamental questions raised by the committee in respect of data and how they are managed.  Judging by the interviews carried out with members of local communities, the communities are crying out for assistance.  They have been left with an onerous task.  The questions raised by the committee have not been answered but the scheme is still being defended publicly, as was the case last weekend.  I wish to support the cause of those communities.  The current situation is unacceptable.  No one should stand over a scheme which has only been taken up by six communities across the country.  The scheme is not working and that is not defendable.</p></speech>

A number of matters arising from the meeting are covered.  In regard to the funding of debt management, a chart is provided which outlines cash balances since 2004.  That information will be of interest to some.  The correspondence provides information on the Irish Strategic Investment Fund relating to a schedule of projects excluded for environmental and tobacco reasons.  The next item details the amount of funding for residential housing.  However, the information given in that respect is inaccurate and is corrected by the subsequent item of correspondence.  Details are provided on the State Claims Agency and the list of public bodies under its remit.  There is information on the role of NewERA and details relating to the corporate governance of the NTMA.  We will note and publish that.  The information will be of great interest to some people.</p><p>The next item of correspondence concerns a similar topic.  It is No. 1507 B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing an information note requested by the committee on to the possible inclusion of local authorities and other public bodies on the general indemnity scheme.  Mr. Watt points out that it would require a decision of the relevant Minister to include local authorities in the indemnity scheme.  There is a later item of correspondence on this issue which we can also discuss later.  There is a big issue in respect of this letter.  When the State Claims Agency was here, we asked what public bodies were included under its aegis.  It gave us a list and I asked for the main areas that were excluded.  Going back to the previous correspondence, the sectors that do not come under the State Claims Agency are the university sector, the voluntary secondary schools sector, the primary schools sector, local authorities, Teagasc and semi-State bodies.  I raised it because the section 38 bodies recently come in under the State Claims Agency's brief and I asked if that could not be extended to others.  That is what prompted this.  We also wrote to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issue.  In correspondence No. 1507 B, the Secretary General said they are insured by Irish Public Bodies, IPB.  I want to know why we have two bodies insuring State organisations with the State Claims Agency handling their cases when they have an insurance policy.  We asked about the value for money.  Mr. Watt writes:</p><blockquote>However, the value for money provided by Irish Public Bodies has been examined.  In April 2015, a Value for Money Steering Group was established with representatives of the County and City Managers Association, the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  The objective of the Steering Group was to oversee a value for money review by IPB and it concluded that &quot;at an aggregate level, IPB is providing an insurance service that represents value for money for its members and is operated efficiently&quot;.</blockquote><p>We want a copy of that report immediately, nothing more and nothing less, with no prevarication.<br/><br/>We had separate correspondence from Ms Dowling, the former chairperson of the insurance body that looks at those figures.  Having seen the conversations, she wished us luck.  As chair of the board that dealt with some of those insurance issues, she could never get it.  The section 38 bodies - all the hospitals - can move in under the State Claims Agency and have it handle the cases.  Maybe Irish Public Bodies gives a great service but nobody can say that except by looking at that report, which we want to see.  We will write back to the Secretary General saying that he is to get the report because he is the one who told us about it.  It comes in under the Office of Government Procurement, the City and County Managers Association and the ETBs.  I do not care who gives it to us but Mr. Robert Watt is to secure that report for the committee.  It will tell us whether there is value for money and will deal with the whole issue of claims to local authorities.  The State Claims Agency handles the central ones.  We need to see that.  It is not just about local authorities.  We note No. 1522 C, which also relates to these issues.<br/><br/>The next item - some of it is a bit slow to go through - is another minute from the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to the committee's periodic report.  There are three such items, which we will over, so people can have time to study them in the meantime.  We will hold that over until next week.<br/><br/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1512 B from An Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, dated 2 August 2018, responding to the committee&rsquo;s concerns about data protection issues impacting on inquiries and commissions of investigation.  The Taoiseach advises he has referred the matter to the Attorney General.  Can we agree to note and publish this?  Agreed.  The Cook report or somebody else raised that issue with us and we passed it on to the Taoiseach to be considered in respect of the terms of reference and if there were going to be data protection issues.<br/><br/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1513 B<b></b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, providing further details requested by the committee on the status of the non-screening cervical cancer misdiagnosis claims.  We will be coming to that matter separately.  We might go into private session at the end of this part of the meeting to discuss the best way for us and the Joint Committee on Health to handle it.  We will note and publish that.<br/><br/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1514 B<b></b>from the NTMA, concerning the &euro;526 million provided for residential housing.  I want to deal with this.  We got a previous letter from the NTMA which I referred to a moment ago.  Clearly, the figures in that were wrong.  This is essentially a correction of No. 1506.  When it was before the committee, in respect of the &euro;526 million for residential housing, we asked the NTMA for a note on the number of houses delivered by the end of 2017 and the projected numbers for each year from 2021 from this investment.  This was as part of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is under the NTMA.  At the meeting, we were told that it had allocated &euro;526 million.  We asked how many houses it had built by the end of 2017 and the reply, No. 1506, said that from the &euro;526 million referred to in the annual report for residential housing, 1,747 units had been completed to date.  Then this letter comes back to say that the number of units completed at the end of 2017 was 894.  That is a different figure from what was given before.  Maybe it is just correcting that.  The money did not produce the number of houses we thought it had.  We note and publish that item.<br/><br/>The next item of correspondence is No. 1515 B<b></b>from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing a note as requested on the timely submission of financial statements of education organisations that receive over &euro;1 million in funding from the Department.  We note and publish that as part of our ongoing work to make sure organisations provide their accounts in a timely manner.  These are organisations that receive funding from the Department but are not directly under its remit.<br/><br/>Next items of correspondence are Nos. 1526 B, 1528 B and 1530 B<b></b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 17 and 20 August 2018.  There is a considerable amount of information enclosed.  I think we will have to hold it off.</p></speech>

We will note and publish it in the meantime but will hold over the discussion of it.  We will come back to it on our work programme.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1537 B<b></b>from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 24 August 2018 providing follow-up information requested by the committee about general adult mental health services; costs of hiring private investigators in relation to consultants' compliance with contracts; non-disclosure of legal costs in the accounts; an explanatory note on the three different schemes available for treatment abroad; an up-to-date note on the National Children's Hospital funding; and a note following the review of recovery of moneys from insurance companies.

Agreed.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1558 B from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president, University College Cork, providing details on procurement matters.  The information provided will feed into our next periodic report.  We will be coming back to that and will note and publish it for today.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1560 B from Dr. Barry O'Connor, president, Cork Institute of Technology, providing a detailed note requested by the committee on the preparation of terms of reference for the KPMG review of anonymous allegations against CIT in 2014.  We note and publish that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092700002#N00600"><p>I am not happy, anyway.  I do not know if other people have read this.  It is going on for a number of years now.  This letter is as if they were not here at all.  That is my view on it.</p><p>The issues we have are as follows.  We have disclosures, and the people mentioned in the disclosures were responsible for providing legal briefs to companies to come up with terms of reference for what, ultimately, was a desktop audit.  The people who did it only talked to senior management, many of whom were allegedly mentioned in the disclosures.  Several meetings ago, I said that we needed to start at the beginning with this KPMG report and to work through it.  There may be an issue in how disclosures are dealt with nationally from a procedural point of view and as a matter of public policy.  Without prejudice to anyone involved, one cannot have people named in a disclosure having any hand, act or part in setting terms of reference or providing a legal brief.  Many of the answers we had on that day were to the effect that they got solicitors to come but they drafted the terms of reference.  Solicitors will do nothing for somebody without being given a brief, though they might give an idea of what is best practice.</p><p> I am told that there were people on the audit committee.  Forgive my language - I am mixing up internal audit and the audit committee.  The people on the audit committee were potentially mentioned in the disclosure.  The same individuals secured the services of another legal firm and set the terms of reference for them.  The same people who advised them on how to handle the fallout from the KPMG report had a hand in determining the brief for KPMG in carrying out the desktop audit.  It was not thorough enough and the same people were involved.  We cannot have a perception of a conflict of interest, however misplaced it might be.  There may be an national issue but I am certainly not happy about this individual case.  There are missing pages and other stuff.  The people mentioned in the disclosures are investigating themselves so CIT is, in effect, investigating itself.  That is not right and we cannot sit here comfortably and say the matter has been dealt with.</p><p> I know that a previous Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was not a member, looked at the KPMG report but we need to start at the beginning again as it is unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

The president, Dr. O'Connor, had an opportunity to break from the past but we are going around in circles and it has been going on for years.  Nothing has been learnt.  Last year, the committee said governance was poor and risk management non-existent, and now CIT is trying to tell us again that there is nothing to see here.  I could talk on this for hours but I will not do so as we have been through it so often.  They are effectively investigating themselves and they are trying to justify themselves again with this letter, saying they have processes in place to deal with it.</p> <p>  Where does the committee from here?  Do we make a recommendation that somebody goes in and investigates them?  What powers do we have?  We will have a meeting in a couple of weeks on third level education with Dr. Love but he will not be able to answer questions specific to CIT.  We can talk about how the process was investigated but we will not be able to deal with the other issues.</p> <p>  This has been going on for the guts of four or five years and we have not yet even got to the &euro;13,000 that was spent on the lavish party, on which I have some correspondence separate from that of the committee and about which I will talk in a while.  Where are we going to go?  The Chairman, Deputy MacSharry and I have gone through this many times and we cannot keep going round in circles.  How are we going to get a body to go in, once and for all, and investigate what has happened here?</p></speech>

That is all we can do and it is for others to enforce them.  Between now and the next meeting, we could explore the options.  Could we recommend that a senior counsel goes in and looks at this stuff?  Should we recommend another inquiry or investigation?  At the moment, everyone is claiming plausible deniability based on a process but perhaps the process is flawed.  As I said at the outset, the process seems flawed but that does not mean we are not entitled to seek answers.  On the one hand, we are encouraging whistleblowers to come forward to improve governance and risk management but as soon as they do, the practical reality is that they are thrown under a bus or the shutters come down.  Perhaps the secretariat could take advice from the legal office of the Oireachtas to see what we could recommend.  Whether it is acted on is a matter for Ministers, Government and other authorities.</p></speech>

In fairness to the HEA, it gives us a response in its letter, No. 1561, a paragraph of which I will now read into the record as there has been quite a bit of discussion about it.  We had written to it about the weakness in control.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>[Our] correspondence was considered by HEA Board&rsquo;s Finance and Governance Committee at its meeting on 24 July 2018.  At the meeting the Committee agreed that that the HEA should reply to CIT noting the process changes the Institute has implemented and recommending a change to the sign-off process.  Specifically, the Committee recommended that in relation to the change made to CIT&rsquo;s hospitality procedure that requires prior approval from the Vice-President for Finance and Administration for President or Governing Body-related expenditure over &euro;500, the Committee was of the view [that is, the HEA board's finance and governance committee] that it would be more appropriate for such expenditure to be signed off by the Chairman of the Governing Body&rsquo;s Finance Sub-Committee.  A letter to that effect issued to CIT on 29 August 2018.<br /><br />In relation to the amount of expenditure incurred for these events that the HEA considers was not subject to appropriate controls (ca. &euro;6,700), the HEA is currently considering the most appropriate means of recouping this money from CIT.</blockquote><p>In fairness, I could have read that before the conversation started, but there is a system in place and at least somebody is doing something.  I do not know how &euro;6,700 will affect the CIT.  There is a strong point being made here as a result of the ongoing discussions related to that particular function.  For the first time at national level, the HEA will specifically recoup money that in its view was not subject to appropriate control.  It is a small victory but there is a matter of principle established here, which must be widely circulated.  Where the HEA or other bodies come to the conclusion that the expenditure was not subject to appropriate control it will have to be recouped from the body.  There is a point that is being well made, and it has been helpful.  Once the message gets out that that money will have to be recouped where HEA is satisfied that it was not appropriate, there is a good lesson learned here.  This item of correspondence is helping with the conversation we are having, and we will note and publish it.  We want confirmation in due course that the money has been recouped.</p></speech>

I know the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, for instance, in the Cork branch has passed motions looking to recoup this money, including from the president.  There has been much correspondence and commentary on it, and it is a welcome development.  Having said that, we will see what happens.  It is a small component of a bigger picture.</p></speech>

We will not change behaviour unless there are consequences, and the public element was part of ensuring there would be a consequence.  We saw it with the HSE when certain amounts were not paid, or they were paid in retrospect if they were in compliance.  In fact, it changed behaviour markedly.  It might be worth at some point considering talking to someone about institutional culture and how to change behaviour in order that we can have a range of things that might be available to us to suggest in the future.  In other public account committees in other countries, what are the things that produced that kind of outcome?  We should have a range of things we can suggest.  I am putting it out there as a general point.</p></speech>

They blame the culture, the system, the policy and so on.  It is about individuals as well.  It is not about an ice sculpture or a portrait, which is the visible stuff, the window dressing that we get to see, and which makes me worried about what is under the bonnet, particularly when one looks at investigations done by KPMG and so on where there has been at least the complexion of people investigating themselves.  There might be no wrongdoing at all, but then again there might be.  It is all wrong.  It is great that the chairman of the governing body will sign off from now on, but as things stood I have no doubt the chairman of the governing body would have signed off for the ice sculpture, the party and everything else.  In fairness to Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, when he was here and we raised this matter, he said it was a matter of fact that the contribution of someone who has served his or her country and institution so well would be acknowledged, and I agree with that.</p> <p>  In everybody else's office, however, it is "pass the hat around", everyone puts in a score, and there is a bit of finger food, a pint and a voucher for Brown Thomas if one is lucky.  That is the end of it.  As for the portrait thing, CIT has an art college.  I am sure it is proud of its students, and I am sure the best student could be provided with a bursary of &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 or - let us really push the boat out - &euro;500, as opposed to spending &euro;22,000.  I am sure it has confidence in its own students.  That is the minutiae, the window dressing, the surface stuff, but the fact that it existed and happened worries me about what is beneath the bonnet.  It is common sense; we should not throw lavish bashes.  It is not Mr. Robert Mugabe's going away party that we run here.  There is a way to do business and that is not it.  In fairness, in most private-sector companies that I worked in, and certainly in the House, when an usher or someone else retires, an email goes out and if people want to give a few shillings they do, and there is a modest evening and maybe a gift given.</p></speech>

We have been through this in a different guise, and it is something the Committee of Public Accounts should return to at a later date.  The submission of accounts by various organisations, such as the education and training boards, ETBs and so on, was delayed in the past.  However, section 38 and 39 organisations also had a poor record of submitting audited accounts to the HSE, and the HSE's former chief executive, Mr. Tony O'Brien, thanked the Committee on Public Accounts for putting the boot in on those delays.  It allowed him go to every one of them and say that unless they got their accounts into the HSE in a timely manner their funding would be held up for the current year.  Lo and behold, there was 100% compliance.  There was a consequence for the boards.  I propose that any time we suggest a sanction on an organisation for a corporate or cultural issue, or something that is under the board's remit, it should be directed at the board members and should not be taken out of the service that is provided.  When a board is employed to do a job, where the members all get their couple of grand each year, if they do not do their job there should be consequences at board level.  If the board sends down the right message through the chief executive, what will happen down the line is remarkable.  It is a broader issue and we will return to it.</p></speech>

We noted No. 1561, which I have just read out and published.  No. 1562 is from Ms Clare Campbell of the Government accounting unit in relation to the OECD meeting which I attended yesterday on behalf of the committee.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The following item is No. 1584 from Mr. Paul McGowan, chairperson of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, dated 19 September 2018, providing information requested by the committee in regard to a report by Wind Aware Ireland, as well as on the commission's role and function.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. 1584B.  The committee will understand why I skipped ahead to this one.  It is a report from Wind Aware Ireland and the commission's role or function regarding an electricity substation in County Laois.  The matters under dispute are ultimately policy issues which are not within the remit of the committee.  I therefore propose that we note and publish the item and forward a copy to those who raised the matter and that we agree that this committee's consideration of the matter is closed.  If there are any outstanding matters they could possibly be taken up with the relevant sectoral committee if it is willing to do so.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will note and publish that.</p><p> I will go back to items Nos. 1567B, 1568B, 1569B and 1570B.  These are correspondence from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from different dates in August and September informing the committee of changes in Accounting Officers in the Public Appointments Service, PAS, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We note and publish all of those.</p><p> The next item is No. 1586B from Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, dated 6 September which is a copy of a letter sent to the Chair of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach on the collapse of the Carrillion group and public-private partnerships.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach was dealing specifically with that and we will not duplicate its work as it had special meetings on it.  We note and publish that.</p><p> The next item is No. 1588B from Mr. Ken McCue, the director of the Dublin City Centre Citizens Information Service on the proposed dissolution of Dublin City Centre Citizens Information Service company by the Citizens Information Service board.  The matter was raised before around the restructuring of the Citizens Information Service.  It is an ongoing issue and while members may have their views on this it is not a matter for the Committee on Public Accounts.  I recommend that if members wish to raise this matter they can do so with the relevant sectoral committee, in the D&aacute;il Chamber or with the relevant Minister.  The issue of value for money can be looked at in terms of future financial statements.  We note and publish that information.</p></speech>

Perhaps the committee has received it already.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1590B from Mr. Neil Murray, director of the Abbey Theatre providing clarification to evidence provided to the committee.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1593B from Deputy Mick Wallace dated 21 September requesting that the committee make inquiries with NAMA on Project Nantes.  The secretariat has requested that NAMA follow up on this after last week's meeting and the queries raised by the Deputy are included.  He was obviously watching last week's meeting closely and we have already been in contact about those issues as a result of that meeting.</p> <p>  The next section of correspondence is C and these are from private individuals and do not have anything to do with previous public meetings as such.</p></speech>

I do not know what will be in the report and I am sure he will not tell us but there may be some issues that will jump out at us as requiring our immediate attention next Thursday.

Wicklow.  I recommend members to read this item.  Does any member have a comment on this?  We note and publish it and we may return to it next week because it is quite extensive.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 1572C dated 15 September, is related to the previous item and is from the individual who originally raised the matter with the committee.  He has provided further details.  We will note and publish the response from the Department and send a copy to the individual who made the inquiry.  We note the individual's correspondence and if members wish to discuss it next week please feel free to do so.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1494C from Ms Mary Lawlor from NAMA, dated 23 July replying to our inquiries on the sale of a property adjacent to AIB headquarters.  It had been suggested that the property had belonged to a NAMA debtor.  NAMA has confirmed that the individual was never a NAMA debtor.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will write back to the individual.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1497C from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on a protected disclosure made in respect of St. Munchin's Community Centre, Kileely Court, Limerick.

We previously received a similar inquiry on this matter and we replied to the individual and enclosed the information note that was received from the Association of Irish Local Government.</p> <p>  No. 1508 C was forwarded by Deputy David Cullinane, enclosing correspondence from the Irish Thalidomide Association which has queried the information provided by the State Claims Agency in relation to ongoing thalidomide litigation.

It seemed as if it was just the German company but if one goes through the transcript the State Claims Agency said it is also raising the Statute of Limitations, which is interesting.  I would like to know the total number of outstanding cases because it is not clear from the transcript.  If the agency could comment on it in the first instance we could take it from there.  It seems clear that there was no mediation from a date in December 2016.  Perhaps the agency could comment on it first and then we will come back to it.  The association deserves clarification.</p></speech>

I think the association phoned my office directly as well, and I spoke to someone from the agency on the phone during the summer also.</p><p>Next, we have No. 1509 C<b></b>from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 7 August 2018 requesting the committee to include the national broadband plan and ICT programmes at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in our work programme.  This appears to refer to the current year's accounts.</p></speech>

One is the fact that Enet was awarded the contract in 2004 and the contract was then extended until 2030 without going back to the market with a tender.  Much of what has gone on in relation to the issue is opaque and requires scrutiny.  In mid-2017 the infrastructural investment fund invested &euro;200 million in Enet.  To be honest, I find that curious given that it is buying into a company whose only product is owned by the State, so the investment was in the State's own asset, as it were.</p> <p>  There are probably two issues.  The first is that when the investment was made, Enet was vying for the broadband contract.  It is not clear which came first.  That is something we need to know because it would have had a bearing on the investment.  Broadband has been a huge source of frustration for a long time, given that much has been promised and the roll-out has been hugely disappointing outside of major urban centres.  A lot of money has been invested.  The situation is opaque and there is a need for scrutiny into what happened.  We are now at the point where, currently, there is only one tender.  We talk about the need for competitive tendering.  The personnel within the company who made the tender has changed over time.  I do not know if we can look at the issue but it is happening in real time.  The problem is that Actavo, formerly Sitserv, was involved, and there is a commission of investigation into it.  The whole issue is hugely problematic.  At the very least in this term we should get the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come before the committee to get a better understanding of what has happened to date in terms of the investment that was made in relation to this contract and about having better oversight of this.</p></speech>

That additional spend could very well be by way of another inquiry or a tribunal.  This is highly unsatisfactory and it is something we must look at.</p></speech>

The Government programme divides the country up into various areas, including what is known as an amber area that will be subject to the new contract where there is only one bidder.  My experience is that private companies who provide broadband commercially outside of the scheme are eating into the amber areas on the edge of towns.  I fear the Department is trundling along thinking the amber areas will have X number of people and are constructing the contract on that basis.  By the time the work is ready to start a lot of cherry-picking will have happened in the amber areas and there will be fewer houses available for incorporation into the plan.  Broadband is a dynamic issue and is not fixed while tenders and revised tenders take place.  The other operators are eating into the good bits of the amber areas as we speak and by the time a contract is signed the total population of the amber areas requiring broadband will have changed from today's configuration.  Even though we are talking about future expenditure I hope the lesson has been learnt from the previous process.  We will put broadband issues into the work programme.</p></speech>

The individual raises issues about the opportunities afforded to organisations to "get their accounts right".  The correspondent refers to a number of different versions of Dundalk IT accounts during the 2015 to 2016 audit.</p><p>Does Mr. McCarthy wish to reply orally or give a detailed written response?  He has seen the individual's response, which talks about the accounts from when they were first presented until he signed off on them.</p></speech>

A draft set of financial statements is presented to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  In an ideal world, the systems within the organisation would produce a set of financial statements that would not need any change thereafter, but we do not live in an ideal world and changes happen.  We want to ensure that when a set of financial statements are presented, they give a true and fair view.  Of course, organisations are allowed to make changes and we would require them to make changes.  If they do not do something, that leads to a set of financial statements not giving a true and fair view, for which we give a qualification.</p> <p>  There were difficulties with this particular set of financial statements.  The audit was signed off at the end of June, and as I understand it, they are with the Department and will be presented in due course.</p></speech>

I went through the banking inquiry, where these issues came up frequently.  She refers to the Central Bank and Anglo Irish Bank and her view of the proximity of the regulator and all those people.  I do not disagree with her on that particular issue.  It would be good for the Comptroller and Auditor General to state that no such cosy relationship exists and that people probably do not like getting a call from his office about accounts.</p></speech>

I raised this matter earlier as part of the previous discussion on the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the value for money report carried out on the insurance costs of local authorities and the operation of the IPB.  A report was published but it has not been circulated.  We have insisted that we get a copy of that report.  This correspondent, who has knowledge of the area and of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board had written a separate letter when he or she heard our conversation the last day, saying that he or she had sought a copy of that report, and it had gone as far as the Information Commissioner who found in the person's favour in 2017.  IPB has applied to the High Court for a private hearing, which is listed for next month to prevent that report being issued.  We are insisting that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issue that report.  That somebody else wants to take a High Court action has nothing to do with us.</p> <p>  No. 1523 was sent to the Minister for Finance from an individual dated 15 August 2018 regarding the publishing of pension arrangements for the President.

We have previously made inquiries from the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on foot of a report submitted by the correspondent.  The replies we received were forwarded to the individual.  The individual has offered to meet the committee.  While there appears to be some validity in the points made in the correspondence, the outsourcing of this service is a policy matter for the Government and it is, therefore, outside the remit of the committee.  We have brought the matter as far as possible.  I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on this issue previously.</p></speech>

We will deal with that separately in the context of how we deal with the cervical cancer as part of our role compared to the role of the Joint Committee on Health.</p><p> No. 1580 is from me, proposing that the committee examine Vote 1.  There will be no further discussion.</p><p> No. 1581 is dated 18 September, from Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, looking for clarification on whether she is needed for next week's meeting on CervicalCheck, which was supposed to be this week's business, but we are rescheduling that.  We will hold her offer to attend open until we finalise that work programme and the date for that.  She was the clinical director of CervicalCheck but no longer works for the HSE.</p><p> Nos. 1516, 1517, 1573 and 1574 are from an individual with regard to a previous HSE human resources, HR, inquiry.  The correspondence is further to previous correspondence that was dealt with at our meeting in July.  It was agreed to ask the HSE to respond.  The HSE to wrote to us on the matter and advised that an agreement was concluded between the staff panel, unions and the HSE under the aegis of the national joint committee in May 2015.  The corporate employee relations service notified all divisions of the HSE and section 38 agencies of the provisions of the agreement and the necessity to advise those who were unsuccessful in their application for regularisation or who have otherwise not received any outcome of their application.  I propose to send the HSE response to the individual and if the individual wants to come back to us with further information, he or she is free to do so.  While all those wonderful provisions happened at national level, it appeared from what the individual wrote that staff members on the ground never got the information.  They were never aware of this programme.  While employee relations services, corporate committees and joint committees said it was all in order, staff members who may have been interested in being considered for that insist they were never notified.  We will send all that.  That is the official response.  What happened on the ground may have been different.  If he or she has evidence, we will look at that matter because it does not fully address the exact query with regard to individuals not being informed on a local level.</p><p> No. 1576 is from an individual, dated 30 August, who alleges unauthorised state aid is paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to Horse Sport Ireland.  I propose we request a response from the Department.  It does not like giving money to Horse Sport Ireland.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 1578 is from an individual, dated 14 September, requesting the committee to make recommendations to the Government regarding accountability for the management of the State's property assets.  This matter is related to a forthcoming report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and refers to an issue raised with the previous committee.  I propose we await the forthcoming report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and consider it as part of our work programme at that stage.</p><p> No. 1579 is from Susan Gilvarry, solicitor to the Cooke commission of investigation, dated 14 September 2018, requesting documents submitted to the committee from Fortress during the inquiry into Project Eagle.  The secretariat has sent the requested documentation to the committee and we will note the request.  The letter refers to Deputy Catherine Murphy but it should have been Deputy Catherine Connolly.</p><p> No. 1587 is from a solicitor, dated 27 August, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding increased cost of long-term care in West Kerry Community Hospital.  That is probably funded by the fair deal scheme.  The people who set the price for the fair deal scheme are the National Treatment Purchase Fund, or it might be a matter for the HSE.  We will write to both organisations for a response to that matter because I am sure the State is paying most of the costs of care in that organisation, through the fair deal scheme or otherwise, even though there is a private element involved.</p></speech>

The issue of the private patient is part of that but we want a comprehensive response on the issues raised in the letter.</p> <p>  No. 1589 is from an individual regarding the Waterford Youth Training and Education Centre, WYTEC, in Waterford city.  This is an employment issue.  It states that the individual contacted the committee in early 2009.  It appears to be a ten year old issue.  I will not mention the individual's name.  The end of the correspondence indicates that the individual was encouraged to seek legal advice, and had done so initially but this time it was with protection.  We will note it.  We cannot get into it.  We can refer the individual to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is not at our request but we can advise the individual that he or she might consider it.</p> <p>  No. 1592 is from an individual, dated 20 September, advising the committee regarding previous access by the Comptroller and Auditor General to information regarding presidential expenses.  That is noted with no discussion.</p> <p>  Other correspondence not circulated includes No. 1545.  It is from a co-ordinator of the Chartered Accountants Voluntary Advice service and is dated 22 August.  The co-ordinator is making inquiries on behalf of an individual regarding access to funds in a particular bank account.  This item has not been circulated as it includes personal financial details related to the individual.  As well as being outside of the remit of the committee, the matter has been decided on by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Can we agree not to circulate that correspondence?  Agreed.  There is too much detail about personal financial circumstances.  If anyone wants to see it, he or she is free to contact the secretariat but we will not circulate it.  I advise the committee that we have not circulated it.</p></speech>

It is a group of chartered accounts, which provides free advice and took it up with us, but the personal information should not have been sent to us, which is why we are not circulating it.</p> <p>  No. 1521 is from Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice, dated 14 August, forwarding correspondence requesting the committee to make an inquiry with the HSE regarding charges for medical care.  The correspondence has not been circulated because there are some libel and general data protection regulation, GDPR, concerns.  There is also considerable personal information.  At Deputy Fitzmaurice's request, I met him and the person who made the complaints before the summer recess and asked them to send us a detailed letter.  We will not circulate this.  I will go back to Deputy Fitzmaurice and ask for the points to be made in a fresh letter without the personal details next time.  It relates to the possibility of improper or illegal charging of residents for incontinence wear at the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon and the right of those residents to a refund.  The matter relates to the general governance of sections 38 and 39 organisations.  I propose we write to the HSE to establish whether it is satisfied that all residents who were improperly or illegally charged for incontinence wear at the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon have been refunded and to provide a note on the HSE's oversight of this matter and how and whether the matter has been fully dealt with.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  If members wish, we will redact or just revise the letter so people can see it.</p></speech>

The charity provides a normal volume of incontinence wear.  If somebody has a particular problem, it says the allocation is two per day and a person might require six, which it says is above and beyond the normal requirement, which means it is additional medical care and the person is being billed for it.  It appears that has happened in this case.</p></speech>

I am joined this afternoon by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department, and assistant secretaries, Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. David Walsh.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, will join us shortly.</p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is many things but at its core it is a delivery plan with the single objective of delivering more for citizens.  I have said many times that the housing challenges Ireland faces cannot be solved overnight but that is not to say we are not dealing with the day-to-day priorities or ignoring the significant issues.  We are endeavouring in everything we do to provide ongoing support for our most vulnerable citizens in every way possible while managing long-term programmes to create a sustainable pathway to a stable and consistent housing sector.  Nowhere is this more evident than in homelessness.  The first six months of this year saw 2,332 adults exiting homelessness into independent tenancies.  To date, 3,600 households have been assisted under homeless HAP and over 200 Housing First tenancies have been established but more needs to be done and more will be done. </p> <p>  It is a complex issue with many contributory factors and supply is a key factor.  Increasing supply of appropriate and secure accommodation is the main objective and so too is ensuring that while we await that supply coming on stream in a sufficient quantity, we have a robust system of response in place to meet the needs of citizens who, for whatever reason, find themselves presenting as homeless at our local authority housing desks and in Parkgate Street.</p><p>This means continuing to provide shelter in the most appropriate accommodation available.  We know that hotels are not that, which is why I recently wrote to the Dublin local authorities requesting that they expand their hub programmes so the short-term emergency accommodation we provide is as suited to the needs of families and individuals as possible.</p><p> The key remains supply and the accelerated delivery of social housing.  A need for linkage between the strategic and operational is an essential component of a successful plan, which is why housing summits have become a central part of how my Department engages with the critical partners for delivery.  In July we hosted a third summit for local authority chief executives and held very meaningful discussions on both strategic and operational issues, bringing forward a number of key actions.</p><p> In recognition of the approved housing body, AHB, sector as a major stakeholder not only in social housing delivery, but also in terms of tenancy management and services to the homeless and other vulnerable members of our communities, I invited chief executives of a number of tier 3 and tier 2 approved housing bodies to attend a dedicated AHB summit on 17 September.  The theme was collaboration between AHBs and local authorities, as well as collaboration with the market and the development sector.</p><p> Working together is achieving tangible outcomes.  Up to the end of the second quarter of 2018, Rebuilding Ireland has delivered more than 57,000 housing solutions across all delivery streams.  By the end of this year I expect that number to have grown to approximately 70,000 and we are on course to achieve that.  We committed to supporting 137,000 households into appropriate accommodation under build, acquisition and leasing programmes, as well as HAP and RAS, over the six-year period, and by the end of tier three we will have achieved more than 50% of our target.  The need to continue to intensify and accelerate new build activity is to the fore of our strategic planning.  The early years of Rebuilding Ireland focused on harnessing existing capacity and more immediate solutions while, in parallel, progressing local authority and AHB capacity to build more, and establishing solid project pipelines.  Those pipelines are now in place and growing, as evidenced in the quarter two construction status report which has just been published.  Since the end of 2016 the number of schemes and homes in the programme has doubled.  Activity onsite has also increased significantly, with 1,074 homes going on site in the second quarter of this year alone, which is a 239% increase on the number of homes that went on site in the same quarter last year.  There is no room for complacency, however.  We have committed to exponential growth and we are striving to achieve this.</p><p> As Minister, I have also been clear that we need to address issues of housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low to middle income households, particularly in Dublin and certain other of our main urban centres.  Back in 2011 all affordable housing schemes were stood down, given the prevailing economic position in the country.  As members know, given the collapse in house prices there was an overhang of unsold affordable homes at that time.  This time around it is important that we only target affordable housing interventions in areas that require them, based on a consistent approach to economic assessment.</p><p> In terms of affordable purchase, I have commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider greater Dublin area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land, and that analysis is progressing well.</p><p> With regard to cost rental, I am determined for it to become a major part of our rental landscape in the future.  It is clear there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  The Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of approved housing bodies have signed the agreements on our first cost rental pilot at Enniskerry Road, and tenders issued last month.  In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency undertook detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore which Dublin City Council will now develop as a major cost rental project.</p><p> In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the serviced sites fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion urban regeneration and development fund, I am redirecting the &euro;50 million funding for phase 2 of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, to the serviced sites fund, thereby increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25 million to &euro;75 million.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use as affordable housing.  A total of &euro;15 million Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2018, to which the local authority minimum contribution of &euro;5 million will be added.  This should enable the provision of infrastructure for around 500 affordable homes initially, based on a maximum level of &euro;40,000 infrastructure investment per home.</p><p> One of the most significant actions taken since I last presented to this committee was the formal launch of the Land Development Agency, LDA.  This will be a commercial State-sponsored body, acting within a clear Government policy framework, including that all public land disposals must deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands in the form of social and subsidised or affordable housing.  The LDA will establish a national centre of expertise for State bodies and local authorities, using experienced staff with expertise in project management finance, planning, development and procurement.  For the first time, the Government will create a State body to deliver on the key principles of the Kenny report of 1973 and NESC&rsquo;s latest research, targeting land management and housing delivery that is intended to underpin the delivery of 150,000 new homes over a 20-year period, or around 25% of all housing needs envisaged by Project Ireland 2040.</p><p> In terms of furthering our ambition to maximise utilisation of vacant housing stock, my Department published the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy 2018-2021 in July.  It builds on significant work already begun in 2016 and 2017 by various stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies, in order to meet our Pillar 5 goals.  The strategy sets out a number of concrete actions, including the adoption of vacant homes action plans by all local authorities and the appointment of vacant homes officers, funded by my Department, to co-ordinate local actions addressing vacancy.  It also provides a clearly signposted source of information for owners of vacant homes, including the funding options that are available to assist in bringing vacant homes back into productive use.</p><p> In regard to the rental sector, as previously stated, the Government approved the drafting of a new Bill to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts.  The proposed changes will further empower the Residential Tenancies Board by giving it the necessary powers and resources to protect both tenants and landlords in the residential rental sector, particularly with regard to enforcement.  These changes will further strengthen the effectiveness of the rent setting and rent review laws by empowering the RTB to investigate any contravention of the law around rent limits in rent pressure zones and to take enforcement action, if necessary, including the imposition of sanctions on landlords in breach and initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.  The progress of the residential tenancies Bill will influence the framework as each proposal will require a lead-in time for the RTB to put systems and resources in place for effective delivery.  My Department is working closely with the RTB to identify capacity and what functions will need to be developed to implement the legislation.  The proposed new powers for the RTB are a crucial first step in expanding its overall role and function as part of a multi-annual change management programme to proactively enforce tenancy law and assume more the role of a regulator within the rental sector.</p><p> My Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General in drafting this legally complex Bill and I hope to bring it to Government shortly.  Following the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the committee has issued a report highlighting a number of recommendations, including the introduction of tax incentives for small-scale landlords.  My Department is considering the report with a view to making any necessary amendments to the existing Bill or for consideration for inclusion in a separate planning, housing and residential tenancies (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which my Department is also working on.</p><p> With regard to short-term lettings, I am currently considering the report of the working group and the recommendations from the Oireachtas committee's report on this issue.  I intend to shortly announce the initial measures and actions that can maintain or return to use properties for long-term rental purposes in our cities and urban areas.  This approach recognises that the introduction of a new regulatory system will take some time to be designed and come into effect.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, I have circulated a range of documents to it over the course of this week.  I am more than happy to answer any questions in regard to those documents and, indeed, in regard to the continuing progress we are making under Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p> I want to add two further points.  First, I have just come from a meeting on the homeless figures for August, given we have been trying to make sure they could be published in advance of the committee hearing today.  My apologies for giving the numbers to the committee orally but those numbers will be published imminently.  For August, the number of presentations was 238, which is down on July; 114 families were prevented from entering into emergency accommodation; and we had only 83 exits from emergency accommodation in that time.  Much of the reason for this is that our focus and our resources were put into protecting people in existing emergency accommodation ahead of and throughout the papal visit.  The total number of people in emergency accommodation in the State following this work is 9,527.  People will know this is down on the number in July and, in conjunction with the publishing of these numbers, I will be making available a summary of the recategorisation survey that was conducted over the past four months.  That recategorisation survey identified 741 homes that were being classified as emergency accommodation when they are not.  Those numbers have been removed from the total number of people in emergency accommodation but they were removed at various points in time over the past four months, so I cannot be clear on how many have actually come out of the August number.  Nonetheless, we now have a clear number in terms of the total number of people in emergency accommodation in the State, which, as of August, is 9,527.  Furthermore, I have requested the CSO, and it has agreed, to become involved in the preparation and compilation of our homeless numbers to get better accuracy on this data because we continue to struggle to get accurate data, month in, month out.</p><p> Second, I have documentation for each member in regard to the number of builds that are happening in local authorities at the moment, both social builds and private builds.  I thought it might be useful to give people an accurate picture of what is actually happening on the ground in their local authority as we talk about ramping up supply and what more needs to be done.  That is being distributed at the moment.</p></speech>

We all need to work to make sure no one is homeless.  It is frightening to think people are still homeless.</p> <p>  Rents are rocketing up.  When I asked the Minister about the rent pressure zones he said he thought it would be illegal to put the rest of the local authorities that were not in the rent pressure zone into it because some are affected and some are not.  Will he consider that again because I believe he spoke about it last week or there was documentary on the radio saying that rents are high in every area?  The housing assistance payment, HAP, for Carlow County Council is &euro;548 but it costs &euro;1,000 a month to rent a house in County Carlow.  There is a balance to be found there.  I know there is only a 20% leeway but that is unacceptable.  We need rent caps in each county, whether Dublin county or city.  There should be a different strategy.  In Dublin, the HAP is almost &euro;1,200, which is fine, but the Minister is forgetting rural areas.  Although I welcome his opening speech today everything was based in Dublin and Cork.  He needs to consider the rural areas.  Will he consider a different strategy because I do not think the rent pressure zones are working? </p> <p>  I was speaking about the HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, payments.  This is an important time because within two weeks we will have the budget.  What are the Minister's full proposals in the budget to help rural Ireland?  What exactly will the Minister do for local authorities?  Will he give them extra funding this year under the scheme?  He says there is money there and I welcome that but will he give extra funding to local authorities that have been crying out for it to put towards housing and other projects?  I welcome the fast track planning and rapid build but there is so much red tape now between the Department and local authorities that the timescale of two or three years is too long.  I understand everything has to be transparent and above board but because there is such an urgent housing crisis is there any way the Minister could rush local authority houses that need to be built?  </p> <p>  I am very concerned about mortgages.  They are the way forward for people who do not qualify for a mortgage from a bank or building society.  A person has to bring a refusal from each to the local authority but the Minister is not supporting it enough.  His timescale is wrong.  I brought this up with him six months ago when he told me there is only a six-week delay in applying for a mortgage.  That is not true.  There is a 12 month delay.  I have dealt with 12 mortgages since then - I can name the people - and it is between six months and a year before I hear back.  It goes to the Department, then it has to go to the credit committee in the local authority then back to the Department.  That is unacceptable because a person who applies to a bank for a loan will know within two to three weeks exactly why they do or do not qualify for the loan.  That is the way forward. </p> <p>  I am so disappointed with the Minister because he has said on several occasions that he is aware that the housing crisis is not much better but there is a small improvement and that has to be welcomed.  Carlow County Council has one of the lowest caps to qualify for the housing list, at &euro;27,500.  Compared with Laois and Kilkenny we are failing the people of Carlow who do not qualify.  I know a woman who was &euro;50 out to qualify for the local authority housing list.  I was devastated and so was she.  There is no appeal.  That is unacceptable.  The Minister and his staff have given me a commitment that would be addressed in September, that the cap for Carlow County Council would be increased.  This is part of the housing crisis and homelessness.  It is not being addressed.  We are falling down on areas like that.  We all have to worry about people who are homeless.  I could name at least 20 people in my area who are couch-surfing.  They have nowhere to go because we cannot get them on the housing list.  There is no room at home for them.  These are the people who are falling through the net.  The Minister needs to give me a commitment today that the cap for Carlow County Council will be sorted in the next few weeks.  I will not leave here today until I get a commitment from him.  </p> <p>  I have loads more questions but the ones I asked were on the cap, the mortgages, central Government funding to the local authorities for their budgets, and whether Carlow County Council will get any extra help in the next budget because the budget plays a massive part in our local authority.  </p></speech>

I appreciate the time she gives to it and thank her for recognising the improvements.</p> <p>  I will work backwards through her questions.  Several documents have been published this week, ahead of this scheduled meeting but also because it is the end of quarter 3, we are looking back to quarter 2 and this is the traditional time to publish the figures.  I had hoped that the work on the social housing eligibility criteria would be completed in September.  That was always the intention.  I am not doing it.  The Housing Agency is leading on that.  We are almost at a point of completion.  There will be much work to do in October for further publications which have gone a bit over time.  I cannot give any commitments on it until it is completed by the Housing Agency and has been given to me but everyone has heard the concerns the Senator has raised several times in this committee. </p> <p>  More than 1,000 homeloans have been approved by the housing agency and they go back to the credit committee.  We and the housing agency are turning them around very quickly but there are delays in the local authorities' credit committees.  There is also an inconsistency in how the credit committees make decisions.  On foot of recommendations from colleagues in my party earlier this month I am doing an assessment of the rebuilding Ireland homeloan.  It is being done independent of my Department so that we can get an independent view, closer to that of a local authority to get a better understanding of what fixes can be made.  I have done several round tables with the key players but we are still finding kinks in the system.  This review will hopefully work them out.  </p> <p>  I have sat in local authority chambers where members have told me that a project has been with my Department for four, six or eight months and they have not got it back and when I have asked my officials about it they say it was received only a week before.  I am tired of this buck passing between local authorities and my Department back and forth.  That is why I published-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018092700002#C00400"><p>Whenever there is a problem there is always a bit of blame to go around.  That is why I looked for full transparency with local authorities at the beginning of this year, asking them to publish their targets for the year, making sure we had a layer of accountability that we had not had previously and that we could work to those targets throughout the year so that the members, as elected representatives, could see what their local authorities should have been doing and ask why they were not doing more.  If they then said the Department has not given approval the members could ask me why it had not been approved.  I could say it was an issue with a particular design or the financing or whatever it might be if there was a delay.  That is the purpose of that programme and, in fairness to many colleagues, the number of requests that have come to the Department through written correspondence asking about a particular site has increased and from time to time that can help expedite things.  I encourage members to look at the targets for their local authority areas and the details I have given them today and see where they can help if there are logjams in the system because we can all play a role in this.</p> <p>  The four-stage approval process is 59 weeks.  That was agreed with the local authority managers.  Where it works it works very well.  It is very close, if not similar, to what happens in the private sector when it comes to design, planning, procurement and all the things that have to happen before going on site.  We are not too far off where we should be but we can work it better and I am considering aspects of it again.  Conversations are happening between me and other Ministers on this issue because I have heard it from enough people that I recognise we can look at it again.</p><p>An important point to make is that if we rush the development of any housing scheme we would not want to risk a problem arising in ten years time where it would need to be rebuilt, redeveloped or discover we have made a fundamental mistake in the planning, design or outline in that we have located the playground where it does not allow for passive supervision and, subsequently, find there is concern about anti-social behaviour or something happening behind people's houses rather than in front of them.  One encounters all these different issues as one visits housing schemes up and down the country and finds the different ways they are designed are for very good reasons, and we want to take care in that respect and we do that.</p><p> Regarding the budget, I cannot tell the Senator what my full proposals are.  There have been enough conversations in the media to get an idea of what we would like to achieve.  We in the Department have moved away from the big bang budget day where the budget is a big surprise and a big review on the day by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  We have a multi-annual budgetary framework for Rebuilding Ireland whereby we already know what funding is programmed into it and pretty much the funding for which programmes next year and the year after because it is a five to six-year plan.  In respect of Project Ireland 2040, we have also taken that view in terms of long-term planning.  The Senator knows there is a &euro;4 billion urban regeneration fund.  She will know the closing date for applications is tomorrow.  We will announce people on foot of that in October with respect to the drawing down of &euro;100 million in funding next year.  We do not need to wait for the budget to be told that.  That said, there will be a few items that will be covered in the budget regarding the way we will be spending money and some new initiatives.  Those negotiations are currently ongoing.  Anything that I can say publicly before the budget, I will say, but certain matters have to remain until the last minute because some decisions are only made at the last minute when we can get a proper idea of where the resources are going to be allocated as per priority not only within my Department but between other Departments and the Government.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and congratulate Mr. David Walsh on his appointment as chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We will miss him but I hope he will not forget everything we have said to him during the past two years.  I look forward to engaging with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I would add there has been slippage on its part in terms of Rebuilding Ireland.  We still have no i-planning system in this country despite my having a circular from the now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, that this would happen within three to four months of that strategy.  A great announcement in Rebuilding Ireland was that we were going to embrace technology.  I am not asking the Minister to take notes to respond, and that is not out of rudeness on my part, but I want to use my time in the form of a monologue, for want of a better word, because w  will have many opportunities to talk and he will have many opportunities to come to both Houses of the Oireachtas and we can engage in that way.  We need to examine planning in terms of An Bord Plean&aacute;la because commitments were given about engaging in a process, particularly regarding fast-track planning, student accommodation and a range of matters, but that contract with and commitments to the citizens have not been fulfilled.  I happen to live in Dublin but I would not want to be living down in west Cork and trying to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la or to go into look at bad etchings and drawings in planning authorities before I prepared some submission to the board.  In any event, I wish Mr. David Walsh well in that job.</p><p>I acknowledge the strong and robust account the Minister gave of himself in the D&aacute;il during the week.  It was impressive.  I took the time to look at the coverage of it and to listen to it.  He is very capable of defending himself and he did it in a professional and robust way and I have no doubt about his personal commitment to housing and addressing homelessness.  I acknowledge that and I like to be positive.  As I was coming into this meeting, it struck me that I am not a member of the Minister's party or any political party, I am Independent.  That does not mean I am against Government or Government policy, or against anybody.  I am against something when I believe it is wrong and I advocate and support something that I believe is right.  That is the way I motivate myself in my personal, political and business life.  I acknowledge the Minister gave a good and strong account of himself; he demonstrated his knowledge of this brief and that must be respected.  </p><p>We have 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation despite all our best efforts, promises about hotels and emergency accommodation in hubs, some of which are very good and some of which are not great, and I have been to many of them.  We also have 3,600 children who are homeless.  That is the factual position.  Many figures are bandied about regarding the number of households on social housing.  Today the nearest figure we can be precise about is approximately 85,000 householders.  I have spoken to a number of non-governmental organisations today and I acknowledge the great work they are doing.  Let us not get caught up in the semantics of the numbers because we are talking about homes and people's lives.  I use this opportunity, on behalf of us all, to acknowledge the great work of Focus Ireland and many of the non-governmental organisations and the many positives developments that are happening.  There are many positives in terms of the people who have been lifted of the streets, given housing and other forms of holistic support, which are important.  The day of the blame game is over with respect to who is for and who is against a measure, who did not do wrong and the numbers.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's announcement regarding the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  I suggested that to him last year in this very room and told him we needed somebody independent to validate our figures and somebody took exception to that idea.  They thought I was having a pop at them.  I am not having a pop at anyone.  We need to validate our housing figures and to stand over them.  That is important.  We have 85,000 householders on our official social housing waiting list.  I do my own statistics across the 31 local authorities with key councillors with whom I have built relationships. </p><p>Also, I acknowledge we had representatives of four councils here last night and I was very impressed by them.  They had various views on the issue.  The point that emerged from last night's meeting is that they are sick of being blamed and I am sick of people blaming the Minister and <i>vice versa</i>.  Therefore, we need accountability.  If the Minister is brave enough to have another one of his great housing forums or meetings, he should have the next one with us.  Furthermore, I do not believe he is tapping into the resources around this table.  We have a wide experience in local government.  Everyone here has been involved in local government.  I read a note about the Land Development Agency that I received after the event.  I speak to media journalists who report on this specialist category of housing, planning and local government who regularly contact me to tell me they have been tipped off and briefed about matters - that is the truth, let us call a spade a spade - about which we, the members, have not been told.  We had to request this after the event.  I see people surrounding the Minister at various gigs and openings in regard to policy and I ask myself why are they there.  I am not convinced he or his Department is tapping into the enormous skills, expertise and talent around this table, and that is a challenge.  I ask him to reflect on that and to use us and have dialogue with us.  I do not want to be hounding anyone in his Department and I do not want anyone hounding me, but I believe we can have a constructive exchange and be in a partnership in this respect.</p><p>I wish to touch on three or four issues.  From statistics I received today, I note 70,000 borrowers are in mortgage arrears with 30 being more than five years in arrears.  We have a crisis across the whole spectrum in terms of mortgages, rent and affordability to purchase and to rent.  I want to put a few points to the Minister and he might not be able to fill me in on some of the detail because I am aware from having been in communication with him that some of it is sensitive.  There are 158 acres in Thornton Hall.  It is a scandal.  Either the Government does something with it and puts it to use, or we should consider alternatives.  I do not know if the Government has considered moving an Army barracks or some other facility in Dublin to Thornton Hall.  I visited it, saw the services on that site and it should be used.I will leave it at that.  I do not want to engage on it because there are sensitives around these issues and I like to be responsible.  What is happening with Shanganagh Castle?  I have heard that the council is frustrated by the Minister's Department and I have heard from his Department that the council is not providing the data.  That is a big issue and it has the potential to create many homes.  I will not go on about the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The Minister knows the story there.  I would ask him to engage with the local authority.  He should not undermine local democracy but support and work with those in it to get things done.  </p><p>I have been reliably told by independent experts and people who validate this area that there are 3,008 ha of State owned lands, of which I have seen some maps, across the country which are serviced and ready to go.  We need to know about them.  We need to do a full inventory of the lands in State ownership and to have housing built on them or we need to develop imaginative partnerships.  I do not have a problem with partnerships.  We just want homes built.  We have a crisis.  It is deeply dividing people and society.  We talk about reclaiming the city and members of the Garda have advised me that they believe there will be more of these events.  People are angry.  We must understand they are angry and we must empathise and sympathise with them but, more important, we have to stop the platitudes and get on and deliver something.  </p><p>The Minister's status report is good and I acknowledge a good deal of work has gone into it.  I am not too sure of the format for going forward because the Minister has achieved a lot of things.  Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy said at a conference I attended last week that we are worse off in many ways in terms of the figures than we were when we started the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  I do not want to get into the figures but we need solutions and to work together.</p><p>A recent report from National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, on its 2017 accounts includes an attachment setting out a note on the social housing status to the end of March 2018, which I will make available.  It states that 2,474 social housing units have been delivered, providing approximately 8,000 homes.</p><p>The more alarming fact is that we are told that NAMA offered 6,984 residential properties for social housing purposes, but demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for a mere 2,717 of them.  There are likely to be complexities around that - nothing is ever simple - but we must remember who the owners of NAMA are and who is responsible for it.  I know that it is a separate vehicle, that the Minister cannot interfere, and what the standard responses are.  However, we owe it to the ordinary punter, the ordinary man and woman who work and pay their taxes, and those who do not work because they cannot get a job for whatever reason - and I make no judgment about them - that we use the assets of NAMA to help us out in this housing crisis.  We owe it to the public, the taxpayer and this country.</p><p> I thank the Minister for indulging me and allowing me to have my say.  I am not being rude and I want to hear what the Minister has to say; I am not doubting his commitment.  I know there are blockages and that the Minister is also frustrated, as are his officials.  I want to acknowledge their work.  We have to be patient, but we are all in an understandable hurry to resolve this crisis.  I have to leave because I have to attend at the Oireachtas audit committee, which has a very long and interesting agenda today, and I want to play my part there as well.  I am not leaving due to rudeness, but there are some points the Minister might reflect on.  Perhaps we can have ongoing dialogue on them.</p></speech>

I also thank him for the congratulations he offered to Mr. David Walsh.  I cannot think of a better person to lead An Bord Plean&aacute;la into the future.  I wish him well too.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct to note that people are angry and hurt.  They are right to be.  We have to continue to make progress and to look at what is working and continue that work, as well as looking at what is not working and consider how we can fix it.  The Senator has challenged me to have a housing summit with the Oireachtas.  We will do that after the budget.  We will announce further initiatives in the budget concerning what we are doing with our money.  We can then get together in the format suggested.  We might include some of the stakeholders as well.  We should put every available resource into dealing with this crisis.  When I attend a constituency I invite any member who is there.  The Land Development Agency proposal, unfortunately, was leaked out of different part of Government, and we had to try to keep it as close to our chests as we could because there are vested interests in all of these things.  There are certain Departments and agencies which do not want to give up their land for housing.  However, we are going to take that land and use it for housing because we have to.  By 23 October other Departments will have to provide Cabinet their proposals for lands to be made available to the agency initially.  We already have the first tranche done, and Dundrum is a part of that, and we are negotiating for further tranches.  The Departments we have engaged with to date have been superb in terms of their willingness to come forward with public land for new housing for the public.  That is a big piece of work that has to be done.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned different sites.  I will not go into that because time is limited.  On the NAMA offers, unfortunately not all the houses offered were suitable for local authority housing.  I answered a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il today which provides some numbers about what the housing agency is trying to do with its &euro;70 million acquisition fund.  It gives a breakdown of the bids in place.  There are roughly 1,000 in the system at the moment, out of the 1,600 we hope to have by 2020.  </p></speech>

I am not going to ask any questions about that because I have not read the report.  I ask that the Minister gives the committee a commitment that when we have had time to read and digest that report he will come back to us to deal with that issue specifically, because he knows that we are very concerned about it.</p> <p>  I welcome the Department and the Government's continued commitment to Housing First.  It is the correct approach, and is one of the things we agree on.  I also believe it is good that we have a strategy, and that somebody is leading it.  There is a target to have approximately 600 Housing First tenancies over three or three and a half years.  We know there are approximately 3,500 single individual homeless people.  Housing First is not appropriate for all of those people, and I accept that.  I have read and understand the methodology that is used to identify the 600.  It seems to me that 600 over three years is a very low target.  Clearly, those 600 identified individuals are those with the greatest level of need and who have been in emergency accommodation the longest, and therefore should absolutely be prioritised.  Does the Department have a figure for how many more Housing First properties will be required, based on the knowledge we have of single people currently in emergency accommodation?  Can the Minister tell us why the targets are as modest as they are?  Notwithstanding the fact that it is good to have them, they are nonetheless very modest.</p> <p>  We received the report on pillar two today.  One of the worrying things about the quarter two social housing output is that if one looks at the local authority, approved housing body, AHB, and Part 5 properties, it can be seen that around 1,051 units have been delivered over six months.  The target is 4,969 over the year.  It is not unreasonable to be concerned.  The Department and the local authorities have a long way to go to meet that target.  Is there anything the Minister can say to reassure members that the target will be met?  If we were 33% or 45% of the way along that would be fine, but there is a long way to go.  While the Department is ahead in terms of acquisitions, the acquisitions target was always very low, at 900.  I welcome the extra acquisitions, but it is still a low number.  </p> <p>  On voids, Mr. Brendan Kenny was here yesterday - the Minister was not here - and he told us categorically that there are no more long-term voids and that all they have is expensive casual re-lets which the council do not categorise as additions to the stock.  However, 387 voids are included in the figures provided by the Minister, including 184 from Dublin City Council.  We are getting conflicting information here.  Dublin City Council tells us that those properties are not voids and should not be counted as additions to the stock, yet the Minister tells us that they are voids and they should be counted.  I am genuinely concerned because I believe they are being incorrectly categorised.  </p> <p>  I also have a concern about Part 5 properties.  Looking at the quarter two social housing construction report and the quarter two housing supply co-ordination task force, the figures on Part 5 properties do not match the figures on the private builds.  Perhaps I am reading the two reports incorrectly, but rather than social housing Part 5s being at around 10% of the total outputs, which is what should be happening, they are actually at 28% when the two sets of figures for quarter two are compared.  Maybe it is an accounting error and perhaps it is unfair to ask the Minister to give a detailed response to that, but I would appreciate it if he could get back to me on that.</p> <p>  Can the Minister give us a quick update on where we are with the AHB redesignation?  There is a lot of concern in the AHB sector about that issue.  Can the Minister give us some indication as to what the plan is and how it will be rolled out?</p> <p>  We dealt with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, quarter two index report today.  I know the Minister is going to bring forward legislation, and if it does what he says it will do he will certainly have the support of my party, and we would be happy to expedite it.  However, it will only provide protection in the first instance for just over half of the total number of tenancies.  Some places are not covered by the rent pressure zones, RPZs, but it can be seen from today's report that places such as Limerick, Waterford and Sligo town are all experiencing unsustainable rent increases.  What is the Minister going to do for people in those places?  How is he going to respond?  </p> <p>  In terms of pillar four, affordable housing, while I have welcomed the approach taken at St. Michael's Estate as a significant change in direction in terms of Government policy on these matters, I keep hearing the Minister mentioning a rent coming in at 10% to 15% of market rates.  That is worrying, because it is not going to be genuinely affordable for the income cohort that exists.  It is also not the same as what Dublin City Council is telling us; it is seeking to overlay the cost of providing those units - the financing and maintenance - with the income of the tenants, which might mean a number of income bands to make sure that not only those at the top end of the affordable income cohort benefit.  I believe that linking it to market rents is the wrong way to do it, and I would appreciate some clarity on that.</p> <p>  In terms of the vacant home tax, can the Minister confirm that the Government, on the back of the Indecon report, is not considering implementing such a tax?  If it has not made up its mind, I say to the Minister that in the context of the very low uptake on the repair and leasing scheme, despite the fact that there is a very good carrot - albeit underfunded, in my view - he should consider the stick of a vacant home tax on properties that are being sat on speculatively by individual owners of funds.  I am not referring to properties stuck in probate or fair deal arrangements.  Without such a tax, the repair and lease scheme and similar schemes will continue to dramatically underperform.</p></speech>

To go back to Senator Boyhan's points, we need to move away from confusion about numbers to look at who we are trying to help and how we help them.  The recategorisation was certainly a very important part of that work.  I did not get to clarify earlier the work the CSO will do.  It is not that we are taking responsibility away from ourselves for the CSO to do the work.  This was a very successful exercise when we did it with build because we can now have confidence around the build number and can speak to accurate, independent data.  The CSO will help us with our counting, analysis and categorisation, that kind of work, so the responsibility will be kept with me, with this Department, as it should be.</p> <p>  Sam Tsemberis, whose surname I always mispronounce, from Canada is the leading expert internationally on Housing First.  He was over for the launch yesterday morning.  We need to be careful in rolling out Housing First in the right way.  We absolutely know what works now.  There is an 85% retention rate and more than 200 homes have been secured.  Bob Jordan is absolutely the best person to be the national director.  He has put together a fantastic plan for the country.  We have 200 homes already in place, 600 more coming and about another 200 earmarked for people who may be coming out of prison and might have severe difficulties as they do so in establishing a tenancy or getting back into a normal life.  It is therefore actually a larger figure than 600.  The advice I have been given is that we need to roll this out carefully and slowly to ensure we do it right.  One of the difficulties that has been established in other countries is that some NGOs, for all the good will in the world, have said they are doing Housing First or housing-led initiatives but have not really changed their models or approaches, which has not had the desired impact in terms of the kind of approach that sees people into a home and the services come to them.  I trust Bob Jordan's plan on this and his expertise in terms of the targets we have.  Initially, they are minimum targets.  I was with members of Dublin Simon Community on Tuesday morning.  They were talking about the new capacity they are bringing into the system and how they will ensure there are enough one-beds and two-beds for Housing First.  Bob Jordan also spoke at the housing summit and reinforced the point I was making, that as one builds, one should think about studios, one-beds and two-beds for Housing First.  As we build more, we can expand these targets.  We just want to ensure that when we have a programme that works so well and is designed to best international practice, we roll it out in the right way.</p> <p>  On the construction side of things, one looks at the build figure for local authorities and housing bodies and sees 1,000 in six months and we must do 3,000 more in the second six months of the year.  We must get there.  Last year we saw a step up in delivery over the course of the year that saw a slow first quarter and second quarter, a jump in the third quarter and a lot of delivery in the fourth quarter.  It is really the way in which the delivery programme is designed as well as funding being released.  It has that kind of ramp up quarter on quarter, particularly in the final quarter of the year.  This is what happened last year.  I saw the numbers and have communicated to the local authorities that we must get to these targets.  That is an absolute necessity.</p> <p>  Regarding voids, I have not seen Mr. Brendan Kenny's contribution to the committee last night.  I beg the committee's pardon but I was in other meetings.  When we talk about voids, we are not talking about them being new builds, but the recommendation did come from the Oireachtas that they would be counted as part of the 50,000 we would have in terms of the targets for the joint Oireachtas committee.  We have done a huge amount on voids over recent years.  We know that voids as a low-hanging fruit are now almost coming to an end.  We gave a significant amount of additional funding to Dublin City Council, Mr. Kenny's own council, earlier this year to expedite its void programme, so it might well be the case - again, I have not seen Mr. Kenny's remarks - that because that work has now happened, the council does not believe there is much left in its own pipeline under void delivery.</p> <p>  Regarding Part 5s and their not matching, there are unfortunately still some sites that qualify under the previous law before it was changed, whereby they had a buy-out option.  There is also a phasing issue now, whereby we are trying to expedite the delivery of Part 5s upfront first and we have been able to allow and release funding in that way.  This might explain the mismatch Deputy &Oacute; Broin sees in the two numbers.  As we get into the year-on-year cycles, however, those numbers will certainly correlate.</p> <p>  Work on AHB reclassification is ongoing.  It is being led by the Department of Finance because we are treating it as an accounting issue and not an issue that will get in the way of our build targets.  I reaffirmed this to the housing bodies at the recent housing summit.</p> <p>  Regarding the Residential Tenancies Board and the new proposals, I reiterate the point, which I know everyone understands, that when this Bill hits the floor, we must move on it quickly.  We saw the delays we had in the last term.  It was so frustrating to see important legislation delayed by filibustering and people with spurious contributions to make time and again.  We have a real change that we can make for many people.  We must get the rent Bill enacted before the end of the year.</p> <p>  The RTB has raised the qualifying criteria for rent pressure zones.  In Limerick there have been massive increases in rent but, because rents in Dublin continue to increase, Limerick will never hit that average, that second qualifying criteria.  This comes back to Senator Murnane O'Connor's point earlier about whether we can change these things.  I have heard from the RTB that the qualifying criteria, as established in legislation, are not helping cities such as Limerick that are seeing exponential rent increases.  I recognise this point.  However, we have a second rent Bill coming in which we want to do some more complicated things.  I know people will come forward with amendments to our rent Bill, but let us not table amendments that might require further advice from the Attorney General or further legal consultation that could potentially slow down the Bill.  Let us get the good things that we can get done and then let us move to the second pieces insofar as we can.</p> <p>  I asked an official in my Department earlier today for the presentation made when we did St. Michael's but I have not seen it yet.  The Deputy has the document.  I do not know whether it contained the financial modelling we did in respect of pay scales, what percentage of a person's income it would be and then whether an apartment the payments for which he or she could meet would actually be delivered.  Certainly, as we worked on this proposal, looked at the number of homes that would be provided, how they would be subsidised and the level of finance, it was to ensure that affordable meant affordable.  A piece of modelling was done, so perhaps Mr. Kenny was talking about that.  There is a discount of between 15% to 25% on the market price which one needs to achieve, balanced against what that means for a single earner or a couple and the qualifying criteria and then this maximum of 35% of their income going against their rental payments.  The NDFA led on this financial modelling.  I have seen it and it stacks up.  We will have to remodel it once we have the final approval from the council.  As it does that final approval, the number of affordable homes will achieve that level based on those two criteria.  That is what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

I was interested in the Minister's comment on the local authorities and improving transparency.  We would all agree with his comments but I think what we also want is an end to the buck-passing between his Department and the local authorities and <i>vice versa</i>.  If we continue to blame one another, we will not get anywhere.  I have a major concern, which I share with Deputy &Oacute; Broin, about reaching the figure of 4,000 on social housing by the end of the year.  I hear what the Minister is saying, that he made a personal commitment to attaining this.  Is his Department looking, or will he look, at raising the cap on local authorities?  There is an average bill of about &euro;210,000.  This is the Minister's figure, which I got from responses to parliamentary questions.  Basically, therefore, anything over &euro;2 million goes to his Department for approval.  We have county architects drawing up very good schemes that are being sent into the Department to be looked at by people who are their juniors and who are checking them and sending things back and forth.  If there is a local authority cap of &euro;2 million in, let us say, Fingal, my area, any scheme of eight or nine houses or more will probably go into the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It would be the same in the four Dublin local authorities and, I imagine, Cork and Galway.  I really do not think we will get the supply of social and public housing up unless we do something with that cap.  I take the Minister's point that he does not want to rush.  His Department could never be accused of rushing things, based on output.  This needs to be looked at and tried.  He could raise the cap.  If he went to &euro;10 million on the cap, he could probably allow estates of up to 40 or 45 houses be built and let the local authorities get on with it.  If they are not doing so and he has given them the autonomy to do so, then he can beat them up about it.  We will not get anywhere near our targets if we continue with the same processes and procedures.  Has the Minister - his officials may have a different view - given consideration to looking at the criteria as to what needs to be checked?</p><p>I ask the Minister sincerely to do this, if he has not done so.</p><p> I would like to speak about affordable loans.  The Minister has made an interesting point about credit committees.  I would agree with much of what he has said.  Two thirds of applications have been refused under the Rebuilding Ireland affordable loans scheme.  As of June, approximately 134 loans had actually been drawn down.  It is much slower than any of us would have wanted it to be.  I have been in contact with people who have applied under this initiative.  It is seen as a good initiative.  When two thirds of applications are refused, often for technical reasons, there is a problem.  Can the Minister confirm that common underwriting criteria are being used across our local authorities when these mortgages are being underwritten?  I do not believe common underwriting criteria are being used.  I have seen one local authority deal with overtime and bonuses differently from another local authority.  It generally always seems to be at the expense of the applicant.  If their overtime payments or bonuses put them over the limit to apply for the affordable loan scheme, they are out.  If the reverse is the case, it is deemed that they are not getting enough for a mortgage.  There is a job of work to be done here.  There should be uniformity in mortgage underwriting, particularly around basic criteria with regard to matters like salary.  That needs to be done, but it is not being done.  We are way off our target and some of that has to do with what I have said.  I agree with what the Minister said about committee delays.  Does each affordable loan application, regardless of whether it relates to south Dublin, Galway or Fingal, go back to his Department for a check or a validation, rather than for a decision?</p><p> I agree with the Minister that there is a need for HAP, as we have discussed previously, but we are over-reliant on it.  Some &euro;152 million was spent on payments under the scheme in 2017.  That figure will increase to &euro;301 million this year.  Does he have a projection for next year?  The amount we are spending on HAP has doubled in the past year.  If we compare the amount spent on payments under the HAP scheme with the figure for capital expenditure, we will see that if the rates keep increasing as they are, we will spend almost &euro;1 billion a year within four years.  We are creating a monster, out of necessity in many instances.  If we do not increase supply to move people out of HAP and into public housing and permanent housing, we will have a big problem.  If new mechanisms are not found, the HAP budget will keep eating into our capital budget.  The figures are astounding.  Has the Minister a view on how we can put more money into capital rather than current expenditure?  Payments under the HAP scheme are putting phenomenal pressure on the Department and on the Exchequer.  I disagree with the fundamental plank of Rebuilding Ireland, which is that someone's housing need can be met under HAP.  Perhaps things are different in the case of long-term secure leases, but we have a problem in cases of 12-month leases.  We should not remove people who get HAP tenancies from the main housing list and put them on a transfer list.</p><p> The LDA-----</p></speech>

I will run through them as quickly as I can in the time available.  I have spoken on the point that was made about passing the buck.  I recently communicated with local authorities about emergency accommodation.  That intervention was about looking at the number of families in hotels without seeing a corresponding programme to get them out of hotels and into hubs.  I have been defending local authority builds for the past 14 months and I will defend them again today.  Some local authorities are doing great work and some are not.  I had similar concerns last year about how our build trajectory was going, but we were just 8% off our build target at the end of the year.  We exceeded every other target we had in areas such as acquisitions, leasing and voids.  A significant volume of work was done.  Along with my officials, I will continue to drive the local authorities until the end of the year to ensure we hit our targets for this year.</p> <p>  I am looking at raising the cap on the one-stage approval process.  It has been suggested that everything is too slow in the Department.  My officials work incredibly hard.  When we are building houses, they have to be safe.  They have to be planned well.  People have proposed certain shortcuts to me.  They have said that every social housing scheme should be designed the same, on the basis that everything could be done much more quickly if there was just one design plan.</p></speech>

The point I would make about slowness is that if we are building 20 homes, we need to ensure they are still standing as safe and secure structures 70 years from now.

If they were all approved by the credit committee, we would have almost exhausted the first tranche of &euro;200 million.  A significant number of loans have been approved by the Housing Agency.  The problem is with the credit committee.  That is why we are assessing what is happening.  Perhaps drawdown is not a fair measure.  This was not opened until February.  As anyone who has ever bought a home will be aware, a great deal of time can be lost after mortgage approval is secured while one goes looking at houses and gets into the process of going "Sale Agreed" and everything else.  It can be six months before the mortgage is drawn down.</p></speech>

It does the due diligence and the financials.  The credit committee makes the decision.  We need to make sure each credit committee applies the rules in a consistent way when it is making decisions.  There is a need for consistency among local authorities.  This is not the only area in which they are inconsistent.  We can achieve consistency with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan because it is a simple and straightforward product.  I have had meetings on it.  An independent assessment is happening now.

It is not sustainable to rely on HAP for our social housing supports, as we are doing at the moment.  That is different from suggesting we are not meeting people's housing needs.</p> <p>  I heard that there was a good programme on the repair and lease scheme the other night.  I did not see it, but I understand it covered some properties I have inspected.  The scheme is important in the context of the discussion we have been having about vacancy.  I do not know whether the committee has had an opportunity to debate the latest Indecon report, which is incredibly interesting.</p><p>The true level of vacancy in Dublin is 0.6%.  That is not based on the numbers provided by the CSO, which include houses for sale or rent, those undergoing renovation and the homes of people in nursing homes.</p><p> The repair-and-lease scheme is fantastic but its criteria are restrictive.  To qualify, a person must have a second home in which he or she does not live and which is in a state of significant disrepair such that it cannot be inhabited.  The person must not be able to afford its renovation and must be prepared to lease it for at least five years.  It is a good scheme but the number of people who can avail of it might not be as significant as we first envisaged.  I have been speaking to Deputies from outside of Dublin regarding vacancies in their local authority areas which are near or a short commute to urban centres and what we can do in terms of pairing people up with such vacancies.  There is something else at which I am looking relating to the repair-and-lease scheme because it is a good programme but is not delivering in the way we thought it would.  It is possible that there is less demand for the scheme than we anticipated when we originally looked at the numbers two years ago.</p><p> On the Land Development Agency, the general scheme of the legislation will be published later this year.  The agency is already working.  It has been set up under a different Act on an interim basis in order to be able to work on the sites that have been identified, negotiate with Departments and get additional sites into the pipeline.  In answer to a parliamentary question on the issue in the D&aacute;il this morning I stated that we can have it established by Easter of next year.  It will then move to its second phase of funding, which is the capitalisation under ISIF.  It will receive &euro;20 million in initial capital under the urban regeneration fund to allow it to fulfil its role between now and then.  I look forward to an exciting debate on the legislation.  People have differing views on the matter.  It is a very important development.</p></speech>

We must continue to drive action on all of those things.

One might define it as having families in emergency accommodation.  Very regrettably, there will be families in emergency accommodation for quite some time to come because we must build houses or find houses on the rental market for them.  At the same time, we must strengthen the rental market to try to prevent from people falling into emergency accommodation.  It will take a few months to pass laws in that regard and for those laws to bed down.</p> <p>  There are many ways to measure the crisis.  One could measure it in terms of housing output.  Some 4,500 new homes were built in the last quarter.  At a steady state and disregarding pent-up demand we require approximately 6,000 homes per quarter.  Taking pent-up demand into account, we probably need approximately 8,500 homes.  We are not too far off what we need to produce in housing supply per quarter.  We will reach a point in the coming year at which sufficient homes will be built per quarter to meet stable state requirements and pent-up demand.</p></speech>

That comment was made in the context of the jobs plan.  When Fine Gael entered office, we stated that we had a five-year programme to fix jobs in our economy.  There was a structural problem in the economy after coming out of the crisis years.  We are still dealing with the legacy of those years in our banking and housing sectors.  The Minister for Education and Skills was making the point that we stated it would take five years to implement that plan but it took less than that.  We did more in that time than we had said we would.  However, during that period, other parties in the D&aacute;il voted against us on every measure we took to create those jobs.  We are two years into Rebuilding Ireland and I am 16 months into my term of office.  I do not think the Minister for Education and Skills was saying it will take another five years to tackle the housing crisis but, rather, was comparing the five-year Rebuilding Ireland plan and how it is currently being judged to how the Action Plan for Jobs was judged two, three or three and a half years into it.  It was ultimately successful.</p></speech>

Fine Gael entered office when she was 18 and has been in power for seven years.  In spite of the woman having educational qualifications and ambitions for what she wants to do in life, she cannot afford to buy or rent and is forced to live at home with her parents.  She is sick of the discussion of this issue and is seriously considering becoming involved with the Take Back the City campaign.  Fine Gael has been in power for seven years, since the woman was 18.

We had 3,000 ghost estates.  We had a massive deficit which we had to correct to get us to a stable state.  If the Government proposed borrowing billions of euro at that time - which it would not have been able to do - to build housing, it would not have lasted in office.  In 2014, we exited the bailout and everyone said there would be a second one.  We are only now managing to correct that deficit.  In spite of that, two years ago we embarked on a very ambitious plan to rebuild housing and that is what we are doing.  We are playing catch-up.  This crisis was more than a decade in the making and we have gone from crisis to crisis in housing in this country for decades.  That is why this Government, as well as implementing immediate responses to the crisis, is also planning for the long term through proposals such as Project Ireland 2040 and the Land Development Agency in order to ensure that no future generation suffers from the kind of crises that afflicted the past two generations - which I straddle - while also helping to protect those generations to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p>  It is important that people in a functioning democracy protest, take to the streets and get outraged about what is happening in the Oireachtas because it means they are paying attention and they care.  Too often in our past, particularly in the years leading up to the crisis, too few people were paying attention inside or outside these Houses to some very bad decisions that were being made.  Since the crisis, we have had far greater political engagement as well as public engagement on political events.  Great changes have been brought about by the people through the referendums on marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Very important things have happened.  I hope that people continue to engage on this matter because it is important that we all understand where we have come from and where we need to go.</p></speech>

The people who will join the Raise the Roof protest outside of the gates of Leinster House at 12.30 p.m. next Wednesday have a simple and extremely modest demand that the capital spend of &euro;2.3 billion be doubled.

We cannot just cut off HAP and put it into building because those people would have nowhere to stay if we did so.  We will continue to support people with HAP and we will continue to build as well.

He brought a lot of clarity to people's minds on where we are with this crisis, what has been done, where we are on the road to fixing it and what the plans are to deal with it.  People are more interested discovering what is happening.  I have often said that houses take time to build.  We do not have enough of them but they are being built.  Some 4,500 were built in the last quarter, which speaks volumes.</p> <p>  I have a few issues I wish to raise with the Minister.  Does he have any plans for a tenant purchase scheme?  I am not convinced that such a scheme is necessarily the right way to go but it has been flagged.  What is the current position regarding such a scheme?</p> <p>  On HAP and the cap relating to social housing, I agree with what others have said on this.  In County Clare, it is &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;30,000 for a couple.  That needs to be increased significantly.  There are people who are falling beneath the threshold due to very small figures.  We need some flexibility.  In the first instance, the cap needs to be increased to a realistic level, especially considering the way rents are going.  We also need flexibility so that individual cases and circumstances can be taken into consideration, particularly where there are children with illnesses involved.  Flexibility at local authority level needs to be looked at and I do not know if there have been any moves to do that or if there are any plans to do so moving forward.</p> <p>  On Traveller-specific accommodation, I have a sense that local authorities are not making cases to the Department to purchase houses for large Traveller families.  There is a housing crisis within the Traveller community and it requires special attention.  There are families with six, eight and ten children in Traveller communities in local authority areas who are on the housing lists and need to be accommodated.  Again, flexibility is needed on the part of local authorities and the Department in the context of how the former can apply to the latter for funding to purchase houses for members of the Traveller community.  A much more focused approach is needed to deal with that.</p> <p>  I agree with vacant home taxes.  We need to adopt the stick more than the carrot in our approach.  The scheme to fix up and rent out properties is good but there are many properties out there where if there was a vacant property tax, the minds of the owners would be focused.  It should be looked at in the upcoming budget.  We also need to look at a levy for holiday homes and properties that are never rented out.  If an individual can afford to have a holiday home then he or she should be in a position to pay a special levy on that property which could then be channelled into the pot for helping to deal with the crisis that exists.  There are thousands of them out there.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about this in the context of something to which consideration should be given.  Not too many people advocate for more taxes but, in this particular case, the possibility should be examined.</p> <p>  On the turnaround time between local authorities and the Department, the objective is for 59 weeks from the inception of the discussions on a scheme of houses to getting said scheme shovel-ready.  In order to achieve that target, there has to be better synergy between local authorities and the Department.  There are too many instances of one side referring back to the other for more information and when schemes are sent up by the project teams and the various local authorities they are being filleted.  There should be some sort of standardised specification because local authorities are finding it very difficult to meet the 59-week target timeframe because of the amount of intricacies coming from the Department.  That is what I am being told by those at local authority level in any event.</p></speech>

During that visit, we visited a number of different sites to see what is happening.  It was good to see the proposals for housing there.</p><p>We have been working on the tenant purchase scheme and will come to a conclusion on it very shortly.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy English, about it yesterday.  I understand the points that have been made by academics in this area, and that by the Taoiseach yesterday, in the context of losing social housing stock while we are trying to increase it.  However, I think the aspiration to home ownership must be there for all our citizens and we are trying to find the right balance.  The current scheme does not have the right balance.</p><p> As stated earlier, the Housing Agency is carrying out a review on HAP and social housing eligibility.  It should have been concluded by now but it needs a bit more time and will be done shortly.  In the Senator's own area of Clare, 1,272 homes have been the subject of HAP, with 22% available at discretion, which is a 20% uplift and amounts to 283 homes.  On average, the rate of discretion was 18.7%, which is quite high as compared to other local authorities, and that will contribute to pressures around HAP in the area.  I have a more detailed report which we gave to the committee and which I am sure the Senator has on file.</p><p> We are encouraging local authorities to pay more attention to Traveller-specific accommodation.  A number of families are in emergency accommodation - too many.  Local authorities are having problems in placing families owing to objections being raised locally and we are trying to deal with that as best we can.</p></speech>

There does not seem to be any movement on the part of the local authority to purchase a house for them because what would be required is outside the thresholds.  I am looking for the Minister to direct local authorities to be flexible and to think outside the box.  If a property is &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 more expensive than permitted, if it accommodates a family of seven or eight people it should be looked at seriously.</p></speech>

The vacant home tax was something I wanted to do when I came into office.  When we looked at the detailed data ourselves, using people in the Department and local authorities who had advanced vacancy research, it was clear that it was not the low-hanging fruit we originally thought .  Apart from that, tens of millions of euro are available in the Department to open up vacant homes and get them used again, which is happening but not as quickly as we hoped it would.  The recent Indecon report recommended keeping the possibility of a tax under review and I will do that but there will not be a vacant home tax in the next budget.</p> <p>  A levy on holiday homes was proposed, which means more taxes and I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will appreciate the suggestion.  The LPT is already paid on holiday homes and there are no proposals for any increased levy.  A period of 59 weeks for shovel-ready sites is quite good for big developments.  As I said earlier, I am looking at stage 1 at the moment but 59 weeks for the planning, design and procurement for 40 or 50 homes is quite good.  There are 4,600 social housing homes under construction and 1,500 are about to go on site.  We have designed this with local authority chief executives and those who know what they are doing are working to a 59-week timeframe, though not every local authority is working at the same speed.  That is why we hold housing summits and why we have increased staff in the housing sections of local authorities by about 700 people in the past two years.  We are constantly approving more project officers and programme managers and they are being billed to our Department because we have committed to paying when an authority has a site on which it can build a lot of homes.</p></speech>

Some 14 local authorities have indicated that they wish to set up a HAP place finder process.  How many of these are up and running?</p> <p>  Has the Department received any applications for the mortgage-to-rent scheme?  Has there been any take-up of the rural housing relocation scheme?  Is it a worthwhile scheme?  Have any other ways been considered to facilitate relocations?</p> <p>  A review of rental pressure zones started last summer.  At what stage is that and when will we see some amendments to the criteria?  Did I miss something during the summer?  A number of landlords at the bottom end of the market want to stay in it but, because the rent they get is so low, have no option but to find ways to get out.  We could keep some landlords in the market with some subtle changes.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about repair-and-lease scheme and it is disappointing that it has not been taken up.  There might not be many vacant properties around Dublin but there is a huge number of them in all rural towns.  I do not know if the scheme was not sufficiently promoted or enough information given about it.  I see vacant properties every day in which we could have families living.  I do not know what we need to do to get to that position, though I know there are complications with the planning process and other regulations.</p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Walsh on his appointment and the next question is for him.  How many housing developments have progressed through the fast planning process?  How many have been granted and how many refused?  In respect of student accommodation, there was a target of just over 8,600 and there were 3,000 up to May this year.  Is the Department confident of hitting the target?  The Department said it would review the differential rent scheme for social housing but I do not see any update on that.</p> <p>  There is a four-stage process for the approval of social housing projects but how many have got through the process in 59 weeks?  What is the average time it takes to go through the four-stage process?  The quarter 2 figures for 2018 have just been released and 143 projects are at stage 1.  One has been there since 2013, two since 2014, 19 since 2015, 13 since 2016, six since quarter 1 of 2017 and 11 from quarter 2 of 2017.  A total of 36% of the total number of projects have been sitting at stage 1 appraisal for over a year.  I understand a review was carried out and a document published, which I could not find.  From my interaction with my local authority, I understand it can be tweaked.  Can the witnesses give me an update on that?</p> <p>  I have a question on the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040, relating to housing development, the housing crisis, the proposed regional strategy that is coming down the road and the impact it will have on my county and on Kildare and Meath.</p><p>I will give the example of Wicklow town which has invested more than &euro;100 million in critical infrastructure to allow housing development to happen, including the port access road, upgrade of the waste water treatment plant and the water services.  With all the infrastructure that is there, we do not need to go to the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, for it.  Our population target and the national spatial strategy was 26,000 and under a county development plan launched last year it was 26,000.  It will now be 17,000 under the roadmap that has been issued by the Department.  That means Wicklow town will not be able to grant planning permission for a home until 2026 and we have the critical infrastructure there already.  If that is what is happening with this roadmap, it needs to be revisited before the draft document is published.</p></speech>

Some 10,000 will be done this year but I cannot give the figure for funding for next year because it is part of budget negotiations.  I apologise for that.  It is not the case that I am trying to withhold the information but it is sensitive at the moment.</p> <p>  I will work backwards through Deputy Casey's questions.  In 2040 we will have 1,000,000 more people and 550,000 new homes.  The Land Development Agency will be a big part of that.  There will be &euro;11 billion in funding for 110,000 social housing homes.  The Deputy knows all of those numbers.  The population projections the county development plans have been based on since 2006 massively overstated the potential increase in population in terms of what will actually happen.  We have done very detailed and consistent modelling on what we think the projections will be over the next 20 years but what we have done in terms of designing the strategies for each part of the country is to take what we think the likely population increase will be and to take the massively overstated 2006 figures and come to a midway point.  We would use that midway point as a guide as we transition.  We will review our population targets every time there is a census to make sure that changes are happening in line with what we expected.  In 2021 we will be able to see if we are growing the way we thought we would or if we are growing more than we should be.  The key thing about Project Ireland 2040 is to grow in the right places rather than just growing.  If Wicklow can achieve the kind of growth that has been set for it in terms of it reaching its targets, that will be something we have not seen in Wicklow for quite a while.  Our officials continue to engage with each local authority and with the regional assemblies to make sure people understand what we are trying to achieve here.  It is different from before but we are putting in more than enough head room in case the increase in population is greater than anticipated in counties such as Wicklow.</p> <p>  On the four stages, if there are projects that have been ongoing for two to four years that are still at stage one or stage two then there is a problem with that project, not with the process.  Otherwise it would have progressed.  We have these checks and balances in place for a reason.  They are not just sitting at a desk somewhere-----</p></speech>

Somebody was telling me about a particular design scheme going back and forth 11 times between the Departments.  I launched those houses and they were fantastic so it was obviously a good thing that they went through the checks and balances that they did so that we could get these great new homes built.  There is a reason we do these things the way we do.  There is a reason we worked with local authority chief executives to get the process down to 59 weeks because we saw that it could be improved and there is a reason I am now looking at the threshold for the State approval process to give greater flexibility to local authorities for smaller schemes.</p> <p>  The differential rent review has almost been completed and it will be brought forward shortly.  I am confident we will meet our targets on student accommodation and it is quite important that we do because it takes pressure off other parts of the housing system.  On the fast track process, 5,443 residential units, 2,665 of which were homes, have been granted permission.  There were 2,778 apartments as part of that 5,443 and 4,479 student bed spaces.  A total of 1,575 residential units were refused permission which consisted of 906 houses and 669 apartments.  The fast track process has been very successful for getting large scale developments approved more quickly through the planning process which is great.</p> <p>  The repair and lease scheme or something like it will be great for the regeneration of towns and villages.  There is a reason it is not working in towns and the villages.  The urban and rural regeneration funds of &euro;3 billion for the next ten years under Project Ireland 2040 might be the way we get there.  I have been at some schemes that were privately led by people who are publicly known who have themselves taken on a property as their homes and encouraged a friend to do the same in the village.  They have then turned a building into a business hub or a place where start ups can go.  We have asked the local authorities to look at all of these initiatives to see how they can help.  As I explained earlier, the repair and lease scheme requires a particular set of conditions to exist for an individual who owns the property before they might wish to bring it forward.  We initially spoke about ten years for social housing and nobody came forward.  We brought it down to five years for social housing but in certain parts of the country there might not be enough of a demand for social housing so it would not work under that scheme so we have to examine if there is something else that we can do instead.  At the moment I have asked the Attorney General to look at the compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to see if we can CPO local vacant homes and then sell them.  We are not looking to CPO them for social housing but to sell them.  Some local authorities are doing it but not all of them so I am getting advice from the Attorney General and we will issue that advice to every local authority to use their CPO powers.  It is not a question of actually using the CPO but the threat thereof will get the house back onto the market for anyone who is able to buy it and that is what we want to achieve.</p> <p>  The rent pressure zone, RPZ, review was published in either May or June of this year.  That is on our website.  I made a note here that the potential loss of landlords is a concern because the Deputy said it as well.  I have to find a balance in everything that I do so that when we strengthen protections for renters we also have to make sure that we are getting more people in to invest in rental property.  This is not just people in Ireland buying one or two properties but institutional investors as well.</p> <p>  I have been talking to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, about rural relocation.  It is something that Deputy Harty brought to my attention in my first few weeks in the job.  The previous scheme was not that successful unfortunately because many people fell out of it and went back to the cities that they had come from.  Much can be done and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, brought a proposal to me that I referenced earlier on as well that officials are looking at whereby people could live a short commute to somewhere like Tralee in a house that is currently vacant but in decent condition and some money could be made available to refurbish the house and bring it back into use.  This would not necessarily be for people with social housing needs but for anyone and we are looking at that.</p> <p>  There have been 72 mortgage to rent scheme applications approved so far in 2018 but there are currently 845 in the system.  On the HAP place finder service, 23 are now in place following requests from local authorities.</p></speech>

I was involved in the set-up of that coalition about three years ago.  It arose from absolute frustration at the way in which the crisis was continuing to get worse and how nothing the Government did seemed to do anything except make it even worse.  It has continued to get worse since that point.  I do not wish to speak too much about the past because we have to speak about the future and solve this problem but it does not give me a lot of confidence when the Minister makes statements such as nobody could have predicted in 2011 that this was going to happen.  That frustrates the hell out of me and it suggests to me that the Minister and this Government have learned nothing because we did predict it and we said it very openly in the D&aacute;il in 2011 when the Department produced a document explicitly saying that there would no longer be big capital public housing projects.  Anybody who doubts that should Google the Department of Local Government and the Environment June 2011 housing policy and they will find it.  I remember holding a briefing in Buswells Hotel where I had to try to explain to journalists who did not know anything about this stuff at that stage what the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, was - we did not have HAP then but we had RAS.  I tried to explain to them that this statement meant that the Government was formally abandoning the direct construction of council housing in favour of outsourcing it to the private sector through RAS or a new similar scheme.</p><p>I will send the Minister the press statement I sent out that week, where we warned that this policy would cause a housing crisis.  One did not have to be a prophet to work this out, because even then there were 96,000 families on the housing list.  It was obvious that if the local authorities did not build council houses, there would be more demand.  Another point made by Members in the D&aacute;il the following year was that the decision to allow NAMA to unload vast amounts of property to vulture funds was going to be a disaster.  I really think the Minister should withdraw that statement and recognise that it was a mistake to make a formal decision to stop building council housing.  Would he agree in retrospect, even if he did not see it at the time, although some Members warned about it, that it was a mistake for NAMA to flog off all those lands and assets, given that we now see a very significant portion of the people who bought those lands and property assets from NAMA, sitting on land, speculating and flipping land and ratcheting up rents and property prices through their activities?  The reason it is important to make this point is that while the Minister now states that we are now going to ramp up the level of direct construction of council housing and so on, the proportion of social housing solutions in the Rebuilding Ireland plan that are dependent on the private sector still remains the overwhelming majority of those targets.  Approximately 90,000 out of 137,000 houses in the Rebuilding Ireland plan will be RAS, HAP or houses for leasing.  In what sense has the Government broken from the policy that was started in 2011, if that is what its plan is?</p><p> Does the Minister have anything to say about the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that is warning that not only will that not deliver secure social housing for people but will deliver very precarious housing from which people can be evicted and will cost the State an absolute fortune as the bill for housing under RAS and HAP to private landlords who we can see are jacking up rents month after month, gets bigger and bigger and becomes a massive hole in the public finances?</p></speech>

First they were predicting that NAMA had overpaid for the loans and it would make a massive loss on the &euro;32 billion in bond holder money it was covering.  They were also predicting that the ghost estate would have to be bulldozed, the recovery in jobs would take more than ten years and there would be a second bailout.</p></speech>

That was a decision that was made at the time.  I was a backbencher in government and I stood fully behind it.  It was the right decision to make when one looks at what has happened.  Unfortunately, there has been under-investment in housing.  The Fine Gael Government in 2011 did not make the decision to almost exclusively outsource the social housing bill to the private sector.  We are the Government which has corrected that decision and brought that responsibility back into the State and the allocation of taxpayer's resources.  That is why we sit here and talk about how we are going to spend &euro;6 billion.</p> <p>  I thought we would talk about more than &euro;11 billion in the national development plan for increasing the stock of social housing.  We cannot rely exclusively on one stream of delivery for anything or else we will become over exposed potentially in a future crisis.  It is very important that we do that.  When we look at increasing the stock of social housing and the 50,000 we have, a multiplicity of streams are available, direct build, local authority housing, housing bodies, acquisitions, regeneration and long-term leasing.</p></speech>

I want to ask another question.  Will the Minister outline the attitude of the Government to building council housing estates?  I just mention in passing that Mr. Brendan Kenny of Dublin City Council said that there was no doubt that it was quicker to build just council estates than to have to do this mix that the Minister insists on, because one had to get the money from one place instead of having to go to borrow money as well for the private and affordable bits.  Why does the Government have the attitude that one cannot just build a large council estate?  Will the Minister explain that to me?  If the Minister thinks there is a problem with building council estates, as we have in the past, is there a problem with building private estates, where there are loads of rich people all hanging out together?  To me it is just blatant snobbery.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to put things in context.  I know that Deputy Boyd Barrett did not want to do that.</p> <p>  I believe in mixed communities.  That is a principle for Fine Gael building into the future.  We want to build sustainable mixed communities.  We do not want to divide or segregate people.  We want to unite and support them.  That is what we are doing.  When one looks at the ambitions around the Land Development Agency, for the first time in the history of this State, any State land that is going to be brought forward for the development of housing will have locked into it at least 10% social housing and at least 30% subsidised housing but across the portfolio of lands, 50% will be social and subsidisied-affordable.  It does not mean that other 50% will not be affordable.  It will depend on where it is being built and the point in time in the market, and we are talking about the next 20 years.  We are bringing forward massive tracts of public land that might never have been made available for housing for housing for the general public.  That is a good thing and that is what Fine Gael is doing in government.</p></speech>

I have a few follow-up questions.  The homelessness figures for this month and last month are now on the web and I have had two quick reads of the reclassification report.  My questions are factual and we will come back to the substance of this at a later committee meeting.  There has been a decrease in the number of adults in emergency accommodations from July to August of 190 and there has been a decrease of the number of children in emergency accommodation by 80, according to the figures published.  If I am reading the reclassification report right, it states that somewhere between the survey and now, an additional 741 adults and children have been recategorised as not being in emergency accommodation.  The Minister in his opening remarks said there were 238 new presentations in August and 83 exits.  I believe that is in Dublin as opposed to State-wide.  Can the Minister confirm that at least some, and possibly all, of that 270 decrease is as a result of the recategorisation of people as not being homeless because of his view of the accommodation there are in?  I know he does not have the exact number but some, and possibly all or much, of the 270 decrease in the number of adults and children is as a result of reclassification rather than exits from homelessness in August.  Ms Mary Hurley does not have the detailed breakdown of the months that those 741 came out but she has given a commitment to provide us with that information when she has it, which would be useful.</p> <p>  My second question relates to categorisation.  I will not get into the politics of that, as we will do so at a later stage.  In the Minister's recategorisation report, his argument is that he discovered there were families in accommodation that was owned, rented or leased by the local authority and, therefore, in his view, that is not emergency accommodation, and I understand his argument.  How are those units different from hubs or the likes of Tallaght Cross, which are owned or leased by the local authorities?  I am not clear on how the Minister is making that distinction.</p> <p>  The RTB made an important determination in respect of student accommodation a few weeks ago.  I have just emailed it to the Minister and I do not want him to comment on the determination now but he needs to pay attention to it.  It was one of the court cases in Galway regarding the significant rent increases that are occurring now.  While the determination found that the individual who took the case did not have standing because they were not in a tenancy at the time and, therefore, not subject to the RPZs, there were two important findings in it.  The first is that it states the student licences that exist in that location are regarded as tenancies by the RTB and, second, that if somebody had a tenancy now that was subject to something more than the 4%, they would be covered and protected by the RPZ legislation.  I ask the Minister to study that determination with his team in advance of whatever he and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, will bring forward at a later stage regarding student accommodation because that determination has a material bearing on the conversations we have been having.  It basically states that student licences in purpose-built student accommodation are regarded under the terms of the Residential Tenancies Acts as tenancies and have the RPZ protection.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask about the four-stage process.</p><p>Finally I wish to raise the four-stage process.  The one thing I do not agree with is the idea that the process cannot be improved.  We heard from officials yesterday and many have spoken to officials about this previously.  An argument is made by some senior officials in local authorities that we could move towards a two-stage process.  We could have less duplication and back-and-forth between local authorities and the Department in regard to design and cost approvals.  That could shorten the process, particularly in light of the fact that the market ultimately determines the cost in the tender process, whatever about the cost approvals between the Department and the local authorities.</p><p> I talk about procurement rules with professionals and academics in the field.  They are far more expert about this than I am.  They strongly advise that within the legal framework in which the Government has to operate there must be a way for localised or regionalised framework agreements, like those that currently operate for maintenance contracts, to be applied to small and medium-sized social housing builds.  That would mean every single project would not have to go out to a new round of tenders.  We could have a group of contractors sitting on the shelf to whom works could be handed out.  Whether or not that is possible I do not know, and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts.  </p><p> We will have a dedicated session on the Land Development Agency, LDA.  The Minister knows my view.  I would like to see council-led mixed-income and mixed-tenure estates.  We do not disagree on the mixed-tenure element.  My one concern is that if, in the round, only 10% of what the LDA delivers is social housing, we will be unable to meet the level of social housing output that is required.  I would like to know the rationale for setting the figure at 10%.  This is a factual question, not a political argument.  I know that some sites might have more or less, but all of the documentation and commentary in the public domain indicates that the target is 10%.  Given the level of need and the ambitious targets for social housing delivery that the Government says it has under the national development plan, surely the minimum requirement should be more than 10%.  Otherwise, all we are going to have is 10% of the big sites and a small amount of infill on council sites.  Therefore we simply will not have the capacity to meet the limited targets that the Government has set for itself.  </p></speech>

I will address the recategorisation summary which I received earlier today and which has been published.  The report says that 741 individuals were recategorised.  It outlines the parts of the country where that has happened.  I do not know exactly when it happened.  I have said this before when this issue has arisen and in regard to the collection of homeless numbers in general.  We are not dealing with a perfect system for collecting and reporting data.  I am not criticising anyone in the local authorities by saying this.  The pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, is complicated to use and was never designed for this type of thing.  We have recognised that we could be capturing a lot more data as people come in so as to put even better preventative measures in place.  Work is now underway to do that and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, is helping, which I think is very important.</p> <p>  The number of presentations was down in July.  Some 238 presented and 114 were prevented.  The figure of 83 exits refers to Dublin only.  It is not a national figure.  The total number of people who are in emergency accommodation is lower than we thought it was.  It is 9,527 individuals, including adults and children.  I do not know exactly when the recategorisations happened so I cannot comment on that.  However, we are endeavouring to constantly improve what we do.  I have spoken about the publication of these numbers before.  I had a discussion with my officials about this.  Making sure that we are publishing accurate numbers is very important.  A huge amount of time and resources goes into that.  I need to work with the people in my Department and those in local authorities to see how we can improve the collection of data so that it is more efficient, better data is collected and the published numbers can be fair month-to-month comparisons.  It is very difficult to do that when recategorisation work is under way.  We have discovered people living in homes who are being counted in the wrong way. </p> <p>  In relation to the report itself, I note that there are three categories of home.  One is local authority-owned, one is owned by an approved housing body, AHB, and one is leased by the local authority or the AHB.  People living here have their own homes, their own doors and their own keys.  It is very different to a family hub.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has been in family hubs.  He knows the type of setting we are talking about.  </p></speech>

In Tallaght Cross people have an apartment and a key.  They have a nine-month, 12-month or 18-month licence agreement.  There are 65 of those units.  I am not looking to have a political row.  I am trying to understand the rationale.</p></speech>

In certain cases they are individual homes, so if I provided a list the public would be able to know who is living there.  When someone has a place to live for two years with their own door and their own key, they are in a home.  That is not a person in an emergency.</p></speech>

This is quite important.  My question is purely factual so I can understand the logic of the report.  Tallaght Cross contains 65 units that were purchased from a debtor to the National Asset Management Agency NAMA by South Dublin County Council.  South Dublin County Council took a decision to use them as emergency accommodation.  It is managed by T&uacute;ath Housing.  Families that present as homeless are placed in Tallaght Cross and have a licence agreement.  It is emergency accommodation.  However, that licence agreement runs for six, nine or 12 months, during which time T&uacute;ath works with them to place them in housing assistance payment, HAP, accommodation or a council home.  I am trying to understand the difference between that arrangement and the one by which Waterford County Council used some council stock to do something similar; or the arrangement by which Louth County Council used private rental stock to do something similar.  Can the Minister explain to me the difference as he understands it?</p></speech>

From my understanding it is not a hub.  It is not a precarious tenancy at all.  The landlord is the local authority.  It is an arrangement with T&uacute;ath.  People there are in their own homes and are going to be in their own homes for quite some time.</p></speech>

I refer to the decrease in the August figures by 270 adults and children.  There are 190 fewer adults and 80 fewer children in emergency accommodation.  Is it fair to assume that there is a possibility that some of those have not exited homelessness, but have been recategorised under the change in counting method?  People will see those figures published today.  If that is just a straight reduction and those people are now in full-time tenancies, that is good news.  However, if people have been recategorised and are still not in permanent tenancies that is something different.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018092700002#O01400"><p>This emphasis on permanent tenancies might be a bit of a misdirection.  Often the people who are actually in those homes the Deputy has identified are in more secure living arrangements than people in the private rental sector.  They will never exit those arrangements and move into homelessness.  They will never find themselves in emergency accommodation, because the local authority's duty of care as a landlord means that it cannot allow that.</p> <p>  The second point I would make is that the overall number of people in emergency accommodation is lower than we thought it was.  A significant number of people were in homes and not in emergency accommodation.  That is about as clear as I can be on it. </p> <p>  In relation to student accommodation, we are finalising the rent Bill at the moment.  We will publish the Bill and on Committee Stage we will bring an amendment addressing student accommodation.  We have time to work on that amendment.  The Deputy and I have had meetings on this.  I know how interested he is in it.  </p> <p>  I will also address the shortening of the approval process.  Though some people say summits do not achieve anything, one of the outcomes of the housing summit  is that we are going to agree an internal specification for social housing.  A standard internal specification will shorten timelines.  I will not agree a standard external specification, but why not agree an internal specification?  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Broin has visited some of the new social housing builds recently.  They are fantastic.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a proposed two-stage approval process.  We can do more with a one-stage process.  I will not say any more than that.</p></speech>

This is merely a factual query.  If a local authority wishes to have a tender arrangement with say, maintenance contractors, it puts out a general call, a bunch of applicants come in and it makes an agreement with three contractors, each of which has a contract for three years or five years.  The authority hands out the jobs as they come.   Is the Minister saying that the Attorney General has said that this type of arrangement is not possible for large-scale builds?</p></speech>

For example, there would be one for Dublin and one for the south west.  That would mean that not every individual job for an infill development of ten, 20 or 50 houses would have to go out to tender.  One could have the same process.  All I ask the Minister to consider doing, because again this is what the officials are telling us, is to have these on a regional basis rather than in the centralised way he has for new builds.  That could save a lot of time in terms of the tender process, and I believe that is worth exploring.</p></speech>

What we have been talking about for the 14 months that I have been in the job, and in addition to that, is to do even more on subsidised housing.  This a general and wider type of housing which has affordability.  When I came to the LDA and we were designing it, I wanted to ensure that as a big gun with big firepower, it would be delivering more on the affordable side.  It is up to every site to determine what mix will be obtained.  On certain sites it could be 30:20.</p></speech>

A number of the local authorities as well as Mr. Brendan Kenny from Dublin City Council have said that past 2021, if they meet all of the social housing output targets, land is going to become a real issue for them.  Some local authorities are in a better position than others.  My concern is that if we max out all the land on the existing social housing output programme, particularly through Part 8s, infills, etc., and if the Minister sticks to the 10% on the larger-scale sites that are LDA, then we are going to have a big problem post-2021.  This will be just in terms of meeting the Minister's own targets, which I believe are too modest in the first place.  All I am urging the Minister to do, and we will come back to this in the legislation, is to think very carefully about whether an overall 10% - we will get into an argument as to who does the development at a later stage - is in any way appropriate in terms of his obligations to meet his own targets in the national development plan up to 2040.  By my calculations, this is going to hamper the Minister in delivering even those targets.</p></speech>

I am going to have to ensure that I can meet the targets that I put into Project Ireland 2040.  The most important thing is that those home are delivered into the stock of social housing.  As long as I am in this job and responsible for this, I will make sure that those commitments that were put into Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, which are so important in terms of social housing delivery, are met by ensuring everything is done in tandem with that.</p></speech>

I can see where Deputy &Oacute; Broin is coming from with the 10%.  There is also a growing crisis in middle Ireland and the affordability of houses.  The only way to deal with that is to crack on with the construction of houses.  When the legislation is brought forward, we can tease this out in far greater detail.</p> <p>  Returning to the question I asked earlier about the housing aid for the elderly and so on, I asked would there be a supplementary budget this year for local authorities, based on other local authorities which may not have spent their allocation.  That is a worthwhile consideration.  There are certain counties where it would be very desirable if there was as a supplementary budget as in other years.  Would the Minister's officials be able to consider this?</p></speech>

We constantly do a performance review on what spending we are doing to see if we are on-profile to meet the allocation we have been given and that we spend the money  that we have for the year.  We must not overspend because then we would be in a difficult position, but we must not underspend when we are in a crisis.  If certain local authorities have not been able to utilise its grant as efficiently as we would like, we can allocate additional money to other local authorities that might have a greater call on it.  We are doing some work on this at the moment.</p></speech>

They are future-proofed by having wider doorframes and by having particular types of bathrooms that can be easily adapted or do not need to be, because of the way they have been designed, in being washrooms as well.  I am very pleased with some of the foresight local authorities have had in designing some of these houses.  That does take a little more time.</p></speech>

They are registered charities but they are paying rates on these charity shops.  Would the Minister consider an amendment to the upcoming legislation that would exempt the charity shops of proper registered charities from rates?  One would only be talking about a &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million of a loss to local authorities but this would greatly equip and enable those particular organisations to continue the good work they are doing.</p></speech>

In terms of build, the proportion of the output that is build, as against housing assistance payment, HAPs, rental allowance scheme, RAS, and leasing, is about 10%.  Is that not a fairly miserable output in terms of direct build?  Even if one includes the acquisitions, about 80% of the Minister's social housing output is still dependent on the private sector.  It does not really give much credence to the suggestion that we are weaning ourselves off dependence on a private sector, particularly given that the private sector, as we see, is jacking up rents.</p><p>That will clearly inflate the cost the State has to bear to pay for social housing that is dependent on this sector.</p><p> The next issues relates to that and this is where it comes down to the human level.  The Minister made the statement earlier that if the State is paying the rent of a person, his or her housing need is met.  Does the Minister honestly believe that is a fair comment in respect of the many people who find themselves in HAP or RAS arrangements and who then discover the landlord is pulling out of them, which is happening regularly?  Such people do not feel their housing need is being met because it is not; HAP is not secure.  One could argue that RAS provides some security, although we have had extreme difficulty in my area because landlords pulled out of RAS arrangements and the council said a new arrangement could not be found.  When somebody is in a precarious HAP arrangement and where there is plenty of evidence of landlords pulling out of them, how can the Minister make that statement?  Is it not a bit of an insult to the people who find themselves evicted and then in hubs or emergency accommodation, having supposedly had their housing need met?</p></speech>

There is a risk of people undermining genuine supports that can help people insofar as they may not take up a HAP offer and find themselves in emergency accommodation when they could have been in a rented home.  I have met many people who have been badly affected by this crisis.  HAP has not worked for some people but more than 40,000 tenancies have been created under the scheme, with 17,000 created last year.  HAP is working for tens of thousands of people and it is a good support.  It does not always work and, as in the private rental sector, not every tenancy will work out, but for the vast majority of people who are able to rent, it works for them.</p> <p>  We face challenges because there is not enough rental stock or enough time being given to people when a notice to quit is served.  There are issues around rent transparency and greater enforcement of RPZs.  We are trying to address those in the upcoming Bill and adding them to what we have done to try to strengthen and mature our rental sector.  HAP must continue until we build more homes and it is working for people.  The placefinder model is working for people and the uplifts are working.  There are 20% and 50% levels for homeless HAP, along with a deposit and the first two months of rent; these supports are real and they are making a difference for tens of thousands of people.</p></speech>

I do not encourage that as people must make those personal decisions that have an affect on their families.  It is insulting to tell them that if they make a decision not to put themselves through a similar experience, there is no right or entitlement to do so.  We will leave that pass.  As long as there is a reliance on HAP, we will continue to have a significant minority of people who will find themselves in trouble again and again.  That is indisputable.</p></speech>

It was the first question he asked.  If the output for the first six months of the year for local authority building was maintained for the rest of the year, it would not be good enough.  I know from my experience in the job last year how the programme was delivered over the course of the year and ramped up significantly quarter on quarter.  This year we will do ten times the number of local authority builds that we did only two or three years ago.  It is ramping up significantly and over the course of Rebuilding Ireland, we will increase the stock of social housing homes by 50,000.  That is real and it will help people.  It will take away from the over-reliance on HAP currently.  HAP will always be there and that kind of support in the private rental sector - using taxpayers' money to give people State support - will always exist but it should not be there to degree it is now.  We did not come from a perfect State and we came from a crisis to a crisis.  We cannot forget that or we will make the same mistake again in future.</p></speech>

My next question relates to my earlier contribution.  I will outline a concrete example, which is important.  It relates to Cherrywood.  That development could solve the housing crisis in the greater D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  At the weekend we had evidence it would not be able to do that because of the approach of the Minister and the Government over the past ten years.  NAMA sold it to Hines, a supposed developer, and at the weekend that supposed developer announced it would sell 73 acres of the land.  It has walked away with a fortune, although I do not know exactly how much that is.</p></speech>

The company bought the Cherrywood land from NAMA at a low price and now it is being flogged, with no houses built.  The company is walking away with a fortune and no houses have been built.  Does it bother the Minister that land acquired from the State is being flipped and the company will walk away with a massive profit on a site we could use for public housing?  Would that lead the Minister to conclude that perhaps the State should consider taking back the site?  There is a miserable 10% that we hope to get so we might at least take our 10% upfront in land and build on it ourselves so we are not reliant on Hines or the next developer who buys on it for speculation purposes.</p></speech>

It has such an importance for delivering housing.  When that flipping of land occurs, does it prompt the Minister to think we cannot afford to way to get the public housing we want on that land for whenever the next developer decides to build or not, given there is clear evidence of speculation on this land?  Should we not take as much as we can get now and build ourselves, or God knows what will happen on the site?  We might never get stuff or it might be drip-fed.  It will certainly be way down the line if we are dependent on whoever fancies buying the land for whatever purpose.</p></speech>

I can answer the question.</p> <p>  I am bothered when I do not see houses being built on sites that are ready for such building.</p><p>The Deputy knows there are more complications with this land than might perhaps be evident in his question, such as there being a number of landowners on a large site.  Significant investments have been made in that site.  It was not all taxpayer money.  Investments have been made and investments can be returned.  That is how these things work.  I am bothered when houses are not being built.  This is exactly why I brought forward the LDA.  We all need to park our ideology at the door whether one is on the left or the right.  The Deputy opposes the private sector building houses at all.  If we did not have people building houses-----</p></speech>

We have hundreds, if not thousands, of enterprising communities throughout the country.  There is a different picture in the country distinct from what the media state.  Much of what is said is true.  Communities have suffered grievous damage, but most of the communities I have visited are very strong in their determination to recover and become even more prosperous than before.</p> <p>  The enterprising community is a socio-cultural economic ecosystem which is very important.  I have evidence from all of the statements which I will go through quickly, but I do not have time to present it.  Our understanding is the enterprising community is a problem solver, a wealth creator and an organiser that shapes values, character, attitude and respect.  It is the most fundamental institution in the country.  It shares responsibility for services and facilities.  Families, schools and clubs want the best for themselves and their children and are prepared to work for it.  Problems are solved or prevented at source.  Social enterprises address many needs and opportunities.</p> <p>  I will use Dunhill Fenor Boatstrand Annestown, DFBA, Community Enterprises as a case study.  It is only one of thousands and I acknowledge that there are others better than ours.  I have been to them and spoken to the people involved.  I am using our community enterprise as an example because it is the one I know best.  </p> <p>  It was established in 1993 when there were four communities in the parish.  There was a Church of Ireland village, a fishing harbour and two internal agricultural communities.</p><p>There were three reasons for the start-up, one being that each of the two parts of the parish - Dunhill and Fenor - had lost a teacher.  The school in Dunhill went from having four teachers to three, while the school in Fenor went from having three teachers to two.  After the 1980s there was a declining population.  Emigration had reached a high in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell.  There was a lot of uncertainty at the time, much like it is today.  A key factor was the setting up of the LEADER partnerships, the county enterprise boards and community employment schemes.  That was fundamental.  It is coincidental that I am sitting here with three people involved in the LEADER partnerships.  The LEADER partnership was fundamental to us because it was the most prominent group to assist us in setting up in 1993.</p><p> Another key aspect was that in 1989 the local GAA club had built an indoor complex for IR&pound;350,000.  It cleared all of the debt within a few years by voluntary fundraising.  Looking at what had happened, within the parish a realisation dawned that there was a new capacity within it and the question was asked whether it could be used to deal with other important aspects such as job creation and schools.  Even though I am an avowed GAA person, I make the point that GAA clubs are representative, competitive, fearless and caring, as one can see at funerals or when there is a crisis in a parish.  The GAA is much more than a sports organisation.  I hope that after a number of things that happened recently, including the event at P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, people who have a different view understand what they are dealing with and how precious it is to the country.</p><p> As a result of the initiatives taken, the school in Dunhill has gone from having three staff members to nine, while the school in Fenor has gone from having two staff members to 17.  There was a special reason for this, but I was advised not to go into too much detail in this part of my presentation and that members could ask questions later.  </p><p> The population of the area has grown by 25% since 1993.  Some 250 jobs were created in the Dunhill Enterprise Centre since it was set up in 2000.  Currently there are 36 enterprises, with 75 jobs, in the centre.  We have achieved international recognition through Copper Coast, the only voluntary European Union and UNESCO global geopark in the world.  There are integrated constructed wetlands.  RT&Eacute;'s "Ear to the Ground" programme is spending all of today in the Dunhill wetlands.  There are also Fenor Bog and Dunhill Castle, the home of the Power clan.  The first Baron of Dunhill was Robert Le Poher in 1174.  There are also connections between Ireland and Newfoundland.  There is a special relationship between the south east - Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford and south Tipperary - and Newfoundland and last August 80 Newfoundlanders visited the area.</p><p> All of the results outlined have been achieved mainly against the odds, for example, during the financial crisis.  There is no broadband in the area.  We are expecting it to be provided within weeks, but we have been expecting it for the last year.  Currently we are within the blue area and hopeful and praying it will come our way.</p><p> The available supports are fragmented all over the place.  Nobody in this world can tell us or explain what supports are available for social enterprise because they are many and so varied.  Social enterprise has not yet captured the recognition of the Government, but we are hopeful it will shortly.  In my understanding of communities there has always been huge emphasis on tackling disadvantage.  I have no issue with this at all, but I do have a big issue when the provision of resources is ignored for communities that want to contribute.  We set up a social enterprise, of which I was chairman, in a most difficult part of County Waterford in Ballybeg.  I do not make any point about the allocation of resources other than it tends to be consumed by people trying to make up stories to claim disadvantage.  It was a disastrous approach to it.</p><p> I shall turn to Communities Creating Jobs which we set up in 2011.  We held three conferences in Dunhill, which were packed out.  People came from everywhere to them.  We said they would have to work together and it is now a national voluntary shared learning network.  It shares ideas, problems, solutions and resources.  It also helps communities to avoid mistakes, waste, duplication and displacement.  It identifies better ways and activates dormant resources.  It provides scaffolding and tools for communities that are starting off and gives them examples.  It simplifies complex documents and criteria and tries to help in removing barriers, difficult though that may be.  We also try to develop new pathways to success.  While we have been successful, we have not received support or recognition, which is a pity when one sees so many communities throughout the State that are working together and prepared to work together but cannot receive support.</p><p> Cumas&uacute; 22 is a jobs model we have developed.  The word "Cumas&uacute;" means empowerment.  The year 2022 will mark the centenary of the first Government.  We would like all of our communities to be able to look back over that 100 years and state, "We had ups and downs but look at where we are now."  We believe that can happen.  Cumas&uacute; 22 is made up of Communities Creating Jobs, the GAA and the third level education consortium.  Our starting point is a target of creating ten jobs in every community.  We have a local task group and a facilitator who has been given a six-month timeline to come up with all of the assets, enterprises and opportunities in the location.  That work is not to be interfered with by any agency.  They must be left alone to figure it out for themselves and say things to themselves that cannot be said when there is anyone else there and that includes Communities Creating Jobs.  We set the framework for them.  We have completed the first stage of an assets and opportunities audit report and it was all done voluntarily.  When we went to the GAA, it told us that there were three things it wanted from us.  That suited us down to the ground.  It wanted this initiative to be voluntary and community based.  It did not want any of the current officers to be involved because it wanted to leave them working for their clubs.  We were told that we could accept help from all previous officers, other business supporters and so on.  The second stage involves engaging with the relevant agencies to create jobs.  It is about three things - job creation, empowerment and the capacity building process.  I hope I have got that point across.</p><p> Above anything else, families are concerned.  It is a democratic imperative that the State be seen to partner with communities in regeneration projects, including in the areas of education, employment creation and housing.  In a parish local to me but in another county the postman has helped to identify 80 empty houses.  Nobody can understand why something is not being done.  The idea is to empower communities to use their social capital to build capacity, prosperity from ground up and engage people.  People believe they are the helpless victims of the recession and austerity measures when they should be active participants in changing the whole thing.  The idea is to solve and prevent problems at source and rebalance the population and the economy with the assistance of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and social enterprise.  To ensure we will not repeat what has happened in the United Kingdom or the United States of America, the process also aims to build respect between the institutions of the State, the political system and the communities in which people live.  It can be done this way.</p><p> I have ten recommendations that I will outline for the committee.  I recommend that the new social enterprise policy and implementation plan be facilitated from January 2019.  I ask all parties to back the plan.  Surely there can be no division between any party on it.  I suggest State, community and private supports be identified through the Department of Community and Rural Development.  If the Department looks to identify and describe all of the different resources available, it will know the extent of what is possible in communities.  </p><p> I recommend a Cumas&uacute; 22 pilot project in the south east.  We had a pilot project in County Galway and it was a great success, but, unfortunately, Mr. Joe McDonagh died.  He had been leading the initiative.  We want to have a second pilot project in the south east where we could have some influence over it to make sure it would work.</p><p> Another recommendation is alleviating community enterprise centre debt.  I have spoken to Enterprise Ireland and the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres as a number of community enterprise centres ran into difficulty during the financial crisis, but unlike private companies, they refused to give up and leave the debt unpaid.  Ours is one of them.  To this day we have never not paid our way.  However, we have a debt problem.  While it is not too serious and we are able to handle it, to give us a chance, we need support, as do other centres throughout the country.  I recommend that all parties include a reference to social enterprise in their manifesto or programme for Government for the next election.  </p><p> Another recommendation is access to fibre broadband countrywide.  I cannot tell members how many jobs and businesses we have lost because of the lack of it.  Our education centre wants to become a digital education centre and those involved in it are crying on my shoulder every day.  When I go there tomorrow, they will be after me again and want to know if there is any news on the provision of fibre broadband.  We are in the blue area and have been told that we will have it within a few weeks.  </p><p> I recommend that EU funds for social enterprise be maximised.  Mr. Barroso and Mr. Barnier established the business initiative in 2011.  They established a &euro;100 million fund for social enterprise.</p><p>We have heard nothing about it since but they are big people in the EU and they are completely in favour of social enterprise.  We ask the Government to get onto committees.  We know it is thinking of getting onto some of the committees it is not on, or it is willing to get on them.<br/><br/>I refer to a pilot social enterprise project in the North of Ireland where six communities in Waterford were involved with six communities in Antrim.  We spent three years with them.  The most telling statement came from a very strong woman, Angela Hayden, a nationalist and a superb person.  She said what she most got out of the project was the capacity to talk with her Protestant neighbours in a collaborative session.  The focus was not that she could talk to us down in Waterford, albeit she appreciated that, or that she could talk to other nationalists in the North of Ireland, but that she could talk to people she had never spoken to before in that setting.  The other thing we want is the opportunity to export to the North of Ireland.<br/><br/>I refer to credit unions.  We know our own credit unions.  Our own money is all tied up.  There is lots of money available.  While there are difficulties with the Central Bank and on the policy side, we ask if they would do something for the Irish League of Credit Unions.<br/><br/>I hope people will purchase and promote the <i>The Enterprising Community</i>everywhere they can.  The book will open eyes.  There will be European elections next year and the members of the committee will be down around the south east.  I invite every member to come to Dunhill and I will spend two hours showing them around until I have persuaded them of the huge potential of social enterprise.  It is a billion euro business or sector.  It is not a small thing where great volunteers are doing great work.  This is a billion euro business which includes universities, credit unions and a lot of things people do not associate with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.691" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to attend today.  We welcome the opportunity in circumstances in which the work of the Irish Local Development Network, or ILDN, is deeply entwined with the committee's objective of promoting viable rural communities.  The ILDN is the representative body for the country's 49 local development companies, 35 of which operate in rural areas.  We cover the whole country.  Last year, local development companies supported between them more than 15,000 communities and community groups and 173,000 individuals by delivering approximately &euro;330 million worth of programmes on behalf of the State.  Of these, over 11,000 community groups and more than 83,000 individuals were in rural areas.  Almost 6,000 rural dwellers found employment through the local employment service, of whom 3,116 moved to self-employment.  More than 5,000 people moved onto T&uacute;s community workplace schemes and almost 3,000 provided valuable services on the rural social scheme.  A further 1,500 plus are employed in social enterprises, which is what Dr. Cooke was discussing a couple of minutes ago, and these have been supported by local development companies.<br/><br/>The range of programmes delivered by local development companies allows for an integrated approach to rural development.  Examples include LEADER, the social inclusion and community activation programme, or SICAP, the local employment service, RSS, rural recreation and walks schemes, social enterprise supports, social farming, T&uacute;s, education and child care and public health programmes.  In addressing rural development, we will focus today on five key principles before inviting questions and discussion from the members.  Some of my colleagues might come in at that point.<br/><br/>The first key principle involves the one-stop shop approach and innovative brokerage.  Rural communities are increasingly confused and frustrated by the plethora of fragmented funding schemes which often have contradictory qualifying criteria and are released in an unplanned, <i>ad hoc </i>manner.  Given their working methodology, local links and reputation, local development companies, or LDCs, are well-placed to signpost and co-ordinate rural and community development funding on a one-stop shop basis, similar to what LEOs do with enterprise funding.  LDCs bring the added value of 25 years' experience of animating rural communities to participate and lead their own development.  As a result of their work on the LEADER and other programmes, LDCs have a recognised experience of supporting, transferring and leading innovation in their regions.  The ILDN proposes to formalise that innovation brokerage as part of its range of animation services and recommends that there should be one integrated rural development strategy for an area for a five-year period which covers LEADER and other national rural development programmes.<br/><br/>The second key principle involves community-led local development, or CLLD.  The community-based, bottom-up methodology of LDCs is key to their effectiveness.  This includes an emphasis on pre-development work, community animation, building the capacity of individuals and communities, as Dr. Cooke, again, mentioned earlier, accepting the individual's starting point and customising appropriate local solutions.  The positive impact of LDCs in independent reviews of SICAP, LEADER, local enterprise schemes and the back-to-work area enterprise allowance testifies to the effectiveness of the approach.  CLLD aims to promote integrated approaches of territorial development and offers potential savings and increased effectiveness in rural policy.  The added-value of CLLD manifests itself in improved social capital and governance and enhanced social impacts.  We welcome the fact that the EU is seeking to broaden the uptake by member states of the CLLD approach and hope that the Irish Government will incorporate CLLD across all EU programmes from the next round in 2020.  Doing so would provide the kind of bottom-up enabling environment needed for meaningful social and economic development.<br/><br/>The third key principle involves recognising the specific features of rural areas.  Rural social structures are changing and we must recognise the features of rurality that require specific solutions and be prepared to act on them.  For many rural dwellers, the choice is to migrate, remain unemployed or underemployed or create his or her own job.  That is why the impact of supporting more than 3,000 people into self-employment last year is so significant.  I ask the members to imagine the headlines if one employer created over 3,000 jobs in rural Ireland.  In addition, the local employment services run by LDCs placed 5,700 people in employment last year.  As that service is operated in just a handful of rural counties, what is needed now is a national community-based, not-for-profit employment service which encompasses and recognises the nature of rural unemployment, underemployment and seasonal employment.<br/><br/>I move to a subject which Dr. Cooke covered in detail, namely, social enterprise.  The 2013 Forf&aacute;s report on social enterprise estimated that just 1.25% of the labour force worked for social enterprises in Ireland.  The report stated that if Ireland's social enterprise sector were to approach average or mean EU levels of output or the goal set by the EU under the Europe 2020 strategy, at least 65,000 jobs could exist in the social enterprise sector here.  With Dr. Cooke, the ILDN welcomes the forthcoming publication of a national strategy on social enterprise.  The strategy must ensure that the appropriate resources and supports are made available to the potential social entrepreneurs in order that the potential identified by Forf&aacute;s can be realised.  I echo in that regard Dr. Cooke's call for the Government to seek greater EU resources for this area of investment.<br/><br/>I turn to social inclusion.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has responsibility for SICAP, the national social inclusion programme.  This a is a key programme to enable local development companies to employ staff and operate many of the other State programmes for which they receive no management fees.  SICAP has suffered very deep cuts in the past eight years and requires a significant restoration of funding if it is to retain professional staff who have build up 25 years' experience.<br/><br/>The fourth key principle involves the current LEADER programme processes.  All parties to the current LEADER programme have acknowledged the severe difficulties in its effective delivery.  Notwithstanding the ILDN's anticipation of the problems introduced at design stage, member companies have worked closely with DRCD and LCDCs to ensure accelerated roll-out.  Credit must be given to the Minister and officials for realising in 2017 that the programme was in crisis and implementing changes to the operating rules.  While these changes were the minimum needed for the programme to function, more radical reforms are necessary to truly liberate the programme and should be considered in the context of the next programme.  These reforms should include securing block exemptions for LEADER from state aid regulations, the facilitation of LAGs and LDCs to have full access to all the priorities of rural development programme funds, and a more facilitative approach to the inspection and monitoring regime which recognises that LEADER is about innovation and area planning and which acknowledges the risk element to that work.</p><p>My colleague, Mr. Rice, can address the issue of the autonomy of LDCs as local action groups delivering LEADER and how the change from the previous programme has elongated the supply chain of LEADER funding to the detriment of rural communities and businesses.</p><p> It is imperative that all parties learn from the current programme.  The new RDP should provide greater flexibility for LEADER to be implemented as a genuine bottom-up approach to rural development.  We also encourage the Government, the Department and this committee to ensure that the maximum LEADER funding is availed of through the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Overall, we will seek to secure a minimum of &euro;400 million for the next LEADER programme. </p><p> My final point relates to smart villages.  The Cork declaration in 2016 emphasised new approaches to overcoming the digital divide between rural and urban areas and to develop the potential offered by connectivity and digitisation of rural areas.  Emphasis was given to the need for integrated approaches and the interaction between different policy fields in view of increasing complementarity and coherence.  The concept of smart villages relates not just to being technology smart but finding ways from the bottom-up to avail of opportunities and address challenges across the whole range of rural life, including service provision, enterprise development and culture.  There is much more potential in this approach and with local development companies implementing it, my colleagues will be happy to elaborate on this area.</p><p> In conclusion, we again thank the committee for its invitation and welcome the opportunity to discuss these and other relevant issues the members of the committee might wish to discuss.</p></speech>

The enthusiasm of Dr. Senan Cooke is contagious for all of us.  I live in a rural parish and some of his comments struck me strongly.  Our parish has a three-teacher school and, on 30 September, we will not have enough pupils to maintain that number.  Over the summer, we ran a campaign to get new families to come to the area.  We found new families who were interested in coming to live in the parish but we do not have houses for them.  One issue in Leitrim and in areas where there is poor land is that we cannot get planning permission to build new houses, and much of the old accommodation is not suitable.  There are many issues confronting people in rural Ireland but the primary one is getting energy back into the community, trying to find employment for people and finding a sense of purpose for the future.  That has been missing.  I commend the work Dr. Cooke has done.  It is refreshing to hear somebody say that we should not look at our disadvantage but at our advantage.  We need to try to turn that around.</p> <p>  I am also conscious that for any sector of society to reach its potential, it must be at a certain level.  We must get a certain platform under it, and the problem in many areas is that they are without that platform.  They are below the waterline, as it were, and they need assistance to try to get on their feet again.  Rural communities need some encouragement and help to lift themselves up.  Investment is the key in many of those areas.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Reilly for his contribution.  I am conscious of the work LEADER has done in many areas.  I know Ms Martina Ealey well because the old Arigna LEADER programme covered Leitrim before the divide, which was a huge backward step.  The way it is set up now has not worked for communities, and that was acknowledged in the presentation.  We have often discussed that with the Minister and, in fairness, he acknowledges that changes need to happen.  He made some changes but, as Mr. O'Reilly said, they have not gone far enough.  The issue I wish to discuss is social enterprise and communities coming up with ideas to move things forward.  Many years ago, I was at an event which was attended by a Minister.  People were talking about co-operative employment and communities coming together to do things.  He made the quip that "Co-op is no op".  Basically, if the private sector does not do it, it does not work.  That concept still exists in large sectors of the establishment, the Government and the way in which things are implemented, whereby if an individual is not prepared to go out and take the risk, it will not work for communities.</p> <p>  We must change that, and the LEADER programmes have largely been trying to turn that around.  As Dr. Cooke said, we must recognise that this has potential and can deliver jobs that are sustainable in the long term.  However, we must change the mindset.  Mr. O'Reilly put forward suggestions for what needs to happen, but what are the core ones?  If he could pick three core changes that would turn this around and that he could put in place tomorrow, what are they?</p></speech>

It gives us an opportunity to review current mechanisms for delivering for our rural communities.  I especially welcome Dr. Cooke, whom I have known well for almost 30 years.  He is from a neighbouring parish.  He mentioned the resilience of the community he comes from and the passion and commitment in it.  In addition, we heard about the initiative and volunteerism of Dr. Cooke and like-minded people in that area which have turned a small rural community that was declining in numbers into a vibrant community of which not only they but also the people of Waterford are proud.  It is held up as a example of community and social enterprise on many fronts.</p><p>I attended the launch of his book, <i>The Enterprising Community,</i>and it offers examples around the country of communities helping themselves.  It identifies the challenges they originally faced and analyses how they went about reinventing and reinvigorating their communities.  It is a roadmap for a community to regenerate itself.  Dr. Cooke acknowledged that the LEADER group assisted the Dunhill and associated communities in starting on that road, and I acknowledge the fabulous work that has been done for over 25 years in communities throughout the country.  However, a number of challenges have been identified and this is where the committee can be beneficial to the work of those who made the presentations.  The challenges must be identified to help communities unlock their full potential and identify ways they can help themselves.</p><p>There is great resilience in rural Ireland.  We often hear the negative stories but the people who reside there are resilient, innovative and committed.  We must find ways in officialdom, as policymakers, to assist these people to achieve their potential by exploiting whatever assets are available to them.  The first asset is the people.  The second is the natural assets that surround them, be they walkways, greenways, mountains or rural areas.  We must identify ways to exploit natural assets and this where the strength of local LEADER groups comes in.  I am aware of the work they do on the ground.  They are aware of the enablers and the natural assets in their communities.  Mr. O'Reilly identified problems where changes are required, whether that is funding, flexibility or identifying ways that communities can exploit their full potential.</p><p>Dr. Cooke mentioned that there is a lack of support for the CCJ, the voluntary network.  Could he elaborate on what he means?  Is it in terms of administration, financial support or recognition by those in authority - and I include in that the local, regional and national authorities?  What does he mean by a lack of support?  He has worked on a successful model that he wishes to roll out throughout the country and he is calling for further support to try to enable that.  What types of support he has in mind in order that the committee can further analyse that?  That would be a worthwhile exercise.</p><p>I have a question for the LEADER groups.  They identified areas that we need to improve and how we can improve access to the various EU programmes, increase funding and so forth.  We recognise that.</p><p>Why are some rural communities far more successful than others?  That is probably a simple question but it goes to the root cause of success in various rural communities.  Why are some communities so successful and why do others seriously struggle?  What can we do, as policymakers, to assist the Irish Local Development Network in helping rural communities?  What policy changes are required and what do we need to do to assist those communities?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#F00200"><p>I thank those who have contributed this morning.  It is interesting to hear what has been going on in other communities.  Dr. Cooke's story is known the length and breadth of the country.  It is a fabulous project.  I attended a community council meeting in Goleen in Mizen Head in west Cork last Monday night and we were talking about it, believe it or not, because we had purchased a bit of ground next to our community centre and are thinking of ideas.  We might visit Dr. Cooke's project.  If it is being talked about in Mizen Head, it is most certainly being talked about throughout the country.</p> <p>  I come from a rural community in a mainly rural constituency in west Cork.  Eight businesses in my constituency have closed in the past two weeks.  A school can close due to a fall in population.  I know we can identify many houses that are empty in our community, particularly in the towns.  We have been pushing for the regeneration programme to be expanded into areas like west Cork.  The programme is not working and is not moving in our direction.  I find that communities are pulling out all the stops but they face a gale.  That is the difficulty.  The change in the LEADER programme was detrimental to west Cork.  I can see the evidence in the trail of destruction it left, which we predicted but nobody listened.  Much of this comes within the remit of the local authorities.  I contacted my local authority about six weeks ago on a broadband issue and received a response yesterday.  That tells us where things have gone in this country.  It took six weeks to respond and the response was totally contradicted by the information I received from Eir.  I think the whole thing is lost.  It has lost touch with reality on the ground.</p> <p>  Local communities are fighting very hard to come up with projects and turn things around because nobody wants to lie down.  People in Drimoleague recently got a grant to paint the village, which has gone through tough times.  It is now rejuvenated and bright and the council is resurfacing the village roads.  Things like that are small but they are very important to communities and have made a major change in Drimoleague.</p> <p>  Without easier access to LEADER funding and funds that will continue to regenerate communities, things will go in only one way, unfortunately.  If we keeping closing services such as post offices, we will knock the very life out of towns.  I come from Schull where the local bank was closed.  The second biggest shop in the town closed within 12 months with the loss of 17 jobs because people were going to the neighbouring town to do their banking and no longer came into Schull.  The same will happen if post offices close.  There is no forward thinking by the Government.  A small subsidy needs to be given to postmasters because they cannot live on the minimum wage.  That would be a long-term gain for a town or village.</p></speech>

Communities Creating Jobs, CCJ, was set by Dunhill Rural Enterprises Limited in Skibbereen following the conferences we had.  We have a national organisation.  A colleague of mine, Dr. Yvonne Crotty from DCU, is at the back of the room.  What we want is so small, it is unreal.  Dunhilll Rural Enterprises, a voluntary organisation, has invested at least &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 every year on items such as an office, phones and copying.  That has kept CCJ going on an administrative basis.  We have carried that cost.</p> <p>  The first thing we need is for our model to be interrogated and, if possible, piloted.  It would be the second pilot because when we went to Galway, we worked with three parishes or communities and identified 116 jobs which would be provide by a business coming back from Boston, another coming back from Dublin and another coming back from London.  Joe McDonagh, who was the chairman of the sub-committee in Croke Park, died and the project went off the rails, even though Enterprise Ireland had backed it with &euro;13,000, GMIT had put &euro;6,500 into it and the GAA had put &euro;6,500 into it.  The whole thing fell apart.  As we were in the south east, we were unable to do anything about it because of our distance from Galway.  However, with a second pilot and some help for administration, the model could prove itself.  We believe it will transform society and the economy.  People can look at us and ask what we are on about but I can tell members that if our model, which did not belong to me but to people, is implemented, it will transform local communities.  Of course, it will do nothing without LEADER, local authorities and everyone else.  I have spoken about two small steps that would make a major difference.  </p> <p>  With regard to why schools turn things around, four individuals in Dunhill guaranteed a &euro;400,000 loan - &euro;100,000 each from their own pockets.  They went down to the credit union, borrowed the money, bought a field, built 40 homes for young families, saved the schools and created a new dynamic in the parish for business people.  The GAA club and the school were given a big lift.  It was one of the most top-class things that ever happened.  The GAA club set up a draw in 1989 that raised &pound;1.5 million.  It got five clubs together to share the costs and each one maximised the profits.  They were able to maximise the profits while sharing the costs in five ways.  We got &pound;30,000 from Noel Davern out of a total of &pound;350,000, and the five clubs, Dunhill, Roanmore, Kilrossanty, Dungarvan and Lismore, raised the rest.</p> <p>  I have been around the country.  There is nothing people are not prepared to do.  I was speaking on Kilkenny-Carlow community radio.  People from Danesfort, which is near Kilkenny, asked whether they could talk to me.  I told them to come down and I thought one person would come.  I found seven people outside the door.  They told me about their plan, which would cost &euro;1 million.  Was there any worry about whether they would do it or not?  It did not enter their minds.  Of course, they would do it and they would get the money from whatever source, including the community.  Another GAA club opened an all-weather pitch that cost about &euro;400,000.  It has now spent &euro;1.5 million.  The treasurer told me it only owes &euro;150,000 of that and set out what the club was going to do next.  Everyone says rural Ireland is dead and gone when the complete opposite is true.  It has massive potential, provided it receives help from LEADER and the local councils.</p><p>There is massive potential and social enterprise would be a billion euro sector if it got the chance.  I have spoken to the different parties in Waterford, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party and the Independent Deputy and Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan.  I am trying to chase them and to see if they will agree to get the new policy through.  I told somebody in the hotel this morning that to do so would unleash a massive amount of resources and energy that will transform this country, which we sorely need.  We need our communities to motor ahead and not to worry about Brexit, Trump and all the other things that happen in the world about which we are not happy.</p></speech>

I am being facetious, of course, because it is very complex.  It comes down to empowerment, support with resources, and confidence.  There is an induction loop into which all these things feed.  Deputy Martin Kenny asked us for the three most important things.  There could be 30 things but broadband would be at the top of the list.  People compare it with the introduction of electricity but I think it is more serious even than that.  It is like water, that is, running water and wastewater treatment.  It is not just a question of what broadband to have and we know that all salespersons say theirs is the best system.  We need future-proofed broadband in rural areas so that we can compete with urban areas at the right price.  The LEADER programme has a role to play and the national broadband is in stream so we do not want to compromise that.  We have a broadband team in our programme but we are constrained in what we can do.  Very low amounts can be spent on capital, with a maximum of &euro;20,000 on a single project.  As members will imagine, that does not do an awful lot.  We would welcome the opportunity to do something in the blue areas where State money is not going and we have made a proposal to the Department on that basis.  We would like to lend a hand and we should be empowered to do so.<br/><br/>There needs to be some form of social framework to let social enterprises help themselves, be they community shops or enterprise centres.  There are a number of streams of funding which are used by community enterprises in an <i>ad hoc</i>way.  As Dr. Cooke said, people will do whatever they can to get resources to make things happen.  Often they are not helped and the rules do not help them in getting resources.  If the commercial sector is pulling out of rural Ireland, as it increasingly is, the only way it will be addressed is by social enterprises and communities in rural Ireland stepping up to the mark.  If people are pulling out commercially there is a reason for it and that is that they cannot make enough money.  The only way we can do this is on the basis of supports.  The community undertakes to take on some burden and the State also agrees to do it.  That will mean an expansion of the current schemes and the dedication of long-term funding.  There are real jobs in that and real opportunities to add value.  We have been a bit mealy mouthed about this.<br/><br/>We are talking about community empowerment and Mr. O'Reilly mentioned a number of things which we have been supporting over the years.  We have commissioned research on social enterprise and a conference is taking place today on social enterprise in local development companies.  It is becoming a fashionable concept but it needs vigorous support at a tactical level and it needs people to ask what we need.  We will work with the committee on that and we have a lot of ideas, though we are not looking for them to adopt them wholesale.  We would like to set up a conversation with the committee on these issues.  There is a lot of synergy.<br/><br/>We have been very constrained in the LEADER programme and broadband is an example of this.  We understand that the broadband plan is technical but we feel we are not being given the chance to do all we can do.  Some of us have 26 or 27 years experience in the rural and local development sector and we have internalised a lot of the knowledge that is out there.  We see ourselves as facilitators of the community but not as having to do things for the community.  We feel we are not, however, being allowed to spread our wings and do it.<br/><br/>I am lucky enough to work for a company which is one of only four independent local action groups, LAGs, in the country and I can feel the pain of my colleagues when we talk about projects.  I had a meeting yesterday with three other companies on a simple project based on community shops, for which we were hoping to appoint somebody to do some work.  I thought it would take a month but it took six months.  That was because they had to go through the local community development committees, LCDCs, and there were two in one county so it went around the track to be signed off.  What is the point of that?  I am happy that we are an independent LAG.  It does not get us out of all our problems but it does mean that we are responsible for our own fate, the captains of our own ships and masters of our own souls.  We need to ask what was so wrong with the situation and what is right about where we are now.<br/><br/>We would like the opportunity to help rural Ireland.  We have loads of ideas so ideas are not the problem.  I give the Minister credit for recognising the flaws in the system but it is still not right from a structural point of view.  We will get to the end of this programme and the money will all be spent and spent properly.  However, LEADER is burying its talents in the ground.  We want to make the most of what we have and do much more than we are doing at the moment.  We feel, however, that we are not being facilitated.</p></speech>

I am a voluntary board member from Tipperary and a retired farmer.  The biggest mistake in the current LEADER programme is that we are not allowed to animate and build capacity in communities.  Members wonder why one community is better than another.  My answer is that rural development has a cycle of between 20 and 25 years and we need that to build capacity in rural Ireland.  Some communities got up and running in the 1990s and are now the successful ones while others lag behind.  The former got assistance more quickly and were maybe better educated.  It cannot be done overnight but takes between 20 and 25 years.  If the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann want to do one thing, they can help us animate communities in the new programme coming down the line.</p><p>If we can do that we will be helping to build the communities and to put in place the structures mentioned by Dr. Cooke.  </p><p> While we are seeking changes in the new programme, in the past farmers, postmen, school teachers and so on became activists in their communities, took on board memberships and undertook the task of empowering their communities.  Currently, few young people join the boards of local development companies and we need to address that.  All of our companies are doing the best we can.  We realise that we have to be accountable but bureaucracy has increased and there is now less local decision making.  In the past, decisions were made locally.  Nowadays fewer decisions are made at parish level than was the case in the past.  </p><p> I refer to a very successful organisation that has been already mentioned, namely, the credit union movement, which in the past was available to local development companies and they delivered.</p></speech>

I will try to respond to aspects not covered by my colleagues.  One of the three core issues for us in terms of change is the stop-start of rural development.  We waited a long time, from 2013 to 2016, for the last programme.  In the context of Brexit and its likely impact on rural Ireland, this is not acceptable.  We are calling for a continuation of the LEADER programme, a national rural development programme of the type we had previously from 2001 to 2006 and local development strategies in 2019.  It is critical that the stop-starts of the past are not repeated.</p> <p>  The next programme is very much about smart villages.  It has been agreed by Europe and it underpins the bottom-up approach to local development companies, local people mobilising and using their assets, including new technologies, as possible solutions.  We are seeking support for this programme.  We urge that local rather than national funding be made available because local communities are often left behind when it comes to national funding.  It is often the case that the best dressed and the most dynamic get the funding.  We believe that local development companies, working with all partners, including local authorities and elected representatives and communities, are best placed to develop all community and rural development, with the focus on communities.  Our boards are community-led, working with State sector social pillars.  We have the structures in place.</p> <p>  As mentioned, Arigna LEADER in 1991 was very successful.  Three local authorities came together when the coal mines closed.  Local actors came together with their own funding and decision making, supported by elected and local authority representatives, and the fruit of those community projects are up and running.  In terms of disadvantaged communities, as stated by Mr. Finn, they were the earliest into LEADER.  We can never be complacent.  There are always new issues arising for communities.  Local development companies put in the hard work at ground level.  They never say no to communities.  We believe that hard work, strategic development and long-term plans are necessary, but based on consultation with the communities.  To ensure a return on public investment, development must be sustainable and a community has to want it.  </p> <p>  On farmers, the current LEADER programme does not sufficiently address farm diversification.  There is no specific measure in this regard in the programme.  Also, in terms of enterprise support under the LEADER programme, innovation is key.  In other words a company must prove its enterprise does not already exist.  We recommend that the back-to-work enterprise allowance model, which is so successful in terms of start-up businesses, be used in the farming sector, working with farmers on a collective basis to free up the stringent measures under LEADER in terms of innovation.  There is no support programme specifically geared towards the farming sector.</p></speech>

I will move now to the next round of speakers, starting with Senator Grace O'Sullivan, followed by Senator Hopkins and Deputy Fitzmaurice.</p></speech>

They are the champions in their communities.  I acknowledge the presence of Dr. Senan Cook, whom I know personally.  I attended the communities creating jobs workshop in Dunhill.  What is being done in this community, in terms of bottom-up, is incredible.  As someone who lives close to the Dunhill, Fenor, Boatstrand and Annestown area, I know that it is the creative holistic approach taken to developing the community that has been a success.  It is about opening one's mind and opening potential.</p> <p>  Ms Earley referenced the ability to innovate.  We have no national policy on social enterprise.  Having listened to the contributors, I recommend that this committee contact the Minister, Deputy Ring, and ask him when we will have such a policy.  The witnesses have identified the need for same.  We all recognise the importance of sustaining rural communities.  The Green Party made a submission to the national social enterprise strategy in December 2017.  One of the areas we looked at is the transit to decarbonising our environment, which feeds into what Mr. Finn had to say in terms of the farmers.  The Green Party believes there is huge opportunity to mobilise and engage communities in rural Ireland on the issues of renewable energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases.  Do the witnesses have any plans in this area in their communities?  For example, there is potential for farm buildings with regard to solar energy generation and potential in the renewable sector in general in enterprising communities to develop the whole energy market as we move away from the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p> The point for the Green Party is that we get bottom-up movement in this area and that we get co-operatives moving and communities moving so that we are working towards a healthier and better environment for all.  I understand it will take considerable innovation, but that micro-generation of energy has huge potential for rural communities.  I know in Dr. Cooke's area there is some engagement with regard to the potential of wind energy.  Although there is considerable opposition, it is because the model currently being used is a top-down model with large corporate businesses coming in.  We lack that community engagement.  Do the witnesses see that potential in their communities?  How could the Government support them in that regard?</p><p> People in my area in Waterford say they have difficulty in accessing LEADER funding for projects.  Individuals have to provide their own guarantee based on the match-funding mechanism.  Could that match-funding be minimised or what could be done to give more people the opportunity to develop their enterprising ideas without barriers at the initial stage?</p><p> We need to come in behind what the witnesses are doing, particularly the model Dr. Cooke spoke about.  The Green Party would be 100% behind him if we can get that pilot going.  His presentation ticks all the boxes and he is very enthusiastic.  However, it is not just what he is saying here; we know it in the community.  Along with Senator Coffey and Deputy Butler, we see what he is doing.  That model would be brilliant if we could roll it out and we will give whatever support we can in doing that.</p></speech>

The committee will produce a report with recommendations to Government.  It is very apt that Dr. Cooke and representatives of the LEADER companies are here.</p></speech>

I know Dr. Cooke, because we shared the pulpit in the speaker's corner in Ballaghadereen when we talked about the same subject of rural communities.  The presentations answered many questions on LEADER.</p> <p>  We know that certain rural areas are doing well and others have challenges.  I ask Mr. Rice to outline why that is the case.  He spoke about support, resources, confidence and obviously the big game-changer, better broadband.  Mr. Finn's contribution dealt with the longer-term planning emphasising that things do not happen overnight.  We need to bring all of those issues and challenges together to try to support the weaker communities in particular.  Ms Earley will know that because I work very closely with her and the other staff in Roscommon LEADER Partnership who are doing tremendous work.  They have a particular focus on areas of disadvantage and communities that need extra support to get themselves more organised in making applications.  We need that longer-term planning on where we see ourselves going.</p> <p>  The Chairman spoke of preparing a report.  One of our key challenges is to try to support those rural communities that need extra help.  We have said that communities that are well supported, resourced and organised will succeed.  Our challenge is in the other areas.  Mr. Rice said it is a complex issue, but that does not mean we cannot rise to that complex challenge, which we should do.</p> <p>  I will give some examples from our area.  We spoke about an integrated approach.  Roscommon LEADER Partnership is working with Roscommon County Council and the ITs, as well as being rooted in the community.  A very good example is the recently established food hub in Castlerea.  That responds to market demands in terms of the need for more workers in that sector.  We know we need more chefs.  There is huge possibility in the area of food and obviously training for that.  I use that example because it is responding to market demands.  The key issue in sustaining any rural community is people being employed.  We need to see more of that.</p> <p>  The other example is Kilbride community centre.  What Mr. Finn said reminded me that 21 years ago that community centre had a long-term vision.  It never stood still in wanting to achieve and build on success.  Roscommon LEADER Partnership has been very much involved with that centre.  It set up a community shop which is a very good social enterprise that is responding to the needs within communities.  While I have many more examples, I use those two to emphasise the need for the Minister, the Department and all the supporting agencies, including the employment agencies to respond better to weaker areas.</p> <p>  We have wonderful examples.  I am sitting beside two representatives from Waterford and Deputy Butler is also in the room.  Dungarvan has been completely transformed by the greenway.  We need to find the resources in weaker areas and rise to that complex challenge and try to support the people within those communities as much as possible.  I do not really have a question because many of the questions have been asked.  It is just a point that needs emphasis. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#J00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  In particular I mention Ms Earley who comes from our neck of the woods.</p> <p>  There is considerable debate about rural Ireland.  The message needs to go out clearly that it is probably the best place a person can live.  However, we need to ensure we keep people in order to keep those areas vibrant.  At one time in nearly all rural areas people either set something up themselves or had to go somewhere else to work.</p><p>At one time it was the case that one either set something up oneself or one had to go working somewhere.  A massive amount of people set up their own little businesses and were their own entrepreneurs in rural parts of Ireland.  I come from a rural setting and an agricultural background.  There would be a guy down the road who would do welding, a person up the road who would do fitting and another individual who would do something else.  Unfortunately, there are problems at present in the context of getting planning permission for people who want to do something in their areas.  The authorities want to move such people to areas where everyone is doing it.  There may be merit in some of that but it may be blocking some things.  What are our guests' views in that regard?</p><p> To put it simply, I believe that agriculture is the background of most people in rural Ireland.  With regard to the CAP - and the new CAP is coming in 2020 - in many parts many parents have said that they are only getting a few thousand and that they cannot make a living out of that.  There has been a flight of youngsters from the land.  To keep people in those areas, young girls and lads must be encouraged and given a fair crack of the whip.  I have noticed that in certain parts of the country in which larger-scale operators have come in and are renting land and in which there has been a flight from the land, communities are not as vibrant.  What are our guests' thoughts on family farms?</p><p> Our guests referred to broadband.  I have made study of the issue.  There is an amount of toing and froing in respect of broadband.  I hope everything will work out.  I went to England and looked at areas in which there is community involvement in delivering broadband.  Companies such as Eir have to be put in their box and asked whether they are prepared to facilitate people who are prepared to bring a connection right along a particular road?  If a community is willing to do that voluntarily and is willing to do it safely and have everything right, giving it funding may be a way to speed up the process of rolling out broadband in areas such as those to which Mr. Rice referred that do not have a service at the moment.</p><p> A problem I notice, and with which I am sure our guests are familiar, is that with more people going to work - which is good and which is appreciated - we find that in initiatives in local towns, such as the Tidy Towns competition and community employment and T&uacute;s schemes, there are criteria to fit and if one does not fit them, one is told "Goodbye" and must take a year off and draw social welfare rather than staying in the job one was in.  This has put pressure on rural communities that were trying to make their towns or villages better.  Do our guests agree that we need the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance to get involved?  Being realistic, the banks have moved out of many parts of Ireland the banks have moved.  There is no point crying about that.  We do, however, have the credit unions and the post offices - wherever some of them will be.  The credit unions have a lot of money and are willing to spend.  It is actually people's own money.  The credit unions need a bit of flexibility to be able to move into the area of resourcing and funding rural Ireland.  Included in that would be, for example, the GAA and the different town teams and so on.  What are our guests' ideas regarding joined-up thinking of this nature?</p><p> We should never underestimate the amount of work that people who are part of voluntary groups do every night.  There may be towns or villages that are doing better than others but, in fairness, everyone is trying.  I have yet to see a village or a town in which there is not somebody doing pioneering work.  However, such people are up against a headwind for the simple reason that they always have to be on the ball.  I noticed it earlier when Mr. O'Reilly was talking.  There should be a one-stop shop to which people could go so that they would know what is coming out in January, February, March and so on.  They are looking at papers and are trying to find out this information.  We have to realise these people work voluntarily.  What are our guests' ideas?  I know new ideas are being thrown out in terms of towns and villages.  I saw one community, with which I would have worked, that had the idea that three, four or five small villages, in which there would be a shop, a pub, a church and whatever, and a main town in the middle could be worked into an economic area that would feed the constituent villages.  What are our guests' views on that matter?</p><p> The obstacles regarding the LEADER programme are a major problem.  It is good to hear that all funding will be drawn down.  That would be great.  Is it not now that we need to start making sure that the voices calling for simplification are heard?  What are our guests' views on municipal districts having more autonomy over the budget for their areas?  What happens at present is that the council is given money and it then decides what to do with it.  Should there involvement for municipal districts, which would know more about what it is going on in an area, which would have more autonomy and which would work with local communities in a bottom-up manner?  We can work from the bottom up, but the foundations need to be there and the different Departments need to work together.</p><p> In the context of agriculture, the CAP is a big issue coming down the line.  We see it in the west of Ireland especially.  We see youngsters moving away from family farms.  The more that happens and if the people are not there, it will not matter if we were the greatest magicians in the world, it will still be hard to revive activity.  What are our guests' thoughts on a tax credit to encourage people to come to areas that are being hit harder than others?</p></speech>

As a result, I am not going to prolong proceedings.  I welcome our guests.  It is great to meet them.  I know of their drive and enthusiasm to make things better.  I am sure they will not mind if I keep a special mention for our own lady from Roscommon.  I really want to pay tribute to Ms Earley because she has a real hands-on approach and she has been involved in many innovative ideas throughout the county.  Like Deputy Fitzmaurice and Senator Hopkins, I am sure we really acknowledge her enthusiasm.  I am always amazed by the amount of meetings, gatherings and launches politicians have to attend at night, but Ms Earley nearly outdoes us.  She is great for that.  I really want to pay tribute to the work she does in our region.</p> <p>  I will keep to basics.  The biggest problem in a county like Roscommon - and Deputies Fitzmaurice and Kenny and Senator Hopkins will know this as they are from adjoining counties - is broadband.  I know I am being a bit parochial but if one looks at County Roscommon, it is obvious that it needs the national roll-out more than any other county.  More than 50% of the county is relying on the national roll-out.  We have been disappointed on many occasions.  In their engagement with Government, did our guests speak to it about broadband?  Is it talking about giving them a greater role in respect of broadband?  Like other politicians, companies approach me and state that they can deliver this or that but I am not going to go around recommending a broadband company because I do not know what it will deliver.  Many of them pick and choose in any event.  They are in business and the reality is that they want to be successful and make money.  I have seen this happen in the county already.  They came in, picked the cherries off the tree and left everything else.  We do not want that scenario but it really is vital and important for rural Ireland.</p> <p>  We talk about the post offices, which definitely are important in parts of our regions, but they are not as important as broadband.  I am wondering about the engagement there.  I fully accept what Ms Earley has said about the stop-start scenario.  It is doing the whole LEADER project no good.  We have seen this happening in our county.</p><p>People lose faith in it so I fully agree that we must have an ongoing plan.  It should not be the case that, over weeks and months, we merely hear that particular measures will be brought forward.  That is not a good scenario.</p><p> Many communities have fantastic ideas, as Deputy Fitzmaurice noted.  If we consider the innovative people in rural Ireland over the years who started businesses from old sheds in backyards, it is amazing.  That would not happen anywhere else in the world.</p><p> In the context of our town of Strokestown, despite the wind farm on Sliabh Bawn, about which, as Deputy Fitzmaurice knows, I got many a slap in the face, we have a group of 15 people who go onto that mountain to walk and exercise.  Coillte has put in a large number of tourism attractions.  It could do much more but it has done a certain amount.  My point is that there are seven people within a radius of ten miles who have tourism business proposals to link up.  One of those is for a wood museum in Strokestown.  Such a museum would be unique and would attract people from throughout the country and abroad.  We have the National Famine Museum, which attracts 65,000 visitors.  If we had something like that, it would be great.  In terms of developing the museum, I am coming up against a brick wall.  It appears that nobody at Government level is able to help us.  We do not have such a facility anywhere in Ireland.  Coillte has 700 acres in the area on which there is a wind farm, but now we have tourism-related and health promotion activities on it.  A wood museum would attract many people to that area and would be a fantastic economic boost for the region, but it is impossible to develop such a project.  I would love those involved in LEADER to be given more power by Government to involve themselves in that type of development.  On foot of the discussions they have had with the Minister, will our guests indicate whether consideration is being given to granting them more powers to take on such projects?</p><p> We had briefings yesterday with the IFA and a point made strongly by the representatives - Deputies Martin Kenny and Fitzmaurice and Senator Maura Hopkins will be aware of this - is that they are open to dealing with the question of renewable energy.  There is a huge area, as the Chairman knows, that could be developed.  Is that something the Government is discussing with our guests with a view to developing it further?  It is my belief those are the areas we have to develop.</p></speech>

Many people on social welfare who want to participate in various schemes or start their own businesses are in a trap because they cannot get any help.  It is almost as if they fall into an abyss.  They have to be on social welfare for a year before they can get on the back-to-work scheme and many other schemes.  They despair in terms of trying to get out of the trap to which I refer.  Many of the schemes in my area do great work.  They have people in their late 50s and early 60s who will not get a job in the economy yet they are sent to JobPath to write curricula vitae for jobs that do not exist.  What are our guests' views in that regard?  I am of the view that it is creating a logjam and that it is an issue which must be resolved.  I accept that it is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but it is an issue that affects everyone.</p> <p>  Another point is that it is also about the difficulties people in rural areas experience.  Yesterday, we had people before another committee on the issue of school transport.  If one member of a family living in a rural area works, they cannot get a medical card or school transport.  They cannot send their children to school and end up telling themselves that they would be better off if they did not have jobs.  That is the reality for many people in rural Ireland.  Somebody somewhere needs to realise the impact the withdrawal of services will have eventually.  All of that is having a negative knock-on effect.  I would like the witnesses views on those issues, but particularly the issue of people who find themselves unemployed and how they can get assistance to get back on their feet and back to work rather than being sent down a route where there is no work.</p></speech>

I want to ask a question while I am here.  The Chairman mentioned that the committee will consider following up on much of the evidence presented today.  I would like to make a formal proposal to the committee, which I ask the witnesses to assist us with.  My formal proposal is that we, as members of a joint Oireachtas committee, would compile a formal report on supporting community and social enterprise in rural areas nationally.  I ask that we would have a deep engagement not only with our witnesses today but also with other collaborators and stakeholders who can assist us.  I am formally proposing that to the Chairman.  I ask members to support us on that and we might be able to agree on a rapporteur.  I raise it now to ask if our witnesses would collaborate, help and inform us on doing that report.  It is timely now to prepare for future rural development programmes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.719" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Earley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#L00700"><p>One of the most important aspects is that we have Outreach offices in all their areas to ensure the farming community feel comfortable coming in to us in their wellies or whatever.  That local engagement is key.</p> <p>  I was challenged by my board because the numbers relating to T&uacute;s were decreasing.  Also, we were delighted with the increase in the number of rural social scheme places; we now have almost 174 in our county.  We had engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection locally and identified a need to increase the awareness of the farming community in terms of accessing the farm assist scheme.  Our team came up with an app that tested the means and engaged with the farming community.  Our partnership, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the IFA are now going to the marts in County Roscommon where we hold workshops and have direct engagement with people on farm assist.  Farm assist now attracts a training budget that we are accessing, which is very important.  The rural social scheme is key to our county and to our farming community.</p> <p>  Our company was delighted to be given the challenge of having a national contract for digital skills.  We focus in particular on the farming community, working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, because from talking to the IFA we know that the future of farming is in precision farming and digital knowledge.  We have to support our farming community with digitalisation.  We are on the ground to offer support in that regard.  We supported more than 5,000 farmers last year, working with the IFA and Teagasc, in terms of their digital uptake.</p> <p>  This is a complex issue.  Farming communities are embedded in the communities.  They want a community that will sustain the next generation - their children and families - in order that they will be there to mind them.  It is a life-cycle approach.  We need to take a holistic view.  That is why LEADER works.  It is integrated and it is about having the job, the social enterprise, locally.  We are calling specifically for an action such as the back to work enterprise allowance or a special scheme to support the farming community and their farm diversification projects.</p> <p>  There is a lack of trust in the farming community.  We have to engage with them and build up that trust.  They are sceptical about the bureaucracy and the loss of forms.  Local development companies are ideally placed to continue our work on LEADER and the rural social scheme throughout CAP and the next programme with the farming community.  We have their trust.  They are our colleagues.  They are the people we work with on a daily basis.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Martin Kenny's point regarding how we deal with people who are unemployed and getting them support, the social inclusion community activation programme that we operate is good.</p><p>It is personalised.  We sit down with people individually and find out where they are.  It is confidential.  Sometimes there are many other holistic issues.  We work with them on an individual basis to break down their issues.  There is personal development, training and education.  It is done on a case-by-case local basis.</p><p> We recommend to Government that the T&uacute;s programme be extended similar to the community employment scheme.  One year is simply not enough.  The feedback from T&uacute;s participants is that it is wonderful as a bridge to employment.  If that was extended, it would be of great benefit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Rice" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#M00200"><p>I will try to go quickly through some of the questions.  Senator Hopkins mentioned a number of issues about the challenges.  As Ms Earley remarked in covering a number of issues, we see ourselves as one-stop shops for communities and small businesses and we would like that recognised in any new framework, particularly from the point of view of innovation.  It is something which we understand.  It does not always have to be Einstein stuff.  It can be merely a simple transfer of ideas from one area to another or from one context to another.  The innovation broker idea is something which we see.  Going back to what Mr. Finn was saying about animation being an important part of the role, we meet people both in farm yards and in community centres at night, kicking the tyres, etc.  We do all of that stuff but we would rather have sufficient resources to let us do it to the level we think is needed.</p> <p>  One issue on energy is that the smart village idea is very much about areas that make the most of opportunities they have as well as integration and all of those good things.  If  local energy is to be a factor in rural and local development, grid access will have to be improved and localised, solutions found for local sources of energy we produce and communities will have to be allowed to keep the money they make from those sources of energy.  A little work has to be done on that.  Europe, as ever, is probably ahead of us in some of the examples but perhaps the smart village concept will lead to those being cascaded down.</p> <p>  Broadband was mentioned by a number of members.  Mr. Jan Dr&ouml;ge, the director of the broadband office, is coming to Ireland next week to meet us.  He is the head of the broadband at local level.  We have many ideas.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned them and we have put some to the Department.  There are issues, as we are told repeatedly, with state aid in respect of the national broadband plan but we are willing to have a go and put our shoulder to the wheel.  We have a coherent and rational way of dealing with that.</p> <p>  That covers most of the questions.  I probably left a lot out.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Saunders come in on the social welfare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Saunders" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#M00400"><p>Ms Earley covered it.  I echo Deputy Martin Kenny's concern that many people may fall into a chasm between unemployment and a more sustainable living income.  We share the view that in the transfer between a scheme and something else, there should be a mid way point that provides an incentive to people to progress.  That will form part of our discussions with the Department.  The committee's predecessor in its report on building viable rural communities had some ideas in that regard that we share.</p> <p>  The other aspect the Deputy mentioned was that those aged 55 years plus who are not physically up to the challenge of getting back on a building site or who will not do so again have a great deal to offer and there is probably a third way somewhere between employment and self-employment.  Some of the activation measures, in their current iteration, may not be the most suitable but those people are anxious to give back to their own communities and to contribute in their own way.</p> <p>  A national employment service, although under the remit of another Department, should be community-based and not-for-profit, and it should link strongly to the SICAP programme meaning that there would need to be a level of cross-departmental co-operation that allows for a community aspect to alternatives to welfare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-27a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018092700002#M00500"><p>I will try to wrap up.  We are partnership companies as well.  As well as a bottom-up approach, much of our work is with many of the agencies.  We can bring that expertise, be it with Teagasc or the enterprise boards, to it, for example, with small farmers.  My board, NEWKD, has joined Teagasc and the ETBs have talked about digital access for farmers.  This is a localised version of what Ms Earley has been rolling out.  A partnership approach is important as well.</p> <p>  We were asked about municipal districts and the autonomy of decision-making.  It is not for us to say how local authorities should operate but the more local the decision, the more empowered the community.  That goes back to Mr. Finn's point as well.</p> <p>  We were asked about a tax credit for hard-hit areas.  VAT was reduced for the tourism sector.  Changes to VAT or tax credits may be something that should be explored for the western seaboard and rural areas.  We do not have a fix on that but it would be a positive development.</p> <p>  Regarding biodiversity, Mr. Finn stated that some farmers generate up to 40% of their income from solar energy in Germany.  That goes back to retaining young people, with newer technology and newer ways of gaining income, on the land.</p> <p>  We would say "Yes" to the Minister and the Department asking us about taking on other programmes.  They are keen that we do that and we are keen to do so.  We cover the entire country.  We are positive.  We have a good relationship with the Minister and the Department in exploring those ideas.  There are nine areas in the CAP and we do not want to be pigeonholed into any one of them because we feel we have a role in the environment and sustainability farming.</p> <p>  Matched funding was asked about earlier.  We have rules on the community side and the private sector makes up 50%.  There has to be a sense of viability and fair play regarding the private sector.  On community funding, other funds such as the Clann Credo or Community Finance Ireland provide loans and they are very much on the ground.  The credit unions are also an option and, locally, some of our bodies explore it.  If we have gone through a business plan with an individual, the credit unions will take it that we have gone through it.  They are aware of the professionalism and experience of our staff, and they will take that as a way of easing the process.  Credit unions are giving out unsecured loans to farmers for up to &euro;50,000 now.  They operate on a local basis as well.</p> <p>  We are happy to progress with any of the matters discussed here today and feed back into them for the future.  We are delighted to be able to have such a robust and interesting discussion.</p></speech>

I agree with everything I have heard on this side and everything I have heard from the members, and I am not being nice to them.  There are lots of good ideas from everyone.  I am going to leave here and there will be a row in the first place I go into , although I will not want a row.  Going in with a reasonable request on one occasion, I was asked which letter in the word "No" did I not understand, the "N" or the "O".  I was then asked whether I had a problem.  We have the LEADER programme with all these brilliant ideas and they are doing brilliant work.  The committee members are doing brilliant work as well.  I read about them in the newspaper and I look at them on the television and this "That is a great idea."  For example, there was a good idea about social welfare.  The good idea about rural Ireland is put forward time and time again.  The suggestions Senator Coffey came up with, even the suggestions he put there to us, are good.  What is the problem?  How can we deal with the gap between all of us and the system?</p><p>I do not blame anybody in the public service for anything.  The system they are forced to manage forces then to implement actions.  When people go to the public house they will be asked if they have heard about something - things that could not be made up.  The LEADER programme came out some time ago with a 50% grant for communities and it was equated with a 50% grant for the private sector.  A community of volunteers was equated with private people looking for profit.  That could not be made up.  Those are issues that we spend much of our time thinking about.</p><p> We had a young chap and we begged T&uacute;s administrators to let him stay with us for another year.  It would have suited us and it would have given us more work.  He had a degree but he had been bullied in school.  The difference he was making would not be believed.  When the 12 months were up, T&uacute;s took him away from us and gave him nothing.  Three years later, he is eligible again.  He is being told that he did great work with us three years ago.  We are being asked to given him another year.  He is 28 or 29 years of age and a lovely fellow with lots of potential.  We had him for 12 months, we were doing great work with him, he was coming out of himself and talking to us freely and he was getting involved.  He would not say "Boo" when he came first.  Where was he for the past three years?  He is back on 23 September.  The only place T&uacute;s wants to put him now is back to us because it thought that when he was with us first he was going well so perhaps now he can pick it up three years later and we can build on what we were doing with him.  There are a million of those type social welfare issues, which I could talk to the committee all day and all night about.  Between us we have all of the answers, so why can we not implement all of these measures?  Why can we not give that role to LEADER?  I do not understand.</p></speech>

If the will is not there within either the Government or a Department, we will lobby.  Deputy Martin Kenny and I are in opposition.  At the end of the day, however, unless hard decisions are made, whatever is agreed in Europe under the CAP by officials and the Government, and whoever supports the Government, they must be pushed by the people that either support a Government or are in Government.  That is the only way it will be achieved.</p></speech>

The potential in rural Ireland is enormous.  All these people running big multinational companies are based in communities in rural Ireland.  They can be tapped into.  They will sponsor us, help us, give us expertise and connect us with the global economy.  We are being offered this all of the time.  When ask if we can do that, we are told then that we cannot.  It is not in the criteria, that is not on and this is not on.  I am asking the committee if we can all work together and see if we can get the new policy and then an implementation plan.  If we do that, it will be a huge step for us.</p></speech>
