    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019030500002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the recent proposals from the European Commission with regard to fisheries, a sector of the economy that is uniquely exposed to the negative implications from a no-deal or disorderly Brexit.  Under the transition period as set down in the withdrawal agreement agreed between the UK Government and the EU, there would be no change to the current situation in respect of fishing during the transition period, up to the end of 2020.  The Government's position is that it hopes that a no-deal scenario can still be avoided and that the withdrawal agreement with the United Kingdom can be concluded, but it must also be prepared for all possibilities.<br/><br/>On 30 March 2019, if the UK leaves the European Union without agreement, it also automatically leaves the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The UK will then become a third country or coastal state in its own right under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS.  The UK would, if it so chose, be able to immediately close its waters to EU vessels.  This would mean that the <i>status quo </i>in which Irish vessels can freely fish in many areas of the UK exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and<i>vice versa</i>, could be altered immediately.  On the issue of access to waters, there has been no clear unequivocal message from the UK Government.  The Secretary of State, Mr. Gove, made a remark last October that could be interpreted as meaning that the<i>status quo </i>on both access and quota would continue for 2019 even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  However, much has changed since October.  The UK Government's guidance note on the fisheries sector and preparing for EU exit, published on 1 March 2019, states that &quot;access to waters will change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal&quot; and that &quot;non UK vessels will no longer have the automatic right to fish in UK waters&quot;.  While the position on access is not clear, the possibility that all EU vessels and hence all Irish vessels would be excluded from the UK zone in the event of a no-deal Brexit is certainly one possible scenario. <br/><br/>In the context of that possible scenario, the Commission has put forward two separate technical proposals relating to fisheries.  Under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, it is possible at present, under certain limited circumstances, to provide temporary financial aid to vessels for the cessation of fishing activities for a period of time.  The purpose of the Commission proposal is to amend the EU regulation for the EMFF to widen those circumstances to cover vessels that would be significantly impacted due to their exclusion from UK waters.  There are limits to how much fishing effort could be redirected from UK waters to EU waters for many reasons, including the sustainability of fish stocks, the cost effectiveness for vessels and quality of catches.  The aid under the EMFF would be available for a maximum of nine months over the period to the end of 2020.  The EU Commission position is that the funds would have to be found from within the existing member states' EMFF envelope.<br/><br/>This loosening of the rules around temporary cessation and financial aid is a limited measure that, while welcome in the event that it might have to be availed of, would not address all the issues that would arise from loss of access to UK waters.  Perhaps most importantly, it provides the legal framework in which to provide possible tie-up aid to affected fishing vessels.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, has made it clear that, in the event that a tie up-measure is required, it will be essential to ensure a co-ordinated and balanced application of a scheme to individual fisheries, across the fleets of the member states involved.  Ireland is working closely and intensively with the other member states most concerned and with the European Commission's DG MARE to identify the potential impacts for fishing that would arise from displacement of fishing activity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<br/><br/>The second proposal from the EU Commission is similarly about ensuring that there is a legal basis to allow EU vessels to operate in the waters of a third country in the absence of a formal agreement between the EU and that third country.  That second proposal also provides for the possibility of current quota swapping arrangements between EU member states and the UK to continue in the absence of an agreement.</p><p>This proposal does not mean that there will be ongoing reciprocal access after 29 March.  It merely provides the legal basis for it to happen should the UK be willing to grant such reciprocal access in a no-deal situation.  As to the timing on the adoption of the two proposals, they are proceeding on a fast-track procedure through the Council and the European Parliament.  A plenary European Parliament vote is scheduled for 13 March and it is expected that the Council's final endorsement will happen around 18 or 19 March so that they are legally in place before 29 March.<br/><br/>The impact of the loss of access for the Irish fleet is the critical issue.  Ireland, France, Denmark, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands all take, on average, between 30% and 45% of their landings by volume and between 18.5% and 50% by value from the UK waters.  Of the UK's total landings, only 15% by volume are caught outside the UK's EEZ.  On average, 34% of Irish landings by volume and value came from inside the UK&rsquo;s EEZ.  Ireland catches a proportion of all our main commercial quotas across 30-plus stocks in UK waters and in some cases, for example mackerel, which is our largest fishery, well over 60% of the quota is taken from UK waters.  The most immediate impact of loss of access would be for our whitefish and prawn fisheries.  This is because our pelagic fisheries, in particular mackerel, would not be immediately affected in 2019 as our fleet has largely caught the available quota in the early part of the year.  This situation of concentration of fishing in a small period could, however, have adverse impacts on our processing companies later on.<br/><br/>In the event of exclusion from UK waters, Irish vessels would lose access to parts of the important nephrops, or prawn, grounds in the Irish Sea and to the important Smalls grounds situated off Milford Haven.  It would also lose access to the parts of the Celtic Sea that come within the UK zone with important fishing grounds for mixed demersal species such as cod, haddock, whiting, monkfish, megrim and hake.  The fleet would fully lose access to the fishing grounds around Rockall and off the west coast of Scotland.  A major knock-on effect of loss of access by Irish and other Union vessels in the event of a disorderly Brexit is the likely increase in activity in the fishing grounds in the waters around Ireland.  The concern here is an increase in pressure on fish stocks in particular fishing grounds leading to an increase in fish mortality there.  This could, in turn, threaten the long-term sustainability of those stocks resulting in lower quotas going forward.  In that context, the temporary tie-up of vessels may be required to protect the long-term sustainability of the stocks upon which our fleets rely.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, has made it clear that if there has to be any temporary cessation, its use must be proportionate across the EU fleets fishing in the shared fisheries.  It cannot be the case that in shared fisheries, the vessels of one member state are tied up while the vessels of another continues to fish without restriction.  The Minister has made it clear that there must be a level playing field for all those impacted by loss of access to UK waters.<br/><br/>I turn to preparedness.  The Irish response will continue to be within the overall EU 27 context and, in particular, the group of eight member states directly impacted for fisheries.  The Minister met fisheries Commissioner Vella on 18 February to discuss these issues and the ongoing work of ensuring a co-ordinated response at EU level.  There have been a number of other meetings at official level with the group of eight member states and the Commission and that work is ongoing too.  Displacement of other EU fleets into the limited remaining fishing grounds in western waters must be planned for and measures must be taken to ensure that we have orderly activity within sustainable levels.  Meetings between the group of eight member states and the Commission are focused on ensuring there will be an EU co-ordination mechanism on the actual application of any temporary cessation.  Work is ongoing on identifying the fleets and stocks most vulnerable to a disorderly Brexit and exploring possible mitigation arrangements within temporary cessation schemes.<br/><br/>At national level, the Minster has continued to work closely with industry representatives.  The most recent meeting was on 25 February in Clonakilty where the Minister and industry representatives had a full exchange on the evolving situation on Brexit.  Within the Department and the marine agencies, there has been intensive work to prepare for all possible scenarios.  The State is providing advice and information on importing and exporting issues in a situation of a no-deal Brexit.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is holding a number of information events for traders and information notices are available on its website.  Notices are also being published on the websites of our Department and of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  BIM, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland are continuing to work with seafood companies to help them to deal with Brexit, seeking to make them more competitive and diversify market exposure.  Support is also given to upskill teams.<br/><br/>I turn to the readiness of the seafood processing sector for Brexit.  In total, there are 163 seafood processing companies operating in Ireland.  Of these, 53% generate less than &euro;1 million in annual revenue while 32% generate revenues of between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million.  The remaining 15% of companies have annual revenues greater than &euro;10 million.  Exports of seafood from Ireland in 2017 totalled 314,000 tonnes worth &euro;666 million.  The EU is the main market for these exports, particularly in the shellfish, salmonid and whitefish seafood categories.  The UK market is significant and was worth &euro;86 million in 2017, with a volume of 44,000 tonnes.  BIM have been working extensively with the sector to determine the extent of the potential impact and to offer advice on readiness for Brexit.  There remains a high level of uncertainty as to the landscape for businesses post Brexit.  While some of the seafood processing companies are prepared to a high degree for Brexit, the majority are prepared to a limited extent and some are unprepared.  BIM, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia will continue to work with these companies to strengthen all aspect of their preparations.<br/><br/>In a trade context, the seafood sector shares many of the concerns of other sectors with regard to currency fluctuations, tariffs and the landbridge.  There are, however, a number of additional issues for seafood.  A no-deal Brexit will mean that Irish importers and exports of seafood products to and from the UK will require additional certificates on top of those required for products of animal origin under sanitary and phytosanitary rules.  All seafood imported into the EU from a third country, which the UK will be after it leaves the Union, must have a catch certificate.  The UK is a significant market, representing 14% of exports for Irish seafood, but it is not our most important one.  While the landbridge is a significant issue for many exporters, it is especially worrying for seafood exporters given the perishability of their product.  On average, we export 26,000 tonnes of seafood via the landbridge each year.  Having to go by sea directly to continental Europe would add 12 hours to the journey.  Again, these are issues on which we are working closely with the sector and the relevant state agencies.<br/><br/>A no-deal Brexit, which is not the desired outcome, would have a severe impact on the Irish seafood sector as whole.  Loss of access to UK waters is the most immediate large scale threat to the seafood industry.  We have a clear and agreed strategy in place at EU level that future fisheries arrangements with the UK can only be agreed within the context of the overall economic relationship.  That has not changed throughout the Brexit negotiation process and will remain the case in a no-deal situation.  Specifically on fisheries, the agreed overarching priority has been and remains to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources to provide continuity and certainty to our catching and processing sectors.  In the short term, EU emergency aid may be required in a worst-case scenario to allow us to tie up a proportionate part of the EU fleets in highly impacted fisheries.  This can and will only happen in an agreed and co-ordinated way thus sending, again, the clear message that the EU 27 are working as one in fisheries to deliver on the EU priority to maintain the <i>status quo</i>in terms of access and quotas.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Beamish explain why that would be the view of the Department on this matter?</p><p> These legislative proposals will go through quite quickly in terms of fast-tracking-----</p></speech>

If the UK withdraws on 29 March without an agreement, its waters will effectively probably close.  Can Dr. Beamish explain what must happen for that to take effect?</p> <p>  With regard to payment from the existing EMFF for compensation, what could be the impact in terms of the projects for funding under the EMFF?  Will there be enough money available to compensate the fishery businesses adequately for the loss of income due to the closure of UK waters to them?  Is there any provision in that for the compensation of crews?  While the owners of the boats may be compensated, the crew members will be out of work.  Is that something on which the Department would take a view?  Dr. Beamish stated that the Minister made it clear that the temporary cessation must be proportionate across EU fleets.  How is he proposing that will work?  What is the mechanism whereby that will work and what will it mean in effect?</p> <p>  I understand that the landbridge might not be Dr. Beamish's concern, but can he address it in respect of fisheries exports to the EU using the landbridge?  Obviously, they will be sealed in Killybegs, Greencastle or the other ports and transported across.  Is the fact that the seal will stay intact enough?  Has the Department considered how that would work?</p> <p>  Does Dr. Beamish have any information on the import tariffs that are applicable to seafood?  Does he have them regarding the UK?  While 14% of exports will be impacted, what will be the level of the impact from those stocks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019030500002#E00600"><p>I thank Dr. Beamish for his presentation.  Basically, the requirement we have here relates to the compensation of fishermen who would be negatively affected due to Brexit if they are frozen out of a large section of water where they traditionally fish and catch a large portion of their catch.  In that regard, is the Department getting any indication from the negotiations in regard to the overall situation for the Common Fisheries Policy and what arrangement will be in place?  Clearly, regardless of what happens, Britain is going to leave the Common Fisheries Policy.  There will still have to be some arrangement in place between the EU and Britain in respect of access to water and access to stocks in different places.  I am wondering about the amount of quota that will be taken away from the British fishermen and where that quota will go.  If Britain leaves the EU, the portion of the quota it currently has will be coming back into the system.  What will happen to that or is there any clarity in that regard yet?</p> <p>  I am also interested in the tariff rates that will be in place.  Is there any indication as to what deal can be done in that regard?</p> <p>  The other issue is the compensation for fishermen who would lose in this respect.  If Irish fishermen will lose out and the vessels are tied up for a period because they cannot fish, will one of the consequences of it be that there will be extra competition within what will be the diminished or smaller EU waters as a result of Brexit?  What new arrangements are possible to revert to the Common Fisheries Policy and see what new negotiations can take place there?  For example, last November the total allowable catch was established for this year.  However, before the end of this year, we could be in a situation where Brexit has thrown all that up in the air.  Will there be a new negotiation to work it all out again or what is the proposal in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019030500002#E00700"><p>I thank the officials for attending.  Can they provide further clarity regarding the carve up of quota between what UK registered vessels have at present and what other EU member states have?  What will happen there?  If there is a hard Brexit and the UK is not willing to do a reciprocal deal on access to stocks and waters, what will happen to the UK's quota?  In addition, what will happen to the quotas other EU member states have for various fish stocks?  What is the process around that?  The scenario of a tie-up would be massively disruptive and expensive and would cause massive financial loss to the fisheries sector.  In the event of a tie-up, what are the estimates for the reduction in fish catches overall?  In terms of the fish processing sector, what are the estimates regarding the availability of fish for the sector?</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about funding under the EMFF.  Dr. Beamish indicated that any funding would have to come from existing national allocations or envelopes.  Can he clarify further what he meant?  Obviously, it is essential that the level of funding in place in such an undesirable scenario could properly compensate the fisheries sector, both fishing vessel owners and the employees.</p> <p>  Dr. Beamish referred to the importance of the landbridge for fish getting out of the country, particularly due to the perishable nature of fish.  He indicated that additional sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks would be required on fish products.  Last summer the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced that 300 SPS and veterinary officials would be hired to be in place to deal with the possibility of a hard Brexit.  That number was reduced to 116 in October.</p><p>Have sufficient SPS personnel been recruited to carry out that work and, if not, what is proposed to ensure the checks will be carried out in a prompt manner?</p></speech>

In so many ways it is a doomsday scenario.  It is important to clarify the position before we get into the meat of the issue.  On the tie-up measures that will be required in terms of the timeframe requested in the event that there is a hard Brexit, do we know how much of the fleet will be impacted, taking into consideration lack of access, particularly in the mackerel sector?  That sector will be okay in 2019, but access to UK waters, given that so much of the product is landed in the United Kingdom, will be an issue in 2020.  How will these waters be policed in a hard Brexit scenario?  As a nation, how would we police them?  Having viewed the proposed border on the map, it appears to be extensive.  We have a limited naval service.  Would we have the capability to man that border to ensure we would not be faced with issues such as vessels from third countries fishing in our waters?</p> <p>  On the arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland, with reference to recommendation No. 2 in respect of the proposed reciprocal arrangements, there are no arrangements proposed with regard to the six-mile limit about which we spoke previously.  I recall there was a debate in the Seanad on this recommendation which would have ensured this issue would be resolved.  Does Dr. Beamish have recommendations or an insight in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019030500002#F00400"><p>I will do my best to answer all of the questions in the order in which they were raised.  </p> <p>  It is important to set the context.  For the many people involved in Brexit, it is hard to be certain about what one is dealing with.  The scenario to which the UK Government agreed and which it is working to have adopted in the House of Commons, to which the European Union agreed and which the Irish Government supports is that in fisheries there would be a transition period for the remainder of 2019 and no change in 2020.  We will operate as we have heretofore under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Total allowable catch, TAC, quotas would be set in December 2019.  The United Kingdom would be outside the door, but the quotas would be set and apply to it for 2020.  By mid-2020, the negotiations on the future relationship will have reached a certain point, including on the arrangements to apply to fisheries, but at the end of that year a decision would have to be taken on whether the transition period should be extended for a further year to allow the negotiations to be concluded.  That is the central case in the context of the main approach that is still being pursued.  In the event that this will happen, nothing will change immediately.  This could be the position on 1 April and it is what everybody is working towards.  However, there is a lot of uncertainty.  In the event that there is no agreement, there might be an extension under Article 50, which means that the United Kingdom would remain a member of the European Union.  Therefore, the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, would apply and things would continue as normal for the period of the extension, whatever it might be.  They are the two scenarios which might mean that there would be no change.</p> <p>  In the event that there is a disorderly or no-deal Brexit, technically and legally, once the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union, the Common Fsheries Policy will not apply.  The United Kingdom will become a third country, in the same way as Norway and Iceland, and there will be no automatic access for EU vessels to UK waters or for UK vessels to EU waters.  However, the geography will not change and the United Kingdom will still need to trade.  It is likely that some discussion will take place.  Therefore, there will be a need for an arrangement governing how long and the point at which a prohibition on access would be implemented.  </p> <p>  The second measure in front of us made by the Commission is based on the possibility that the United Kingdom would offer reciprocal access arrangements in 2019 on the basis of the TAC quotas agreed to last December.  For the remainder of 2019, it would offer reciprocal access arrangements.  The second proposal would create, on the EU side, a legal framework whereby we could allow UK vessels into our waters, while EU vessels would be allowed into UK waters.  While technically the United Kingdom would be outside the European Union, access on a reciprocal basis would be granted in 2019 and we would operate under the existing TAC quota regime.  That is one possibility in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  The proposal to enable it to happen in the event that an offer is made and agreed to with the United Kingdom would apply to 2019 only.  In that event, there would be no need for a temporary cessation and so on.  It is also dependent on timeframes because many fishers are seasonal, or their locations are seasonal.  All of the mackerel quota will have been caught.  Traditionally the sector has been dependent on catching a large proportion in the UK zone west and north of Scotland.  The catch is already in the factories.  Therefore, the impact on the fleet in 2019 would be limited.  We are not talking about it being to the fore in dealing with the issue of cessation.  </p> <p>  On other stocks, stocks are not managed on the basis of national areas and have not been within the European Union.  The stock ranges across the areas west of Scotland that are included in the UK zone and ours.   It might well be the case that vessels could avail of their quota entitlements in our zone.</p><p>It could be that fishing activity could continue and it might be, if that was a migratory type of stock, that it would not have a big impact.<br/><br/>There are other stocks based on discrete grounds and if fishermen are off those grounds and there is increased effort on the grounds in our zone, that would be spatially limited and it could have an impact.  That is where we might want to ease the effort on that ground.  It is all about when this reality will become true and at what point it would need to be done.  It would not necessarily have to be done on 1 April and it is not that everybody would stop fishing on 1 April but rather that they would just have to fish in European Union waters.  The other issue is the extent to which other fleets would increase fishing effort in our zone.  For some things that could happen and for others it does not really make economic sense because of the size of the boat or other opportunities in French waters, etc.  There is no script for this and we are trying to work this out and plan for the scenario.<br/><br/>It is quite complex.  There are approximately 100 stocks shared with the United Kingdom.  There are biological units straddling the United Kingdom and Irish zone, and no matter what happens, they will have to continue to be shared and jointly managed if we are to avoid damaging the stocks.  Whatever future scenario arises, whether the UK is outside the Union or in transition, some sort of management arrangements would have to be worked out between the UK and the EU to manage those stocks.  There is no point in one side conserving the stocks while the other side is damaging them.  That does not work in fisheries.  We have models and we do things with Norway and others where we share stocks.<br/><br/>People asked what would happen to the UK's quota.  That quota is an entitlement to fish a certain portion of the stock.  The UK has generally indicated that it would stick to those arrangements for 2019 and that it would only fish that amount.  The EU entitlements would be the same and that is the most likely scenario.  There would be negotiations after that as to what would happen but it is not the case that a lot of quota becomes free.  It does not work like that.  We would be trying to manage the out-take from a given stock divided among people and it is not just that some additional quota can be shared around.  If we are taking 100% of what is biologically sustainable to take currently, we cannot share around another 40% and take 140%.  That would be a road of mutually assured destruction that we do not want to go down.  In the short term quota does not become available to anybody <i>per se</i>.  Some in the UK fishing industry have an obvious ambition to take a bigger share of the stock and that has implications but that is a little further down the road.  For 2019, quota entitlements probably will not change.<br/><br/>If the UK leaves the Union and the Common Fisheries Policy, there will not be automatic access, according to the UK.  That is just a fact.  It does not mean the UK will not decide perhaps to grant reciprocal access for 2019.  We do not know how long the position of no access will exist.  It is not the case that the UK is without problems as it needs to access the market and have relations.  It also has many things that impacts its position as well.  That is the general position and we are trying to deal with and prepare for a variety of scenarios but a number of them involve no change.</p></speech>

We have nothing to give them, as such.  I understand it is linked to other arrangements but how realistic is it that this factor will make the UK allow access?</p></speech>

It will cut across all sectors and a variety of issues will be in play.  The EU is likely to take some sort of co-ordinated approach across those.  In very simple terms, the UK largely exports to the EU what it catches and imports what it eats.  We are not terribly different ourselves in many ways.  The EU market is very important to the UK and keeping that trade going feeds all the way down to the fishermen.  It is not something that can be done in isolation of the position in the market and the EU is quite conscious of that.</p> <p>  There was a question about tariffs.  This is not the same as in the agricultural sector, such as with beef, where one would be very dependent on the UK market.  Ireland is not terribly dependent on the UK market when it comes to seafood.  It is an important market but it does not have the same dominance as it would with beef.  The tariffs on fisheries products are also much lower.  Tariffs on fishery products apply the other way as well as the UK exports to the EU and it would hit tariff barriers in that respect.  We would export to the EU market without that tariff barrier.  There are many ways to look at this.</p> <p>  At the high end of tariffs, mackerel and herring would see a rate of 20%.  The more common white fish see a rate of approximately 7.5%, so the average is approximately 14%.  These are the lower end of some of the tariff ranges when compared with the agrifood side.  A processed product attracts higher tariffs and the UK sells quite a bit of processed product into the EU market.  The tariff element has not been as dominant in the fisheries discussion as it would have been in the other areas.  It is not about the market so much.</p> <p>  The landbridge has been dealt with by other colleagues and the European Commission.  Much depends on how the UK deals with the product.  Although fish is perishable, it is not the only time-limited agrifood product going through the UK on the landbridge but it is important that the landbridge can work.  It is a bigger subject than I can go into here.  There was a question about temporary cessation being proportionate but there is no script on this and Brexit is something new.  With the proposal before us today, the Commission is creating a legal framework where temporary cessation can be used in circumstances that nobody foresaw when the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, was being drawn up.  If it was not changed by virtue of this proposal, we could not use temporary cessation because a member state was leaving.  It is creating the possibility to use it.  The question was raised about crew.  In the EMFF it is provided that people who have worked more than 120 days during the past two calendar years are eligible under the EMFF for payment.</p> <p>  We are talking about the legal framework to enable this proposal today.  The detail has to be drawn up in a scheme.</p><p>That can only be done when the exact extent of access, as well as which fisheries have gone through and which fisheries are severely impacted, is clear.  Not all fishing is the same.  The committee knows that very well.  There must also be a proper sense of the likely displacement impact at European level.  We are working very hard with the Commission and the eight other impacted member states to draw up a factual assessment of where we think displacement will be felt and what species it will affect.  We are preparing fishery science advice on the likely impact of that increase in effort.  As I say, if the stock is migratory, increasing the fishing in one particular area may have no long-term biological impact.</p><p> All of this is being assessed at the moment.  There is no co-ordination mechanism in place to determine the proportionate reduction and how to carry it out.  That work is ongoing with the Commission.  The fisheries are shared.  They are European fisheries.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, has been saying that we need a European response.  As one member state on our own, we cannot set the rules for the French, Dutch or Spanish fleet fishing in our zone.  It is a common policy, so we want a common response.</p><p> A question was raised about the funding.  The Commission is saying that funding must come from the existing national envelopes.  The existing national envelopes have already been allocated to different programmes.  We are working to spend our envelopes.  We have not envisaged a scheme for tariff cessation.  Funding will have to be considered both at Government level and at EU level.  That will happen later in the month as we get closer to whatever the reality might be.</p><p> Deputy Kenny asked about the quota taken away from British fishermen.  We have dealt with that.  If the UK leaves permanently, there will still have to be negotiations with the UK on how to manage fisheries.  It is just not possible to coexist in 100 shared fisheries without working out arrangements on how to manage them.  The national position is that those arrangements should not impact on relative stability.  We should keep our shares in them but we would have to agree on certain things.  For example, within the Common Fisheries Policy members are all working towards a shared objective of bringing stocks to maximum sustainable yield levels by 2020.  Would the UK adopt that target if it left?  That would have to be negotiated, because in that case we would be jointly managing those stocks.  We would have to agree on the target to which stocks could be managed and then agree on uptakes.  There will be fisheries negotiations in some form or other no matter what happens.</p><p> We cannot be certain, but we do not envisage new negotiations on tax and quotas in 2019.  Insofar as it has made any consistent comments, the UK Government has suggested that it will stick to the tax and quota arrangements of 2019.  That only applies for 2019.  We will see what happens then.</p></speech>

Obviously the EU has other neighbours that are not member states in other areas where seas are shared.  Do those templates provide any guidance on the kind of arrangement we might be able to work out in the future? </p></speech>

This is probably unique because of the scale of what we are dealing with.  Our 100 shared stocks cover a vast swathe of what is available in European fisheries.  There are no other arrangements of that scale.  We have smaller-scale arrangements with Norway.  We share information on catches etc. because each side needs to know that the other is respecting the agreement.  As such, all of the catch statistics in those fisheries are shared.  In an agreed arrangement, as opposed to a disorderly exit, the UK and the EU would have to be able to share information on catches, ensure fishing boats apply controls etc.  There would have to be joint confidence in agreed management arrangements.  However, nothing of that scale has been done up to now, so this would present quite a different landscape.  In many ways, this arrangement will probably supplant the current December fisheries Council, because many of our stocks will be determined through bilateral negotiations with the UK.</p></speech>

The British are a bit like us.  Although they are an island nation, they do not eat a lot of fish.  Their main export market is clearly the EU.  The UK will face a tariff on these exports whereas we will not.  One would imagine that when the UK Government negotiates, it will have to bear this in mind as well.  People talk about the doomsday scenario.  When we examine all of this, one of the big questions is how much of a positive this will represent for the British fishing industry.  The British seem to think that Brexit will bring them a bonanza.  I wonder about that.  Is it possible that the British could find their vessels have access to more fish because the quotas will not apply, but they are then unable to sell that fish?  It may not be of any benefit at all.</p></speech>

A producer in the shellfish industry, which is non-quota, will face tariffs exporting to the EU.  That is a non-quota sector, so such a producer will not see any benefit.  The UK share of certain quota fisheries is perceived by British fishermen to be relatively low.  They perceive that they will benefit from an increased quota.  The Deputy is correct in saying that these products are largely sold into the EU.  The UK tends to import cod, salmon, tiger prawns, tuna etc. for its domestic market.  It exports a lot of the other fish.</p> <p>  Whether a producer perceives a balance of advantage or disadvantage depends on what kind of fishery he or she is exploiting.  However, fisheries is a zero-sum game.  If somebody gets a bigger share, somebody else gets a smaller share.  We are very conscious of that from the Irish perspective.  Our position, and to date the EU position, is that any future negotiations with the UK will be on the basis of the current access and quota-sharing arrangements.  Ireland's position and that of the EU is that the UK should leave with what it has.  It retains its current arrangements.  If that arrangement allows the UK access to certain EU fisheries and the EU access to certain UK fisheries, that will be the arrangement with which the UK leaves.  That is not necessarily the perception in the UK, as the Deputy points out.</p> <p>  However, all of that is to be worked out in future negotiations.  No matter what happens here, we must anticipate fisheries negotiations taking place over a reasonably long period going forward.</p><p>They will be important for the fishing industry here.  It would be conducted through EU central negotiations, much like Michel Barnier has done so far.  Member states work and feed into that process.  They are not removed from it.</p></speech>

Legally, under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, the waters are deemed as European waters.  I know everybody refers to them as Irish waters.  Our responsibilities are for control and management of that 200-mile zone, which is managed under the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is a complex debate.  The UK would not be subject to the CFP so it would manage its own zone.  The details of who temporary cessation might apply to have to be determined because we do not know the extent of the cessation, what is impacted, what is displaced and what cannot be caught here.  All of that work is going on behind the scenes.  It will not happen on day one.  The focus of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund is on the vessels, the impact on them and on the crewmen.  The perception is that workers in the processing sector would be on the social insurance scheme.  The work is often seasonal in many factories, including in the pelagic factories.  The primary impacts will not be on pelagic fisheries in 2019.  It has been extremely busy for them.  The agreed management arrangement for the national quota was to facilitate the catching of that quota in the first three months of the year.  The focus is likely to be more on the prawn fleet and some of the white fish fleets, which will be more impacted in that situation.</p></speech>

We do not know if anything has changed.  In the opening address, I said that the most recent notice was that there would not be automatic access.  That is a statement of legal fact if the UK falls outside the EU but the important word there is "automatic".  There would not be automatic access but the UK could choose to give reciprocal access for 2019.  I am supposing that having two notices does not necessarily mean that they are inconsistent.  It is still within the discretion of the UK to give reciprocal access for 2019.  The proposal we have from the Commission is so that the EU will be in a position to take up an offer if such an offer happens.  Beyond that, one can guess what Michael Gove's thinking would be.</p></speech>

When the Bill was before the House on Second Stage, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, made it plain that the Government supports microgeneration.  It has been a long-standing position of successive Governments.  In 2017, we organised a workshop with a number of stakeholders and subsequently established the Micro Renewable Energy Federation.  In 2018, we introduced a pilot scheme.  There is, therefore, a strong commitment to the development of microgeneration as part of a changed role for citizens, consumers and communities within the energy system.  The Government has not opposed the Bill so far, recognising this very point and that the support of microgenerators will be needed as part of the implementation of the clean energy package, which has effectively been negotiated.  Evidence-based analysis and assessment will be necessary to deliver the citizen and community entitlements at the heart of the recast renewable energy directive.</p> <p>  There is evidence that microgeneration will have minimal direct impact on carbon emissions but, more important, it provides an opportunity for citizens to play a part in the overall energy and climate agenda, the implementation of what needs to done, and sharing understanding thereon.</p> <p>  The existing pilot scheme will help our understanding of what the likely demand for microgeneration in Ireland will be.  A previous scheme, run by Electric Ireland, offered a generation tariff.  It opened in 2009 and remained open until around 2013, but it attracted only 700 applications.  Including an obligation on electricity retailers to procure 5% of their electricity from microgenerators before first establishing the likely demand for such a scheme may well be premature and may have unintended consequences.  The pilot demonstration scheme opened in 2018 for applicants.  To date, 3,000 have expressed interest.  Working with the Micro Renewable Energy Federation, a code of practice for microgeneration has been developed.  This will help to ensure appropriate quality standards in the sector and will, in turn, increase public confidence in new technology. </p> <p>  Microgeneration and the role of the energy prosumer was part of the Government energy policy in the energy White Paper.  That was a key document setting out a number of points of departure.  I refer to the engagement of energy Ministers with consumer bodies in Europe that have made it plain that consumers are busy people.  They have children, parents, lives, work and social lives.  The time they can commit to any sector is limited so they need simple, reliable, robust systems.</p> <p>  Another principle we would like to underpin the scheme requires that it be equitable and fair.  While supportive of developing the emerging microgeneration sector, there is a need to be careful regarding the consequences for consumers who end up paying higher costs, in effect subsidising those who can afford to participate.  There are a range of options for how we pay for microgeneration.  They broadly fall into three groups: include the cost in the PSO; allow energy retailers to socialise the costs, averaging across their energy rates; or have the Exchequer intervene.  None is simple and all involve additional costs for somebody.  Energy suppliers could socialise the additional costs associated with microgeneration through their unit rates, which would have a negative impact on consumers, particularly those who cannot afford to participate.. Network operators would also have to address how their lost revenues would be recovered.  Following the latest major storm, network repairs cost &euro;30 million.  Funding needs to be addressed, therefore.</p> <p>  The actions to develop the climate action plan's microgeneration policy will assess these and other challenges.  In respect of excess renewable electricity generated and consumed on site, microgeneration will remain a more expensive source of supporting the supply of renewable energy to the grid. </p> <p>  It is clear that microgeneration is part of the future energy system.  It is arriving.  It is here.  More microgeneration technologies will be developed and built in the future.  These must be underpinned by appropriate electricity market design and industry standards, which are currently being developed.  The Bill aims to facilitate this growth, and the Government has made clear that it shares that ambition and will work positively on the amendment Stages to ensue effective and appropriate supports are developed in this area.</p> <p>  I look forward to the discussion and taking any questions that members may have on this topic.</p></speech>

We are promoting the Bill as a means of putting forward alternatives because we want to provide people with a means of switching over from harmful fossil fuels to renewables.  In order to address climate change, we cannot just call for an end to fossil fuels; we need solutions to directly replace fossil fuels.  We need to put in place alternative energy solutions and microgeneration will form a part of this, as well as being an energy source that lowers energy bills for households, farms, industry and small businesses.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 means that suppliers will have to pay the householder for excess electricity supplied to the grid from small-scale renewable energy sources.  It will reduce energy bills and add to the State's overall renewable energy production portfolio.  Up to now, it is ordinary households and businesses that have paid high energy prices and paid for our switch to renewables.  They pay to support large-scale renewable energy through the public service obligation levy on their electricity bills and they pay the current carbon tax.  We cannot continue to place all the obligations on householders and small businesses.  We need to shift the burden from households, businesses and farmers towards those who profit most from energy, the suppliers.</p> <p>  The future growth in the use of electric vehicles, particularly cars, and heat pumps in homes will lead to electricity consumption increasing dramatically.  Allowing ordinary households and businesses produce their own energy means lower energy bills and higher rates of renewable power across the State.  We need to switch from fossil fuels and we can do it by getting everybody involved, not just large-scale developers.  Small-scale renewable energy has a part to play in the future energy solutions mix and we should not be resisting this practical solution to displacing some of our fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The Bill is straightforward in that it provides for microgeneration, whether from small-scale wind power, solar, combined heat and power using renewable sources, small-scale hydro and other technology that the Minister, under regulation, may deem suitable.  We set out that minimum price tariffs need to apply and, again, the Minister will have the discretion to set those, along with the Minister having the power to set minimum contractual terms for a tariff.  The Minister will also have other powers.</p> <p>  With regard to the 5% target, the idea is that if we do not set a target, we will not achieve anything.  We are setting out that suppliers which have over a certain percentage of the market must supply 5% of their electricity from microgeneration by 2025.  While we believe it is a realistic target, we are flexible about this.  Some of the bodies represented here, particularly the Department, have raised this issue with us.  We are flexible about it but we feel the need to set some kind of a target if we are going to get anywhere.  We feel it is a practical step.  While we are not saying that it is a silver bullet, we think it is part of the mix and is a contribution to moving the agenda forward and putting good legislation in place.</p></speech>

We have submitted our presentation as a form of record and I will just put out some highlights we would like to get across.  Microgeneration in Ireland and across Europe is the subject of a number of different definitions, so having a common understanding of what that means is important in the setting out of any Bill like this.  The price of microgeneration has come down significantly in recent years but, despite that fact, it is still expensive when setting the euro-per-kilowatt-hour cost against the delivery of renewable electricity by larger generation types.  It is widely accepted, however, that there are large societal benefits from getting communities, individuals, businesses and institutions, including schools, involved directly in the low-carbon transition.  In addition to this, it is important that the Department highlighted the renewable energy directive, which mandates that self-consumers, or those jointly acting as self-consumers, are entitled to remuneration for electricity they export that would reflect market value.</p> <p>  In Ireland there are a number of catalysts for microgeneration deployment and it is important to bear these in mind.  For example, part L of the building regulations sees approximately two thirds of new homes and a number of businesses having solar PV installed on their roofs .  The SEAI has supported solar PV through Government-funded retrofit programmes for a number of years.  This works through communities and through intermediaries such as Tipperary Energy Agency and others, but also through EXEED with large-scale industry.  For example, across 58 sites, 1.8 MW was deployed through those programmes in 2018 alone.  There is also the residential solar PV pilot that started at the end of July last year and has already seen interest of 3,000 people and deployment of 500 systems.  This looks at the residential sector in regard to PV panels but also battery storage and how that may interact with electric vehicles and other aspects, including heat pumps, as time goes on.  There is also the accelerated capital allowance to support businesses and there are TAMS - targeted agricultural modernisation scheme - grants for microgeneration installation in regard to pigs and poultry.  It is important to have those measures in mind as we think in the round of how we collectively nudge people towards microgeneration because there are a lot of, not conflicting, but different supporting measures in play at the moment.</p> <p>  We undertook a Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes survey last year across Ireland in respect of microgeneration.  It found that 7% of people had an intention to invest in microgeneration and the perceived value of the investment was the most important concern they had, with a societal concern second to that.  Interestingly, right now, people considering that they were going to invest would prefer a grant or a tax rebate.  As we look at a different method of incentivisation, how the market would propose that to someone is quite important.  It is a question of how the obligated party provides that value to a customer so they will move from preferring a grant to preferring some other type of incentive effect.  This is just an insight into the consumer we have.</p> <p>  There are a number of positive aspects to microgeneration.  It addresses the energy citizen and proposes a framework to address economic barriers.  A unique role is identified for community projects; community is very important and we are at the heart of that transition, with many others.  It is technology agnostic and, again, we feel this is important.  The flexibility around a minimum tariff and control of same is quite important to address how the market can shift.  There are a number of positives in this regard.</p> <p>  There are a couple of elements to consider in the context of SEAI operating Ireland's energy efficiency obligation scheme, which obligates the top 18 energy supply companies in the country to engage in energy efficiency.  In terms of scale, it saved, in the years 2014 to 2018, over &euro;200 million of avoided import costs and about 750,000 tonnes of CO2, so the impact and leverage this can have is not insignificant, and is equivalent to about 140,000 homes, 250,000 cars or 300,000 head of dairy cattle.</p> <p>  On foot of that experience, there are a couple of specific things we think would be worth consideration by the committee in its deliberations.  That strict definition of what is inside and what is outside the pot of microgeneration is quite important for everyone to understand.  Supply chain capability is important.  Deputy Stanley mentioned the proposed 5% target and we would see that as being quite large, not in terms of ambition and it is important to have ambition, but in terms of the supply chain being able to respond.  If that is just the exported electricity, it would see maybe 1.5 million homes and 300,000 businesses at the current scale of investment deploying this type of technology.  Considering the supply chain and the idea of people being able to come up that curve, we look at that target in the context of how we educate the supply chain.  This comes from our experience of working with the supply chain on those skills we need and the capacity required.  It would be worth considering in a little more detail.</p> <p>  The aspect relating to cost and equitable delivery is important in that obligated suppliers tend to divest that cost and pass it through to consumers, so how that is equitably pushed down the line is quite important.  Scaling and phasing is important in that, basically, one can inadvertently induce boom and bust scenarios if one has phases of development.  People rush to achieve a minimum target and then, when they achieve it, they drop sticks for a period and the industry can find it hard to flex up or flex down to that.</p> <p>  An important issue for the energy efficiency scheme, but which would also apply to this area, is that we would not inhibit people's ability to switch supplier.  That is encoded in the consumer's ability to switch from one electricity supplier to another and it is, in fact, being reinforced in the new energy efficiency directive.</p><p> When considering a Bill like this, committee members should take care to ensure that it aligns with the other types of incentive in place for large-scale renewables and microgeneration and that, as a renewable energy directive body comes down the line, it fits within the general tramlines that are set.</p><p> We look forward to engaging with queries and supporting the committee as it continues its deliberation.</p></speech>

I have prepared a submission that broadly covers the Bill.  The energy transition is not about just one technology.  Rather, it will take myriad forms beyond Government policy.  It must happen to every house, every journey, every building and every citizen.  In order for the transition to take hold, every one of these little opportunities must be taken.  To date, no regulatory decision made or funding programme employed has been done in a way that engages citizens.  We are all aware that, while much has happened, Ireland is clearly the climate laggard of Europe.  We have a fraction of what the rest of Europe has in terms of solar PV and other deployments of technology.  We have a huge hill to climb.  The State needs to take opportunities, one of which is microgeneration.  Notwithstanding the fact that it has to happen anyway in the renewable energy package, this opportunity should be taken as soon as possible.</p> <p>  As part of its deliberation on the Bill, the committee will be told by various parties that solar energy will not be sufficient for Ireland, we do not get much sun and we need a great deal of energy in winter.  Last June, the UK and Germany hit records for solar energy use, yet we hit records for gas use because there was no wind.  We need a mix.  Solar energy produces approximately 7% of Germany's electricity, with in or around two solar panels per person.  If Ireland was to catch up with Germany, that ratio would effectively provide for 10% to 12% of Ireland's electricity use and could be higher with some storage.  In Germany, 73% of this capacity, or 98% of systems, is small scale at less than 100 kW.  Germany has a more robust electricity infrastructure, and this microgeneration is predominantly citizen and farmer based.</p> <p>  We in the Tipperary Energy Agency believe that we should allow our citizens to partake in this energy transition and should view homes, farms and SMEs as part of the generation infrastructure.  The figure for rooftop solar in the North is approximately 50%, but I could not find the exact details.</p> <p>  Many members of the committee have visited buildings in Tipperary, including a leisure centre and school, that had small solar arrays on large, but otherwise empty, roofs.  It would have been more economically advantageous to put a full array on each roof when scaffolding and incurring transaction costs.  Why would we not use that generation to subsidise the running of such public facilities?</p> <p>  A number of barriers need to be removed if the Bill is to be effective.  Rather than increasing costs, we should remove them before the Bill is enacted.  We must ensure mandated power purchase agreements; that each meter, as part of the smart meter roll-out, has its export channel switched on, as it is currently switched off unless one pays &euro;300 to have it switched on; and that our planning permission system is revised.  In that context, I have submitted a paper containing some advice that we received from planners in Ireland.  It is on the record now.  The revision can happen quickly.</p> <p>  Grants for solar PV on domestic buildings would be a good measure.  It could also be a payment, but if the market soundings pointed to the grant being a better idea, we would support that.  However, export should be paid at at least the wholesale price.  We should allow people to generate as much as they can sensibly on a roof within the cost-effective nature of the technology.  For commercial enterprises like farms and SMEs, though, we should probably use something like a solar feed-in tariff, with a wholesale price plus an appropriate uplift that makes the investment attractive but not overly costly.  The State would only be paying to subsidise the export.  Someone installing a large solar farm would have to pay for all of that generation.  However, if someone installed 6 kW generation on a house and used three quarters of it, the State would only be paying for the small bit that household exported.  We would get much more bang for our buck, as this scheme could be cheaper than the larger arrays.</p> <p>  The reasons the committee will be given for not supporting solar energy in this way will always start with the challenge of spending money on upgrading the grid.  Given that we must move from approximately 18% of our energy through electricity to somewhere in the region of 40% to 50%, depending on which model one uses in the electrification of heat and transport, the grid will have to transform.  It needs to be digitised and to have the transmission capacity to power cars and heat pumps.  We believe that the grid capacity should be in a position to grow gradually to accommodate both.  That study has not been done in Ireland, but it is put on the regulators' asset bases across the rest of Europe.  We would support that here.</p> <p>  Members will hear a great deal about support schemes being expensive.  Due to expensive German support schemes, though, that will not be the case.  We are not Germany.  We are not Australia and will not have solar power in the winter.  Australia is much closer to the equator than us.  Therefore, most of our homes will stay connected to the electricity grid.  One of the arguments is that they will disconnect from the grid, but that will not happen in Ireland because we do not get much sun in the four winter months.</p> <p>  We should put citizens first, encourage active prosumers and use the rooftops as an encouragement to unlock the energy transition.  Someone spilling electricity onto the grid would view an electric car or heat pump as a good use of that power, but we should still incentivise people a little.</p> <p>  Solar is not a silver bullet for energy.  It will only cover a fraction of our total energy use.  However, it may be the silver bullet of citizen and societal engagement in the energy transition that the State has heretofore missed.  Why would it not be?  It was in Germany.</p> <p>  The energy transition is not going to happen without market development supports from organisations like local energy agencies.  Any rapid societal transformation requires societal support.  The modernisation of agriculture did not happen without large-scale State intervention in training and modernisation.  There are local services for the provision of myriad State services, from schools and MABS to childcare committees and sports partnerships.  Without that societal support, governed and run to achieve a transition, it will be almost impossible to achieve the requisite change at a societal level.  I ask this and the parallel committee to consider supporting energy agencies at a local or regional level with a strong public remit.</p></speech>

Friends of the Earth met the current Taoiseach at Electric Picnic a few years ago.  He signed our petition to support a fair payment for solar power.  At a food truck late at night, our director spoke to him.  He considered the petition, smiled and said: "A fair payment seems reasonable.  I cannot see anything wrong with that."  Now he is our Taoiseach.  This issue is one of fairness.  The petition now has almost 21,000 signatures, and I thank the Chair for accepting it today.</p> <p>  Ireland's record on climate change is not inspiring.  Despite agreeing to do so, we have failed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in any significant way.  Like the Taoiseach, I am not proud of our reputation as the climate laggards of Europe.  People are angry about that and scared.  This committee is well aware of the terrifying reality of climate change and the injustice that those who have done the least to cause it are suffering, and will continue to suffer, its worst effects.  It is painfully unfair.</p> <p>  As scared and angry as people are about climate change, they are also motivated to participate in and embrace solutions that transition our energy system from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  This is where our communities come into it.  Ireland excels at the community level.  We have a rich history of community spirit, for example, organisations like the GAA and Tidy Towns.  Supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, a network of more than 200 sustainable energy communities are working around the country developing plans to decarbonise their towns and villages, create jobs locally and build local resilience.  When it comes to renewable energy generation, though, they have been severely constrained and restricted in their efforts.  They cannot do it.  This is not because they are lazy or not committed enough or because they have not thought about it hard enough, but because the rules for generating energy do not work for communities and citizens.  Rather, they work against them.</p><p>It is not only about selling power.  As Mr. Kenny articulated, the rules around connecting to the grid and planning permission do not work for small generators.  It is too difficult.</p><p> We at Friends of the Earth are working to support a network of local power generators with some of the truly inspirational energy co-operatives to build community-based virtual power plants.  This is a system where communities and individuals invest in renewable energy generation, the power is sold into the grid and other members of the communities can buy it back.</p><p> We are also supporting those communities to install solar panels on the schools in their locality.  With initial support from a philanthropic trust, we have applied for match funding through the SEAI grants programme to put solar panels on schools.  Schools are beacons of the community.  They are centres of education and they host the people who in our country will be most affected by climate change.</p><p> Students were invited to come up with ideas on what they would do on the energy transition.  We were overwhelmed by the number and quality of applicants and, to help pick the winners, held an online public vote which in one week received 20,000 hits.  Not surprisingly, students in Ireland want to play their part in the solution.  Under normal circumstances, however, it does not make sense for a school to invest in microgeneration because schools are not open 50% of the days in the year.  However, energy bills come out of capitation budgets and every euro not spent on energy bills is a euro for the students.  If income could be generated from the roof, there would be more money directly for the schools.</p><p> Unfortunately, for the likes of these projects to be replicated and scaled up, a business case is necessary.  That is the reality.  For people and groups to take the decision to support a sustainable energy development, the power that they generate needs to be measured, to be counted and to be valued.  Not paying ordinary citizens and communities for renewable energy is akin to supermarkets only paying corporate farmers and forcing small farmers to eat all they produce or give it away for free.</p><p> Microgeneration may not offer the megawatts of renewable power that will put us on track to our Paris Agreement obligations and it may be marginally more expensive - we will certainly need continued investment in major energy infrastructure and large-scale renewable development - but if we do not offer people the opportunity to fairly benefit from this energy transition, to see, touch and feel these technologies locally, their fears and opposition, however rational or irrational, will derail any best laid plans.  Currently, our energy subsidies are paid to professional developers, large utilities and semi-State organisations with a charge on all consumers' bills.  The forthcoming renewable electricity support scheme will include further subsidies and includes a separate subsidy for community led projects which are bigger than microgeneration, but, notably, not at first.  That is not fair either.  While any subsidy regime can have distributional impacts, we see no logic for demanding that bill payers only subsidise professional developers, and why rooftop generators or community generators are different from these other actors.  They should be able to benefit the same as the big guys.</p><p> The benefits could be huge.  A recent study by European think tank, CE Delft, estimated that almost half of EU citizens could be producing almost half the EU's energy by 2050.  From a national point of view, as far back as 2014, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, recommended building social support to enable continued wind-energy development and strongly supported community and citizen participation to realise local benefit.  The White Paper on Energy recommends paying market generators.  The Citizens' Assembly similarly included paying microgeneration.  It is going to happen.  As has already been outlined, it is only a matter of time.  The EU has granted new rights for consumers to produce, store, consume and sell renewable energy.  The only choice we now have, and the committee has, is whether we get dragged, kicking and screaming into it by Europe at a later date or we welcome it now and do it ourselves.  In doing so, we would build the democratic, fair and renewable energy system we need.  Climate change is not waiting.  We need to completely transform our energy system.  Let us give some power to the people to do it.  We are supporting this Bill.</p></speech>

Before I go to the members, I have one question on the engagement process and, of course, the importance of microgeneration, which will form a crucial part of that transition to a low-carbon economy.  Could any of the witnesses who want to come on this address how best to engage with, perhaps not those who are involved in the local community project but the not-in-my-back-yard objections that come in, especially to wind turbines?  Could they give examples of the best form of communicating with the local community?  Solar panels on one's roof are probably easier and maybe more publicly accepted.  I ask them, in the case of wind generators, about overcoming the obstacles in community engagement and buy-in.  I think we all are on board in relation to having community ownership and shares, being able to tap into the grid, and getting a payment or feed-in tariff.  However, the negatives are something of which we need to be aware as a committee.  For any legislation to be successful, the roll-out and communication of it will be key.  It would be useful to hear of any obstacles the witnesses would be aware of that we need to be able to flag as a committee in order to get this over the line.  Do any of the witnesses want to come in on that?  Mr. Kenny may want to come in first, and then I will go to the committee.</p></speech>

There are many papers and I am sure the Department has seen a lot of them.  The high-level design of the renewal electricity support scheme is very good.  My only complaint is urgency.  Let is get it done.  The Department could do with some resources to deliver that scheme quicker.</p> <p>  What has been seen in other parts of Europe has been that it should be equitable and fair.  The big issue we have had is that someone will go stick a turbine beside a person's house and make lots of money and the resident will make no money.  People will listen to it if there is equity and fairness.  There will be a fertile ground to listen to whether they are good or bad whereas if there is no fairness, all they will listen to is the negative impact.  We see that people who live very close to the turbines they own themselves are quite happy to listen to the noise, as that swoosh is money going into their bank account.  We should learn from Denmark in that regard, and the Department has.  The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is very supportive of that.</p> <p>  The only other point I would make in terms of the communication is that when it comes to some of the issues people will raise in terms of the negative stuff around noise and shadow flicker, there should be clear guidelines, good support and good evidence-based science from an official point of view.  The HSE stating this does not affect people's health is very important to undermine the contrary parts of society.  My only other advocacy is to say let us be clear on the message.</p></speech>

It is important that we do not conflate microgeneration with large-scale generation, especially from a societal perspective.  People experiencing small-scale generation that is their own will tie them in to that transition and they will understand that the need for a flat screen television, a tablet, and a phone, and an electric vehicle, demands wires.  It demands generation.  However, if we bring those two together, it would not be healthy for a microgeneration scheme.  That ownership and that community or individual benefit are far more important.</p> <p>  It is different in that, through the new Part L of the building regulations, two thirds of new homes have these on their roofs anyway.  This type of Bill, or this type of intervention, should it come through the renewable energy directive, RED, is a new mechanism to bring this to be or to increase volume but it is not a new technology.  It is normal, and what we are changing is the equitable sharing of value from the technology.  It is really important that this is just normal.  Let us not treat it like an alien, new or strange technology where there is fear.  This is already part of what we do.  Let us just make sure that as we increase volume, there is an equitable transition.  Conflating this with large-scale generation would cause more problems than not.  Mr. Kenny has articulated quite clearly that the new RESS addresses community involvement quite well.</p></speech>

I support what Mr. Gannon and Mr. Kenny have said.  It is the same issue around electric vehicles and getting somebody to make that transition to move into a space where he or she sees himself or herself now as part of the protection of the environment and one is effectively appointing an ambassador.  As Ms Ruddock and others have said, it will not change the pace of the overall requirement to generate electricity, which has to come from the large-scale developments, but if one can get somebody involved within his or her home or the curtilage of his or her site, that person becomes an ambassador for climate change in so many other ways because one gets that person thinking.  There is much research to show that when people make the transition to an electric vehicle, they change so many other aspects of their lives, whether it is even just the disposal of their waste, which is a separate energy piece.</p><p>This is some very good research that shows that people's entire habits and behaviour are being changed, which is really what we want.  It also assists in the wider community because while it might not be suitable for me, if it is suitable for my neighbour, it is discussed.  We know that one of the greatest ways of effecting any public change is getting people talking about it and this does so.</p><p> I received some queries recently about a belief that there is an issue in some legislative form that is preventing access to the grid from wind and potentially solar at the same site.  Are the witnesses aware of any impediments that might prevent a solar or wind farm accessing the grid at the same point?  Is there some issue around co-location?  Have the witnesses heard anything about that?  Is there anything they are aware of that would prevent that?</p></speech>

I can check this out to be definite but we do not currently facilitate what are called hybrid connections or co-location.  It is something that is topical because it would allow through the same point of connection one would have in this instance, for example, a wind-type turbine beside a solar array, but my understanding is that from a regulatory perspective, that is not permitted at the moment.  It is something we are certainly considering.  There are many issues around climate generally and this is one of the topics that comes up.</p></speech>

This statement does not provide any encouragement regarding the changeover from the massive production of power we see through carbon emissions to where we need to get to, which is what Ms Ruddock and the people from Tipperary described, namely, people buying into the microgeneration of electricity and seeing it as being part of life and something from which their communities and families can gain.  According to Mr. Manley's logic, the only reason there would be a problem is that it undermines the idea that the State always encourages and supports the large generators rather than the community and individually based generators of supply.</p> <p>  It links in with the question put to Mr. Manley by the Chairman about why NIMBYism around this exists.  The reason there is NIMBYism around the generation of electricity in somebody's background is obvious.  It is because it involves massive noisy towers standing over somebody's home when it is evident that there is no facility to encourage localised and community-based production.  Mr. Manley's submission really says it.  Surely the idea that a reduction in demand from the grid because of micro-energy would result in higher prices for everybody else is a product of throwing the electricity market wide open.  We did not have had that problem when we just had the ESB, but now that the market is open to all this vicious competition, that is the reason a reduction in the demand from the grid would mean that everybody else has to pay more because the Department is concerned about the profits of the large generators.  If the State is keen on reducing our CO2 emissions and hitting our targets, it would not take this position.  It would take a different position and say this is exciting and possible and will give communities in the Aran Islands access to the grid instead of shutting it down.</p> <p>  When we moved an amendment to the Energy Act two years ago to permit communities like those on the Aran Islands to gain access to the grid, we were told we could not have that.  Ms Ruddock mentioned schools and the production of solar power.  Students in a wonderful school in Sutton carried out a brilliant project proving how they could generate enough power to fuel their school and make money if they could get access to the grid.  This is precisely the sort of model about which Ms Ruddock spoke, but they still meet a blank wall.  I think this flies in the face of any genuine sincerity about reaching our targets on CO2 emissions and being able to keep our house in order on that level.  That is a lot of criticism but the Department's position is a contradiction and I would like Mr. Manley to explain it.  It is worth listening to groups like Friends of the Earth and Tipperary Energy Agency and its experience of delivering micro-energy rather than thinking it must all be about the large powerhouses.</p></speech>

Most of what the witnesses from Friends of the Earth and Tipperary Energy Agency have said is a cause of no great dispute.  There is no good argument against it.  The theme I was trying to deliver on this note is that the Minister has made plain, and the Department is obviously <i>ad idem</i>, that there is a shared ambition to increase community, citizen and microgeneration on the system.  We think it is a very important part of the future and that people must have that ownership of it.<br/><br/>There are two aspects regarding the impact of it.  Electricity is in the emissions trading scheme, ETS, sector.  Our focus is often on our targets in the non-ETS sector.  Where we make changes in the electricity system, they do not tend to benefit hugely in terms of meeting our non-ETS targets, which are very much focused around transport, heating and agriculture.  A target of 5% in a sector that is a small part of total carbon emissions is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on our carbon targets.  That was the point I was making.  I apologise if I made it clumsily but that was the message that was very much there.  <br/><br/>We are strongly of the view that citizens must be part of the future.  This is a theme coming from Europe, but it has also been embraced in Ireland for some considerable time.  Meetings on the Green Paper were held throughout 2014 and 2015.  There was consultation on the renewable electricity support, RES, scheme.  We published, probably for the first time by any Department, a very detailed economic analysis and a community analysis of the RES scheme.  I do not think anybody has ever published that kind of detailed granular data before - right down to different technologies.<br/><br/>Mr. Gannon reflected on schools.  There is a real challenge in the alignment.  Schools' peak demand is in November, December and January while peak solar is in June, July and August.  There is a real mismatch in how that is handled.  There will also be commercial generators, some small and some large.  The question arises as to how we manage the market mix.  We must transpose the vast majority of the clean energy package and the directives in there by 2021.  We must put communities at the centre of the market.  Looking at the Bill, our question is whether it is the best and most cost-effective way of doing this.<br/><br/>Regarding the grid, it is not so much about the level of demand.  It looks as if we are going to see growth in energy.  In particular, if we electrify heat and transport, this will drive its own piece.  It is how we share it.  If I choose to put in solar and biomass and use very little of the grid, I will need it periodically and will only pay a contribution to the grid for the bit I need, but I will benefit from it all the time, so how do we manage that?  How do we design a pricing scheme that is fair to all of us, not just those who might live in areas where they cannot afford to be involved?  I hope that covers the points that were made.</p></speech>

The Department is very exercised and committed.  We have had publications, seminars, White Papers and the Minister speaking every other day about the necessity of environmentally friendly projects.  I cannot understand why it is taking so long for the Department to establish a feed-in tariff for these projects, particularly solar energy.</p><p>In Tipperary, there are six projects for which land has been purchased, leasing agreements have been made with farmers and planning applications have been lodged.  Permission has been granted by the councils and there have been appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, yet there has been no action.  As late as last week, I brought a deputation to the Minister asking why it is taking so long to establish feed-in tariffs.  The ambition needs to be matched with action.  If people are investing in these projects, they need to know whether they are commercially viable before they continue to invest, and they need to know the exact business plan.  The business plan is based not only on the output but also on the tariff.  At what stage are the witnesses?  When can we expect finalisation?</p><p> I am familiar with the work of Tipperary Energy Agency.  I compliment and congratulate it.  It effectively started as a pilot project.  It has been involved in some fantastic environmental projects around Tipperary.  It has generated considerable awareness.  It is quite obvious that if one has a package and creates awareness, people will buy in.</p><p> The starting point concerns what we can control and influence, such as local authorities and their housing stock.  There has been a good retrofitting scheme in Tipperary but the problem is that the budget for it has been expended.  People did avail of it, however, and they were delighted to retrofit lighting and heating.</p><p> More pressure needs to be put on local authorities regarding planning, which must be conditioned in regard to how one heats one's home, and the use of domestic solar panels on the roof.  The major point from an energy perspective concerns the installation of heat pumps in homes.  This makes a difference and will conserve energy.  It makes a major difference to the carbon footprint.</p><p> Could Mr. Kenny outline the current remit of Tipperary Energy Agency?  How far does it extend?  Has there been any discussion or formulation of policy on extending it?</p></speech>

Our energy agency operates in and from Tipperary but not just for Tipperary.  With regard to expansion, we have made a submission to the other committee on supporting local energy agencies.  Right now, the energy agency is in receipt of programme funding from the European Investment Bank.  The programme, called ELENA, is funding technical assistance at local level, and this is allowing us to deliver many of the projects.  Without it, the challenge would be that the cost of providing expert services in homes, schools and elsewhere would not necessarily be fundable in terms of energy savings because fossil fuel prices are quite low by comparison with the costs of upgrades.  Without the support from the EIB, our scale of activity would be significantly lower.  The funding is coming from the Government through SEAI for many of the things we do.  They are very supportive of us but a lot of work is required to prepare the investments.  Without a conscious effort at national level to provide support at local level, it will be challenging to achieve the societal shift because homeowners and contractors must be educated at a micro level.  That is not fundable with a small portion of the funding through the current programmes.  It is a challenge.  There were 16 energy agencies in Ireland; two provide services to the public now.  The low number is because of a lack of support.  It is similar in other jurisdictions in Europe where there was not capacity support from state level for the local energy agencies.</p> <p>  The region of Upper Austria has approximately 1.4 million people.  It is a little bigger than Munster.  The regional energy agency there has achieved a 43% reduction in carbon emissions from buildings in a decade.  We could do the same.</p></speech>

With regard to microgeneration and support therefor, we have launched a pilot scheme.  It is providing the grants.  It is running into next year.  The objective is to harvest the data on costs, the technologies, how the technologies work, housing insulation, and how to build and develop the supply chain.  The Deputy is more focused on the renewable electricity support, RES, scheme.  The relevant guidelines in this regard are the European Commission's guidelines of 2014.  These change things profoundly.  Up to this, we provided the feed-in tariff for wind and other technologies under REFIT 1, REFIT 2 and REFIT 3 and the earlier AER measure.  The new RES scheme will be an auction-based system.  The high-level design paper for it was published in July last year.  We have been engaged with the European Commission going through the pre-state aid approval process, which is a formal consultation process.  Colleagues have been in Brussels working through it.  We are not yet in a position where we can make the final formal application.  We expect to do so in the coming months.  God willing, or the Commission willing, and once we get state aid approval, we will open the scheme and allow bidding.  The phasing is set out over the next period of decades.  The idea is to create auctions that are big enough to be competitive but not so big that everyone gets a piece of the pie.  I hope that will be happening later this year.  If the members want some more detail, my colleagues will happily give it.</p></speech>

Will it be a matter of the most economically advantageous?  Will there be separate auctions for nascent technologies?  Will the difference between offshore and onshore wind energy generation be considered?  If we go for the lowest common denominator, we are just dealing with onshore wind.  Is there any mechanism that will ensure an array or spread of technologies?  How do the delegates hope to get around that?</p></speech>

There will be a carve-out for community.  The intention is that the community would have a space within the auctions.  The second aspect is that there will be a designed levered in there.  We have to be careful because the model required by the Commission is an auction, which is effectively technology neutral, but we are trying to design in provisions and negotiate with the Commission on the use of levers that would mean we could give the kind of support the Deputy is talking about and yet preserve the integrity of the overall auction process.  That is part of the reason it is taking so long.</p></speech>

One figure that stood out among many is that the level of solar PD in our country is almost one fifteenth of that in Northern Ireland.  There have been controversies over various energy schemes in the North.  Its refit scheme might have been expensive but Northern Ireland is not exactly a solar powerhouse.  That it has 15 times our volume of solar power shows how we pretty much have nothing.  We are growing from nothing.  This speaks to the urgency.  I do not know exactly the extent of the fines the State will have to pay for missing its renewable energy targets; they depend on how much other countries exceed their targets.  Has the Department an estimate as to what the State may pay in fines per percentage point.  When will they kick in?</p> <p>  I apologise if my next question on auctions for larger-scale projects has been asked.  If so, the Chairman should please stop me.  I am aware there are various complexities.  Getting European clearance is not easy.</p><p>Given that the State is facing large and significant fines, the delay in the auction process means it will risk missing a range of wind plants that have planning and grid connection.  Surely it could be arranged to have the auction system in place early this year.  That is not a small decision; it will mean missing the renewables electricity target as well as being a mile short on renewable heat and renewable transport.  We have been working on this for a long time.  Is there any way the auction process could be speeded up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Manley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019030500002#H00200"><p>On the issue of fines, it helps to step back.  The 2009 renewable energy directive is a positive instrument.  It is not drafted in the same way as a road traffic law whereby people who exceed a certain speed have a penalty and a fine to pay.  It contains almost 30 articles, one of which creates a process whereby we could have a support scheme.  This is clearly in state aid territory.  It creates an opportunity to have joint schemes with other countries and the opportunity to use statistical transfers as a way of getting across.  There is no reference to fines in the directive.  It was very much written as a positive instrument and a guide to cajole, lead and drive forward the renewable energy portfolio.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are at, the figures published yesterday from the SEAI had just over 10% renewables at the end of 2017, with a target of 16% for 2020.  We are exercised by this and we could not be any other way.  The projections we have suggest the outturn in 2020 will be somewhere between 12.25% and 14.2%, if I am correct.  It is in that band.  This gives an indication of by how much we will miss the 16% target.  The mechanism we will then be required to use is statistical transfers.  As of 2016, 17 countries were behind and 11 countries were ahead with a surplus.  These countries have a surplus to sell.  There is no developed market yet.  The only trade to happen was between Luxembourg and Latvia.  In that instance, the trade was at &euro;30 million per percentage point.  This gives the order of what the multiplied figures would be if we hit 14.2% and we are able to buy at exactly those prices.</p> <p>  Fines could arise in one process.  In early 2021, the State will report the outturn in 2020.   The final report will be in 2022.  The European Commission could take a view that it had not achieved the target and would seek to bring it before the European Court of Justice and it would be up to the court to seek to impose a remedy.  There are issues to understand in this.  We were at 3.1% renewables when the directive was written.  We were given a target of 16%.  Despite the fact that in the period from 2007 to 2013 we went through a dramatic financial adjustment, we will come in somewhere between 80% and 90% of target.  It is very different in the case of carbon with regard to targets.  There is no provision for fines in the directive.  The mechanism most likely to be availed of will be statistical transfers.  Reporting to the Commission will be in the first quarters of 2021 and 2022.</p></speech>

The Latvian deal at &euro;30 million a tonne is unlikely.  Marie Donnelly estimated it could cost &euro;200 million a tonne  at a previous committee meeting.  If 17 countries are behind and 11 in surplus, the market is likely to be much tighter than the Latvian deal.</p></speech>

To be quite honest, we are seeking to get more information and more understanding of where other countries are at on the overall equation.  The Deputy is correct that the Department published figures in 2013 and 2014 that were higher based on estimates at that stage.  It is uncertain but there is a range.</p></speech>

When Mr. Kenny came before the committee almost a year ago, he made the point that 67% of new build housing in Ireland provides for fossil fuel heating systems.  Given where we will have to go on the climate change targets we will have to meet, in all likelihood we will pay to take them out in the coming decades.  Why would we not immediately state, as the Dutch and Swedes have done, that we will have no more fossil fuels in domestic houses?  Heat pump technology can bridge the gap.  That would promote solar photovoltaic heating, heat pumps and renewable alternatives at no cost to the Exchequer with great clarity, simplicity and speed.  Why is this not introduced this by law immediately?</p></speech>

The support schemes offered by the SEAI and funded by the Department no longer support fossil fuel central heating systems.  More important, Part L of the building regulations effectively requires buildings to be brought up to a BER rating of A3, which is a high level of energy efficiency.  Some developers are developing a combination of solar panels and gas.  The buildings are so efficient that the energy use is minuscule.  I ask the Deputy to bear with me because I take his point on why we do not go to the next step and it is a fair question.  The revisions of Part L will require new buildings to be upgraded to a BER rating of A2, at which stage the current level of heat pump installation, which is high, will automatically step into that space.</p></speech>

There is major controversy about this.  In the US, there is outrage at the exportation of large areas of clear fell and natural forest for power generation by companies such as Drax.  This is an environmental crime.  Added to this judgment, the State is looking to put an end to support for renewable biomass power generation where biomass would be combined with peat, which is another inexcusable measure in an environmental context.  Is the Department considering any change to the renewables directive in terms of support for biomass given the controversy?  As an adjunct to this, is the Department considering a further increase in the percentage of biofuels as a blending-in option?  This is the main reason the State has been meeting its transport target.  There are similar significant environmental concerns, even with the protections in European legislation, regarding the sustainability of the land use effects of biodiesel, particularly palm oil plantations in Indonesia.  Is the Department still very much counting on us using biomass?  This could range from large power stations down to smaller domestic applications.  What is their role in meeting our targets?  Will there be a further increase in biofuel blending and biodiesel?</p></speech>

At that stage, we will have reached the blend wall, that is, the capacity of existing engines to manage the blend in of the biofuel.  Beyond this, we are looking at different biofuels that would have to be either a drop-in biofuel that could totally replace the fuel or to be blended with it without the issues that arise.  We are at an impasse on this.  We largely share supply chains for fuels with the UK and it is in the same place as us on this.  We will have to keep in touch to see where it will go and whether it can go further.</p> <p>  On biomass, the renewable energy directive introduces new and much more stringent requirements for its sustainability as a fuel source.  The current REFIT 3 scheme has provided support to the three plants on a co-firing basis.  Two are seeking planning consent at and they are in process so I do not want to say anything on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question related to the future of Moneypoint, which has not yet been decided.</p></speech>

A refusal to issue a money message would be a cynical way to put the brakes on the legislation.  Any fair reading of the Bill will show that the issue of a money message does not arise.</p> <p>  Reference was made to self-consumption.  This Bill would not end self-consumption.  As other speakers said, energy can still be retained because the Bill addresses the issue of surplus energy.  The feed-in tariff is a big issue.  Householders, small businesses or farmers will not invest in something unless there is some guarantee and certainty around the return on investment.</p> <p>  On efficiency, managing the grid and the technology, I am not an engineer but some of the research we have done shows that up to 15% of electricity leaks from the grid.  The closer electricity is generated to where it is used, the less is used.  Some of the representatives of industry we met in the past couple of years have told us this.  I highlight this point because it is important to note that the level of leakage reduces when electricity is generated close to where it is used.</p> <p>  I agree with the point made about small-scale and large-scale energy generation.  The Bill makes provision for small community projects, home generation and farms.  As I have pointed out previously, many of the larger cattle sheds being erected are south facing and there is no reason they should not be fitted with large solar panels.  I have seen cattle sheds in Deputy Lowry's constituency of Tipperary with lovely south-facing roofs that would catch a large amount of energy.  It is about harnessing that energy, not only using solar panels but also through small-scale wind and hydro generation.  There is considerable agreement on the citizen and community element.  Savings will be achieved through reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the development of microgeneration and having other sources of power.  Nearly 25 years ago, when some of us started talking about waste reduction and recycling we were told Irish people would never do that.  Those who made that argument were wrong.  We can make further progress on the waste front.  There is an appetite for change in terms of energy generation.</p> <p>  The Minister, the Department and others who deal with this issue argue that we must be careful in how we proceed.  I am not saying this in a totally negative way but they are being over-cautious.  Civil servants are cautious by nature and sometimes they must be for good reason.  This has all been done before.  Germany has been highlighted and other states are doing this.  They have pushed the boat out on this issue.  Ireland has introduced all sorts of madcap schemes in other areas of industry and made huge investments that did not work out.  This proposal is very modest.  When we are a bit bold and ambitious we can be very good in bringing about change.  Mr. Paul Kenny from the Tipperary Energy Agency is here.  We have had contact with that agency, which has done major research and brought considerable expertise to the whole area.  No one who visited the company - Deputies from political parties and Independents, officials and journalists with whom I spoke afterwards - was anything but impressed with the examples of what that agency has achieved in Tipperary within the strictures and confines of how the system currently operates.</p> <p>  Some of us want to change and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and the import bill for expensive fossil fuels, which will become more expensive.  With Brexit imminent and America shaping up for trade wars, supply will become more precarious.  As an island, we cannot cut ourselves off from the world but we can do much more with regard to generating our own sources of power.  The Tipperary Energy Agency has shown how this can be done.  There is growing awareness among the public, particularly young people and schoolchildren, of the need for change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  People who have travelled to other countries see living examples of this happening and it is time that we caught up.</p> <p>  In the main, the presentations were positive around the need to do all of this.  I am flexible about amending and improving the Bill.  I realise it is on Second Stage but we need to accelerate the process and move the Bill on.  I thank the witnesses for being here.</p></speech>

I wish to note the timing and remind everyone present of fairness and the potential for public outrage if we delay and wait until the EU forces us to bring in microgeneration and the sale of microgenerated energy.  There has been some discussion of the renewal electricity support scheme, which is very good.  I strongly welcome the scheme but I agree that it should be implemented faster and that the Department needs many more staff.  I am concerned that we would have the renewable electricity support scheme but nobody in the public arena will know the names of the different subsidy schemes.  There may be professional onshore wind developers getting a subsidy and people will see that smaller microgenerators and community projects are not receiving the same level of subsidy, or they may not even be entitled to get it.  The Department is trying to bring forward a community-led project in the first auction but the smaller generators are not included in the first auction.  They are for down the line in the future.  There are shovel-ready community owned projects ready to go.  If we could arrange the timing in such a way that people could see they are able to participate in this transition, this will progress much faster and in a much fairer way.  The Minister has spoken a great deal about needing to bring people with us on the climate change challenge that we have to overcome.

If I ever appeared to be bold before the Committee of Public Accounts, it was not very nice.  Caution does arise over time.</p> <p>  With regard to the Bill, the key message is, as we say at home, is "I am not agin it."  The question is how we make all of the elements work within the objective.  I am aware it has been suggested that we may be dragged kicking and screaming by the EU into this.  That is not actually the case.  Ireland was very supportive of the clean energy package.  The previous Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, was very supportive and co-signed letters of ambition in areas such as energy efficiency when some other Ministers were a little more hesitant.</p> <p>  This is not an issue of big versus small.  We will need utility scale generation.  Hospitals cannot survive on a small collection of generators.  They need big, reliable and very secure generation.  Equally, we are very much of the view that citizens and communities have different roles, whether generating for personal use with solar panels or whether working with neighbours.  The question is how we design the balance on this.  We must have the directive on renewable energy sources, RES, transposed by June 2021.  We have a huge amount of work to do in consulting people to find out their views.</p> <p>  One of the hallmarks of one of the more recent interventions by the Department - and it has been acknowledged in the contributions on the renewable energy sources or RES directive - has been around asking people what works.  In the past two years, behavioural economics students in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, have been looking at issues such as drivers and motivators, what people listen to and whether a grant is better than a fee payment.  This is one of the occasions when I have been more in agreement with all of the contributors around this table than on many previous occasions.  We know this dialogue does not end today and will keep running.</p></speech>

They are here discuss the refugee situation in Syria and related matters and they are all very welcome, as are our guests in the Gallery.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  Members are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are completely turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members just to put their phones on silent mode as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person, official or body outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

Each organisation has shared a briefing paper in advance.  We will each talk about the situation from the perspective of our own organisations.</p> <p>  I will begin with Concern's experience in this regard.  Concern is working in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey.  Concern was here briefing the same committee four and a half years ago.  It is unfortunate that we are still talking about the crisis in Syria.  Since then, the war has raged on.  Some 500,000 people have been killed and 6.5 million Syrians are living in the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt.  Many families have been torn apart and many lives have been shattered as a result of this crisis.  While the bombing has stopped in many parts of Syria, there is no sign of peace.  Active conflict continues and even as we speak people are fleeing for their lives.  The regime has regained control of a large part of the country but a few areas such as Idlib and the north east are still controlled by other groups.</p><p>Normality in Syria today is barely tolerable for many of the people.  Thousands have been displaced on numerous occasions and the conditions are appalling.  The past winter has been extremely hard.  Thanks to Irish Aid support, Concern has been providing tents, stoves and blankets to help keep people warm and survive the bitter winter.  Throughout 2018, Concern supported 1 million people in Syria, most of whom were fleeing the conflict.</p><p> On a more positive note, we are also supporting people who are living in more stable conditions with agriculture inputs and vocational training.  This offers them hope, bolsters their courage and gives them confidence to rebuild their lives.  If stability was maintained and Concern had more funding, we would like to spend much more of our effort and time on helping people to recover from the war.</p><p> At the end of January and in early February, I visited Lebanon.  It was just after the third flood of 2019 had hit.  I met several families from Syria who were living in below-basic standards.  It was freezing cold.  I was freezing and could not get warm.  The refugees described their misery and their deepening levels of poverty.  One woman, Aisha, outlined how her husband was tortured while they were in Syria, and is now in ill health and unable to work.  She was taking her 13 year old son from school to try to earn a meagre living for herself, her husband and their boy's other three siblings.  This, as I learned, is what many other families are doing.  Rates of child labour are increasing enormously.  The incidence of child marriage has also increased greatly.</p><p> Of all the women and families I met, when I inquired if they would like to return to Syria, not one was willing to do so.  Among the reasons are that their homes have been blasted and they have nothing to return to.  They are too fearful to go back as they risk conscription or being detained again.  The clear message is that while the bombing has stopped, there is no peace there.</p><p> Lebanon is the size of Munster.  It has a population of 4 million but now hosts 1 million Syrian refugees, thus making one in four of the population a Syrian refugee.  Neighbouring Turkey hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees and it has brought in legislation that allows many of those refugees to access basic services such as education and healthcare.</p><p> There are many tragedies from the Syrian crisis but one of the biggest is that more than 1 million babies have been born to Syrians living in exile.  These babies, along with hundreds of thousands of other children, have very little access to education.  I urge that we ensure there is no lost generation.  Education is a right for everybody and offers hope for the future.  Unfortunately for Concern, our education program in Lebanon is at risk due to funding constraints.</p><p> The scale, severity and complexity of the humanitarian needs of people in Syria remain extensive.  I thank Irish Aid and the Irish public for all the support they have given to Concern and other organisations that helps us to alleviate the sufferings of Syrians, whether in Syria or neighbouring countries.  I call on the Government, despite all of the support it has given, to do a lot more.</p><p> There are three asks.  The first is that we develop new energetic initiatives in continuing to use the voice and influence it has where it can bring to long-lasting peace.  In this process it should call on women and promote women's leadership so they can be involved in the peace process that will lead to lasting peace.  The second is to honour the commitments the Government has already made, including in the context of the global compact for refugees, as mentioned in the White Paper launched last week by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That commitment supports refugees who want to return to Syria and host governments in the region.</p><p>Our final ask of the Government is that at minimum the level of funding Irish Aid has been providing towards the Syrian crisis is sustained.  Ideally, we would like it to be increased so more can be done to help through the emergency response and to help people recover in the longer term.</p></speech>

GOAL has been operational in Syria since 2013, with offices in Idlib governorate in north-west Syria.  Our programme in Syria is the largest humanitarian intervention in GOAL's history.  In 2018, we supported almost 1 million conflict-affected people with services in the areas of food, water, sanitation and hygiene and emergency response.</p> <p>  GOAL has more than 400 staff on the ground in Syria.  Our colleagues in Syria work in arguably the most dangerous and complex environment in the world.  Since the conflict began, we have lost four colleagues in brutal attacks.  It is an enormous privilege for us that my colleague, Mustafa Al Manla, our emergency programme co-ordinator in Syria, can be with us today to tell his story and describe GOAL's lifesaving interventions in the region.</p></speech>

I am from Kafr Karmin, a village outside Aleppo in north-west Syria.  Until 2012, I was an English language teacher, responsible for more than 80 students.  The year 2012 was very difficult for me because that was when I left Syria and left behind my family, including my mother, father, sisters and brothers.  I left my land and house and the students whom I used to teach.  In 2012, I walked through the border to Turkey.  I had decided to do something important to support those suffering from the conflict on a daily basis and reduce their suffering.  I am here today to tell the committee how Syrian people suffer what I have also experienced.  The majority of them have lost their homes and land.  They have been living in camps and tents for nine years without any opportunity to have a livelihood.  They have lost everything.  They used to be teachers like me or doctors, farmers or nurses.</p> <p>  As Ms Van Lieshout mentioned, I work as the emergency programme co-ordinator.  My main area of responsibility is north Syria.  I have been in this role for more than three years and in that time I have seen the infrastructure of the area destroyed and millions of people lose their homes, jobs, schools and livelihoods and their lives.</p> <p>  What we do at GOAL is very practical.  We give cash, food items such as sugar, olive oil and rice, and non-food items such as tents, mattresses, blankets and even toothpaste.  Imagine, the people being served by GOAL do not even have toothpaste.  Our services are keeping people alive.  In addition, through our lifesaving WASH programme, we pump 1 million litres of water every week, supporting 750,000 people through piped water.  As committee members may know, in Syria piped water is very rare.  We also support 32 bakeries through providing yeast and flour.  This ensures that 600,000 people have proper access to fresh bread every day.  This package of three vital humanitarian services is lifesaving for these people.</p> <p>  I know how important this work is.  Thousands of people have had their lives destroyed.  We have doctors pleading for any type of job just to have something in their pockets to cover their urgent needs.  We need to look at the livelihoods of all of these displaced people.</p><p>As members heard, there is a huge number, amounting to 6.2 million.  We need to consider their livelihoods.  It is a big problem.</p><p> What we are doing is vital.  It is also very dangerous.  Four of my colleagues have lost their lives in air strikes.  My colleagues work in a war zone every day.  They are always thinking about what will happen to their families if they die.  I see the worry they carry every day.  Every day the children hear bombs and see air strikes.  This has become the norm but, as members know, it is not normal.</p><p> It is important to air the view that children are the next generation.  It is the responsibility of us all to take care of them.  We should not forget the humanitarian worker.  We must recognise the courage of the humanitarian workers who are risking their lives every day to support those in great need of humanitarian services.  GOAL provides the basics - food, tents and cash -  but it is still not enough to cover what is needed to survive.  As a result of this conflict, 6.2 million people have been internally displaced.  Every one of these has a story like mine.  Two million of them have been displaced to north-west Syria, where GOAL is fully operational.  Those are the people directly benefiting from the GOAL programme.</p><p> I thank all our donors and the members for listening to my story.  This is the greatest humanitarian crisis in decades.  I thank the Irish Government and Irish Aid for supporting us.  Please stay with us.  We need your support more than ever.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019030500002#G00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today on this important issue.  The Syrian crisis, now in its ninth year, continues to be one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world.  Of a population of 22 million people originally, nearly six million have been forced out of Syria as refugees and over six million have been displaced inside the country.  An estimated 500,000 have been killed in the conflict.</p> <p>  Tr&oacute;caire, working with local organisations, is providing humanitarian assistance in both Lebanon and Syria.  It includes the provision of food, shelter, basic household commodities, especially during the recent harsh winter months, and support with counselling and psychosocial assistance to deal with the traumas of conflict.  We support people with skills and vocational training so their years in asylum are not completed wasted.  We are very grateful for the funding we have received from the Irish Government and EU and the significant contributions we have received from the public in Ireland.</p> <p>  When it comes to the questions of whether Syrian refugees are displaced people and would like to go home, the answer is certainly that they would.</p> <p>  If one is a Syrian living in Lebanon, one most likely lives on less than US $2.90 per day, the minimum required to live in Lebanon.  Over half of all Syrians in Lebanon live below this threshold.  One probably does not work, and only 43% have informal work.  The proportion is only 16% among women.  One depends on borrowing money.  Nearly nine out of every ten households are heavily in debt. One is at least partially dependent on humanitarian assistance, but that assistance is not dependable.  According to the UN, in 2018 only 44% of overall humanitarian funding was received.  It is possible that one lives in a building but approximately one third of households, or nearly half if they are female-only households, live in tents or other unsuitable conditions, in a climate where temperatures can rise to the high thirties in summer and drop to sub-zero in the winter.  One's children are unlikely to go to school, and more than half of refugee children aged between three and 17 are still out of school in Lebanon.  One is unlikely to have a legal permit allowing one to stay in Lebanon, and 73% of Syrians do not have one, so one will spend one's time avoiding roads with checkpoints, work in the black economy, often under exploitative conditions, and hope one's employer does not report one, all in fear of being arrested and taken to the Syrian border.</p><p>With all of this, one's focus is on surviving day to day.  A person who ever thinks about the future has no idea what it holds for him, her or their family and they are very dependent on others, leaders in the region and in the international community, to determine their future.</p><p> Faced with these hardships as refugees, of course these people would consider returning home to Syria.  The UN agency for refugees, the UNHCR, states that over 16,000 Syrians returned from Lebanon to Syria in 2018.  However, there are still over 1 million Syrians living in Lebanon.  They make up one quarter of the country&rsquo;s population and, of course, the Government of Lebanon is encouraging people to return.  There are lots of push factors.  A Syrian living in Lebanon and thinking of returning to Syria has to consider the following matters.  They are likely to be unemployed and over half the population of Syria are unemployed.  Over 50% of the social services infrastructure has either been destroyed or is not operational, so they are likely to be without water, healthcare and other social services.  It is likely that a person's home has either been destroyed during the conflict or is occupied, and in a recent survey over 65% of people said this was the case.</p><p> What really makes the decision very difficult, if people are thinking about returning, is the fear for their own security.  Conscription exists for 18 to 42 year olds and avoidance is punishable by five years' imprisonment or being forcibly conscripted upon return.  They face harassment based on sectarian or assumed political views.  They face various forms of violence, up to and including rape, at the hands of various militia groups, Government and anti-Government.  They risk being disappeared or killed in extrajudicial killings and they are going back into a country where over 500,000 people were killed during the past eight years, the majority by Syrian Government forces.  Faced with these considerations, would you go back?  There is no longer a push for democratic principles that we all saw on televisions nine years ago, and those aspirations are long forgotten about.  People's focus now is simply on survival and security.</p><p> Tr&oacute;caire, along with our local partners, have identified the following priorities.  Any discussion on return for Syrian refugees must have the minimum threshold of being voluntary, dignified and safe.  The UNHCR has provided clear principles for return and Ireland and the EU should ensure that these are paramount.  As we have seen, displacement is a multi-annual situation and, therefore, the Government of Ireland, working with the EU and through its influence in the UN, should ensure there is multi-annual humanitarian funding.  The Government of Ireland should encourage a renewed emphasis on the UN-backed peace process, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254 which requires a Syrian-owned peace process.  There must be accountability for the war crimes and countless human rights violations committed over the past eight years.  Without these, it is very difficult to see the 12 million people displaced by the conflict having sufficient assurances to return home and bring this humanitarian crisis to an end.</p></speech>

I have made three visits to the area.  The first was pre-politics and pre-conflict and Damascus struck me as an amazing, cultured, cultural and inclusive city and society, which was very proud of its history and its place in the area.  The second visit was in the company of a predecessor of the GOAL representatives.  We went to the Turkish-Syrian border and met GOAL staff who were coming in and out of Syria at that stage.  We met Syrians who were living in the south of Turkey.  Some were with organisations and they did much better than those who were trying to forage for themselves.  The way they were being exploited and mistreated by the Turkish population was appalling.</p><p> The third visit was a few months ago with three other Deputies.  We came into Damascus from Lebanon and stayed in Damascus.  We went by bus north towards Aleppo stopping in Maaloula on the way.  We got a different picture of that part of Syria.  Certainly the destruction was extremely obvious but what came across was the resilience and the spirit of the Syrian people we met on that journey.  They were not all a certain type provided for us to hear what they had to say.  They were casual encounters we had when we were on the street, out eating or whatever.  What came across to us was that they were getting on with the rebuilding work and re-establishing their schools and businesses.  Certainly more had been done in Damascus.  The work was only starting in Aleppo.  We met some of the Syrians who had returned and we heard their stories as well.</p><p> We were in Yarmouk and met the Palestinians who had stayed.  We also met the Palestinian group with UNRWA who were providing education and so on.  We got a different sense of what is happening from what the witnesses have provided today.  I know their work is in a certain part of Syria but certainly I came home last July with a more positive view of Syria getting back on its feet, like other countries, post conflict, have been able to do.  The issue is about how to support that.  The witnesses' organisations are working in a certain part of Syria, which is extremely difficult, and they are working with refugees, but do they envisage their organisations supporting other parts of Syria in that rebuilding programme?</p><p> Some of the group had visited the Palestinian camp in Lebanon.  They came away absolutely horrified by the conditions in which the Palestinian people were living in Lebanon.  The Palestinians whom we met in both Palestine and Syria would say their lives in Syria health-wise and education-wise were much better than in other countries where they have been living.  Certainly those Palestinians were staying.  They wanted to start rebuilding in Yarmouk.  Reference was made to 1 million Syrians in Lebanon. Are they other Syrians besides the Palestinian Syrians?</p><p> Safe return is vital.  As I said, we met some people who had returned.  What can we do to ensure that?  I read some of the witnesses' briefings which refer to Syrian-owned, Syrian-led processes on that rebuilding work, but are the organisations willing to engage with those on the government side because as far as we could see, they are there to stay and they have started the rebuilding.  We saw the extent of the destruction and that was very difficult, particularly in Yarmouk.  Did all Yarmouk have to be destroyed in the way it was?  The officials we met would say they are assured that they will start that rebuilding work and that they can do it.</p><p> Conflict resolution will be a key element to how people can come back together and work in that society.  We have seen in other conflict situations where that has happened.  We have been driven by a certain agenda and that is not to take from the horror, destruction, displacement and everything that has happened, and I am thinking particularly of the children.  When we talk about this being Syrian-led and Syrian-owned, that is another conversation and I am not sure that people are willing to have that at the moment.  Obviously, there is the big question of accountability for the war crimes on every side.  There are no winners in a war situation; there are only losers.</p></speech>

I do not have the benefit of the experience of the previous speaker and, therefore, I will ask a few questions.  What our guests highlighted in their informative presentations are issues which we will continue to articulate and advocate on their behalf.  Has Ireland and the European Union done enough to accept refugees or people who either cannot or will never return to Syria?  What struck me in each of their presentations is the scale of the issue and the fallout in terms of the numbers of people who are impacted.  Are we doing enough?  Is the European Union doing enough?  I presume they will say the answers to both those questions is "No".  How much more can we conceivably do?</p><p>We must be practical about it too.</p><p> Will the witnesses comment on the follow-through from the United States when Mr. Trump signed the famous executive order banning all sorts of immigrants from entering the country, which was targeted at people from a Muslim background?  Has that also caused a knock-on problem down the road in terms of allowing a release valve for other developed nations to try to share the burden of the humanitarian crisis?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for their questions.  Syria is the size of Spain, so it is a very large country and there are different experiences in different areas.  As mentioned in my brief, in some areas, the conflict has stopped and that is allowing people to rebuild their lives.  Concern is planning to do a lot more to support Syrians who are returning and even those people who never moved to rebuild their lives through agricultural production, vocational training and business development.  Concern is looking at the conflict through a very gendered lens as well because it has been very gendered.  Many women who never worked outside the home no longer have husbands or adult males in the family and find themselves cast in the role of breadwinner.  We are supporting men and women with appropriate skill sets and skill building to recover themselves.  This is definitely an area on which Concern wants to focus a lot more.</p></speech>

I echo her concerns and recognition that what stands out when meeting the people of Syria is their resilience.  That is often the case in many humanitarian interventions and we certainly see it in Syria.  Right now, GOAL is looking on a weekly basis at how the needs are changing.  Where we are working in the Idlib governorate, we are still experiencing regular air strikes and we are still very deeply concerned about the safety and security not only of our staff but of the populations we serve.</p> <p>  As Mr. Al Manla mentioned, we are looking at building sustainable livelihoods and at what we can do on a practical basis to help people living in very precarious conditions so there is a glimmer of recovery even in those very difficult circumstances.  We have recently moved into a new territory, where we are supporting people who are moving from the Idlib governorate.  There is innovation in our programme but we have not yet decided to work in other parts of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019030500002#K00500"><p>I thank members for their questions.  Like Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, I have been to Syria and Damascus in recent years and I echo her comments about the resilience of people in coping with the conflict.  Our presentations have been focused on the perception of people outside of Syria and those who are displaced within the country and what they consider makes it safe for them to return.</p> <p>  In terms of the organisations engaging with the Government, or the international community engaging with the Government in Syria, we have referred to the UN-backed peace process in the presentations, which is the only game in town in terms of an international peace process.  In January 2018, it was agreed to establish a constitutional committee and the UN special envoy has been leading that along with the various countries which are supporting it.  There were meant to be 150 members.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the UN special envoy issued a statement in which they were negative in their opinions about the engagement of the Government of Syria.  The latter has not put forward members to the committee and has not endorsed its UN members.  The international community has tried to engage with the Syrian Government.</p><p>There is a need for a lot more engagement because the peace process has to happen.  If the conflict is to end, there needs to be a sustained peace process.  All the parties need to engage on that.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Niall Collins's questions on refugees in Europe, the latter should take on a bigger burden in some ways.  Ireland previously set a target of accepting 4,000 Syrian refugees. The number is currently fewer than 2,000.  If the target of 4,000 could be achieved, it would be very positive.</p></speech>

Their organisations are great ambassadors for Ireland.  I do not believe we thank them enough.  Our guests have attended meetings of various committees before but we need to thank them much more often.  The work they are carrying out is making such a huge difference to people's lives.  The Irish are really proud of the work in which they are engaged.</p> <p>  I listened to the comments on getting a peace process up and running.  I do not know enough about the circumstances on the ground.  We rely on news coming in and various organisations and we do not really know how accurate the news is.  I accept our guests' point that there has to be a locally owned political resolution to the conflict.  They have referred to a Syria-led and Syria-owned process but there are international actors involved.  The call is for them to use their influence to bring about an immediate ceasefire and an inclusive peace process.  Part of the difficulty is that many of the actors or those involved in the conflict believe there can be a military solution.  The witnesses are saying the bombing has started.  GOAL has stated that, in the area in which it operates, the air strikes are still happening.  That is another part of the difficulty.</p> <p>  Our guests are asking that the Government uses whatever influence it has.  What influence could we have on those international actors that are involved in the conflict?  Included are the Syrian Government, the United States, the Russians, the Iranians and the Turks.  Given that Ireland is a small country, what influence could it have?  We should bear in mind that support and so on are given.  Many of the actors do not see us as having a private agenda in regard to the work.  How can Ireland champion the cause in question and work hard on bringing the organisations together?</p> <p>  Reference was made to refugees returning home.  While the Lebanese Government had previously maintained an official position of neutrality toward Syrian refugees and that the policy should be implemented with the support of the UN, that policy has shifted considerably over the course of 2018.  Our guests might expand on that.  Those who wish to return are facing rape in some cases and conscription is ongoing.  If the ideal is to have people return to safety, what needs to be done to ensure their protection?  I suppose the Assad regime will be reluctant to allow people to go back.  It will be seeking to scrutinise where people are coming from and their position.  I presume all the refugees in the neighbouring countries want to return.  What are they returning to?  Reference was made to the lack of water and heating.</p> <p>  Reference was made to funding under the 2019 Syria regional refugee and resilience plan.</p><p>How much is the financial shortfall for this plan?  I presume Ireland is meeting its pledges of funding and international commitments.  The Minister said it was.  I never understand the reasons that countries make pledges to that funding and do not honour them.  What is that about?  Is it a day of glory and then they return to their own countries and do not give the money.  I would be interested in learning which countries make a pledge but do not live up to the commitment.</p><p> The United States made a decision to withdraw aid.  Will the witnesses elaborate on how that is impacting on the people on the ground?  In respect of the Syria regional refugee and resilience plan, they say money should not be spent on reconstruction, but how important is that reconstruction within Syria in encouraging people to return?  If there is ongoing reconstruction, it will create jobs in building hospitals, homes and water installations.  How important is that funding as part of the overall solution?  We started by talking about the peace process, but if the armed groups involved in the conflict are not committed to the process, it will go nowhere.  How important is it that groups involved in the peace process have a voice?  I refer in particular to the Kurds.  Kurdish political representatives have repeatedly called for their own separate seat at peace talks.  I believe they should have one but they are very much part of the answers that are needed in the region.  The Kurds have a significant role to play, they played a significant role in the fight against ISIS.  How important is it that the indigenous people such as the Kurds have a say at the table?</p></speech>

I thank them for the great front-line work they and their organisations are doing.  It is important that we hear about the practical issues for the civilian people in Syria, how conditions are both for Syrians living in Syria and for those who are displaced in refugee camps and internally displaced as well.</p> <p>  Following up on the point made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the different prevailing conditions, depending on the region in which the organisations are working, are they witnessing the more severe issues relating security and people's safety?  What is stopping refugees from returning? </p> <p>  I refer to the list of requests that the witnesses have provided us with and the headings "Peace", "Refugee Return" and "Aid Funding".  Under the latter two headings relating to the return of refugees and the sustained commitment to aid, the question for our committee is how best we can support the asks of the witnesses.  Brussels is hosting a third conference on supporting the future of Syria on 13 and 14 March and Ireland will be represented.  Should the committee write to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade seeking commitments that Ireland will push to ensure that support to refugee returns is in line with the EU's commitment to their voluntary, dignified and safe return and that the Government will push to ensure funding is provided on a multi-annual basis to meet the needs of Syrians both in and outside Syria who require support?  As part of those two requests, all the witnesses emphasised the need to ensure protection for humanitarian workers on the ground.</p><p>I have been working for some time in support of the work of Irish Syrian groups who have brought over members of the White Helmets.  I am told that, even this week, the White Helmets - those civilian workers who are so bravely trying to support their fellow Syrians during air strikes from the Assad regime - are under ongoing threat within Syria.  How we can ensure better protection for humanitarian workers is something that Ireland should be pushing for at the third Brussels conference.  We have clearly heard the witnesses on the need for multi-annual funding.  What can the committee do to support those asks?<br/><br/>The final point is on the bigger ask relating to peace and seeking support for a shared, comprehensive diplomatic strategy.  The witnesses all referred in their submissions and again today to UN Security Council Resolution 2254 of 2015.  I went back and read the resolution again and, of course, it now reads very sadly and tragically as being totally out of date, given what has happened since then.  It looks for an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people but the Assad regime has won the <i>de facto</i>victory.  It seems to me, as an outsider, from looking at the various reports, that the support provided to Assad and his regime by Russia, in particular, and Iran has meant that many of the aspirations in that resolution are no longer tenable.<br/><br/>Mr. O'Keeffe spoke about the UN efforts to establish a constitutional committee but they seem to have reached a stalemate because of the lack of co-operation from the regime.  How can we on this committee, noting Ireland's role, seek to continue to push the aspirations in that UN resolution while recognising that the situation on the ground has moved on, and recognising the real tragedy of that, given there was a genuine democratic revolution being proposed in Syria at one point?  I posted a film by Irish film-makers who have been in Syria and who have been seeking to spread support internationally for the democratic movement that had been in place in Syria but which now, it seems, has been defeated.  In the context of the realpolitik of what is happening in Syria now, how can we promote that resolution and how can we support the organisations represented here in promoting it in the important work they are doing on the ground?</p></speech>

I sent earlier word that I was at a meeting of the House of the Oireachtas Commission, which was discussing important legal matters and which overran.  Nonetheless, I have taken the opportunity to read the presentations online and I have been briefed by Deputy Niall Collins, who has a particular interest in this.</p> <p>  I welcome and compliment all the voluntary bodies present.  I am full of admiration for the work they are doing, not just in Syria but all over the world in difficult circumstances and on limited budgets.  They deserve all the support we can give them.  Is there any particular measure they would urge Oireachtas Members, particularly members of the foreign affairs committee, to implement - something we could put our teeth into and work on?  I have studied the issue as best I can and I am afraid I agree with Senator Bacik that it is a battle that seems to have been won by the Russian-Iranian set-up.</p> <p>  The main emphasis of the voluntary organisations is on peace and normality, and on people having food, safety and security.  Unfortunately, there has to be a political end to everything and I agree with Deputy Crowe, who talked about what level of commitment to engage has been evident from the major players.  He was very involved in the peace settlement in the North, where some group had to dream up a blueprint and get everybody on board with it.  It was a long struggle but, to a great extent, it was a success.  I wonder if that level of commitment is evident in this regard.</p> <p>  I have one query.  I picked up with interest the fact that we had agreed to take in 4,000 refugees but only 2,000 made it here.</p><p>Is that because a block was put into the system or because Ireland was not a preferred destination?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019030500002#O00200"><p>On the last point raised by the Senator, I am unsure of the reason for it.  The process is managed by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the peace process.  The constitutional committee has been established.  It has run into difficult territory as its progress is very slow.  It requires the active involvement of and continuous pushing by the international community.  It has the support of Turkey, Russia, Iran and other countries which are strong supporters of and have significant influence with the Syrian Government.  It is to be hoped that they will continue to be able to apply pressure.</p> <p>  On the role of the European Union in supporting that peace process, the EU must realise the kind of influence it has and use that influence to bring people around the table.  The blueprint for the peace process is there in terms of the constitutional committee which was established last year by all the main parties, including those in opposition, in government and others.  It is the only blueprint that exists, so all members of the European Union, including Ireland, must use their influence to bring the various parties around the table to participate in the committee.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about the safe environment existing in Syria and the significant amount of construction necessary in the country over the coming years.  Obviously, the country has been devastated by the conflict.  The support that Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL and Concern provide to refugees and displaced people very much considers their safety and security in the context of a potential return to their homes.  It is not just about whether they have food, water and so on; it is very much about their safety and security when they return home.  They should not have to return to a particular part of the country but, rather, should be entitled to return to the area from which they originally came.  They need safety and security, but those are very difficult to achieve in the current environment.  Indeed, it is difficult to see how they will be achieved in the future.  Presumably, those issues must be addressed at a very high level in the peace process.  It will be necessary to establish an inclusive peace process that will eventually create a safe environment for people to return home in a voluntary, dignified and safe way.  The international community must apply pressure where it can in order to ensure we arrive at some sort of peace process.</p></speech>

We have articulated three particular asks.  Deputy Crowe asked about our level of confidence in Ireland's ability to influence some of the players involved in the conflict.  This is the largest single focus humanitarian support project in which Ireland has been involved.  <i>Per capita</i>, Ireland is one of the top 20 donors in the world to the alleviation of the Syria crisis, which places us in a very strong leadership position and gives us the ability to use the Brussels conference to advocate for continued multi-year annual funding that allows humanitarian partners to plan and support people over a considerable period of time.  It is very important that the Brussels conference next week be used to demonstrate Ireland's leadership and to use that voice to encourage others to call for the political settlement that is required.</p></speech>

We have huge respect globally.  We must continue to use that respect at whatever fora we can, whether with the European Union or the UN or through our embassies, to further the cause of peace.  We must encourage our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or other Departments such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that provide direct or indirect support to the Middle East region to continue to so do.  We must avail of every opportunity to promote and encourage peace.</p></speech>

Of course, refugees would like to go back to Syria but three main elements which must be borne in mind are that the process of return must be voluntary, dignified and safe.  Many areas of Syria are not safe for return.</p> <p>  On the protection of humanitarian workers, we want to encourage those workers and recognise their courage.  They are the bridge linking us with the affected population.  They are always there to support those who have been affected and badly need humanitarian services.  The protection of humanitarian workers should be a priority in order to ensure that we can access the affected population who benefit from the services provided.</p></speech>

It was very welcome to have Mr. Al Manla, as a programme director in that region, in attendance.  The committee was anxious that Concern, GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire have the opportunity to present to the committee and this meeting in public session was specially arranged in advance of the Brussels III conference on supporting the future of Syria and the region which is to take place next week.  As the representatives are aware, the committee does not have an executive role but with the agreement of members, we will write to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to outline the concerns raised by the delegates regarding the ongoing humanitarian issues and other longer term issues in regard to infrastructure, the security of those who wish to return to Syria and the obvious pressures in adjoining countries where there are many displaced people and refugees.  I was struck by Ms Kennedy's reference to the need to ensure that women's leadership is encouraged and supported in this area, as well as the emphasis on education and the very real danger of a lost generation due to a lack of access to education.  The committee was anxious to hold this meeting in advance of the conference in Brussels next week in order to get an up-to-date presentation from the delegates in public session.  We do not have an executive role but we will communicate promptly with the T&aacute;naiste.  It is important to provide taxpayers and the members of the public who support the work of Concern, GOAL, Tr&oacute;caire and other organisations with an opportunity through Oireachtas TV or other media coverage to hear of the plight of many millions of people in that area and to know that the money donated by taxpayers and the public through public appeals is put to very good use.  On its behalf and that of the Oireachtas, the committee wishes to commend the work of the delegates' colleagues who are working on the ground in extremely difficult conditions.  Mr. Al Mansa referred to the courage of humanitarian workers on the ground and the very serious safety and security issues they face on a daily basis.</p> <p>  The committee has had much engagement with these and other organisations on this issue over the more than eight years that, unfortunately, the conflict has continued.  I refer to the death toll of more than 500,000 and the 16 million people who need humanitarian aid.  It goes without saying that the committee will be totally supportive of the cause espoused by the representatives.  We will encourage the Government and the European Union to continue to provide financial support and encourage other members of the international community which have not been as generous or thoughtful in respect of this tragedy to do likewise.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is very welcome.  I also welcome his officials and thank them for the briefing in advance of the meeting.  Before we begin, members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device.  It is not sufficient to put phones on silent mode, as this will maintain interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I very much welcome this opportunity to engage with the committee on two connected processes currently being undertaken within my Department with civil and military involvement, namely, the ongoing White Paper update for 2018 and 2019 and the White Paper implementation project, which is focused on the establishment of a fixed cycle of defence reviews as a permanent feature of defence policy.</p> <p>  I look forward to listening to and noting the comments and observations of committee members present today.  I particularly want to stress that these are new developments in our approach to defence policy.  I am very much in listening mode today and I appreciate that any new ways of doing things, particularly when it comes to defence, should ideally attract broad support across the Houses.  This has been a long-standing tradition which I am keen to maintain.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by the Government in July 2015, provides the strategic and comprehensive defence policy framework for the ten-year period up to 2025.  As such, the White Paper is the Government&rsquo;s medium-term policy on defence.  It is the second White Paper on Defence.  Its predecessor, the first White Paper, dated back to 2000.  The comprehensive consultation process that led to the approval of the current White Paper commenced with publication of a historic Green Paper on Defence in July 2013.  This initiated a public consultation on the White Paper and in doing so it broke new ground by actively encouraging open debate and critical thinking about Ireland&rsquo;s future defence policy requirements.  In response to the Green Paper my Department received a total of 122 written submissions and follow-on meetings with a wide variety of stakeholders and interested parties were subsequently held.</p> <p>  In addition to the public consultation process, officials from the Department of Defence liaised extensively with a broad range of Government Departments and agencies with a common interest in security or which avail of the services of the Department, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence.  There was also consultation with international organisations with a particular focus on international peace and security-related peace support and crisis management operations.  These included the United Nations, the European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency and NATO&rsquo;s Partnership for Peace.</p><p>The consultation process concluded by bringing all stakeholders together for an open policy debate, with an opportunity for those that made contributions to hear the views of a range of panellists and to debate and express their opinions.  This was held in Farmleigh House in May 2015.  All who attended found the event to be useful and thought provoking.  In addition, a final opportunity to engage on and contribute to the White Paper then under development was afforded to Members of the D&aacute;il and statements were taken in the House at the end of June 2015.  The views of all those who contributed throughout the process were carefully considered and there is no doubt that the White Paper has benefited from having had these valuable inputs.</p><p> The policy framework set out in the White Paper is designed to be flexible and responsive.  This is important, given the dynamic nature of the current security environment.  It is also designed to enable the defence organisation, comprising the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, to be adaptive to these changing circumstances and to use our resources as efficiently as possible.</p><p> It is within this context that the White Paper sets out the Government's intention to establish a process of fixed-cycle defence reviews.  These are common internationally and give assurance that policy remains up to date and relevant to changing future circumstances.  The White Paper specifically provides that these reviews are to have a three-year cycle, with every second review being more comprehensive in nature and, as such, would be styled a "strategic defence review".  As set out in the White Paper, strategic defence reviews will commence in early 2021.</p><p> Before that happens, however, the White Paper also specifies that the first in the new cycle of reviews will be a White Paper update, which my Department commenced last July.  Members will recall that I wrote to the committee last autumn to seek their views.  In the interim, a considerable amount of work has progressed, but it is still relevant to obtain members' views, particularly on the long-term approach to the process of fixed-cycle reviews.  I have not come to this meeting to advance any particular approach, speak to any particular element of the White Paper or argue any point in our discussion.  We debate many issues at this committee and in the House and there are plenty of occasions for me to respond to particular points.  This is not such an occasion, however.  My approach today is simply to allow a space in which the White Paper update can take account of what committee members have to say.  In conjunction with this, and most importantly for the long term, it will benefit all if we can put in place an effective, structured and systematic approach.</p><p> The White Paper represents Government policy on defence.  It is not intended that the update will reopen fundamentals of defence policy that were settled when the Government approved the White Paper in 2015.  These fundamentals include the fact that Ireland will continue to maintain its policy of military neutrality.  The White Paper also sets out key principles regarding capability development that have resulted in the subsequent development of rolling multi-annual equipment and infrastructure plans.  Developments at international level, including Ireland's decision to participate in the EU's permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, agreement remain consistent with the approach in the White Paper.  The White Paper also places a strong emphasis on the development of the human resources of the defence organisation and significant work in this area is under way.</p><p> In undertaking the update, we have focused primarily on an updated security assessment and an analysis of the range of projects being undertaken by way of implementation of the White Paper.  The updated security assessment will be published as part of the update, reflecting a reconsideration of chapter 2 of the White Paper.  As such, it is the product of an interdepartmental and inter-agency group comprising representatives of relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  Such an assessment of the security environment will remain a key component of fixed-cycle reviews, as it will be used to situate appropriately the defence policy response in terms of the lead or supporting roles that defence plays.</p><p>In essence, it provides a fully considered and agreed common perspective for all elements involved in protecting the security of the State.  As members will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss the content of the assessment pending completion of all work being carried out as part of the overall update and, ultimately, its approval by the Government.  As with the White Paper, the outcome will be published.</p><p> The second key strand of the update, which is well advanced at this stage, is a review of progress in the White Paper's implementation.  Following publication of the White Paper, a total of 88 projects were identified to be completed over a ten-year period.  From a programme management perspective, these have become 95 discrete projects, with the implementation of each being supported and monitored by a joint civil-military White Paper implementation facilitation team.  As part of this strand, the review of progress with implementation has been broken into a four-stage process, involving high-level civil and military engagement.  This process has involved a review of all 95 projects, with different considerations arising and being factored into the review of each, depending on its current status, that is, whether it has commenced or is now closed.  Two of the four stages have now been completed while work on the final stage, the report capturing the outcomes of the reviews of each project, is under way.</p><p> Following completion of these two key strands of the update, and having regard to whatever views members may have, the next important phase of the update will be consideration of the implications of any change in the context of overall policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing.  All of this work, including that carried out to date, is being overseen by a high-level civil-military steering group that meets regularly to review progress and the overall approach.  It is my intention that, when all work is finalised, the White Paper update will be brought to the Government for approval of the outcome and for a decision on any change in approach that may be required.</p><p> The second aspect of my engagement with the committee is to listen to the views of members on the White Paper implementation project that is focused on the establishment of a fixed cycle of defence reviews as a permanent feature of defence policy.  In this regard, the White Paper sets out the Government's intention that these defence review processes are to be given a new standing in public management terms.  The White Paper specifically provides for a new set of arrangements to ensure that a strong strategic defence planning and decision making approach is taken.  I have outlined the process already under way in terms of the first White Paper update and the commitment on the part of the Government to commence a strategic defence review in early 2021.</p><p> One of the White Paper implementation projects under way in the Department of Defence is focused on developing a formalised structure, to be approved by the Government, for these fixed cycles of defence reviews.  This ongoing project, which is being undertaken by a civil-military team, is principally considering the structure and processes for the future conduct of defence reviews and, in doing so, will draw from the experience gained in carrying out the current update.  The project team has undertaken a broad-ranging study, including academic review and international comparisons, in order to identify the key elements that could shape the conduct of future defence reviews.  When finalised, proposals in this regard will be brought to the Government for approval.  Before that happens, however, it is the Government's stated intention in the White Paper to engage in a process of all-party consultation on the overall approach.  This committee is an ideal forum to address that commitment.</p><p> There are a number of key elements being considered as part of the ongoing project and, subject to the committee's perspective, it is on the following questions, in particular, that I would appreciate views: whether legislative provision should be made for the conduct of fixed-cycle reviews; the extent to which the reviews should differ &ndash; for example, what should distinguish an update from a strategic defence review; the level and breadth of consultation for each; the frequency and timing of reviews; and whether, regardless of these reviews, there is a case for a continuing approach that includes provision for further White Papers and, if so, when, within the new cycle of reviews.</p><p> Having outlined the purpose of my seeking this engagement with the joint committee, and once again emphasising that my approach today is simply to take account of what committee members have to say, I look forward to listening to and considering their views on these important matters related to the White Paper on Defence.</p></speech>

It is positive that we are meeting rather often on these matters.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned a high-level civil-military steering group.  Who exactly are the members of that group?</p> <p>  The Minister of State also referred to whether legislative provision should be made for the conduct of fixed-cycle reviews.  What kinds of changes does he envisage that would require such provision?  I am putting this in the context of a report I have been quoting recently and on which the Minister of State's MEP colleagues engaged at EU level, namely, Ireland and the EU: Defending our Common European Home.  It contains some alarming comments - for example, on redefining the concept of Irish neutrality, amending our triple-lock system and developing our defence industry.  It does not sit easily that such comments are coming from some MEPs when we are committed to Ireland's neutrality here.</p> <p>  It was great that the Minister of State received so many submissions.  Many came from civil society.  I am wondering about further engagement because, with defence, it is civil society that is most effective when anything goes wrong.</p> <p>  There is an increase in military expenditure.  Does the Minister of State envisage further increases?  There are concerns in this regard.  I asked the Minister of State before about the multi-role vessel that was possibly being purchased.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for the letter he sent me following up on my question on training.  He outlined in it some of the training that takes place.  I acknowledge the great work our peacekeeping forces do when on UN-mandated missions.  My question was on interrogation training.  The Minister of State reverted to me on some of the other types of training.  It is important to emphasise the importance of training on gender and refugee issues.  We saw the so-called training for the Libyan coast guard was far from what it should have been.  Our troops are much better trained.  Given Irish troops' training on human rights and gender and refugee issues, could we more proactive in this regard?  What happened in Libya and the Mediterranean was most unsatisfactory.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned his role in planning for Brexit.  I was in Belfield last week for the launch of our international development policy, A Better World.  Was there engagement with the Minister of State's Department?  How does he complement priorities in the new policy document with what we are seeing in the White Paper?  Our role has been human rights based and humanitarian.  Was there any engagement with the Department of Defence?</p></speech>

I am not aware of any engagement.  I may revert to the Deputy on that.</p> <p>  The White Paper update steering group has met at least monthly since the updating commenced last July.  Meetings are chaired by a relevant assistant secretary and are attended by the assistant chief of staff and the heads of the Department's planning and organisation branch and the Defence Forces strategic planning branch.  There is also a White Paper working group, which will consider any implications for overall defence policy requirements, associated tasks, capability development and resourcing.  This group comprises the heads of the planning and organisation branch and Defence Forces strategic planning branch and the White Paper project team.</p><p> The fundamentals of the White Paper are not going to change but I am looking for members' views on it today.  What changes would they like to see?  What would they like to be added or subtracted?  I am looking for the committee's views rather giving mine.  Everyone should know my views on the White Paper because it was approved by the Government in 2015.  We are now on the review stage.  I sent briefing notes to all committee members.  I wish to hear members' thoughts on the White Paper.</p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred to the Fine Gael MEP group publishing its own paper on the future of Ireland's policy of neutrality.  It is totally separate from Government policy.  I always encourage political parties and individuals, be they Independents or otherwise, to engage in an open and honest debate on issues that affect everybody daily.  These are issues that affect us.  We would be doing no justice to society if we did not have open and honest discussions on them.  The discussion paper reflects the MEP group's own thoughts and it was not endorsed by my political party.  A group of MEPs came together and published the paper.  It is not reflective of Government policy by any manner or means.  I welcome everybody's comments, however.</p><p> We are increasing military expenditure year on year.  The multi-role vessel about which the Deputy spoke is referred to in the White Paper.  This is at the planning stage.  It will be some time before we make a decision on it.</p><p> The Deputy talked about the Libyan coast guard.  Through Operation Sophia, we are training it.  I am not sure about the extent of training on gender issues, etc., but I can revert to the Deputy on that.</p><p> Regarding Brexit, defence organisations are currently engaged in prudent planning in response to Brexit.  This includes active participation in the whole-of-Government framework developing a response to Brexit.  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise.  Prevention of trafficking is in the first instance a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda.  There is a Government Brexit team.  An assistant secretary from my Department is on that team.  We meet quite regularly.  Responsibility for the security of the State rests solely with the Department of Justice and Equality.  If it acquires aid to the civil power, it calls for the assistance of members of the Defence Forces or the Department of Defence.</p></speech>

I am alarmed by the fact that they made their comments in an open debate in the European Parliament.  It is the Minister of State's party that is in government here.  Therefore, there is no doubt about what occurred.  Ireland has a very proud tradition of being involved in UN-mandated peacekeeping missions.  That is what we should continue doing rather than getting diverted into other areas.  Regardless of the assurances the Minister of State is giving, there is concern that we are moving away from our neutrality.  I am very definitely of the view that we must be assured that our neutrality is sacred, as is fitting for an independent, sovereign state, and that we should not be brought further into the growing security agenda of the European Union.  We should return to saving lives in the Mediterranean as opposed to being part of an agenda bringing people from the Mediterranean into the Libyan detention camps.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019030500002#W00100"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  The White Paper update indicates that 42 projects have been initiated, which is less than half the total number of 95.  To date, only 11 of those 95 projects have been completed.  It is clear, therefore, that there has been an under-delivery in terms of the White Paper.  As I just stated to Senator Ned O'Sullivan, there is very little detailed information in the Minister of State's statement.  It was just an exercise in grammar and language.  He explained very little in terms of what he is actually doing with regard to many key issues.  I have a number of questions about some of the key issues that are fundamental to the White Paper.</p> <p>  The Chief of Staff was before the Public Service Pay Commission recently.  I was very surprised to hear that the Chief of Staff was joined by two officials from the Department of Defence and two from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would see that as a muzzling of military management regarding its plea to the Public Service Pay Commission.  Why did the Minister of State and his Department seek to attend that meeting with the Chief of Staff?  Why did they not allow him to exercise his discretion with the commission?</p> <p>  My second question relates to my shock at seeing the effective strength as of March 2019.  We have 45% strength in the First Brigade, 45% strength in the Second Brigade, 34% strength at the Defence Forces training centre, 22% strength in the Air Corps and 23% strength in the Naval Service.  This is a complete destruction of effective strength in our Defence Forces.  Why did the Minister of State not address that in his White Paper update?  Why did he not address the serious issues of retention and recruitment?  There was not a word or syllable from the Minister of State about the significant exodus we are seeing and the failure to deal with it.  We are seeing a significant spillover on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State provide an update on the current recruitment campaign for the Naval Service and the Reserve?  There are concerns that it has been either suspended or delayed because of a difficulty between the Department and others involved in the process.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether the campaign is continuing as normal?  What is the position regarding the recruitment campaign, which was well publicised by the Minister of State and others in recent months?</p> <p>  I also want to get the Minister's view on cybercapability and cybersecurity.  Can he outline how many staff are in the cybersecurity unit?  What have the Defence Forces provided for around cyber-capability in terms of personnel, resources and responsibilities?  I understand that there are four positions.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that this is sufficient to protect us against the threats we face?  Today, President Macron outlined the serious destabilising effect on democracies across Europe if we do not address significant cyber issues.  How prepared is the Department for that?  Can the Minister of State brief the committee on the development plan to achieve this capability?</p> <p>  Can the Minister update the committee on the ongoing EU Partnership for Peace in-depth evaluation of Ireland's military capability?  In the interests of transparency, will he commit to publishing its contents when it has been concluded?  Can he update the committee regarding where the Department is in the context of the implementation of the two PESCO projects to which it has signed up?</p> <p>  My next question concerns something that might not, but should be, mentioned in the White Paper.  We saw the departmental change that occurred in the Department of Finance during the recession and across a number of Departments.  What is the Department of Defence doing to ensure it possesses staff with appropriate academic qualifications - such as degrees, masters degrees or PhDs - in international relations and security and defence?  This is something that has been mirrored across other Departments.  Could the Minister of State clarify how many members of staff are qualified in those areas?  What are the Minister of State's plans to bring forward any legislation to allow the Reserve to provide time in terms of training, as is the norm in other countries?</p> <p>  Brexit was mentioned by a previous speaker.  What bilateral discussions have taken place with the UK regarding a hard Brexit?</p><p>Has there been any contingency planning?  Obviously, Ireland has an informal agreement on air defence cover and the Minister of State needs to clarify the position in respect of it.  He needs to clarify what discussions his Department has had regarding those matters.</p></speech>

The issue of pay has nothing to do with the White Paper.  I am just seeking members' views.  It would be totally remiss of me if I did not come before the committee in the context of reviewing the White Paper.  I wrote to the committee in the autumn and stated that I would like the opportunity to come before it to ask members their views on the White Paper.  I will appear before the select committee later today in connection with the Estimates and have no problem answering any of the questions the Deputy has just posed at that point.  However, most of his questions do not relate to the White Paper.  I say this genuinely.  The White Paper is a ten-year project that we will review.  If I was an Opposition spokesperson and the Minister of State did not come before the committee asking for members' thoughts and views on the specifics in the White Paper-----</p></speech>

Pay is not an issue for the White Paper but the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform met the Pay Service Pay Commission this morning.  I do not determine who appears before the commission.  As I have pointed out to the Deputy on numerous occasions, the commission is independent.  I do not say "Send this one in" or "Do not send that one in".  That is nothing to do with me.  That is a matter for the commission.  Nor is it anything to do with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is why we have an independent pay commission to look at the overall issue of pay.  Nobody muzzled anybody.  It is up to the commission.</p> <p>  The overall strength of the organisation is 94%.  There is no delay in recruitment regarding the Reserve or enlisted members.  A process relating to a competition will get under way shortly.  For security reasons, I will not give the Deputy details regarding how many members of the Defence Forces are with the cyber unit in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

Amendments of DFR S7 are linked to DFR R5.  The former cannot be finalised with the latter being completed.  Amendments are very complex and time-consuming and require extensive consultation.  It is anticipated that the initial draft of the revised DFR R5 will be available within the coming months.  The Office of the Attorney General has been snowed under due to Brexit, which has delayed all legislation.  I am not stating that it has delayed this specifically but we depend totally on the staff of the Office of the Attorney General to assist us in drawing up legislation.  This is very complex legislation.  We have one opportunity to get it right and we want to ensure that we do so.  I expect the revised DFR R5 will be available in the coming months.</p></speech>

I find the way the White Paper is laid out strange.  There is no harm in it.  If one reads through it, one will just about find what the tasks and targets are.  The Minister of State mentioned 95.  We were originally told it was 88.  There is no list within the White Paper itself so sometimes it is very difficult to judge.  Most other documents of that scale have the target, purpose and timeframe in which it is hoped that goals will be achieved at the end.  I know the Minister of State has supplied some of that material to me since.  It makes it difficult for people looking in to gauge whether the Minister of State, Department or military authorities are successful in achieving what has been set out.  It is quite obvious that we are not achieving some goals.</p> <p>  There is a chapter on retention of soldiers.  Recruitment is being achieved.  We have seen people being recruited and cadets being sworn in recently.  I congratulate them.  There is a dilemma that we have discussed in the committee, of recruitment and retention and the problems that creates for military authorities while trying to plan for the future.  If one has a cohort of older, more experienced soldiers leaving and newer recruits, it makes it difficult to plan major events, overseas operations, fisheries protection operations or for whatever skills are then missing.  In recent years, air ambulances have not been able to provide the full cover that is expected of the Defence Forces by the public.  It is conditional on their availability but the public has, or at least had, a view that the Defence Forces are available as an aid to the civil power.  The military authorities can only do that if they have the personnel and equipment required.  We have seen a number of occasions where they have been constrained or where it has created difficulties relating to a lack of soldiers or equipment.</p> <p>  An issue I have with regard to the role of the Defence Forces is that there should be greater concentration on preparing the Defence Forces for more operations abroad, such as disaster relief and infrastructural works.  They have shown in Ireland that they can do that.  They have been quite good if a bridge goes down, for example.</p><p>The change to a two brigade system meant the loss of one of the engineering units and a lack of equipment for disaster and humanitarian relief.  I have a different view to most recent Governments, which seem to have embraced the EU battlegroup role for the Irish Defence Forces rather than peacekeeping and helping in disaster zones around the country.</p><p> My criticism of the review is that the White Paper should be made more accessible.  The Minister of State set out the 95 targets or tasks so that when the cyclical reviews come up, it is easier for people on the outside to comment and say that they want there to be more focus on certain matters.  Brexit has really changed much of what was set out in the White Paper.  The Minister of State is here this week and it is a pity that it is not next month, since we might have some surety about it then.  That will impact on the call on the Defence Forces relating to Border duties.  There are stories about garda&iacute; being trained.  There is a plan already in place to put some of the new recruits in the Border region in preparation for a possible hard border.  We saw the issue of fisheries last week.  That will become a greater problem or duty for the Defence Forces in the near future if we do not have the agreement that we intend.  The Defence Forces and the Department, when preparing the White Paper, would not have been aware of Brexit coming down the track.  They would not have been focusing as much on that aspect of security.  While I know it has been done, that suggests a need to continually review the security situation as the Brexit issue develops.</p><p> I have raised this issue before so it is more of a comment than a question.  The first duty of the military authorities and the Department is to respect and protect the members of the Defence Forces and to enhance morale.  There are a number of issues and events that have happened in recent years which are contributing to lowering that morale.  I have not heard any problem with regard to protection of soldiers.  I think they are happy with the protection.  Respect for soldiers has been brought into question by the lack of proper wages and proper health and safety standards in the past.</p></speech>

We are running into time constraints again and have the select committee soon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1394" speakername="Ned O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019030500002#Z00300"><p>I will keep it very tight.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  It is good that the Minister of State wanted to engage with us.  Having said that, maybe I was ill-prepared for the meeting or my expectations were different, but I am disappointed and underwhelmed by what the Minister of State has to say to us.  He says he wants to listen to our views but at the same time, for anyone looking in from outside, White Papers and Green Papers are like dancing on the head of a pin.  People want to know where the beef is and what the Minister of State's vision is for the Defence Forces.  We cannot treat White Papers and Green Papers as an ongoing circle of bureaucracy.</p><p> The Defence Forces are highly respected and held in high regard by the public, and rightly so.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, their work as peacekeepers in the UN is exemplary and something of which we are all very proud.  We are also proud of the profile the Army has in many State functions.  I particularly welcomed its activities in schools during the 1916 centenary.  It is also lovely to see the Army band in communities.  When there are weather and climate crises, the Army plays a role and this is also appreciated.  These are the upsides as far as I can see but there are some serious downsides.  The Minister of State said the White Paper is not the place to speak about Army pay or all of the resignations and buy-outs from the Army.  Perhaps we will have another day for that.  Is the Minister of State concerned about morale in the Defence Forces?  The morale of any force, be it the Garda, Army or Naval Service, is important.  It is important for us as committee members to know whether the Minister of State is happy with the state of morale in our Defence Forces.</p><p> Insofar as the White Paper deals with it, will the Minister give us an update on where we are with Army property?  There has been a lot of speculation that some of our big barracks, such as Cathal Brugha Barracks, will be used for housing.  I am not saying it is good or bad; I would just like to know the future of Army property in rural towns, such as Listowel, where we used to have slua halls and FCA property.  What is the future for this type of property, as the Minister of State sees it?</p><p> Does the Minister of State have plans to inject new life into the RDF?  Recently in the Seanad I mentioned to him that I thought the FCA was an exemplary force that gave a lot of young people in Ireland training in life skills, a sense of patriotism and something useful.  The Army has a very low profile in the country.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  I am not looking for militarisation.  The Army has a very low profile, particularly outside of Dublin.  This is something the Minister of State could look at by reviving and putting more funding into voluntary reserve forces, such as the FCA used to be.</p><p> The Army has done very well so far in the centenary of commemorations.  We are halfway through the commemoration the War of Independence.  Shortly, we will move on to commemorating the Civil War.  There were no angels on either side of that terrible sad divide and republicans, no more than anyone else, committed atrocities.  Nonetheless, some major atrocities were committed by the State and the army of the Free State in the name of the people.  Statements were made in the D&aacute;il by the Minister for Defence at the time that need to be corrected.  Has the Minister of State taken an advanced view on how this will be handled?  It is a very sensitive area and nobody is looking for triumph in this regard, particularly not me.  It would be as well for the Minister of State to have a plan to deal with these issues as they will undoubtedly arise.</p></speech>

There are 88 projects in the White Paper but a number of them have subprojects and rather than trying to hide the figure of 88, I said 95.  I hope that explains it.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention are challenges for the Defence Forces but it is a challenge for defence forces throughout Europe and armed forces throughout the world.  When I speak to my European counterparts, they face the same issues I do.  We have funding for a full strength of 9,500.  The Government has provided this.  Recruitment will be open in the next short while.  I do not have the exact date but it will be shortly.  This is with regard to Reserve personnel, enlisted personnel and cadets.</p> <p>  With regard to the ambulance service out of Athlone, I am not sure there have been constraints.  It has been fully operational and is very successful.  No one has stated to me it has been unable to fly.  If it has been unable to operate, it must have been for a specific reason.</p><p>When the helicopter is being serviced it tries to provide-----</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to operations abroad and perhaps assisting abroad where there is a catastrophe.  At present, where we are on peacekeeping duties we reach out into the communities.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the reorganisation and the number of engineers.  We reduced from three brigades to two brigades but there was no reduction in the number of engineers.  The key aspects of the reorganisation included consolidating understrength units into a smaller number of full strength units and a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.</p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, when the White Paper on Defence was published, it was not even born.  There have been a large number of changes since then.  I will not pre-empt what will happen next week.  The defence organisations are engaged in prudent planning in response to Brexit.  This includes active participation in the whole-of-Government framework developed in response to Brexit.  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, with regular co-ordination and liaison meetings.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised fisheries protection.  There are implications for increased monitoring, patrolling and inspecting of Irish controlled waters.  This will depend on the outcome when the UK departs.  It will be a matter for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in association with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As I stated earlier, a senior official at assistant secretary level in the Department is leading the input into the deliberations of the framework established throughout the Government.  The management board also maintains oversight of all Brexit-related matters in the Department.</p> <p>  Avoiding a hard border on the island is fundamental to the draft Brexit agreement reached between the EU and UK Government.  There are no plans to introduce a new Army barracks or Defence Forces base in the greater Border region.  However, the Defence Forces keep operational plans under constant review.  I am satisfied the operational readiness and deployability of the Defence Forces is such that they can respond effectively to whatever is required by the State or the Government.  The White Paper was originally put together in 2015 and the security situation is a fundamental part of the White Paper review.  In my opening statement I referred to reviewing the security situation of the State.  If Senator Ned O'Sullivan reads what I said about the objectives of the White Paper, that is the meat.  That is my vision.  It is the Government's vision of where we see the Defence Forces over the next ten years.  That is why, as I stated earlier, it is important that we review the White Paper.</p><p>The strategy statement sets that out very clearly.</p><p> Morale is very important within any organisation, be it a political party, the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Department or the HSE.  However, leadership is as important as morale.  That is my leadership and that of military management and civil management.  I have an excellent team around me, military and civil.  It is very important that we show leadership.  Of course we have our challenges but every organisation has its challenges.</p><p> On the role of the Reserve, I have stated on numerous occasions that it is an important platform for the organisation as a whole and that it plays a very important role within the organisation.  Numbers have been dwindling because younger people have more opportunities now than they did 20 or 30 years ago.  The Government has provided the funding for full training days for the reserves.  There is no lack of funding for their training days.  They are well funded.</p><p> Over the past 25 years, my Department has disposed of a range of properties deemed surplus to military requirements.  Since 1998, under the barracks consolidation programme, the sale has been completed of 12 of the 14 barracks closed under this programme.  They were Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Ballincollig, Clancy Barracks in Dublin, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan - they were new barracks - Letterkenny, Kildare, Clonmel and Lifford.  The sale of Castlebar barracks to Mayo County Council will be completed in the near future.</p><p> The newly established Land Development Agency, LDA, has identified Columb barracks in Mullingar, which closed in 2012, as a viable solution to the provision of residential units, and it will form a significant contribution to the 3,000 units to be targeted by the agency in this first tranche of the provision.  Project management branch has, on my instruction, continued to liaise with the relevant officials in the LDA and the transfer of the site to the agency is a priority, subject to terms and conditions that are yet to be agreed.</p><p> Currently, &euro;37 million worth of capital projects are at various stages, from design to tender to construction.  These include the replacement of the major secure storage facility, phases 2 and 3, in the Defence Forces training centre, &euro;10.2 million; the construction of new gymnasiums in Sarsfield barracks in Limerick and Stephen's barracks in Kilkenny, &euro;6 million; locker block refurbishment in Cathal Brugha barracks, Dublin, &euro;3.8 million; upgrade and refurbishment works at the cook house and dining hall in Custume barracks, Athlone, &euro;4.1 million, which is under construction at the moment; the upgrade of accommodation blocks in Pearse barracks in the Curragh, &euro;3.1 million; upgrade and refurbishing works in the apprentice hostel in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, &euro;3.3 million; the upgrade of the oil wharf and installation of fire protection and detection and a fire-fighting system in the naval base on Haulbowline, &euro;2.4 million; the upgrade of one and two block accommodation facilities in Cathal Brugha barracks, &euro;2.4 million; and the upgrade of seven block accommodation facilities in Connolly barracks at the Defence Forces training centre, &euro;2.1 million.</p><p> The White Paper project is also under way to put in place a five-year plan for the programme.  The list of works identified as part of the project will be prioritised for delivery based on military needs and will be updated annually to form the basis of the selection of capital projects under the programme into the near future, and new start projects to be commenced in 2020 will be informed by the projects.</p></speech>

Following on from the work done on the 1916 commemorations, which were really successful, there is an all-party commemorations committee.  We must be very careful in the context of the decade of commemorations.  If an all-party committee worked for the 1916 commemorations, there is no reason it should not work for the decade of commemorations.</p></speech>

There is a vote in the D&aacute;il.  I will make just one quick comment to the Minister of State.  Departments and statutory agencies often have a habit of having the usual consultees on the development of Green Papers or White Papers.  We do not respect corporate knowledge enough.  I would love to see people who may have left the Department and the Defence Forces and those who have served overseas get the opportunity to contribute.  One thing we are very bad at is recognising corporate knowledge and its importance.

On 19 December the D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimates for public services for the following Votes be referred to the select committee for consideration: Vote 27 - International Co-operation; Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade; Vote 35 - Army Pensions; and Vote 36 - Defence.  Today the committee will consider the Estimates for Votes 35 and 36 and report back to the D&aacute;il.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for defence matters, Deputy Kehoe, who is accompanied by his officials.  I thank the Department for providing briefing material in advance of the meeting.</p> <p>  The proposed format is that the committee deal with the Votes on a programme-by-programme basis.  The Minister of State will give an overview of each programme, outlining the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance or expenditure on the programme in 2019.  The floor will then be opened to members to ask questions.  I ask that they put their questions about the specific programme in order that we can progress in an orderly and efficiently manner.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind them to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system, even when left in silent mode, and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings.  They can also adversely affect television coverage and web-streaming of the meeting.</p> <p>  Members received briefing documents on the Revised Estimates.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I have a short opening statement which sets out the overall position.  I will update members on some of the main developments within the defence sector in recent times.</p> <p>  There are two Votes for the defence sector: Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence.  The high-level goal is to "provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government".  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.</p> <p>  The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2019 provide for gross expenditure in excess of &euro;1 billion, which represents an increase of &euro;60 million or 6.4% on the figure for 2018.  The 2019 provision comprises &euro;758 million for Vote 36, which represents an increase of over &euro;50 million, and &euro;249 million for Vote 35, which represents an increase of &euro;10 million.</p> <p>  The Army pensions Vote has a single programme entitled Provision for Defence Forces Pension Benefits.  It makes provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and their dependants.  Retirement pensions, gratuities and disability pensions account for 99% of all expenditure.  The 2019 Estimate provides for a gross sum of over &euro;249 million for the Army pensions Vote, of which some &euro;239 million covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and certain dependants.  For the most part, pension benefits granted are statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.</p> <p>  There are approximately 12,480 pensioners who are paid from the Army pensions Vote.  During 2018 approximately 340 Defence Forces members retired on pension.  It is anticipated that a broadly similar number will retire in 2019.</p><p> As the committee is aware, it has been my stated intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations.  Solid progress has been made on that front.  As announced in budget 2019, the gross allocation for Army pensions this year has been increased by &euro;10 million to approximately &euro;249 million, which is very welcome.  It builds on a increase in funding of &euro;9.5 million in the 2018 Estimates.</p><p> The 2018 review of Defence Forces pensions expenditure which was published with budget 2019 was carried out as part of the 2018 round of spending reviews and undertaken jointly by officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department.  Among other things, it concluded that the underlying trend of rising military pensioner numbers was likely to be maintained in the coming years.  It recommended that the Army pensions Vote be allocated resources in line with its cost analysis from 2019 onwards to ensure the full funding demands were met.</p><p> I turn to Vote 36 - Defence, which is delivered under a single programme entitled Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs.  The defence Vote for 2019 of &euro;758 million includes a pay and allowances allocation of approximately &euro;529 million, while the remaining non-pay allocation of &euro;229 million provides mainly for the renewal and maintenance of essential equipment, infrastructure and standing and operational costs.</p><p> The pay and allowances allocation of &euro;529 million provides for the pay and allowances of over 10,400 public service employees, including 9,500 PDF personnel, 550 civilian employees and 355 civil servants, and makes provision for increases due under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The agreement contains proposals for increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4%, over its lifetime.  By the end of 2020, the pay of all those who earn less than &euro;70,000 will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.</p><p> There has been ongoing recruitment within the Defence Forces in recent years, at both enlisted personnel and officer level.  It includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  The current recruitment plan envisages approximately 800 new entrants being inducted across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service this year.  These recruits will avail of the highest levels of training and, in return, the Defence Forces will benefit from the injection of energy and enthusiasm that every organisation, particularly the Defence Forces, needs.  Promotions are also ongoing within the Defence Forces, with approximately 600 promotions across all areas of the Defence Forces in 2018, meaning that one in 14 serving members is promoted.</p><p> In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence brought the issues of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Department has provided data, as requested by the commission, for consideration and the commission's work is ongoing.  My Department will continue to engage throughout the process.</p><p> The budget allocation includes over &euro;2 million for Reserve Defence Force pay in 2019.  This will allow for 26,000 training days for reservists this year.  I acknowledge and appreciate the commitment and enthusiasm of Reserve Defence Force members who provide voluntary service throughout the country.  The Department's White Paper is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve Defence Force.  A key ongoing challenge for the force is recruiting and retaining personnel.  Two recruitment campaigns for the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve are planned this year - one in March and the second in October.</p><p> The non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements.  The current expenditure allocation of &euro;123 million in 2019 provides mainly for expenditure in meeting ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.</p><p> The capital expenditure allocation for Vote 36 in 2019 has been increased to &euro;106 million, which represents an increase of &euro;29 million or 38% on the 2018 allocation.  It will allow the defence organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in the White Paper on Defence.  Among the main equipment programme priorities planned in 2019 are the ongoing upgrade of the Army Mowag armoured personnel carriers, the replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft, the purchase of military transport vehicles and the mid-life refit of Naval Service vessels.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces built infrastructure continues to be enhanced and modernised and to that end the Defence Vote makes provision for increased investment in this area, with more than &euro;28 million allocated for 2019, an increase of almost &euro;5 million, or 20.6%.  A number of projects planned for 2019, which are progressing on a phased basis, will upgrade and maintain the infrastructure essential for the Defence Forces.  The overall capital allocation of &euro;541 million for Defence for the period 2018 to 2022, as set out in the national development plan, NDP, emphasises the importance attached by this Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capability necessary to deliver on all the roles assigned by Government.  This funding will play a vital role in ensuring that the priorities identified in the White Paper can be met and that the Defence Forces can deliver fully across all roles.</p><p> I will now outline some of the key roles and outputs delivered under the defence programme.  The Defence Forces continue to make a considerable contribution in their international peace and security role.  As of February 2019, Ireland was contributing 673 Permanent Defence Force personnel to nine missions throughout the world.  In addition, personnel are deployed to a range of international organisations and national representations.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 458 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in Syria, with 136 personnel.  Up until recently, Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL, including a small Estonian platoon.  Due to other national commitments, both Finland and Estonia withdrew from the Irish-Finnish battalion in UNIFIL in November 2018.  As an interim measure, an additional contingent of approximately 106 Defence Forces personnel have been deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the Finnish contingent for a 12-month period.  This additional commitment will continue throughout 2019 as Ireland has assumed full duties and responsibilities of IRISHBATT up to November 2019.  Efforts to source a partner country to replace the Finnish contingent are progressing well.</p><p> Since October 2017, the Naval Service has been participating in the EU naval mission, Operation Sophia, which specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean.  The question of a further deployment to Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean in 2019 is being considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto; the demands on the Defence Forces; our overseas commitments; and available resources.  The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for Ireland's domestic security supported, as required, by the Defence Forces as part of their aid to the civil power function.  This role is multifaceted and in 2018 included a varied set of tasks such as Garda air support missions, Central Bank security guards, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal call-outs and Naval Service diving operations.</p><p> The Defence Forces also provide assistance to the principal response agencies tasked with responding to major emergencies.  For example, in 2018, the Defence Forces were deployed on a number of missing person searches, the Naval Service conducted fisheries boardings and the Air Corps undertook a number of emergency aeromedical support missions.  The professional competence shown by the Defence Forces in undertaking these roles is greatly valued and appreciated by all stakeholders and was further illustrated by the extensive and wide-ranging assistance provided in response to the severe weather emergency last March.</p><p> The Civil Defence is also funded from the Defence Vote and remains a vital component within each local authority's emergency response arrangements.  Volunteers from Civil Defence have responded very effectively when required, most notably during the aforementioned weather emergency.  I have secured an additional &euro;500,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2019 which will be used to enhance the Civil Defence four-wheel drive capability.  This will ensure that Civil Defence continues to perform its core function of supporting the principal response agencies as set down in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p><p> The allocation of more than &euro;1 billion for the defence sector for 2019 emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas, and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all their assigned roles.</p><p> Members have been provided with briefing material on the individual subheads for the defence and Army pensions Estimates and I look forward to positive engagement on any issues they may wish to discuss.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019030500002#E00200"><p>Vote 36 includes an allocation of &euro;529 million for pay and allowances.  The Minister of State mentioned a Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500.  Is he confident that a strength of 9,500 will be reached and thus that &euro;529 million will be required?  If not, where will any surplus be diverted to?  There is concern within the Defence Forces that the cost of pay is cannibalising the overall defence budget.  Will the Minister of State clarify if there are any planned military-specific allowance increases?  In a previous session I asked if there was a review under way of the terms and conditions of recruitment.  I would like clarification on whether a review is under way, or a delay in that regard, of the terms and conditions of recruitment in the context of the current recruitment phase for the RDF and the Naval Service Reserve.</p> <p>  In regard to the Defence Forces budget, in our discussions in this area last year it was mentioned that the budget is reducing or stagnant in real terms.  I would like the Minister of State to comment on that.  Regarding moving the deadline for the Public Service Pay Commission to report, when does the Minister of State expect that to happen?</p> <p>  In regard to Operation Sophia, the Minister of State said that overseas commitments are subject to available resources.  Are available resources likely to compromise any future operations or is he confident that he has an appropriate allocation in that regard?  </p> <p>  I would like to know the underspend and overspend in capital last year and how it has fed into the projections for this year.  What was the projected allocation and the underspend or overspend for current expenditure?  What was the underspend or overspend for pay year-on-year?  We need to know if money allocated last year is feeding into the allocation for this year or if it was returned to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Exchequer. </p> <p>  In regard to CASA replacement and the funding for PC12s, is funding to meet this cost being diverted from any other budget and, if so, will the Minister of State clarify it is not affecting recruitment plans?  We have had a significant debate on Project Ireland 2040.  The Minister of State mentioned the NDP in his opening statement.  The cost of the children's hospital has overrun by a significant amount.  He mentioned a &euro;541 million allocation.  Has he been approached or have there been any formal discussions between his officials and officials in other Departments about the defence capital allocation being affected by the children's hospital overrun?  Will he clarify that the &euro;541 million he mentioned is not affected in any way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019030500002#E00300"><p>In regard to the children's hospital overrun, the defence budget will not be affected in any way.  In regard to CASA replacement, we are not diverting funding from any other budget.  Regarding the capital overspend, I do not have that information to hand but I will have it forwarded to the Deputy.  On Operation Sophia, there is a review under way of the mission.  The UN has granted an extension of the mission.  When I get a full brief on that, I will make a decision.</p><p>I will be in New York at the end of March to meet Mr. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary General, and that is one of the items on the agenda.</p><p> The Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and personnel from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform met the Low Pay Commission this morning.  I will get a full update from my officials on that meeting this evening.  I do not want to be specific about a timeline or tie myself down to it because the commission is fully independent.  It is not up to me to tell it when to report.  Nor is it a matter for the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to tell the commission when to report.  I would, however like to hear as soon as possible.  The commission has a job of work to do.  I am aware there is a huge amount of work going on.  There are face-to-face interviews and an online questionnaire for members of the Defence Forces.</p><p> There is no delay whatsoever in recruitment.  A recruitment competition planned for the Defence Forces envisages some 800 new entrants being inducted across all services and competitions in 2019.  The Naval Service general service competition closed on Monday, 21 January 2019, with 969 applications currently being processed.  The cadetship general service recruitment competition will commence shortly.  The aircraft apprentice technician competition is expected to launch in quarter one, but details are yet to be confirmed.  The Naval Service continues to recruit direct entry officers for bridge watchkeeping, marine engineering and electrical engineering roles.  The Defence Forces are also accepting applications from qualified doctors for careers in the medical corps.</p><p> In addition to traditional recruitment methods, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed.  These are aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas.  A scheme has been introduced that permits former officers with a specialist skill set to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force.  Arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel.  This will take legislative changes.  Currently there is a direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications, which is utilised in the recruitment of medical officers and engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.</p><p> The recruitment process is carried out by the Defence Forces.  They are responsible for promoting the competitions and the processing of applications.  The military authorities advise that targeted medical campaigns using traditional methods of social media, cinema and print will continue to be used in the upcoming recruitment campaigns.  An additional &euro;50,000 has been allocated in 2019 for recruitment advertising campaigns.  This will bring the total up to &euro;295,000.  A variety of recruitment initiatives will be undertaken throughout the year, including local and national outreach events to attract young people to the competition process.  The recruitment process itself is monitored and appraised on a continuous basis to ensure it remains fit for purpose.</p><p> To complement this approach, it has been decided that the Department of Defence, in conjunction with the military authorities, will review all elements of this process.  This work is in the very early planning stages.  I have looked for a review of the overall recruitment process - similar to the review I had carried out for the conciliation and arbitration scheme - where an independent person who has absolutely no involvement in the Department or with the military will come in to look at the process in an objective way.  I believe it is very important that we look at this by bringing people in from outside.  If there are lessons to be learned it is important to have such a review.</p><p> The most important issue from the recruitment perspective is that there is funding for 9,500 Defence Forces personnel in total.  Under the public service stability agreement we are fully funded for all pay increases, support and operational costs, an increase in capital spend on essential equipment and infrastructure up to &euro;29 million, with an additional &euro;10 million for Army pensions, to fully fund the Vote.</p><p>This has been something I have wanted to address since my appointment in 2016 because I was quite concerned that there was a shortfall in the pensions Vote.  I am delighted a commitment last year from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, which he fulfilled, means that we were fully funded for the pension deficit.  There will be no delay on recruitment whatsoever and I will come back to the Deputy on the other issues.  All savings arising will be retained within the defence budget.  When I come back later in the year with Revised Estimates I will then set out exactly where that will go.  We are spending more than &euro;1 billion on defence.  This is the first time ever that we went over &euro;1 billion.  It shows the commitment by Government.  We absolutely have challenges and we will continue to have challenges, as does every other Department and organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-05a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019030500002#G00200"><p>There are a number of areas where the Estimate is below what the outturn was in 2018 or 2017.  I find this odd because these are in some of the areas we have been talking about, for example, barracks and engineering in subhead A12.  The uniforms and clothing total is just under &euro;2 million below the previous figures.  The Defence Forces communication and information technology subhead, which we have discussed in the context of cybersecurity, is &euro;3 million below the previous year's spend.  Military education and training is &euro;500,000 below what was spent in the previous year.  It applies also to the Defence Vote for logistics and travel.</p> <p>  Subhead A18 relates to the Defence Forces medical and healthcare support with a substantial increase.  The logic for that &euro;4 million is that they have shifted something that previously came under civilian support into the medical and healthcare area.  This is an accounting process.  Does subhead A18 cover all of the psychiatrists?  There is a problem with regard to not being able to employ psychiatrists directly and having to get outside consultancy.  Is this cost accounted for in the &euro;7 million that has been set aside for drugs, dressings, equipment and professional consultants?  Theoretically the Department has taken &euro;4 million from subhead A7 - Defence Forces civilian support, and given it to subhead A18.  This suggests that if things had stood as they were, it would have meant a substantial increase of &euro;6.5 million this year in the pay and allowances for civilian staff and not the &euro;2.5 million indicated.  This substantial amount is not fully explained.  Obviously there is some provision since there are more than 500 civilians working in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to Naval Service expenditure on equipment and support.  For some reason last year was an exceptional year because it had peaked but it has dropped back.  Was this because of new equipment being more efficient and, if so, why was it so high last year?  Given that Irish Naval Service vessels are continuously on Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean Sea, I would have expected that the figures for the purchase of fuel and lubricants, specialist training and so on would remain much the same.  I find that odd.</p><p>The Deputy asked some very technical questions and I will provide a detailed written answer if that is acceptable.  I do not have the full information to hand and, therefore, I will provide him with a full reply in writing.</p><p> The number of civilians employed has dropped considerably over the years, with a marked decrease during the economic downturn.  The recruitment of civilian employees for military installations is an ongoing process based on a combination of the filling of consequential vacancies, which have arisen due to promotions or retirements, and the filling of priority vacancies on the basis of identified requirements.  A programme of targeted recruitment has been in place to fill priority vacancies.  In 2018, eight civilian appointments were filled by external competition, while 17 were filled by internal competition.  As of December 2018, an additional 39 candidates were undergoing security and medical clearance prior to appointment.  There were 47 retirements or resignations and no deaths in service, and no redundance packages were paid out in 2018.</p><p> The Naval Service equipment and expenses cost &euro;2 million, the maintenance of vessels cost &euro;6.3 million, marine fuel and lubricants cost &euro;3.7 million, specialised training cost &euro;167,000, while miscellaneous costs were &euro;723,000, accounting for a total of &euro;13 million.  There was no major change from the previous year, except fuel costs.  The outturn for 2017 was &euro;13.7 million, while in 2018 it was &euro;17 million but that can be explained by increases in the cost of fuel and so on.</p></speech>

I am not querying it but it is odd because I had presumed that the same level of activity within the Naval Service would lead to similar costs.

The chaplaincy service is vital.  There were 15 chaplains in 2017 and 16 in 2018.  A female Church of Ireland chaplain is <i>in situ</i>in the Curragh.  The chaplains provide an important service, especially when overseas.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  Will he provide an update on the pay commission in as much detail as he can, although I accept that he may have given as much detail as he can in that regard?  Will he also provide an update on the recruitment competition and additional recruitment within the Army?  Finally, will he elaborate on the process of commissioning from the ranks?</p></speech>

It is the first time there has been a commissioning from the ranks, where members of the Defence Forces' ranks will be fully commissioned, which is brilliant.  While I am not sure of the exact number, it is approximately 26 or 27 and I will revert to the Deputy in that regard.</p> <p>  On the pay commission, I have provided Deputy Jack Chambers with a briefing.  The matter goes back to 2017, when, under my direction, the Department tried to spot issues with recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces and bring them to the attention of the pay commission, which produced its initial report in May 2017.  The report highlighted recruitment and retention issues in the health system and within the Defence Forces, both of which were prioritised.  The commission concluded its work on health in October or November 2018 and I hope that it will report soon in respect of recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces.  I reiterate that the Secretary General of the Department, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform met the pay commission earlier, and I will receive a full briefing later.  Much work is ongoing in the background where members of the Defence Forces are being consulted.  As I have stated previously, the commission is fully independent and when it will report is a matter for it to decide.</p> <p>  On recruitment, on which I provided some detail, we will advertise to that effect shortly.</p></speech>

It is an important issue for members of the Defence Forces, but it is concerning that there has been no discussion of it in a budgetary context.  It is disappointing that the matter rests in the subhead related to the courts and, given that people wish to see a pathway delivered, the Department's response to the challenge is also disappointing.</p> <p>  The Minister of State stated 24 doctors are employed.  How many vacancies are there for specialist posts, such as in psychiatry?  The Minister of State also stated the payments to the Defence Forces for professional consultants and specialists have started to be met from subhead A7, but there is little mention of it under that subhead.  There are many personnel throughout the country who must use PDFORRA's fund or their own family to obtain appointments in private hospitals because of the demise of medical staff within the Defence Forces.  People are being forced to retire as a result of their medical condition or physical difficulty which, in some circumstances, is due to a lack of intervention.  For example, if someone has had an arthritic knee for two years without the appropriate intervention because he or she is waiting to be seen in the public system, and if there is a shortage in the cohort of medical staff within the Defence Forces, he or she will be in limbo and unfit to continue.  Consideration needs to be given to some type of fast-track process for people who require intervention for their employment and are forced out because of their medical circumstances, where they could have had the appropriate intervention.  Does the Minister of State have any pathway to increase the number of doctors employed or on the level of availability for diagnostics for members of the Defence Forces?  I have many examples of people who have to join the queue despite the &euro;17 billion that the State is spending on defence in general.</p><p>Part of what was built into the terms and conditions of members of the Defence Forces was the fact that there would be a medical corps.  There was supposed to be access to diagnostics and medical specialties but we have not advanced the specialisation of medicine in our Defence Forces.  Members are left in limbo.  The Minister of State's Department should look at that.  Genuine people are being forced out because of medical circumstances in a way none of us should allow.</p></speech>

There has been an increase of 133%.  What is provided for under that subhead?  Does that consist of buying in health services from outside the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

They are now met under subhead A18.  That is the reason for the increase.  This is reflected in an increased allocation of &euro;4 million under subhead A18.</p></speech>

The Defence Forces outsource some medical services because of the need for consultants.  In the past, some soldiers would not go to the Army doctor because part of the duty of that doctor was to report soldiers as unfit.  Does an outside consultant or doctor have the same duties to report to the Army that a soldier may be unfit?  This has arisen when soldiers have travelled overseas or have been in charge of trucks or other equipment and potentially put other people at risk because of the condition of their health.  I know from having talked to soldiers that if somebody is suffering from severe depression or is suicidal he or she will not approach the Army doctor because he or she will be put on sick leave.  This will mean that soldier will not participate in overseas missions and will not get allowances.  As such, the likelihood is that he or she will be on the breadline, which adds to his or her depression.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate topic for today, but it should definitely be looked at given that the Defence Forces now have to rely on outside doctors.  I have not yet decided whether I am in favour of the doctor telling the military authorities in all cases.  There seems to be an anomaly.</p></speech>

We have our own in-house GPs but we have to bring in locums on occasion to see members of the Defence Forces.  Their reports are put on the medical files.  If a member of the Defence Forces living in south County Wexford wakes up, is unable to go to work and has to get some sort of doctor's certificate, that is a clinical decision.  If the member goes to his or her local doctor and is told to stay at home as a result of the clinical diagnosis made, whether to pass that information to the Defence Forces medical corps is a clinical decision for the doctor.</p></speech>

Each of my colleagues mentioned the importance of the Reserve Defence Force and that we would like to see its numbers increase.  On a number of occasions over the years I have taken the opportunity at this committee to outline the importance of the Reserve Defence Force.  The Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association made a very good presentation to this committee some weeks ago.  One of the issues raised was the Reserve's eyesight requirement as opposed to that of the Permanent Defence Force.  It is an extra demand.  Another issue that arose is that Reserve members cannot serve overseas.  Thankfully, the Reserve Defence Force today is very representative of society in the different careers, trades and professions included.  There is often specialist knowledge there, in the medical area for example.  Such people could serve abroad in a very useful capacity.  It is not strictly a matter for the Estimates.  Does the Minister of State propose to change legislation to allow members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve abroad?</p></speech>

The findings of this report will be considered in due course.  I would like to have this sorted out before the Reserve recruitment campaign if at all possible.  I hope this will be sorted out shortly.  In 2019 there will be two recruitment campaigns for the Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve, one in March and the second in October.  Support is being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force through the use of social media and outreach activities for Reserve members.  Permanent Defence Force exit interviews now provide information on applying to become a member of the Reserve.  There were 124 Reserve Defence Force inductions in 2018, 139 in 2017, 18 in 2016, 344 in 2015 and 157 in 2014.  The Chief of Staff has appointed an officer to liaise directly with the Reserve to ensure the recruitment campaigns are run locally.  The problem is in getting numbers.  Applications for the Reserve Defence Force will be open very soon.</p></speech>

A number of years ago, there were proposals from the Department and the Defence Forces to regionalise the local Reserve Defence Force in my area to Dundalk in order to cover the Cavan-Monaghan-Longford area.  I raised the matter in representations to the Minister of State via parliamentary questions.  Thankfully, it did not happen.  It is important to retain that structure whereby there is a knowledge of the workings of the Reserve Defence Force at local level and that there is local input.  Over the years, people with local knowledge were able to recruit locally because they knew the type of young lady or young man who would be suitable for recruitment.  Many such people subsequently served in the Permanent Defence Force.</p> <p>  I previously mentioned to the Minister of State that I understand it can be difficult to recruit at times.  Many of our colleges of further education and post-leaving certificate programmes run security courses.  There may be a cohort of young people who are hoping to pursue a career in that area and are studying security courses in our colleges of further education who would be interested to know that the Reserve Defence Force is recruiting.  It would be worth ensuring that awareness is created in that regard.  I sincerely hope that will be done.</p></speech>

We hope that we will not need additional security measures in the Border region.  I previously outlined the major mistake of closing D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks in County Cavan.  That barracks was in a central Border area and was the most modern barracks in Europe.  I sincerely hope the Permanent Defence Force does not have to deploy additional personnel to the Border region.  We sincerely hope it does not come to that but, in the event it does, I send a strong message that such personnel cannot go to inferior accommodation.  If additional personnel from the Permanent Defence Force are assigned to the Border region, they should go to proper accommodation.  It was a different situation when the Troubles erupted in 1969 and 1970.  It was difficult at that time because of inadequate accommodation and all of that.  The former D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks is still a very sound and modern structure and I sincerely hope that, if additional personnel are assigned, facilities such as D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill barracks would be used.  I sincerely hope it does not come to that but it is an issue worth bearing in the back of our minds.</p></speech>
