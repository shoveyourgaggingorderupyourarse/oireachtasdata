    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021061700002#A00300"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Carthy, Hourigan and Sherlock.  I welcome all of our witnesses to the meeting.  Due to the current situation in respect of Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are complying with that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today we examine the 2019 financial statements of the University of Limerick.  Areas of interest to members, of which the university's representatives have been made aware, include protected disclosures, the contracting of retired staff, the remuneration and paid notice period of the president, the new student centre and the university's Limerick city campus.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the University of Limerick, UL: Professor Kerstin Mey, interim president; Mr. Andrew Flaherty, director of the human resources division; and Ms Rosemary Fogarty, financial controller in the area of operations.  The witnesses are all very welcome and I thank them for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so that any background noise will not be picked up.  As usual, I remind all of those in attendance to have their mobile phones turned off or on silent mode.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations regarding parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are, within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation actions in respect of anything they say at the meeting.  They are, however, expected not to abuse this privilege.  As Chair, it is my duty to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to identify himself or herself when first contributing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021061700002#A00400"><p>The University of Limerick&rsquo;s group financial statements for 2018-2019 show income totalling &euro;279 million.  Of this, income in respect of recurrent State grant and pension funding totalled &euro;82 million.  Academic fees accounted for &euro;103 million, almost a third of which was received directly from the Higher Education Authority.  Research income recognised in the year totalled &euro;34 million, with almost &euro;26 million of this coming from State sources.  Other operating income of &euro;43 million was derived from a range of sources, with 40% coming from rental of student accommodation.</p> <p>  The university group&rsquo;s expenditure in the year totalled &euro;281 million.  Pay and pension costs accounted for two thirds of the expenditure total.  Other operating costs were &euro;75 million, while depreciation accounted for just under &euro;20 million.  Overall, the group incurred a deficit of &euro;2.1 million in the year.  However, this must be considered against the group&rsquo;s accumulated revenue reserves of almost &euro;252 million at the end of September 2019.</p> <p>  My audit opinion on the financial statements was unqualified.  However, I draw attention to the recognition in the financial statements of a deferred pension funding asset.  In effect, the university is assuming that State funding will be available in the future to meet the pension entitlements already accrued by current and former staff.  This is a standard practice for Irish universities in compiling their financial statements.  My audit report also draws attention to the university&rsquo;s disclosure in section 9 of its governance statement of instances where the procurement of goods and services was not in compliance with the relevant procurement procedures.</p> <p>  The financial statements of the University of Limerick Foundation are not consolidated in the group financial statements, on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the University of Limerick.  However, the audited financial statements of the foundation for 2018-19 are appended to the group financial statements for information purposes.  These indicate that the principal activity of the foundation is the furtherance of education and research, and in particular the furtherance of education and research carried out by the University of Limerick and other educational, research and development bodies associated with the University of Limerick.  The foundation&rsquo;s balance sheet indicates that, at the end of August 2019, the foundation had cash of around &euro;20 million.</p> <p>  Note 26 of the group financial statements discloses the transactions between the university group and the foundation in the year.  This indicates that the university received income of &euro;2.6 million from the foundation for specific purposes.  The university contributed &euro;350,000 towards the running costs of the foundation.</p> <p>  Like a number of the other universities, the University of Limerick appoints commercial auditors to carry out audits of the group companies and of the consolidated financial statements.  In the interests of avoiding duplication of effort, I seek to rely on the work of the commercial auditors to the extent that is appropriate and, by agreement, staff of my office review their working papers as evidence for the purposes of my audit.  While this makes the audit process somewhat more complex and prolonged than normal, it is effective.  Nevertheless, there may be circumstances where my office seeks additional assurance and evidence and I form my own opinion independent of that of the commercial auditors.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that my audit of the group&rsquo;s financial statements for 2019-20 is not yet completed.  We received a full set of draft financial statements, including a draft statement of governance and a draft statement on internal control, in mid-March 2021.  Our audit fieldwork, including review of the commercial auditors&rsquo; working papers, has now been completed and the audit file has recently been submitted to me for review.  There are a number of matters where my office has sought additional information and back-up documentation from the university.  When these have been received and reviewed, I will be in a position to clear the account for certification.</p></speech>

Time is limited but I have read her opening statement and it is quite concise.  She has five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Kerstin Mey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021061700002#A00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee and to address questions members may have in relation to the 2019 accounts, the issue of protected disclosures and other matters as outlined in the meeting request and follow-up note.  I am accompanied by Mr. Andrew Flaherty, chief corporate officer, and Ms Rosemary Fogarty, financial controller.</p> <p>  I became interim president of the University in September of last year.  It was my honour to be the first female appointed to the role of a university president in over four centuries of higher education in Ireland.  Prior to joining UL in 2018, I held senior roles as pro-vice chancellor and dean of the Westminster School of Media, Arts and Design, University of Westminster, and, before then, director of research and enterprise for the University for the Creative Arts in England.</p> <p>  Members will appreciate that my accent is not that of a Limerick native.  I was born and raised in Berlin but, like everybody who comes to Limerick, I am immensely proud of the region and of the university and I am very conscious of my responsibility as chief officer to help strengthen this wonderful institution so that it can continue to play a transformative role not just in the mid west but in Ireland and further afield in the decades ahead.</p> <p>  The Covid pandemic has meant that the past 15 months have been a very challenging time for the university sector, as it has been for society at large.  While dealing with the practical challenges posed by Covid-19 has dominated our activities during this period, we have also been very conscious of the need to make progress on other issues.  In this context, together with the chancellor and the governing authority, I am very aware that the reputation of the university in recent years has been buffeted too often by controversy and disharmony.</p> <p>  I am also conscious that our relationship with this committee has not been as constructive or harmonious as it should have been, and I want to assure members that I will do all I can to make our relationship with the committee a positive one of trust going forward.  The root cause of many of these issues lies in the areas of culture and governance which have been a major focus since I became interim president.</p> <p>  On culture, my goal is to reset the organisational culture and to build a new spirit of openness and trust within the university community so that every member of that community feels valued, supported and empowered by a shared purpose.  To strive and thrive we require the talents of all and an inclusive and supportive climate where anyone can come forward with new ideas for improvement and can raise awareness of errors, weaknesses and wrongdoing without any fear of retribution.  In an inclusive, supportive and proactively learning organisation, whistleblowing and protected disclosure &ndash; while always available - will no longer be needed.</p><p>To this extent, I have endeavoured to stimulate two-way communication processes between the campus community and senior management, to make improvements to financial reporting and data provision for evidence-based decision-making, and to introduce an inclusive consultation process on our strategic plan, UL@50.  I am pleased to report that the participation in this process has been very encouraging, with 130 individual submissions and 57 group consultations in the first phase and evidence of a strong desire to participate in the second phase, which will inform the recalibration of our strategic plan.</p><p> In terms of governance, I can confirm that the recommendations from both the Mazars and Thorn reports have been implemented in full and we are now completing the implementation of the Code of Governance of Irish Universities 2019 and taking into account the recommendations made by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, in CINNTE Institutional Review 2020.  We have also completed an overhaul of UL's policy management framework, ensuring consistent policy development, approval and review processes in line with best practice.  We completed an external evaluation of the governing authority in 2020 by the Institute of Public Administration, with a draft report issued in early 2021 and the subsequent implementation of recommendations.</p><p> We have completed training on an annual governance statement and a statement of internal control for all senior managers by external experts, and introduced a new internal audit structure through the appointment of an in-house internal auditor.  We have also introduced an enhanced risk management structure, namely, the audit and risk committee of the governing authority, which now invites owners of local risk registers as a standing item.  Risk management is also a standing agenda item on the executive committee and governing authority.  Finally, we have addressed the structure and size of the executive committee to strengthen governance and ensure a broader representation of all areas of the university in decision-making and, through a flatter structure, create a more distributed leadership to safeguard delivery on strategic initiatives.  The new structure includes the appointment of a chief financial and performance officer through open competition.</p><p> I will address three issues that I know have been and are of concern to this committee.  At our previous meeting in 2019, Deputy MacSharry put it to the then president that he should consider reporting a potential incident of fraud at the university to the Garda.  I can confirm that following that meeting, my predecessor sought legal advice in respect of the relevant issue.  The university briefed the Garda on the matter and we have co-operated fully with it on the issue since.</p><p> At that same meeting, there was a lot of discussion about the plight of two members of staff who had identified as whistleblowers.  I can confirm we have reached agreement on one individual and the matter is completely resolved with approval from the Department.  In the second case, the individual agreed to the terms of a full and final settlement but subsequently raised concerns about tax liabilities and has not yet signed the settlement that had been agreed.</p><p> Finally, there has been some recent speculation about the purchase of the Dunnes Stores site and building in Limerick city by the university for the development of a city campus and the fact that no formal written valuation report for the site before the acquisition is on file.  The governing authority has asked KPMG to conduct an independent review of the governance around that purchase and we will share the outcomes of that review with the committee when it concludes.</p><p> I cannot say we have reached the end of what has been a difficult period for the university, but I can say with confidence we are making real progress.  We understand we have to work hard to earn and maintain the trust of all our stakeholders, including this committee.  We are committed to doing so, as am I.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

Time is short with the way in which the Covid world has structured meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts these days, so I may cut in on them in their answers at times.  This may seem rude and I apologise for that, but it may be necessary.</p> <p>  Is it the university's current position that the former president lied to the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

I do not have the academic qualifications of our panellists, but if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is usually a duck.  Is it the university&rsquo;s position that the previous president lied?  That appears to me to be what the chancellor is saying.</p></speech>

I think what the chancellor has said is that there was a correction from a member of the university team who was there on the day.  I do not believe that correction was from the president but from somebody else.  I do not believe the correction to the evidence came from the president.  It is related to a protected disclosure, so the people here today are not fully aware of the details and ins and outs of that protected disclosure.  My understanding is that it was not the president's evidence that was corrected but rather that an individual who attended along with the president corrected their evidence.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

While he is absolutely correct, we have parliamentary privilege, which sometimes must be used in the interests of the public.  It seems to me that we were lied to and misled that day.  As Mr. Flaherty rightly said, the matter was the subject of a protected disclosure.  I am conscious the interim president has acknowledged with candour the difficulties we have had in the past and the lack of harmony in our relationship and that she and her colleagues are committed to improving that.  I will return to that later.</p> <p>  The issue related to a position I had asked about at the time, namely, the director of strategic projects.  I was told this was a new position and someone had sought to correct the record.  They told us this in correspondence that came to the committee and was demoted by the committee, but it also came to me personally.  The correspondence clearly stated, and this has emerged since, that that role already existed and the person doing it was doing a very good job, such that the Higher Education Authority had acknowledged how successful the person was, going back to a report in 2017.  Is the university's position today different from that?</p></speech>

I will not use the name but we know who we are talking about.  The report went on to state the author was satisfied, and found as a matter of fact, that no consideration had been given by the then president to the fact the person was carrying out the role.

I am only interested in the areas that I have highlighted, which are the sum total of our engagement back on that day; I was misled, I was wronged in terms of the answer given and so were other people who were on the university staff, in my view.  The McKenna report unequivocally bore that out.  The chancellor unequivocally told us that incorrect information was given and now Mr. Flaherty is telling me that in effect that person has not been restored to that position but a new position now exists that is very similar.  Is that the evidence that is going to be given today?  Is that the truth?</p></speech>

In the protected disclosure that was submitted, elements were substantially similar to other protected disclosures which were being investigated by Mairead McKenna.  As a result, the elements that were similar were added to the McKenna investigation and were investigated there.  The individual received a copy of the findings and based on the findings felt that the other parts of the protected disclosure were resolved to their satisfaction.  The individual felt the complete protected disclosure was resolved to satisfaction as the findings came out in favour of that individual.</p></speech>

I was sick to my stomach and shook by what the University of Limerick has said about me in the article and assume this is what they are going to tell the PAC about me.  I believe this is another appalling tactic on their part.  The university statement about me in this article is a lie, it is wrong, it is deceptive and misleading.  I believe this was done to try and paint a false and wrong picture of me.  They have done this for so long and seem to keep getting away with it. </blockquote> <p>It goes on very substantially for two pages.  It says that person C never consented to be part of a mediation process and has never been in a mediation process with the university at any time.  Later, it takes particular issue with the interim president and her wording and states that there was a lot of discussion about the plight of two members of staff who had been identified as whistleblowers.  Is the interim president not willing to accept that they are whistleblowers?  While I hope to get in on a second round towards the end of the meeting, I am bound to say that the interim president's opening words are empty to me.  I do not find them convincing based on evidence available to me and it is business as usual at UL.</p></speech>

To give as thorough an answer as I can, the contract in question was a ten-year contract and the contract was silent on the issue of notice.  As a result of being silent, it would have given an entitlement to the individual to either give or receive reasonable notice at common law, so the expectation would be that reasonable notice is given.  Six months' notice was given.  Dr. Fitzgerald signalled his intention to resign in May and he subsequently gave six months' notice.  He was involved in the university for the first two months and the governing authority made a decision to pay in lieu of notice the last four months to the president in order to allow us to appoint an interim president at an extraordinary time because of Covid and what we were facing into.  He was paid.  It would not be normal but, under the extraordinary circumstances, it was decided it was in the best interest of the university.</p></speech>

One is outstanding.  Whether they are resolved or not, I find repugnant the reports that the whistleblowers were offered cash to simply resign.  There are questions about the purchase of land which seems to have been purchased at a price inflated by more than 250%.  We are not getting answers to those questions.  Salaries have increased dramatically.  There are irregularities related to salaries in the transition between presidents and no answers in that regard either.  There is an ongoing pension probe.  There is mismanagement with the president's residence and &euro;4,000 spent on bed linen.  It is nuts and it speaks volumes about the manner in which the University of Limerick is managed.  I wish we had more time to get into this.</p> <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts generally spends most of its time dealing with national bodies.  Various members of the committee have concerns about other third level institutions.  We will bring in the Higher Education Authority to discuss matters as a whole.  We all felt it necessary to bring representatives of the University of Limerick before the committee again.  What does that say about its management?  There is a grave concern, which has been compounded by the fact that members of the governing body only found out about the witnesses' appearance before the committee through the media in the last few days, despite the invitation having been issued three weeks ago.  It speaks volumes about the manner in which the university is managed.</p></speech>

She has not been before the committee since she was appointed.</p> <p>  I will focus on the KPMG report.  Professor Mey says she will provide it to the committee once she has received it.  We will require the witnesses to appear again once they have received it.  It is a pity we did not have the report for today's meeting.</p> <p>  How did the university select the Dunnes Stores site?  My understanding is that the Limerick opera site was chosen and that there would be an application to the HEA for funding.  Would the university just tell the HEA that another site had been picked without a valuation having been provided?  It is difficult to get my head around the process that would have been followed for the valuation and site selection.  Will Professor Mey address that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy may know, all of the higher education institutions in Limerick are on the periphery, so to speak, so it is not evident that Limerick is a university town.  We felt that we could make the biggest contribution to the transformation by having a city campus as well as our Castletroy campus.  A number of regeneration sites were assessed in collaboration with Limerick City and County Council.  There was interest in Dunnes Stores-----</p></speech>

Professor Mey confirmed there were no written valuations but did not confirm whether there were verbal valuations.  Surely, if there was a verbal valuation, which would be unusual in itself, there would be some record of it on a file somewhere, given the amount involved.  I take it from Professor Mey's answers there was no verbal valuation.  This was pursued earlier in the meeting, but it was not clear whether anyone was asked even for an opinion about this.  Getting the views of two different property consultants, given the amount, would be normal, but from what Professor Mey said, in this case the university is in a situation where it still only gets one rather than two.  In this case, she clarified it did not get any.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We do not have a written valuation report on file.  That does not mean there was not opinion involved in the valuation of the Dunnes Stores site.  As I said, KPMG is looking into the governance of the purchase process and we will share the outcomes of that process with the committee.  With regard to the fact of two independent written valuations for a property purchase, I agreed with the previous Deputy who asked the question that this is best practice.</p></speech>

It does not appear even an opinion was noted.  There is no evidence, or even a record, of an opinion being sought, verbally.  Nobody was asked, even on a street corner, why the cost, which was valued a very short time previously at a much lower cost of &euro;3 million, all of a sudden arrived at &euro;8 million.  The governing authority of the university, as I understand it, has 28 members.</p><p>I want a "yes" or "no" answer.

The witness can state that this morning categorically, so I thank her.  The witness has confirmed that advice was received from the consultant who did some negotiating around the deal.  Was that consultant on a percentage or was that how payment for consultancy fees operated?  In other words, if the site was valued at &euro;1 million, the consultant would get a percentage of &euro;1 million and if it was valued at &euro;10 million, it would get a percentage of that?  In this case, in a short period the value went from &euro;3 million to &euro;8 million.  Was the arrangement that the consultant was paid via a percentage of the purchase price?</p></speech>

As we said earlier, the contract was silent on notice, which obviously caused a problem.  The legal costs were incurred in the discussions and negotiations around what reasonable notice may be.

In general, all of the academic buildings and the buildings in the university are owned by the university.  Plassey Campus Centre and its subsidiaries own the accommodation or residences.  A number of years back, the Plassey Campus Centre, PCC, bought a unit near the university called Park Point as an investment property.  The university has a building which is leased to Munster Rugby.  That is in our accounts as an investment asset.  Obviously, there is the Dunnes Stores transaction, which is owned by the university.  In broad terms, the subsidiaries have the residences and Park Point and the rest of stock of buildings is in the accounts of the university.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General and the commercial auditors, PwC, look at all our transactions and fixed asset additions each year, which include land and buildings in all entities, whether it is subsidiaries or the university.  We have a breakdown of it and they have a breakdown built up from the audits over a number of years.</p></speech>

The impact of the refunds from a subsidiary perspective was a loss of &euro;800,000.  For context, in the previous year, 2018-19, the subsidiaries made a profit of &euro;1.9 million.  That was a swing of &euro;2.7 million, which is consistent with the value of the refunds the president spoke about earlier.  That is the movement.</p></speech>

I see during Covid we managed to spend &euro;1.02 million on entertainment.  I cannot wait to see the breakdown.  Could the witnesses send us that?  In the previous year, &euro;1.7 million was spent but there was no Covid then.  The university still managed to spend &euro;1.02 million on entertainment in 2019-20, although half of the year was affected by Covid.  It must have been party central down at UL for that period.</p> <p>  The other information I want to get is a nauseatingly detailed breakdown of the &euro;496,000 for the strategic project change management and advisory services.  In particular, I want a breakdown of all costs associated with the person who took up that role - moving to Limerick, being put up in Limerick, any settlement assistance or anything financially or in lieu.  Was the person put up in an apartment?  Were they looked after?  Were they wined and dined?  Was there a food allowance, a clothing allowance, a moving allowance or a travel allowance, and everything else under the &euro;496,000?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  It is a tough day for them.  I am trying to be as fair as I can, but I believe we have made no progress.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the university is tackling governance, but this is not just governance.  From a commercial transaction perspective, using publicly funded moneys, it is not credible to say that there is no written record on a valuation worth millions of euro.  Is that fair to say?

The president confirmed earlier that there was no written quotation on file on the large financial transaction regarding the Dunnes Stores site, which involved substantial public funding.  From my limited experience, anyone who has served on the board of a company would know that if the fire extinguishers in a modestly sized building were going to be changed at a value of &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000, the board would ask the manager to get at least two written quotations and present them to it at the next meeting.  I appreciate that Professor Mey is new in the job.  She outlined that in her opening statement, and she accepted that things have not been good or the way they should be.  What I say to her is not meant in any lecturing way, but I think I am expressing the view of the committee that how things have been managed to date at UL is very unsatisfactory.  It is public money.  I acknowledge Professor Mey is aware of that.  We are all public servants.  We will probably revisit these matters again.  I ask that substantial progress be made.  I understand that it can be difficult to deal with issues retrospectively.  We can see there are difficulties in a number of areas.</p> <p>  I understand there were recommendations in the McKenna report regarding the creation of specific roles for individuals.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Today, the committee will be engaging with representatives from the OECD and the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, to discuss the cost of climate action as part of the committee's pre-budget 2022 scrutiny.  The witnesses have already joined the meeting.  I welcome Dr. Ivana Capozza, senior policy analyst&ndash;programme manager in environmental performance reviews, and Ms Tatiana Samsonova, policy analyst for the International Transport Forum, from the OECD and Mr. Se&aacute;n McCabe, executive manager at climate justice centre from TASC.</p> <p>  Before beginning, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely and from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present would do.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I now ask Dr. Copozza to give her opening statement.  After her contribution, we will hear from Mr. McCabe.</p></speech>

I also thank the committee for its interest in the OECD's work and, particularly, in the recently released Environmental Performance Review, EPR, of Ireland.</p> <p>  As our report indicates, Ireland's emissions of greenhouse gases have broadly followed the economic cycle over the past decade.  They declined during the recession of 2007-2012, but rose by 3% with the fast economic growth in the second half of the decade until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world economy, and the Irish economy as well.  Significant underinvestment in the wake of the recession affected the quality of infrastructure and slowed down environmental progress.  Environmental pressures, including greenhouse gas emissions, are likely to intensify with population growth and increasing urban sprawl, road traffic and livestock.  The positive environmental effects of the Covid-19 crisis are expected to be temporary.</p> <p>  This is why more determined action is needed to tackle emissions from buildings, transport and agriculture.  We welcome the Government commitment to phase out coal and peat electricity generation during this decade.  While the share of renewables in the energy mix has more than doubled since 2010, fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix.  In particular, coal, peat and oil provide approximately half of home heating.  Hence, our review suggests that Ireland needs to phase out residential fossil fuel boilers more rapidly, while considering fuel-poverty risks.  Ireland should focus support for energy efficiency on deep building renovations.  Decarbonising transport is also crucial and it was a focus of our report.  Ireland's dispersed settlement pattern and low population density imply that road transport is by far the dominant transport mode.</p> <p>  The EPR welcomes the climate action plan of Ireland as a major step towards bringing emissions down and meeting the European cap-and-trade system target by 2030 which requires the cutting of emissions by 30% compared to 2005.  This plan would also put Ireland on the path to the net-zero emissions goal by 2050.  However, we also highlighted that the plan's implementation requires considerable investment and financial resources, but these resources are not been sufficiently assessed.  Given public finance constraints, engaging the private sector and financial markets is crucial.  For example, the climate action plan contains actions such as massive home retrofitting and expansion of the use of electric vehicles and these actions call for households' willingness to invest.</p> <p>  This brings me to talk about climate change and transport.  The target of almost 1 million electric vehicles by 2030 is the main pillar of Ireland's strategy to decarbonise transport.  Generous subsidies have supported sales of electric vehicles but their share in the fleet remains negligible.  Our report notes that these grants are a costly way to decarbonise mobility.  Ireland should consider complementing these subsidies for electric vehicles with travel demand management, which would include road pricing, and also higher taxation of conventional vehicles and a more extensive charging network.  The planned increase in the share of electric vehicles will also contribute to a significant loss of public revenue from motor fuel taxes and motor vehicle purchase taxes, which are linked to the CO2 emissions of vehicles.  Therefore, there is a need to shift the focus of road transport taxation from fuel use to road use over the medium term.  Such road pricing would help raising revenue on the one hand and better address congestion on the other.</p> <p>  More generally, better incentives are needed to manage travel demand.  Reducing reliance on private vehicles and providing credible alternatives remains a challenge.</p><p>Congestion and the costs relating to it have grown and are expected to increase further, especially in the greater Dublin area.  Except for the Dublin Port tunnel, Ireland does not use road-use charges to manage travel demand.  Hidden car-use subsidies, such as free parking at a workplace, provide implicit incentives to commute by car.  Our report recommends that Ireland consider congestion charges alongside investment and policies to enhance travel conditions for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users.  Revenue from charges of this kind could fund such investment and provide income support to vulnerable households.</p><p> As I touched upon revenue, I will now talk about taxes and revenue.  A credible trajectory of carbon prices is essential to encourage low-carbon consumption, investment and innovation.  It is welcome that the Government has committed to continuing to increase the carbon tax to reach &euro;100 per tonne by the end of the decade.  There are doubts, however, as to whether this would be sufficient to achieve the target of a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p><p> We welcome the fact that the carbon tax receipts are to be used to prevent fuel poverty, ensure a just transition of displaced workers and fund climate-related investment.  The allocation of part of the carbon tax revenue to enhance some social welfare schemes this year is expected to mitigate the impact of the carbon tax on vulnerable households and even contribute to reducing poverty.  Such earmarking of revenue can help create political support for tax increases but, on the other side, it may limit the flexibility to adapt public spending to changing needs.</p><p> It is very positive that Ireland extended the carbon tax to coal and peat in 2013 and, more recently, discontinued support to peat-fired electricity generation.  In general, to maintain a consistent signal, Ireland should gradually remove remaining tax exemptions and rebates that encourage wasteful fuel use in agriculture, fisheries, heating and transport.  For example, there is a cap on diesel prices for all hauliers.  This limits operators' incentives to shift to more fuel-efficient vehicles, driving habits and logistics systems.  Diesel is taxed at a lower rate than petrol, which is in common with many other countries, but this continues to give an incentive for using diesel vehicles, which can have negative consequences for local air quality and animal health.</p><p> There is a fuel allowance to help vulnerable households with heating expenses. This tends to support the use of fossil fuels, which are the main source of residential heating.  We are aware that the allowance is a means-tested lump sum that is not required to be spent on heating.  Nonetheless, its name is unfortunate and may have some undesirable behavioural effects.  This is why we recommended the rebranding of the allowance and spreading it throughout the year, as opposed to just paying it in winter.</p><p> Let me move now to the need to steer the recovery towards the green transition.  Our report highlights that, as part of its response to the crisis, the Irish Government provided sizeable funding to accelerate investment in sustainable transport, energy efficiency, water infrastructure and peatland rehabilitation.  The EPR notes positively that in 2020, the Government's climate-related capital and current expenditure increased by 23% from the previous year to reach 3% of total budget expenditure.  The report also notes, positively, that the national development plan allocates around &euro;30 billion, or more than a quarter of its total outlay, to the climate and energy transition.  We see that the in-depth review of the national development plan, to be completed this year, provides an opportunity to further align investment priorities with climate mitigation goals.</p><p> The OECD welcomes Ireland's ambition in transitioning towards a low-carbon economy.  However, we have some concerns about its effective capacity to deliver.  The scale of the investment needs is remarkable, while additional sizeable fiscal spending is required to support the economic recovery from the effect of the pandemic.  There is a need to mobilise the private sector and financial markets, increase efforts on eco-innovation, provide stronger price signals and remove harmful subsidies to encourage businesses and households to take action.  At the same time, there is a need to take into account affordability, the employment impact and regional disparities.  This is not at all easy.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  My colleague, Ms Samsonova, and I will be happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

I echo Dr. Capozza's point in that what lies ahead of us will not be easy, but it may not necessarily be as difficult as we believe.  It could be very beneficial.  This statement is intended to complement a briefing document I circulated, whose points we can pick up on in discussion afterwards.</p> <p>  The message I would like to deliver today is quite simple: climate action should not be considered a budgetary burden.  It is quite the opposite.  Climate action should be viewed as an unparalleled opportunity to build shared prosperity across the Island of Ireland.   If we get this right and if we plan a successful post-pandemic recovery built upon shared and inclusive climate action, we will allow communities all over the country to unlock their potential and uplift their horizons.  New opportunities for work will allow communities to hold on to young people who have returned home over the past year.  The clubs and facilities closed long before the pandemic due to outward migration and a lack of numbers will reopen.  Local businesses will prosper while issues of connectivity and substandard rural transport will be swept aside.</p> <p>  If we get it right, the workers and the farmers, those of us who are understandably most worried that climate action will be bad for their livelihood, community or way of life, will have their fears allayed.  They will see that their perspectives and knowledge are valued in designing the transition.  With their leadership, existing systems that are causing genuine harm will be dismantled in favour of a fairer, shared and sustainable prosperity.</p> <p>  None of this will happen by accident, however.  It will need to be carefully planned and State led.  Significant resources will be required.  In the first instance, it will be expensive, but the cost of inaction is incalculable.  Inaction, or insufficient or poorly planned action, will lead to catastrophe.  It is hard to overstate the precarity of our situation.  Inaction will devastate our communities.  It will claw at the fabric of our democracy, and it will bring hunger.  This is already happening in that there are already men and women around the world who are warning us that they no longer know when to plant and harvest their crops because of the chaos of seasons fundamentally altered by a warming planet.</p> <p>  The fodder crisis of 2018 gave us some sense of what is ahead.  That harsh winter and wet summer cost Irish farmers more than &euro;500 million in feed costs, not to mention the damage done to mental health and the well-being of families due to the stress of that crisis.  Potentially, we are only two decades, maybe less, away from such a crisis recurring every year or so.  This does not have to be our fate.  There exists a remarkable opportunity to undertake transformative climate action in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  While the pandemic response has brought with it rising public indebtedness due to the response measures, borrowing costs remain exceptionally low.  We should recognise this as the opportunity that it is.  We should use favourable financing conditions to finance debt for climate action at rates close to zero.  There is no evidence that borrowing at a rate of zero is a drag on the economy.  On the contrary, evidence shows that borrowings can generate growth if invested well.  The need for meaningful climate action gives us plenty to invest in.</p> <p>  The most recent stability programme update shows the burden of servicing our debt is set to fall in the coming years.  Despite the fallout from Covid, service payments are set to fall to 1.3% of GNI* by 2025, lower than at any other period in the history of the State.  The current global financing conditions provide an unprecedented opportunity to address long-standing environmental challenges.  The climate crisis is one of those challenges.  It requires State-led green industrial and innovation policy supported by unprecedented capital investment.  Given the scale of the climate crisis, a State-led investment approach should now be prioritised over any efforts to reduce or eliminate the current deficit.</p><p>This State-led approach should design a just transition, predicated on putting the productive assets of climate action and its supply chains into the control of communities so they can lead their own development.  This would be truly transformative.  It can be done by adopting a community wealth-building approach to climate action.  Now is the time to give communities ownership of the new climate economy, to give them windmills and solar farms so that they can use the substantial returns to develop community centres and sports clubs and to create new co-operatives for retrofitting or the roll-out of agroforestry so that the jobs become more than a pay cheque.  Climate co-operatives will build a new identity and become a new chapter in the story of place across the island.   It is time to use climate action to democratise local economies and distribute power more fairly between the local and the national, the producer, the consumer and the middleman, and to allow communities to meaningfully access the benefits of climate action and then witness the social value it will return. </p><p> We must use climate action to tackle poverty.  This starts by ensuring that climate action does not further impoverish people or widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  The cost of climate action, including the cost of retrofitting, and the cost of the switch to renewable energy or a carbon tax should not fall on those who can least afford it.  It is essential that we poverty-proof all climate policies.  </p><p> While the burden of payment for climate action should not fall on those who can least afford it, the conversation about whether the State can afford to take climate action needs to end.  Across the world, multinational corporations are transforming their business models as they recognise that the benefits of climate action are greater than ever before.  As they mobilise, the cost of inaction continues to mount.  That cost is more than the cost of the damage done by climate action.  It is also a cost of missed opportunity.  If we delay or get bogged down in quarrelling about minor expenses, we will miss the bigger transformative picture.   The potential for climate action to tackle inequality and bring prosperity to communities across the island will be sold off to a primed private sector and we will be paying a premium to buy back the wind and sunlight.</p><p> I thank committee members for their time and look forward to answering their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. McCabe and Ms Capozza for their contributions.  The OECD report contained some thought-provoking and policy-provoking suggestions, many of which I have articulated over time.  I will make a general point on this and get the OECD response.  Almost all the significant initiatives in Ireland, whether in relation to retrofitting, the purchase of electric vehicles or the extension of the bike to work scheme to e-bikes, require the purchaser to have a lot of cash upfront or significant savings.  They can be described in a general way as middle class incentives.</p> <p>  There has been an exponential rise in the sale of e-bikes.  A good e-bike costs between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000.  Applicants to the scheme must pay that money upfront before availing of the tax benefits.  People need between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000 to get a decent fully electric vehicle before availing of the incentives.  Those who do not have savings or are not on large incomes may have to take out significant loans to cover the cost.  Over time, they can reap the benefits and rewards of reduced running costs but they have to borrow or have the money upfront.  That precludes a significant proportion of people from investing or taking advantage of the incentives.</p> <p>  Similarly with house retrofits, people need significant cash on hand or savings.  The incentives are considerable.  I will give an example.  I put a good boiler in my house a year and a half ago.  I had to have &euro;3,500 to get the substantial benefits.  If I had not had that money, I would have had to borrow it.  Not an awful lot of people have that amount of cash on hand.  I had to save for a few months to get it.  All the schemes are all front-loaded towards people of means.  That is restrictive and precludes many people.  I would like to get the OECD representatives' views on that.  </p> <p>  Transport formed a major focal point of Ms Capozza's presentation.  We have included e-bikes in our bike to work scheme.  People have to shell out between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 to get one of these e-bikes, which are game-changers for shorter distances.  I know many people who have taken them and say anecdotally they no longer drive to the local village for coffee because they get there more accessibly with an e-bike, and it is much easier than the push bike.  This has been transformative.  In Belgium, which I think is the leader in this area, any money employers spend on electric bike infrastructure is subject to tax relief of up to 125%.  If an employer buys an e-bike for an employee and ensures the employee is not arriving to work in a car or if an employer invests in electric bike infrastructure, such as bike lockers, showers or charging facilities, the cost can be written off in full.  This comes at very little cost to the State and means the bike is free or close to free for the employee.  The scheme here is exclusive as it applies to those who have money.  The tax incentive in the bike to work scheme is considerable but people must have the money upfront to purchase the bike, which makes the scheme restrictive.  </p> <p>  The witnesses are brave to come here and talk about this subject.  Any person who thinks about it for any length of time realises that the more people move to electric or hybrid cars, the less tax they pay.  Transport taxes are high in Ireland, as are excise duties.  The witnesses rightly point out that these costs will have to be moved over to tolls - no, thank you - or more road taxes to decarbonise society.  </p> <p>  I and many other members were local authority members for many years.  The State has a database of fuel users who benefit from the fuel allowance.  Why does the State not bulk purchase either gas or electricity for these fuel allowance recipients and get a much more significant deal for them?  Most of it goes on carbon.  Given the significant stock of social housing - my local authority has 10,000 social housing units - I do not see why those local authorities have not bulk bought energy for their social housing tenants since energy was deregulated.  What are the OECD representatives' views on those matters?  The question on fuel and State engagement in bulk purchasing is directed at the representatives of TASC as well.  It would be laborious, as I was told by council officials, but imagine the savings a local authority could secure for its tenants if it bulk purchased their gas and electricity.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McCabe from TASC wish to respond on the issue of energy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.519" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#C00400"><p>Yes.  I am sure there would be savings but I would go further and ask committee members to imagine the savings that would be achieved from the bulk purchasing of retrofits.</p><p>Imagine what that could do in terms of creating jobs as well.  If we were to divide up the procurement of retrofits by county we could have a retrofitting co-operative in every county, which would allow for bulk purchase and for homeowners to pay back based on their savings.  Insofar as possible, the effort should be to start with social housing.  However, I caution that because of the use of HAP we have to be careful of unintended consequences.  Once we start retrofitting houses, there is a risk that the value of that property goes up in rental value, which could result in tenants being moved in favour of higher paying tenants.</p></speech>

It is a curiosity that there are many tenants who would like to do their bit for climate action but they are utterly in the hands of their landlords and completely powerless as a consequence.   Does Mr. McCabe have any suggestions in that regard?</p></speech>

I am a tenant.  It is a very challenging situation.  This is where we get into the issue of the interdependence between action on the housing crisis and action on climate action.  The challenges are interrelated.  In terms of the tenancy, it should be a do-no-harm approach first.  We need to make sure that we do not inadvertently gentrify areas through retrofitting and push marginal groups further to the peripheries of our society.  If we could ensure security of tenure in a more robust way, we could then look to specialised grants or targeted measures to allow the retrofitting of rented properties.</p></speech>

On energy efficiency, I agree with the remarks made by Mr. McCabe.  We believe that priority should be given to the social housing stock.  We also agree that the State, as well as local authorities, should take the lead and reap the benefits of this type of incentive.</p> <p>  On the fuel allowance, we understand that it is means tested, that is, only vulnerable people get it.  At the same time, it is a lump sum that people can use to buy food or heat.  As such, it is not entirely a fossil fuel subsidy.  We believe that if it were disconnected, even in name, from the purchase of fuel it would be better.  It could be changed to a welfare scheme, with the same amount in payment spread throughout the year, but there would be no link with heating and the use of fossil fuels for heating.  In terms of cost, the budget would be the same.  We believe the term "fuel allowance" may have a behavioural effect.  It may prevent people from even thinking about investing in energy efficiency measures.  I am speaking not necessarily about monetary investment, but behavioural measures at home such as not opening the window when the heating is on.  </p> <p>  I agree with Mr. McCabe's remarks on bulk-buying energy and retrofitting.  We also highlighted in our report that subsidies for EVs can be regressive in a sense rather than progressive in that, as stated, they benefit the middle class.  I will hand over to Ms Samsonova on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tatiana Samsonova" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#D00700"><p>On ebikes and EVs, it is true that this measure is limiting in that vulnerable households are not capable of saving money for the upfront cost of ebikes or EVs.  This needs to be examined from the perspective of what happens in other countries and to what extent Ireland wants to directly subsidise the purchase of EVs or ebikes in particular.  For instance, in Paris a &euro;500 cashback is offered to everyone who buys an ebike.  That is the programme set by Paris between 2019 and 2020.  In other cases, the subsidy is designed to target low-income households.  People submit a statement of income and then they receive a specific subsidy for the purchase of an ebike.  That is another way of doing it.  I understand that is one of the limitations of the incentive structure that is currently being set up in Ireland.  We agree on that.</p></speech>

I also need to attend the Chamber shortly so I will be quick and to the point with my questions.  I probably have too many questions, but I will get through what I can.</p> <p>  My first question is to the witnesses from the OECD and TASC.  It is anticipated that in the upcoming review of the EU fiscal rules there will be changes to the current rules.  One proposal relates to the exemption of green capital investment from debt and deficit considerations.  I am interested in hearing from both witnesses if they believe such a reform would help to support the EU's Green New Deal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#D01100"><p>I will give my two cents worth first.  The cost of capital will be important in realising the transition.  It is a capital intensive process.  It would be a no-brainer for the new fiscal rules to exempt investment in green infrastructure.  I would go one step further.  How we use capital that we borrow for these purposes and the extent to which we can put the productive assets of climate action into the hands of communities, or community control, will be enormous.  To illustrate this point - this is important because numbers help - in Fintry, Scotland, following a protracted negotiation the community was given one turbine out of 15 that were being built locally.  This is ownership.  It is not a once-off payment; it is ownership.  The community is currently earning between &pound;30,000 and &pound;50,000 per annum from that turbine.  Once the loan for the turbine is paid off, which loan was given to the community by the private contractor, the earning for the community will increase to &pound;400,000 per annum.  In terms of an asset for local development, that is phenomenal.  If we borrow to invest, which we should, it should work in a way that will enhance local development as well as our climate action, otherwise, as Ms Samsonova said earlier, we will never realise the social approval necessary to drive this over the line.  We need communities to see tangible benefits.</p></speech>

There is a bit of risk.</p><p>How is green carbon investment categorised so that it is not just green-washing and using the opportunity with the fiscal rules to bring in something which is not at all green?  There is a need for rigour with this.  It is good but difficult to implement, so in principle, I agree.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Mr. McCabe said about community wealth-building.  I am on the same page as him.  I was delighted to hear him mention the need for a green industrial strategy.  I have tried to raise it as much as possible.  As part of any green industrial strategy, the State will need to lead from the front.  How can the State best go about doing this?  Is it through procuring private sector providers or does he see a role for a State body in trying to co-ordinate it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#E00300"><p>It would be a foolish move on the part of the State to contract out all of this work.  It is an enormously significant development opportunity.  Consider it as the biggest stimulus package to ever enter the country.  What we are good at, especially in rural Ireland, is co-operatives.  We should intentionally distribute the jobs and opportunities from climate action and the supply chains.  Retrofitting requires materials.  Silvopasture on farmland will produce a lot of lumber and opportunities.  If we consider the role of co-owned renewable energy services, what else could that generate?  Large seaweed plantations can be co-located with offshore wind turbines.  There is significant job potential for all sorts of diverse industries.  If we want to be serious about rural development, we should borrow, invest heavily, lean into this crisis and distribute the opportunities intentionally using progressive procurement and other methods such as community land trusts.</p></speech>

It shows what an exciting opportunity this is and how exciting the future will hopefully be.  I will move on to the OECD for my last question.  This State has been a laggard when it comes to green investment and a just transition.  We have followed a market-based approach which seeks to unlock private investment and nudge households in a different direction.  I am concerned that that will not be sufficient.  I think that private providers will not have the scale, capacity or risk appetite required to facilitate this transition within the required time.  I feel that the State will need to take a more interventionist approach by becoming a large-scale investor in green technologies and a major purchaser of clean energy.  An important historical comparative experience is the Internet, where the United States, through large-scale funding, guaranteed the market for 35 years.  This helped to incubate the technology while giving private investors time to develop their own commercialisation strategies.  What are the views of the OECD on the role that State-owned enterprises can play in a green and just transition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.536" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ivana Capozza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#E00500"><p>They can and should play an important role in a green and just transition.  The State can do a lot, for example by promoting eco-innovation.  We noted that research and development funding from the State has increased but it is not enough.  There is significant capacity for eco-innovation and adoption of new technology by both large multinationals and local firms.  For example, the support for research and development, and for innovation more generally, should be better targeted towards small and medium enterprises.  This is something that the State could do.  The Deputy mentioned the State as a purchaser of green products and services, while there is significant room for manoeuvre.  There is a green public procurement policy in Ireland but it is not mandatory, so one of our recommendations is to make this policy mandatory, because this would increase demand for green products and services and encourage not only publicly-owned enterprises but also privately-owned enterprises to produce more green services and products.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.538" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#E00700"><p>I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their informative dissertation.  Anecdotally, about ten years ago, my household was totally dependent on oil for home heating.  We bought a wood-burning stove which cost &euro;1,500 and changed over to that.  We reduced our home heating cost by something like 60%.  I think that is a good achievement in a short time for a relatively reasonable investment but, as Deputy Lahart said earlier, not everybody can raise that themselves and they need help.</p> <p>  I strongly support the growth of wind energy.  I know that people will always say that we should have wind turbines offshore.  In other words, they would be out of sight and out of mind where we do not have to see them.  I do not understand why we have that position in this country.  People do not seem to have any problem with them in other countries and live in the middle of them and so on.</p> <p>  The problem that I see in this country is the agrifood sector and the extent to which it is likely to be impacted.  It is the one sector which held up after the economic crash and stood its ground in delivering to the economy.  Interference in that has to be reduced to a minimum.  People talk loosely about cutting the national herd by 10% and so on but that will not work.  It will not work because it will not be accepted by the industry and the farming community, which knows full well how to be green insofar as their enterprise is concerned.</p> <p>  Here are my comments, for what they are worth.  We can use more electric cars.  I travel about 45,000 km per annum.  The experts will say that it is not safe to invest in an electric car because of the limited range and that much time will be spent charging it.</p> <p>  The agrifood sector can do a great deal of carbon sequestration but it is not encouraged to do it.  People always say that it can be done but then somebody else comes along to say that it cannot.  In another committee yesterday, somebody said that wood-burning is all right but it emits particulates which are dangerous from the point of view of respiratory illnesses and so on.  He said that all wood-burning should stop.  If we want to sell something, we should improve the situation before we start telling people to stop everything.  There is no gain at all for the country and the economy if we slow everything down.  This needs to be understood.  The size of our economy has doubled since the 1980s.  There are twice as many people in work now as there were in the 1980s, regardless of Covid.  Covid may be with us for a while but we have to think beyond that.  The population of the country has more than doubled since the 1950s.  That has not affected other countries and economies as much.</p> <p>  The agrifood sector effectively, sustainably and efficiently produces food.  It is better at it than any other country in the world.</p><p>We are a leader in the area of sustainability, milk from grass, beef from grass and so on.  Nobody else can compete with that.  We produce enough food to feed almost 50 million people.  No other country across the globe that I am aware of does that without damaging the environment around it, such as the large-scale deforestation taking place in Latin America and so on.  I am a supporter of alternative energy and the green agenda but as long as we create obstacles as we go along, we will not get the kind of support that is needed to achieve the success that is needed without damaging our economy.</p><p> I am not asking any questions.  The Chair will be glad to know I am only making a comment.  I live in a constituency that is a big agrifood producer.  Before somebody says I have to say that because it is where my support base is, I would point out that it is not.  The majority of my support base is in urban areas.  We have to look at the ability of an economy to deliver and meet sustainability guidelines at the same time.</p><p> We can do that but we need help, understanding and for people to say that we can grow more trees, for example.  Incidentally, I am an amateur tree enthusiast.  If we want to, we can grow spruce trees and do a great deal of carbon sequestration.  They do four times what is done by native and deciduous species, yet everybody says we must plant native and deciduous species.  Why contradict the situation before it gets off the ground at all?  If we are going to be serious about this then let us identify to what extent the agrifood sector can get involved in carbon sequestration, such as growing trees in corners of fields, for example.  A certain number of trees will sequester a certain amount of carbon.  We should make it understandable and easy for people to take on board what they can do in order to make a contribution and to what extent it will make a major contribution.</p><p> I want to be supportive of the move to reliance on sustainable energy and the reduction of emissions and it is possible.  However, if the agenda is to scrap the industry we have in order to achieve that then it will not work, there will be no support for it and there will be considerable agitation, plus the fact that we will not achieve what needs to be achieved in the time available.</p><p> Those are my meanderings.  I have lots more to impart at some later stage but I will simply say that we can and need to progress.  We need to do it quickly, effectively, efficiently and sustainably.  There is a notion nowadays that we can live without high-protein food but we cannot do so and we cannot live without food either.  A large portion of the world's population is on the edge of starvation all the time so we have to produce food and it has to be made available.  As the population of the world grows, we have to make more food available in a sustainable way.  There are many challenges that we can overcome but we will not do so if we turn on ourselves and decide that we can abolish part of our economy in order to achieve a target.  If we do so, soon after that our dependability will be on forces outside of our control and we will have to buy our food from different areas.</p></speech>

I hear what Deputy Durkan is saying but I would also say that the specific words he used were "the agri industry".  I fully understand the value the agri industry contributed post-recession but I also know that in terms of income, farming is the most unequal sector in our country and that is inexcusable.  We have some bad faith actors operating in the sector who are making it sound like farming is on the chopping board if we take climate action.  It is the complete opposite.</p> <p>  I travelled around this country in a van, slept in it and met as many farmers and fishermen as I could over a six-week period back in autumn 2019 when the fodder crisis was still fresh in people's memories and the farmers knew that this would bring back the hunger in the long run.  We have to be on the side of the farm and we have to act in such a way that we recognise the power imbalance that exists between the farmers, the middlemen and the multiples that are putting inordinate pressure on our farmers to produce at remarkably low value.  The Deputy is right that it is incredibly high quality produce but they are being paid nothing for it and instead we are importing vegetables.  We have growers in north County Dublin going out of business and we are importing vegetables that are grown by what are basically indentured servants in the south of Spain.  That is unacceptable.</p> <p>  We have to consider our food system and model.  The idea that we are going to persist over the next 15 years in exporting powdered milk to Vietnam is insane.  That business is not going to be viable in the long run.  If we pin our farmer's hopes on that, it is they who will suffer.</p></speech>

Exporting powdered milk may well be less sustainable than other methods but there will be a market for it.  If people who receive that powdered milk now cannot get it in the future, they will have other problems such as the starvation I mentioned.  I can see that we are not going to agree on this but I do not intend on letting any dog run off with a bone on this.  I grew up on a farm.  I was born and reared on the land and I lived and worked on the land for a good part of my life.  I have a fair idea of what it takes to exist in most situations.  I always resented it when people who claimed to be experts began to lecture me on how I should and could do the job better and more effectively than they could by living on their criteria.</p> <p>  I do not agree.  We should meddle to the least possible degree with the productive sectors that we have because we have proven to be experts in those area.  I repeat that we can produce more effectively and sustainably than anybody else and we continue to do that.</p></speech>

With the greatest of respect, I also grew up in rural Ireland and laboured on a farm, although I did not grow up on one.  I understand the enormous contribution farmers have made to this country and it is on their backs that much of our prosperity has been built, particularly during the era of co-operatives and when those co-operative abattoirs or creameries created ten or 15 jobs in communities across rural Ireland.  The resounding point I heard over and over again was that the closure of the co-operatives was the mistake that was made in the history of development.</p> <p>  I am not trying to lecture the Deputy as an expert but I am trying to express what I heard from farmers when I carried out an intentional listening exercise in going around this country.  They are the experts and if we centre their opinions we will reach a good and better solution to this that pays farmers well, allows rural Ireland to prosper and diversifies income where necessary.  It is a real win-win.  The only people who may not win are the people currently profiting massively from the system as it is.  We have to ask ourselves how many people are profiting massively from the system as it is.  Is it the majority of farmers?  It is not.</p><p>I am not lecturing the Deputy.  I am just saying what I have heard.  I have heard farmers struggling.  I have heard people say they are concerned that they will have to leave their farms and move away from traditional farming.  One then sees conglomeration, the concentration of land into the hands of individuals.  That will soon be the concentration of land into the hands of corporations and we will have Nestl&eacute; farms and Danone farms in Ireland.  We need to take clear stock of where we are at, listen to farmers and the situation they are facing.  We must ensure that climate action improves their lot, and it can do, but we need to stop the myths about how it will destroy Irish farming.  It will not.  It may provide a new lease of life for farming.</p></speech>

If that does not happen, we will have a problem.  During a recent election, I stood my ground when there was total opposition to wind turbines.  There were meetings of 500 and 600 people who were abusing left, right and centre.  I stood my ground and held that ground all the time without shift or change.  It was not easy to do that when the amount of abuse was colossal.  I expect that there will be an understanding on the part of the wider community that what can be done should and will be done with the co-operation, help and encouragement of the agrifood producing sector.  We excel in that regard.  We are the best in that business although many people would try to tell us otherwise.  That is my view.</p></speech>

It is an important debate and I do not think we get into enough of the detail.  Fundamentally, everybody here should want to protect livelihoods across rural Ireland and farmers will be doing a lot of the work we need to address climate change.</p> <p>  I want to speak mostly about transport but I will pick up Deputy Durkan's point about the efficiency of our agrifood sector.  He is absolutely right.  I say this with absolute respect for the Deputy, who I admire greatly, but it is not true to say that our agricultural practices do not harm our environment because they absolutely do.  They do so very much at a local level and we must manage and mitigate that as best we can.  They certainly do on a global level.  Our experts from the OECD will perhaps speak about global and greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with agriculture.  We must change how we are doing agriculture.  We must be clever about it and figure out a way that actually works for farmers in particular and keeps them working the land and turns them towards doing things in the right way.</p> <p>  I will move on to speak about transport.  I have not yet welcomed our guests from the OECD and TASC.  I do so now.  Ms Samsonova will probably speak about transport.  Her colleague in the International Transport Forum, Dr. Elisabeth Windisch, was before the Joint Committee on Climate Action a few months ago.  She was excellent and informed a report that committee did on emissions in the transport sector.  That report makes 47 recommendations to the Government so I hope when the OECD is doing its next report on Ireland's performance, many of those recommendations will have been taken on board and a serious shift in transport policy in Ireland can be identified, one that it is helping to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, which are 40% of energy-related emissions and 58% of non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions.  It is hugely significant in terms of our emissions profile.  </p> <p>  Perhaps the overarching theme of our transport emissions sessions was the avoid, shift and improve approach.  The idea is that demand must be managed and the need for journeys must be reduced.  Everything that can be done in that space must be done.  The second priority is to switch to modes that are more sustainable and only after the possibilities have been exhausted should one start looking at efficiency such as electrification.  Our target is to have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  That was the target of the old climate action plan and, in my view, it is neither achievable nor desirable, considering that we sell between 100,000 and 120,000 new vehicles every year.  It would mean that every new vehicle manufactured between now and 2030 would have to be an electric vehicle and I do not see how we can reach that target without throwing considerable subsidy at the purchase of electric vehicles.  It is also not desirable because electric vehicles are still vehicles and still give us a lot of problems, including emissions problems.  They do not give us the greenhouse gas emissions but particular emissions are associated with electric vehicles and those are significant.  They do not solve many of our problems.  It is a costly way to decarbonise mobility and a crude way of reducing emissions.  It does not take into account the value of the additionalities, or improvement to air quality, public health and liveability in our towns, villages and cities by reducing space for vehicles.  I would like it if our guests could go further in these areas than they have in their statements.  It is timely that our guests are before us because a climate action plan will be coming out in the next few months.  If our guests could tell us what the State needs to do in transport, it could have a major influence on our policy direction in the next few years.</p></speech>

I can only concur with his comments and with the statement my colleague, Dr. Windisch, made previously.  We tried to highlight in the report that it is indeed very important that only focusing on improved types of measures and on electrification is an extremely costly way to decarbonise the transport system in Ireland.  It will drain budgets and is still going in the direction of car ownership, which is the opposite direction in which we want to be moving if we are thinking in terms of improving well-being and quality of life.  Improving well-being and quality of life is about reducing reliance on private cars which occupy a lot of space, in urban areas in particular.  They occupy both parking and road space.  That is why for the International Transport Forum, in particular, one of the key points is to focus on avoid and shift types of measures.  Those include managing travel demand and that is why one of the recommendations in the report is to think about considering congestion charges, which are a way to spread demand throughout the day.  We should not think about it as a financial burden or a price we are putting on all private vehicles.  The idea is, rather, to make drivers pay for all the negative externalities they are producing, including noise, congestion, the use of public space and so on and so forth.</p> <p>  We also highlight many positive shifts that are happening in Ireland, in particular the shift of investment budgets from road construction, that is quite counterproductive and only induces demand to public transport, to specifically having 15% or 20% of the budget dedicated to improving cycling and walking conditions.  That is extremely important.</p><p>We see in other countries, for instance, and I will give this example from here in Paris, that a huge strategy to reallocate road space to cycling and walking actually brought an increase in and modal shift to cycling and walking.  Many people now cycle, walk or use public transport go to work, especially given the situation with Covid-19 where people still feel a little bit wary when it comes to using public transport.  We do not really want that demand to be consumed by people using cars but rather shaped to sustainable modes.  Reallocation of road space, in particular, is one of the key things Ireland can consider and hence improve conditions for walking and cycling.</p><p> I feel from the discussions we have had that some positive shifts are happening but a lot of thoughts and hopes are still put on subsidising electric vehicles.  I believe this needs to be reassessed.  It may not bring Ireland towards the targets and in the direction it actually wants to go.</p></speech>

I thank both organisations for their presentations.  I will not go back over old ground but I want to touch initially on public transport.  Coming from a rural constituency, I know the vagaries of transport and the hit-and-miss efforts that can be made in trying to provide it.  The reality is that in rural Ireland, in many cases, there is no other mode of transport except for the car.  If, therefore, we are to shift the mode of transport to public transport, we need to be serious about how we are going to do it.  A project that Deputy Leddin will know well, for instance, is the western rail corridor, which could do an awful lot to improve connectivity along the west coast.  If there is going to be a signal that public transport infrastructure will be dealt with in a serious way, this is one sure way of doing it in a very quick manner to make sure we have transport we can use.  It is very important that we do that.</p> <p>  I spoke in the D&aacute;il last night on climate action.  I cited the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which right now is cutting some of its services because it cannot afford to run them.  The reality is that is what is happening.  The reality is that the carbon tax, while necessary, penalises people who have no other choice but to use a car that burns fossil fuel at the moment.  They do not have the infrastructure in terms of the charging points and the cost of electric vehicles is prohibitive.</p> <p>  To touch on farming, I believe that farmers are very much of the opinion that they are doing an awful lot right.  They feel in general that they are being targeted.  One of the reasons I feel they are being targeted is because we are not an industrialised country and therefore the emissions, when one measures them, are in a higher bracket.  We are first in class in dairy production in Europe.  We are fifth in class in beef production.  We must build on that.  We must take the carbon emissions from agriculture, ring-fence them and deal with them in isolation rather than putting them into the global pot.</p> <p>  Having been a member of a local authority since 2004, I find that planning can be a huge problem, whether it be for a wind farm, solar farm or someone doing something that fits in with the green agenda and climate action, with which I agree.  Our planning situation, however, is such that in certain places, especially in Connemara, people cannot build.  Some of the places are designated in the west of Ireland.  We might say we have a vision, which is great, but at the same time, we cannot realise that vision unless we actually change policies to make sure that we give preference.  We might have to make some hard decisions about where we would locate things such as wind farms.</p> <p>  The other issue I will touch on is this area of just transition.  Deputy Durkan gave the example of changing his heating system.  The reality is that if a person wants to put air to water heating into a standard type house in this country, it will cost &euro;25,000, with approximately &euro;3,500 of a grant.  Unfortunately, therefore, a person has a lot of work to do to raise the rest of the money to do that.  I know because I have just done it.  I do not know whether it will benefit me yet because I will have to see it running for a year or two to get the cost right.  I was lucky enough that I could get access to a loan to do that.</p> <p>  At the moment, we are rolling out the better energy homes schemes for people on fuel allowance to try to improve energy efficiency in their houses.  The problem is that people wait for two years for an engineer to come to the site to tell them what they are entitled to or what can be done to improve the house.  In the past, we did schemes where the building energy rating, BER, never improved.  Works were carried out but the BER was not included.</p> <p>  What galls me about much of what we spoke about is that sometimes people make decisions and say they are right decisions.  One of the most fundamental decisions we made, which was a wrong decision to make, was closing our sugar industry in this country.  That actually removed a huge part of the treatment of tillage farming in the west of Ireland and right across the country.  That is now painfully missed.  Not alone did we close it but we rushed to demolish the factories as quickly as we could afterwards in case anybody would ever attempt to produce sugar again.</p> <p>  When we run with these ideas, we must also listen.  This is the biggest issue arising from yesterday and from talking about climate action the last couple of weeks.  Mr. McCabe mentioned that he went around in a van for six weeks speaking to farmers.  I have spoken to them.  They have been talking to the powers that be but feel they are not being listened to and that what they are saying is not being acted upon.  That is creating a divide we do not need; the notion that somebody is out to get them.  Listening is one thing.  Taking in what is being said is the second and the third is then to react in a way that everybody is brought along and we are all in this together, like we have been during the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>  Having said that, this is the only thing I want to know.  We are here in our capacity as the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We are going to have to find the money in this country to fund this climate action.  Does anybody know how much it will cost, where we will get the money and how we will pay it back?  The payback will be there for young people, the country and whatever else.</p> <p>  The co-operative movements are fine but not compared to what they were in the past.  They are now full up with paperwork, compliance and all those types of things.  Nobody will touch them because they are too cumbersome.</p><p>People will run away from this type of stuff, such as procurement.  It is concerning that we are passing a Bill and we do not know what will be the cost.</p></speech>

I take all the Deputy's points, which are all very well made.  They are all interrelated, which is surprising, and it all ties in with his final question.  I have an answer to that but I will start by running through a couple of responses.</p> <p>  On transport, it does not make sense to privatise or offer private services on the more profitable routes in the country and then not have the revenues to run routes where they are not profitable.  The idea of a State-led intervention in all this would be that we would take the profits from where we make the money - the busier areas - and we would open radically different public transport in rural areas.  That is the point.</p></speech>

That is how I understand we tax people and pay for public services that help us grow as a country.  That is my thinking.</p> <p>  I have two other points.  On the question of agriculture, I take the points made by Deputies Canney and Durkan.  Farmers feel as if they are not being listened to, and that relates to Deputy Canney's final question.  They definitely do not feel their needs and priorities are being acted on.  There are also very concerning dynamics, with farmers taking on massive levels of debt to lock themselves into the current model, which is building larger parlours and sheds, renting or buying land.  These are huge levels of debt and because there is no cash flow through the farm and farmers are doing all the work themselves.  They cannot afford to pay for labour and they are doing longer days and working harder than ever before.  It is unsustainable on a human level, aside from the economic level.  We must really interrogate that.</p> <p>  We must also interrogate the consumer side, as consumers must shop in multiples that offer goods for nothing because they work two jobs on minimum wage just to get by.  We can solve both sides of that equation by giving people real opportunities to shop locally and buy local produce.  I know this does not fit in with the larger dairy model we have kind of become wedded to in this country.  There is room for both in the first instance and then we must consider what is very sustainable in the long run for the farming community.</p> <p>  On the just transition, what has not come up here at all is Bord na M&oacute;na.  We cannot forget that there has been an effort of merit to enable the transition of the workers of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is a very serious matter.  It is already too late to get on that but we really must ensure the just transition funding coming from Europe and us creates a transformative environment for the midlands.</p> <p>  On the sugar industry, I completely agree that co-ops are difficult now and absolutely laden.  That is the enabling environment for them.  That is a policy position.  When we closed the co-operative dairies and abattoirs and moved everything to this hybrid plc model, we also changed the environment to better favour the hybrid plc model.  We can go back and there is no problem creating that environment.</p> <p>  The Deputy's final point concerned funding.  If I were in members' shoes, I would take &euro;100 million per year and put it into nothing else but listening and allowing people to participate in a meaningful way, listening to farmers, fishermen and the people in rural communities who feel they have been left behind.  I would do that every year with &euro;100 million just to facilitate this dialogue.</p> <p>  Looking at a participation fund like that, there are 1,087 parishes in Ireland and I would this at that level.  I would give every parish approximately &euro;65,000 per year to fund a facilitator to help the community through this transition.  That might sound like a lot but we are in a massive crisis.  On the co-operative piece, we would need to put in more than &euro;200 million into the process.  Once communities have come up with their own solutions, how do we give them the resources to activate those solutions?  The communities will come up with solutions.  Any of us who have spent time in the community know their ingenuity.  I am working on two projects right now, with one in Phibsborough in Dublin and one in Ardara in Donegal and we are trying to work with the community to unlock potential in the climate crisis and identify their own solutions.</p> <p>  We will get this to a stage where the community will have a costed plan and we need resources to flow in behind that.  The solution is borrowing.  There was mention of debt falling on our children and grandchildren but countries are not households so we should not view debt in the same way as we do household debt.  There are two figures to bear in mind, which are the deficit and the denominator, which is the size of our economy.  If we act the way we are talking about here and distribute opportunity across the country, our economy will grow rapidly and our debt, which is not, by and large, indexed to inflation, will stay the same size and what we repay will shrink relative to the size of our economy.  We cannot think about debt as something that will somehow land on our children or grandchildren.  What will land on our children and grandchildren is food insecurity, flooding and the potential of an entire societal breakdown as a result of the chaos the climate crisis could bring.  We must act in a robust way now.</p> <p>  The final piece is critical as it must happen in the next three or four months.  We have had the LEADER programme in Ireland and it was very successful.  I could give some figures but they are in the document I sent to the committee.  It has not been as successful in recent years, partly because the amount of money going to it has been reduced and there are some issues around the independence of local action groups etc.  We will not go into that now.</p> <p>  LEADER has evolved in the European Union and it has become the community-led local development multifund approach.  This means that rather than just coming through the Common Agricultural Policy, community-led local development funding can come through all the Structural Funds.  As we negotiate our plans with the EU over the next six months to arrive at our plans for the next six years, we should insist that the money we take in from each of these funds, including the just transition fund, is ring-fenced for the bottom-up processes that are enabled by a LEADER-type approach.  We can then work on improving a LEADER model.  If we really want to unleash the potential of communities, that is absolutely critical and time sensitive.  We must move on it soon.</p> <p>  I hope this goes some way to answering the Deputy's questions.  There should be &euro;100 million per year on participation and more than &euro;200 million per year to enable the outcomes of that participation and co-operative approaches.  We must also look at how community-led local development multifund approaches, if adopted in Ireland, could put resources at a community's disposal.</p></speech>

We agree that on many peripheral and rural routes, private cars are indispensable.  That is for sure.  There is a need to invest more in rural programmes and I know there is Local Link.  The Deputy also stated that in urban areas, public transport is heavily subsidised and asked where we can get that money.</p><p>There are ways of diversifying funding sources, especially if we consider land value capture mechanisms.  The UK levies a specific amount on new developments that benefit from Crossrail, for example.  Those that benefit more pay more and those that benefit less pay less, but they still pay a levy, and that has helped to fund the project.  The same applies to business rates supplements in respect of the rates applied to commercial businesses that benefit from the construction of new infrastructure.  The mass transit railway, MTR, in Hong Kong is another example.</p><p> This is one of the approaches that could liberate funds and cross-fund rural areas and necessary services, in particular demand-responsive transport.  It is difficult to make public transport more competitive than cars in an environment where there is low density, but that brings us to the point that there is a need to promote more compact developments.  Some shifts are already being made on that front.  Ireland is no exception - environments with low-density developments and rural areas are problematic in this context everywhere.  We argue that there is a need for additional investment, especially if one of the directions Ireland wants to go in is towards substituting car trips, in particular for local journeys, with public transport.</p></speech>

Those Deputies who would like to ask a second question should please raise their hands.</p> <p>  While people are organising themselves, I might ask a question.  We have spoken a great deal about expenditure and green investment, but in terms of the cost of climate change, we have not spoken much about fines levied on Ireland for failing to meet its climate targets.  In its submission, TASC puts the fines somewhere in the region of &euro;7 billion by 2030.  I am interested in the OECD's outlook.  In the past year or two, I have had opportunities to discuss with various Members of the Oireachtas the likelihood of fines being levied.  There does not seem to be a great deal of concern about it.  Are we likely to see that level of fine levied on Ireland if we fail to meet our targets?  How would we go about addressing that issue through a medium or long-term budget strategy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ivana Capozza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chair for her question.  We have not quantified the fines that Ireland could pay as TASC has done, but there is a risk of not meeting the 2030 targets under the EU policy framework, namely, emissions that are outside the emissions trading system, ETS.  We understand from the Environmental Protection Agency's simulations and projections that there is a need to implement all measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan just to achieve some of the targets.  There would still be a need to use the international carbon market.  That would be a cost, albeit possibly not as much as paying the fine.  There is a need to implement in a timely and thorough way all of the measures that have been outlined.  In fact, more than those measures must be implemented, given the increased ambition of going beyond the targets set at EU level, but the fines would only relate to the targets set at EU level.</p> <p>  There is a risk of being penalised.  That should be considered as part of the overall cost of inaction.  The main cost of inaction is not the fine, though, but the consequences for the Irish economy and Irish people.  That cost can be quantified, of course, and the quantification to date has outlined a huge cost to people's quality of life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#K00400"><p>The fines are an important consideration, but to echo Dr. Capozza, the opportunity cost will be much more critical.  It is also worth noting that the Paris Agreement has within it a ratchet mechanism, which I hope will come into play at the Conference of the Parties, COP, this year and again in 2026 more or less.  Under the mechanism, every country or, in Ireland's case, the EU will have to increase its nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement.  Not only are we not hitting our current targets, but those targets will increase rapidly.  By the middle of this decade, the infeasibility of the 2050 targets will be realised.  We cannot set targets for 2050, as it will be far too late.  According to global equity, Ireland should be hitting 0% emissions by approximately 2025.  That shows just how far behind we are in trying to achieve our targets.</p> <p>  The fines are one matter, but if we seize the opportunity and lean into this challenge, we will see the creation of jobs and livelihoods and a distribution of opportunity across the country.  That is what we are missing out on currently.  A fine of &euro;7 billion would be a hefty sum - I took the figure from the carbon brief - but it pales in comparison to the opportunity cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#K00500"><p>I am mindful that there are just over 20 minutes left, so I will be brief.  Previously, we spoke about the cost-benefit analyses of infrastructural projects.  On the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, which I Chair, a theme that surfaced repeatedly was that our methodologies for appraising major infrastructural projects were inappropriate for the challenges facing us.  The time horizon is generally set to 30 years and the discount rate is 4%.  It is almost as if the infrastructure will disappear after 30 years and have no value beyond that.  As Deputy Canney rightly pointed out, if we invested the &euro;150 million or &euro;200 million now that it might cost to get the western rail corridor back up and running, the corridor would be there for 100 years or, with the right maintenance approach, 200 years.  On the other hand, other types of infrastructure can induce driving, and even electric vehicles, EVs, have a significant fossil energy cost depending on from where the source energy comes.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on these points.  Are there examples of countries that have changed their appraisal mechanisms for major infrastructural projects such that they actually factor in the projects' low-carbon or high-carbon intensities?  There are other additionalities.  For example, we spoke about opportunity cost and not factoring in other considerations.  It is not just about carbon cost.  There are other reasons.  For example, we do not want a car-dependent society because of the inequalities and serious knock-on effects for our population.</p></speech>

To be honest, I am not familiar with the cost-benefit analysis, CBA, process.</p><p>I assume it is mostly based on value of time because that is how a country goes about CBA.  When there is a CBA process, at the ITF we consider it very important to have an additional process that takes into account accessibility, as well as the extent to which this particular project is improving access for everyone, by other means.  Accessibility is something that is very hard, and almost impossible, to quantify, but there are qualitative ways of doing so, especially if you look at examples in the UK.  It has a standard CBA process based on value of time, costs and benefits but, additionally, each project is evaluated, using this accessibility indicator, to see what extent a particular project will improve access by car or public transport and how many people will benefit from it. </p><p> The ITF has done a lot of work at round tables we have organised on the topic.  The problem is that it is hard to put a number on those aspects related to improving quality of life or well-being of people.  That is why it is hard to present to someone saying we are going to improve people's quality of life by X or Y; it does not work like that.  One of the ways of going about it is having this qualitative, not quantitative, aspect that is related to CBA, which is also included in the decision-making process.</p></speech>

It exists but is a kind of box-ticking exercise.  We need to make it meaningful.  Consider, for example, the impact were we to manage to keep open GAA clubs around the country that have suffered outward migration and closure.  Na Fianna in Phibsborough did a social value assessment of its operations and for every euro invested, &euro;50 was returned.  We have to consider these intangible co-benefits of climate action.  If we distribute opportunities across the country and if a GAA club is kept open, that is astounding.  It is very important and I hope we can find proper measures.</p> <p>  Another key point to make is that Nicholas Stern, a conservative economist from the UK, has previously indicated that the tail risk associated with climate action is so enormous and contains such negative social outcomes that we also need to factor that into the cost-benefit analysis.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021061700002#L00500"><p>It is very interesting.  I concur with the sentiments Deputy Leddin expressed on cost-benefit analysis.  We are talking about having to invest while money is cheap but where do the fiscal spending rules lie as a result?  Can we ignore them in order to save our society for the future?  If we are getting money at zero interest rate should we just go for it and ignore the fiscal rules that may apply in order to make sure we save our planet?</p> <p>  The other side of it all is that we are looking at ourselves as a small country, how the world will benefit from what we do and how we will benefit from what the rest of the world will do, especially China and the US, in trying to get us all to an equal state.  To go back to farming, when you think about the methods we use compared to some of these other countries, it is very questionable as to whether the impact of our actions alone will stop flooding in Ireland.  Maybe we have to show by example.  </p> <p>  I thank the three participants again.  This has been a great exercise.  We could meet all day and still learn from them.</p></speech>

I totally get the Deputy's point about larger countries.  I will tell a little anecdote.  I spent two years working in a hospice in Calcutta in India and I saw the effects of energy poverty there.  In fact, one of the communities where the hospice was built burnt to the ground, due to someone trying to link their shanty to an overhead power cable in some rudimentary manner.  It caught fire and burnt 200 people out of their homes.  While we can look at the enormous collective carbon footprints of these places, as individuals their footprints are much lower than ours.  Our personal footprints are much larger than anyone in China or India, though much lower than people in the US, so we have to keep that under consideration, but it is a key point.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's first point, personally, I would absolutely borrow to save the planet but it is not really the planet that is in trouble; it is us.  The planet will be grand but we cannot be held back by human constructions when the laws of thermodynamics are what we will actually be held to account on in this crisis.  We cannot continue the way we are going.  We need to radically change course.  All signals from Europe seem to be that a green recovery will be supported.  As the Deputy mentioned earlier, even the concept of excluding green infrastructure from the fiscal rules bodes very well.  It comes back to the points made on transport earlier.  We should be dreaming as big as we can in terms of transport.  A railway network across the whole country, and linking villages big and small with light rail, will transform the country in a decade.  It would be unbelievable and would be great for all of us.  It is possible.  The money would be accessible to us if we went about it the right way.  That is my perspective.</p></speech>

It was mentioned during a previous intervention that, to be fair on a global level, Ireland should reach the target even earlier than indicated.  All countries have their own responsibilities.  The fact that China, the US or India are not doing their jobs is not an excuse not to act.</p> <p>  It would be very hard for the OECD to say not to consider fiscal spending rules.  Of course, this is not OECD wisdom so I will not say that.  However, it is true that the EU is opening up many opportunities and these should be used as much as possible.  Ireland has a recovery and resilience plan, which will use at least 37% of the fund for the green transition.  Ireland could be even more ambitious in that respect.  Opportunities are also there in negotiating EU funds for the next multi-annual six-year programme.</p><p>There are opportunities there, even meeting the fiscal standing rules.  Each crisis can be an opportunity to put aside the fiscal rules.  The OECD would say that that is a dangerous path, but <i>voil&agrave;.</i></p></speech>

I listened with interest to this particular subject.  It is very close to my heart.  I want to make it work.  However, I want to eliminate contradictions.  Again, for example, Mr. McCabe referred to the midlands and the Bord na M&oacute;na shutdown.  When one shuts down first, one then creates a problem for selling the argument or the case that one wants to sell.  Therefore, a replacement needs to come first, or the replacement needs to be in place.  For example, we stopped the use and production of peat.  I understand all that.  However, we replaced it then by importing a replacement from Germany for the horticultural sector, of which we have a huge amount in my own constituency, right across the midlands, across north County Dublin, and all the other places.  It is very difficult to make the farming community understand or even to make me understand the logic of that.  I would have thought that we would have first done one part of the job and reduced by a gradual process the dependence on peat in the horticultural sector, before cutting it off and going in the other direction.  The danger is that we will never get away from dependence on imports.</p> <p>  My last point is simply that there is a huge amount to be gained from a clean environment.  The agrifood business has much to offer.  However, it does not any credit for what it already does.  For instance, it does not get any credit for the benefit of hedgerows or for the growing of trees.  We hear about the re-wetting of the countryside.  Those who live in the countryside quickly point out to us that a large proportion of the countryside has been re-wetted often enough, particularly in the last six months or so.  It does not need any help in that direction.  It is a natural thing.</p> <p>  I would love to see a situation where the experts can engage with the agrifood productive sector, which is the backbone of our economy, when it comes to working our way out of a difficulty.  They should engage with those in the sector to try to understand the position they come from, and the position we have to achieve.  The agrifood businesses will do that, are capable of doing it and want to do it.  Let us not forget that they have been managing the rural environment for centuries, for millennia.  The longer that this debate goes on, the more important it is that we understand each other.  I speak as a person who lives in and works for both the urban and rural communities.  We cannot get by without both.  We need a mixed and balanced economy.  </p> <p>  As the Chair knows, during the economic crash, I spent most of my time apologising to economists.  I do not disrespect to anybody.   Many of the economic theories did not work.  They all told us what we should do and what would be best.  They were all wrong.  That is the sad part about it.  We had to, therefore, do it the hard way in this country.  We dragged ourselves up by our bootlaces through the medium of the agrifood sector, in particular.</p> <p>  I disagree entirely with the notion that we do not make a contribution.  Given our methodology in the agrifood business, we already do what they cannot do in other parts of the globe.  They are saying that if we make all the sacrifices that we are going to make a major contribution.  We can make all the sacrifices we need, but unless there is global co-operation in this area, with India, China, the United States, and so on, we are not going to make any major impact on what we need to do-----</p></speech>

I agree completely with the Deputy on his first point about the transition and the need to not do contradictory things that confuse people.  We need, in all instances, a subsidy-first approach.  We need to help people before we hurt them.  The carbon tax is a good example of that.  We need to make sure that we manage the carbon tax in such a way that people are not put into fuel poverty.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s last point, where he mentioned sacrifice, I do not think this is a sacrifice.  It comes down to how we view it.  As I said previously, it is the most unparalleled opportunity for stimulus across the entire island, if we get it right.  The financial conditions are right to do it.  We can do it.  It does not have to be on the back of the farmers.  In fact, if we do it right, the farmers will prosper from it.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Fergal Lynch, Secretary General of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and departmental representatives Carol Baxter, &Uacute;na N&iacute; Dhubhghaill and Richard Quilliam.  I am delighted to welcome from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Sin&eacute;ad Gibney, chief commissioner, and commission member Adam Harris.</p> <p>  I remind members they are allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the precincts of Leinster House or when the D&aacute;il meets in the convention centre.  In this regard, if members are joining remotely, I will ask them to confirm they are in the grounds of Leinster House or in the convention centre.  For anyone watching this meeting, witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to unprecedented circumstances, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.  </p> <p>  Before we commence our proceedings, I bring your attention to the formalities and advise our witnesses on that matter.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  Members are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or not the extent to which the evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter they must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Lynch to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

As the Chair said, I am joined by my departmental colleagues Carol Baxter, assistant secretary, &Uacute;na N&iacute; Dhubhghaill, principal officer, and Richard Quilliam, assistant principal officer.</p> <p>  Our Department was established in its current format last October.  This is the first opportunity for officials to meet with the committee since we took on very important disability functions from what was the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have also taken on other functions in the equality area, as well as matters relating to international protection and integration.  Since we became the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, our formal mission is to enhance the lives of children, young people, adults, families and communities, recognising diversity and promoting equality of opportunity.  For the first time Ireland has a Department with "Disability" in its title, illustrating that disability is a key pillar of our work.  It is an area we will continue to expand on with the transfer to us of responsibility for community-based disability services from the Department of Health.</p> <p>  It is both practical and symbolic that the Department tasked with promoting equality now has responsibility for important strands of disability policy and that this responsibility is set to grow further.  Taking on these functions is central to our wish to move from medical models of disability to a social and rights-based way of thinking about, and progressing, disability issues.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is key to how we wish to plan and deliver our work.  The breadth of the new Department&rsquo;s remit ensures that we see our work in disability not as a single focus area, but one that intersects with our other policy responsibilities across equality, children and young people.  This encourages us to think more widely, understanding that the links between disability, gender, race and age affect people in complex ways.  We need to think and work with those complexities in mind.</p> <p>  The new Department has a pivotal role in respect of progressing disability and promoting the implementation of the UN convention.  Since October last, we become the national focal point and co-ordination mechanism for the UN convention.  This places us at the centre of all activity relating to the progression of the convention and the specific actions that are being taken across Departments.  While we are not implementers of the vast majority of policy relating to disability, we have key responsibilities in monitoring and co-ordination of that activity.  For example, the Department is responsible for our reporting requirements to the UN committee.  In this regard, I can report today that we are at an advanced stage in the drafting of Ireland&rsquo;s initial state report to the committee.  I am conscious of concerns to conclude this phase as soon as possible, and we are keen to do so, but we consciously took time for a meaningful consultation process.  </p> <p>  The Department also has responsibility for the design of an overarching UN convention implementation plan, which we are currently working on and will be an important basis on which to pursue and monitor our progress in implementation.  In addition, the Department co-ordinates the activity which takes place under two key Government strategies, the national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  These responsibilities are not simply administrative.  In fact, they afford the Department a position from which it can promote a human rights and UN convention-conscious approach across Departments and agencies.  In addition to these important co-ordination roles, we have direct responsibilities for implementing policy that progresses the realisation of the rights of people with disabilities in particular areas.  Specifically, the Department is responsible for establishing a disability participation and consultation network, funding the employers for change initiative, continuing to progress key legislation relating to disability and delivering the access and inclusion model.</p><p>The disability participation and consultation network is aimed at ensuring we deliver on the obligations of the convention to include and hear directly from people with disabilities and their representative organisations when developing policy legislation.  The employers for change imitative provides a vital service in the context of the employment of people with disabilities.  Removing barriers to work and employment is the key to the implementation of the convention.  The progress on key legislation relating to disabilities includes the ongoing work on the assisted decision making legislation, which I hope will be considered by the Government the week after next, and the commencement in December last of the Irish Sign Language Act.  The Department is, therefore, providing for law that promotes and protects the rights of individuals with disabilities.  The access and inclusion model provides for access and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in early years education, ensuring that Ireland has an inclusive education system at all levels, as required under Article 24 of the convention.</p><p> When the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, appeared before this committee in November last, he stated that he was "determined that our new Department [would be grounded in] in human rights and social justice" and that it would "drive changes" for children and adults with disabilities.  I believe the Department has begun this work by implementing the measures outlined before the committee and by putting in place pathways to continue the progress to full realisation of the UN convention, as outlined in the programme for Government.  Of course, we have much work to do, but I am very pleased the Department has given me these important functions.  I look forward to working with this important committee as the implementation process continues.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague and commission member Adam Harris, who is also the vice chair of our disability advisory committee. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is Ireland's human rights institution and national equality body.  We are also Ireland's in-house monitoring mechanism designate under Article 33 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and in this role we welcome the opportunity today to share our recommendations on UNCRPD implementation and the ratification of the optional protocol.  We note the stated commitment to developing an implementation plan for the UNCPRD in the programme for Government, and the role of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department as the main co-ordination point in developing this implementation plan.  It is important to say from the outset, however, that we, as a commission, are already concerned about growing delays in implementation and associated reporting.</p> <p>  "Optional protocol" is a technical term that, unfortunately, does a disservice to its meaning and significance and masks the urgent need for action for people with disabilities and our society.  The protocol is about empowering people with disabilities.  It underpins effective domestic implementation of the convention by encouraging states to realise CRPD rights, provide more local remedies and remove discriminatory laws and practices.</p> <p>  Similarly, ratification and implementation say little of the vision of a better life that the CPRD and its optional protocol hold, one in which people with disabilities are viewed not as objects to be cared for, but as people with rights who are capable of claiming those rights and making decisions for their lives based on their free and informed consent, as well as being active members of society.  During our All Human, All Equal disability rights public awareness campaign, one of the participants, Eliona Gjecaj, stated that it hurts when people tell her she is an inspiration because she is just human like everybody else.  While this committee and others can go some way to addressing these out-of-date, if well-intentioned, views, it is through concerted and co-ordinated State leadership to embed the CRPD in law and policy that lasting change will be achieved in attitudes, behaviours and practices.</p> <p> The optional protocol is the key to that.  It introduces two procedures to strengthen the implementation of the convention, namely, an individual communications one and an inquiry one.  In particular, the individual communication procedure offers an essential access-to-justice mechanism for rights holders where all available domestic remedies have been exhausted.  Last week, on behalf of the commission and prompted by our disability advisory committee, I wrote to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, emphasising the need for the State to progress the adoption of the optional protocol as a matter of urgency.  Considering delays in reporting to the UN and an anticipated lengthy delay of the UN examination due to backlogs, we consider that the State plan to ratify the optional protocol after the first reporting cycle, which could take several more years, needs to be reconsidered and should be brought forward.</p> <p>  In this context, accountability for implementing the UNCRPD outside the international reporting process has become all the more important.  Relying on the committee's feedback and observations to guide Ireland's implementation of the convention is no longer an option.  Disabled people have waited too long to have their rights realised.  In line with the principles that underpin the UNCRPD, we also recommended in our letter that the Minister make an annual statement to the D&aacute;il on the progress on implementing UNCRPD, starting this year.  We believe such a statement would be a very positive signal and a demonstrable commitment to meeting Ireland's international obligations to people with disabilities, and would serve to promote transparency for stakeholders.  To support the Government's implementation plan, we also recommend that the State develop a framework for the recognition and support of disabled persons' organisations and pay due regard to the statutory public sector equality and human rights duty.</p> <p>  I will conclude with the words of Gary Allen, another All Human, All Equal campaign participant, to illustrate the potential that the CRPD and optional protocol can release: "Just because I have a disability doesn't mean my limits are any less than anybody else's."  I thank members for their attention.  Mr. Harris and I will be happy to take questions from them all.</p></speech>

My first questions are for Dr. Lynch and relate to the ratification of the optional protocol.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in response to a parliamentary question, reiterated the commitment in the programme for Government to addressing this issue.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission stated that this could take years and no reference was made to the ratification of the optional protocol in the opening statement.  Will Dr. Lynch explain the divergence in priority between him and the Minister?  At a meeting of this committee, the Minister was very clear in his statement.  Does Dr. Lynch intend to accelerate the process as a result of this?  If that is the position of the commission, does he intend to recommend that the Minister do the same?</p></speech>

Deputy Cairns's question concerns one of the most important issues we will be dealing with during this meeting.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  When we spoke initially about ratifying the optional protocol at the end of the reporting cycle, this was on the assumption that the cycle would take a particular length of time, that is, until at some stage next year.  It seems to be case now that there is going to be a significant delay on the UN end, as we understand it will be quite some time before we are invited to Geneva to speak about this.  If that is the case, I can confirm we will be very open to ratifying the convention much sooner.  We would like to do it as soon as possible but, obviously, logistics are involved and we want to ensure we have the proper systems and procedures in place to ensure we ratify it with meaning as opposed to just nominally ratifying it.</p> <p>  Our main concern relates to having this operational.  As members will be aware, we have committed that the targets for that are for this time next year, in June.  We hope the assisted decision-making capacity legislation, which deals with that, will have been enacted by the end of this year.  With that in mind, if we can achieve that objective in that timetable, the Department and the Minister will strongly push to have the optional protocol ratified as soon as possible thereafter.  If it is the case that the reporting cycle is significantly delayed, we will seek to ratify it well before the end of that reporting cycle.</p></speech>

The Department would make recommendations to the Minister.  The other component I need to stress is that the Attorney General has an important role in this in judging the legal perspective to ensure that Ireland is legally positioned to ratify the protocol.  Ultimately, it is a matter on which the Minister would bring a decision to Government to seek its approval.  There is a recognised process thereafter, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, where the instrument is formally ratified.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for joining us here today on the committee.  I have a number of questions on the topic at hand to look at the co-ordination, implementation and oversight of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, on the one hand, and the lack of clarity around the ratification of the optional protocol.</p> <p>  First, Ms Gibney has mentioned something that resonated greatly with me when she pointed to the fact that the technical terminology of words like "optional protocol" and "ratification" disguised the fact that this is about value and worth, about equality, and disabled people being able to demand that their rights are safeguarded and provided for by this Government.  The shift from disabled people being seen as objects to be cared for to being people with rights requires deep attitudinal transformation and corresponding cultural, social, systemic and structural changes to reflect that shift of perspective.  So far, the transfer of the disability portfolio from the Department of Health to the newly-formed Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been mainly semantic.  Yes, finally the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo; explicitly appears in the title of a Department, but that is not much good if the Department is not actively progressing policy and programmes.  </p> <p>  The Department of Health dealt with disability through a medical model and addressed services.  This Department must bring forward social, rights-based developments.  </p> <p>  Interestingly, in the Revised Estimates for public service finances, under the five programmes listed under Vote 40, none is disability-specific.  The only distinct investment in the progression of the rights of disabled people in its allocation is to the National Disability Authority through the equal and inclusive society expenditure.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, announced, Hub na n&Oacute;g, a new programme for youths; he has commissioned a new anti-racism task committee; and luckily there are several well-established programmes for children.  It is becoming more and more apparent that disability is the aspect of the Department that is falling by the wayside.  Will there be a disability programme in budget 2022?  </p> <p>  The rest of my questions are about timing, funding and responsibility.  Looking at timing first, can the members of the Department here outline the roadmap as to when the roll-out of the programmes mentioned in the lead up to budget 2022, such as the access and inclusion model and the employers for change initiative, will happen?  </p> <p>  Second, on funding, will the Department dedicate more disability-specific programmes in the upcoming budget for 2022 in order to honour the provisions of the CRPD and its centrality in the overall remit of the Department?  I know that the transfer of the portfolio has many financial complications and consequences.  Although the Department may not have a full allocation for disability services that does not prevent it from initiating equality-based empowerment, educational and rights-based programmes.</p> <p>  On responsibility, as per the expertise from the CRPD committee together the European Disability Forum, there has to be interdepartmental co-ordination in order to effectively realise the provisions of the CRPD.  Where is the Department on that issue?  What actions have been taken to have representatives from different Departments working together on disability-related issues?  Is stewardship needed or expected from the office of the Taoiseach to oversee the transfer of functions?  The transfer has been ambiguous as to a clear timeline.  A constant fog surrounds the ratification of the optional protocol.  It will take several more years if we wait until the final first reporting cycle is complete.  When combined with the extremely protracted nature of the CRPD in the first instance, this points to a general political unwillingness to accelerate the changes that are needed.</p> <p>  Lastly, who is responsible?  Is it the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte; the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman; or possibly the Taoiseach who can review the decision to delay ratification and give some teeth to the convention?  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her various questions.  I hope that some of them will have been answered in respect of the protocol where I underline our wish to ensure that we seek to ratify the optional protocol as soon as we possibly can rather than waiting for the end of the reporting cycle.</p> <p>  On co-ordination and implementation, there is a significant architecture to ensure that it happens and it is important that we work our way through that.  In the first instance, we have the steering group for the national disability integration strategy and the group in respect of the comprehensive employment strategy.  </p> <p> I respectfully disagree that it has just been semantics in moving responsibilities from the Department of Justice to this Department.  We have been very active since we took over this area last October and, of course, there is a significant amount of more work to be done.  One of the important things that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has done is to fund the disability participation and consultation network.  That will be a very important group in assisting and supporting people with a disability to input into the process of implementation and being consulted on that.  We regard that as being of great importance and want to press ahead with it as much as we possibly can.  </p> <p>  I can confirm that the Employers for Change initiative is already in place and is producing some positive results.  We have, obviously, a distance to go yet but there are some positive results in this.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about co-ordination from the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is always a matter for the Government to decide who co-ordinates actions that apply right across different Departments and agencies but I am conscious that the Government made a very specific decision to assign disability services to our Department with a clear intention that we would have responsibility for co-ordination functions, which we have taken on enthusiastically.  We have a history in co-ordinating other areas such as First 5 in the early years area.  We also have a number of other strategies where we co-ordinate, including the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020; the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, 2017 &ndash; 2021; and other such strategies in the equality sphere.  </p> <p>  We are well-positioned to co-ordinate and to do what we possibly can in that respect.  It is never an easy function because it involves cajoling and encouraging other Departments and agencies to get on board and work with us but we have a good record in other areas of doing that.  While we always welcome the support of the Department of the Taoiseach, my understanding is that the Government&rsquo;s view is that it is this Department that will carry out this co-ordination.  That is, obviously, a matter at all times for the Government to decide.</p> <p>  The disability budget for 2022 will be an Estimates process.  We are already working on our Estimates process for next year.  Similarly, in the health sphere, the Department of Health's function in this area is being transferred from that the Department to here and we will also be closely involved in that Estimates process over the next number of months.</p> <p>  One way or another we are showing reasonable form.  For example, we have increased the funding on the decision support service from &euro;3.5 million in 2020 up to &euro;5.8 million in 2021.  I hope that that is a practical indication of the extent to which we place an emphasis on ensuring that this important service will be properly up and running and operational.</p> <p>  I hope that I have covered most of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  The Deputy also asked about the Access and Inclusion Model, AIM.  That, if I may say so, is one of our success stories.  The numbers who have benefited from the targeted services under AIM are some 15,000 children since it started in 2016.  The total budget has gone up from &euro;43 million to &euro;48 million.  It has benefited many more children in addition to the 15,000 who were the beneficiaries of targeted supports and it supports approximately 3,600 childcare providers.  It has won awards both here and internationally and is generally regarded as something of a success story.  That is not to say for a moment that we are resting on our laurels or anything like that.  AIM is due to be evaluated.  This is under way at the moment and is due to be completed in February 2022.</p><p>According to an independent review carried out on the second year of the AIM's operations, 78% of parents reported that their children had benefited from it.  A similar proportion said the AIM had made the culture of preschool more important.  Rightly, speakers have been talking about culture, outlook, support and inclusivity.  The AIM programme is all about that.  I hope that gives some illustration of this Department's commitment to work in this area.</p></speech>

I absolutely welcome the Secretary General's comment that the Minister and Department will be open to bringing forward the optional protocol's ratification and not sequencing it after the committee process because that would guarantee a much longer delay.  We do not need to delay any further.  Deputy Wynne said the complaints procedure itself takes time.  That ratification can happen now does not mean it will not result in problems for the Department immediately.  It will still give the Department and Government time to put in place the systems and procedures mentioned.</p> <p>  Nominal ratification is, in itself, such a message and a commitment to those in the disability community who have fought so hard for ratification.  I remind members of the testimony or evidence received from Professor Gerard Quinn last year.  He pointed out the inconsistency in the approaches of the Government to the optional protocol to the CRPD and the revised European Social Charter.  Indeed, he believed commencement should happen immediately.</p></speech>

Complaints procedures must be put in place now so that when the optional protocol is in place, everything will be in place.</p> <p>  I heard the Secretary General say "as soon as possible".  What does that mean in months?  Is there a deadline?  I would like a specific date.  Without hanging anyone out to dry, it is important that we get that information.</p> <p>  My sole purpose as a member of this committee is related to my belief that disabilities have been treated in the wrong way for many years.  There are many things happening that I would not be proud of as a legislator, as I said the first day I became a member of the committee.  It is important that we start to put things right.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Department is taking responsibility for disabilities but there is a major task ahead because there are so many facets to the problems on the ground that are not being addressed, as raised in every public representative's office.  They are wide-ranging.  The main issue is that parents and families are so frustrated and have to fight so hard for what should be a basic human right for their child, brother, sister or other individual.  We talk about putting money into systems and so forth but the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, being from my constituency, will concur that the important point is that the money should go where it should be going, namely, to the person with the disability.</p> <p>  I do not have very many questions.  The optional protocol is essential.  It is essential that it be delivered and that there be a timeframe in this regard.  There is no doubt about that.  With it will come all the systems by which complaints can be made.  We have a fractious system for allocating funding to organisations and it is characterised by multiplicity and complication.  Parents, especially when they find they have a child with a disability or special need, find themselves in a swarm of paperwork and new terminology.  It is important that we cut to the chase in the services we provide and make sure they are streamlined and co-ordinated in a way that helps the parents.  That is the kernel of what I would like to see happening.</p> <p>  Today is crazy with meetings so it is not with disrespect that I will be leaving in about ten minutes; I have another meeting to go to.</p></speech>

However, we are committed to ratifying it as soon as we possibly can.  A key element is making sure the decision support service is in place in advance of ratification.  I take the chief commissioner's points on that.  We will work as much as we possibly can to achieve it.  It is, unfortunately, not completely straightforward.  I take the point on the importance of even nominal ratification but, as a Department, we are anxious to have the proper architecture in place to deal with it.</p> <p>  On funding, we will be taking over the disability services from the Department of Health.  I am excited and enthusiastic about considering this area, how we can streamline it, whether there are other means of funding and working with organisations to deliver services, and putting the person with the disability at the centre of everything we do.  The advantage of moving the services to my Department is that it is relatively small by comparison with the Department of Health, which is very large and has a huge number of other responsibilities.  I mean no disrespect to it whatsoever.  It probably would not say itself that it was not able to give disability the amount of attention it would like to have given it.  Given that ours is a somewhat smaller Department, with a smaller budget and staff, we are hopeful that we will be able to focus on disabilities in a way that would not be possible elsewhere.  We are very much looking forward to taking on this area of responsibility and dealing with the types of concerns Deputy Canney has raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#D00600"><p>I want to address a couple of the points raised by Deputy Canney.  Building on the chief commissioner's point on delays in implementation, it is worth noting the significant surprise within the disability community that the optional protocol was not agreed to on the same day the convention was commenced because the reality is that this had always been expected prior to the ratification of the convention.  I note the Secretary General's response today but when queries were raised on the night of the ratification of the convention as to why there were delays, they went unanswered.  While the disability community notes the Department's delays and the challenges it faces, ultimately when we talk about implementing with meaning, we believe the meaning the optional protocol will provide to people with disabilities will involve having recourse and a demonstrated commitment by the State to live up to the values of the convention.  That really must proceed with urgency.</p> <p>  The issue of funding reaching people with disabilities is highly relevant to Article 4.3 of the convention, which refers to the role of disabled persons' organisations.  In Ireland, we are in an unusual position in that we do not have well-funded, established disabled people's organisations, and service providers have a disproportionate influence on policy and advocacy matters within the State.  While the work being done by the Department with the Disability Participation and Consultation Network is welcome, Article 4.3 is not just about advocacy; it is also about making sure the voice of people with disabilities directly influences how services are designed and delivered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.620" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>That is a crucial area that needs to be followed through to ensure that money reaches those who most need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1631" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#E00200"><p>I thank our speakers for their presentations which are very useful for the committee to hear.  I echo the words of others, following Mr. Harris's points, that the lack of clear timeframe for the ratification of the optional protocol is disappointing.  We have all shared our concerns about that.  I appreciate that it is difficult to give an exact time line but will the Secretary General say a little more about the establishment of the decisions support service, the key element in the ratification process?</p> <p>  I have another question on a specific issue in the work being done by the Department.  I am conscious that there has been this change and a move into the children's Department from the Departments of Health and Justice and so on.  All of us very much welcome that and note the need for an intersectional approach to dealing with disability rights.  Where it has really come into focus for myself and others is in the area of education.  There are huge issues in my own local area about access to local school places and local ASD classes for children with autism in particular.  That is a huge issue in south Dublin and also in other areas.  Where provision is made, it is often made at quite a distance from where children and their families live.  In some cases they must be bussed or driven out of their area and are therefore missing out on a lot of social engagement locally.  It seems inequitable because they may have siblings who are going to local schools and they cannot participate in them.  I note that the Department is delivering the access and inclusion model in seeking to ensure meaningful participation of children with disabilities and additional needs in early years education.  It is very welcome to see a focus on early years education but how can we be sure that at early years stage we do not see the same difficulty with the lack of local access to places?  Is there provision for requiring local providers to ensure that children with disabilities are included?  There are huge problems in schools and the process does not seem to be sufficiently robust to ensure that schools will deliver local places.  </p> <p>  I thank everyone and to Ms Gibney for her powerful words on disability rights and treating disability matters as rights.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#E00300"><p>I thank the Senator for her comments.  I take her point about a very specific timeframe for the protocol.  It is not really possible for me to be very much more specific now but my focus and that of the Department will be on getting the decision support service in place and moving ahead as quickly as we possibly can thereafter.  I cannot be too specific because there are individual steps which are not completely in our control.  However, getting the decision support service in place first is valuable and a requirement.  Then the Attorney General needs to advise on our readiness to ratify the protocol at that point.  We will do everything we can to move it as quickly as we can in that context.</p> <p>   To give some further details on the decision support service, the legislation is being worked on and, as I said in my opening statement, we hope that the Minister will be in a position to bring proposals to the Government on this the week after next, 29 June.  The general scheme has priority drafting so the aim is to publish the legislation in the autumn term.  Our overall aim is to ensure that the legislation is enacted by the end of the year if at all possible.  I think that is a realistic deadline.  If we can have that legislation in place by the end of the year, in the meantime the decision support service, which the committee met some weeks ago, has been working on putting its processes and structures in place.  The deadline of next June is realistic for it to be operational.  The specifics of that include an interdepartmental steering group that is chaired by this Department to ensure that the Act can be commenced by next June.  The steering group is also supporting the decision support services to become operational by that date.  That steering group is important because it includes representatives of the mental health commission, the decision support service itself, the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Justice and the Courts Service.  There is a concerted effort by all involved to ensure that we are ready, first, with the legislation and, second, with the  practicalities and the logistics of ensuring that it happens within the timeframe.  </p> <p>  On the access inclusion model, AIM, and how we ensure local access, we have never had a policy of absolutely requiring this access.  What we have done is strongly encouraged it in the financial structures that we have offered in AIM itself and the link individuals, that is the people trained as childcare support personnel to work with children with additional needs, we have funded that programme and its training very substantially.  </p> <p>  I am not very close to the access to local education and autism classes in the education sector.  We can take that back to the Department of Education.  We are very conscious of that as an issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, recently committed to an autism innovation strategy.  The group which will develop that will meet very shortly.  I think it is being set up in the next month.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#E00400"><p>On some of the barriers on the ground in accessing services, particularly around education services, we can bring it back to the UNCRPD.  The UN convention has not been transposed into national law.  Implementation requires national law to work and to live out the values of the convention.  We have heard about new legislation today but we should not lose sight of the fact that much of the existing disability legislation in Ireland, dating from the late 1990s and the early 2000s, has never been fully commenced.  For example, in education, we are looking at the Education of People with Special Education Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.  The non-commencement of that Act is very problematic from the UNCRPD perspective for a few reasons.  It means the bulk of supports provided in an education context are on a non-statutory basis.  Where the UNCRPD speaks about rights, the supports provided by the State are of a much more grace and favour nature.  Furthermore, the non-commencement for such a period means that the Statute Book in many respects around disabilities is significantly out of date.  Very specifically around the context of the UNCRPD, if we take the EPSEN Act, its definition of disability does not align with the definition of disability in the UNCRPD in that it seeks to provide an exhaustive list of disability rather than taking a person-centred approach.  It also does not recognise the individual lived experience of disability.  Critically, it actually provides an exemption around inclusion.  It goes so far as to say that we can be inclusive up to a point but there are some people who we just cannot possibly include.  There is a real need to look at our domestic Statute Book, commencing and updating its provisions, if we really are to fulfil the values of the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

I am struck by why the optional protocol was deemed optional in the first place.  It really should have been part of the whole agreement.  There is so much confusion around it and also delay.  I understand from what Dr. Lynch said that it may not be as long as we had originally thought which is good news.</p><p>In 2015, the Department of Justice published a roadmap for the legislative measures that were needed to meet the requirements of the UNCRPD.  An updated roadmap would be beneficial in monitoring implementation.  Has an updated review of this kind taken place?</p><p> Is there an indicative timeline for the publication of the implementation plan?  This crosses all Departments and to have Departments working together is usually important.  The witnesses might give an update on how the key Departments are working together.</p><p> Of course, we know from one of the UN committee members that many of the issues impacting people with disabilities fall under the responsibility of local government.  While local government comes under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I would like feedback on how the witnesses think the implementation can be strengthened across local government.</p><p> Mr. Harris spoke about inclusive education, and we had a recent engagement with the Spanish Senate commission. This is an area in which I am particularly interested and one we have spoken about quite a lot at the education committee in regard to ensuring inclusive education within communities, on which Senator Ivana Bacik has also spoken.  I believe this is key to how we go forward.  The Department of Education is one of the most important Departments in this regard and it is where we have to prioritise.  Thankfully, we are doing better.  In looking at the school building programme over the past year, we can certainly see an emphasis on inclusive and special education, which is important.</p><p> Given the impact of Covid in the past 16 months on people with disabilities, particularly those who attend schools and day care centres, it is clear we need to have contingency emergency plans for people with disability because they are so significantly and adversely impacted.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views on that.</p><p> There is another area of concern.  In the mandate of the previous D&aacute;il, three committees came together in regard to employment for people with disabilities, that is, the education, disability and health committees.  EU figures show that Ireland is the country with the lowest employment rate for persons with disabilities and with the largest employment gap between persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities.  That is concerning and we need to up our game in this regard.</p><p> My last question is the big question in regard to funding.  A key measure in terms of translating this into law is ensuring adequate funding is allocated in the national budget for various sectors right across the board.  I would be interested to hear if there is any feedback in regard to how we ensure adequate funding across all of the different sectors.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for those questions and I hope I do them justice.  In terms of what remains to be done on implementation, it is helpful to note that the NDA has done a gap analysis on what is currently in place and what needs to be done to achieve implementation of the convention, and that is important work.</p> <p>  Related to that is how Departments are working together.  Our overall structure is one that has worked quite well, even if it is quite complicated.  There is a steering group in regard to the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and there is a steering group in regard to the comprehensive employment strategy, chaired by Fergus Finlay.  Both of those have worked throughout the Covid pandemic, met throughout that time and worked closely on the different areas of concern.  In terms of moving it forward and ensuring that we make the sort of progress we want to make, in many of the areas raised by the Senator, the response will involve the development of an implementation plan, which we are committed to doing.</p> <p>  We have started work on that with an initial discussion with the steering group on the NDIS in terms of what that might look like.  That is going to be a key document, which we hope to produce between now and the end of the year, with a view to publishing it early in 2022.  It will contain a number of specific provisions relating to how best to implement the UN convention in all of its areas.  One of the things it will do is to highlight and identify the areas that are not yet adequately dealt with and where gaps arise, arising from the analysis that the NDA has carried out.  That is going to be an important component of this.  We hope to have a draft followed by a consultation process on that in the autumn.  That will make a significant difference in how best we advance all of these different components to make sure it is properly and genuinely implemented.</p> <p>  Rather than necessarily having a separate roadmap, it seems the implementation plan will be the way forward.  I am conscious that the strategy is due to expire next year, having been consciously extended by a year, and it may be that the way forward in that regard is to merge or effectively group the two together to turn the implementation plan and effectively to represent it as the next national disability inclusion strategy, while also having regard to the employment components.</p> <p>  On the employment side, there are a number of important initiatives, and I mentioned Employers for Change earlier.  In terms of our employment record for people with disabilities, one of the things that the assisted decision making (capacity) legislation will do is to provide formally for the public sector to set a target of 6% employment of people with a disability as opposed to the current 3% target.  That was provided for originally in the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill of the previous Oireachtas, which lapsed on the dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il.  I am happy that the provisions relating to employment of people with a disability - the increase from 3% to 6% - will be included in that legislation.</p> <p>  Funding is a key issue for us.  In future, there will be the national development plan, there will be budgetary arguments and negotiations in the normal way and there will be the normal interaction with individuals and organisations as we go through.  Clearly, this is an important part of what we are doing and we want to get it right.  I hope that covers the main elements of the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on two particular points from the Senator: first, the questions regarding local government and, second, the points around Covid.  I urge the Department to consider in its implementation plan for the UNCRPD the foregrounding of the public sector equality and human rights duty of 2014.  This has been on the Statute Book for seven years.  If the local authorities were in compliance with their public sector equality and human rights duty, there would be a natural flow into their compliance with the UNCRPD.  Therefore, it is important to remember that this duty is a positive statutory obligation on public sector bodies to have regard for equality and human rights in the work they do, and that they assess, address and report on their activities within it.  If we can continue to foreground that, it will help with that implementation plan for the Department.  I just wanted to point that out.  Obviously, this applies to local authorities.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on a few points on Covid, in particular, as I know this is relevant to the committee today.  Equal rights for disabled people have to be central to our recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Ireland is set to receive &euro;915 million in grants from the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility, and the EU has advised that it needs to be spread across gender equality and equal opportunities for all, and this has to include disability considerations.  Covid-19 has exposed a lot of vulnerabilities in the architecture of rights for people with disabilities.</p><p>Many of us will have already been familiar with those vulnerabilities, but I believe it has exposed them to a much broader audience.  It is important for the committee to press Government to progress the range of legislation that we have mentioned today on disability rights and to give full effect to the UNCRPD.  We have continued to engage in various forums throughout the pandemic to advise on the issues that are particularly affecting people with disabilities as they have arisen.</p><p> To touch on a few of them, the participation of people with disabilities and disabled persons' organisations in the Covid response has been lacking.  Of course, we have had particular concerns around the situation of persons in residential settings, including nursing homes.  There have also been challenges for people living in congregated settings, whether they are people with disabilities, older people or indeed people living in prisons and mental health detention facilities.  </p><p> I would also like to emphasise the lack of publicly available real-time disaggregated data.  That is problematic for us as a national human rights and equality institution in respect of being able to monitor how the issues and challenges that we are facing as a society and also the response from the State are affecting individual groups and, particularly, people with disabilities.  The disruption of services has been really problematic and has led to stagnation and regression for individuals.  There have also been problems with accessibility of information, awareness of disability and inadequate positive representation of persons with disabilities.  Those are some of the key issues that we wish to highlight.</p><p> I would also assert that there is an opportunity for us, as a country, to emerge from this pandemic with a structure and an architecture that better cares for everybody in our society.  I urge the committee to emphasise that going forward.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Harris, who might raise some points on Covid and specifically on employment.  </p></speech>

Coming back to a point I made earlier on, the issue of a lack of well supported and resourced and consistently consulted DPOs has been a core problem in terms of our response to Covid-19.  That might be best illustrated in respect of the issue of school closures.  Often, the voices of people who were missing from discussions around that issue were those for whom the services were created.  It is a very significant concern that when services were closed, the voices of disabled people were not at the table and were certainly not given the same weight as large services providers or groups with vested interests.  That is concerning and it is not in line with the rights-based approach conceived in the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  In addition, there is concern around the fact that there was a lack of sufficient safeguards when Covid-19 restrictions were put in place.  Very often, when safeguards were put in place, they were not actively implemented or policed by the Government.  That is particularly well illustrated with the example of face coverings.  Many disabled people have been isolated at home and unable to access vital services, despite being exempt from wearing a face covering.  That is an example of where rights were not protected proactively during the pandemic.  It is worrying and it has had a long-term impact.</p> <p>  Looking down the list of articles in the UN convention, there is not one that was not impacted in one way or another during the Covid-19 pandemic.  One thing that is of concern is that while to our credit equality legislation was not suspended during the pandemic, the reality is that in practice, the right to access vital supports was suspended.  A very bad message was sent by the State when vital supports for people with disabilities, such as occupational and speech and language therapy, were diverted away as if they were not essential services.  That sends a message about where we are at still in terms of our understanding and our position around a rights-based approach to accessing support.</p> <p>  Finally, I think the reopening is an opportunity.  The world of work is an area where there is a particular opportunity.  It is probably the area of life that is going to be most substantially impacted into the future by Covid-19.  We are at the very early stages of the discussion of what the future of work looks like.  We really must take it as an opportunity to make the world of work more inclusive.  For example, we have heard some feedback from around the world that many people with disabilities are underemployed at present because commuting to a workplace, having to interact with people and deal with a busy environment every day is so exhausting that people with disabilities are significantly underemployed or cannot work full-time.  The dawn of flexible working potentially creates new opportunities.  We must recognise the mistakes that have been made over the past 15 months, but we must use this an opportunity to look at how society is changing and how we can really bring the UNCRPD to life.</p></speech>

I confirm that I am in Leinster House.</p> <p>  Many points have been raised in the meeting.  I agree with those made on the optional protocol.  It should have been ratified at the same time as the convention.  However, I welcome a timeline for its ratification next year.  That is most important.  Many of the other points made around how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected society, and particularly people with disabilities, have been well-made.  We all know that is the case.  It is an opportunity to have a look at how different bodies are run, how supports are provided and to try to improve things with a view to preventing it happening again.  </p> <p>  I have a few questions on the important issue of funding.  I have a specific one on funding for the IHREC itself.  Have sufficient funding and resources been provided to the IHREC to enable it to carry out its role as independent monitor or of the implementation of the convention? </p> <p>  We have talked about different Departments.  All of them have a role in implementing the convention.  This committee has written to the different Departments.  While some have responded with the very comprehensive outline of what they see as their role in the implementation of the convention, the responses of others leave a lot to be desired, to be perfectly honest.  I ask the witnesses to outline how the Departments are working together and how we can ensure that they are all carrying out their role.</p> <p>  Can sufficient funding and planning for UNCRPD implementation be achieved without key documents such as the Indecon report on the cost of disability and the disability capacity review.  I believe both of those reports are completed, yet they have not been published.  It is very important that they are published, because there is a deficit in data on disability in our country.  How can we provide for people in need if we do not know where the need is and where the funding is needed?</p> <p>  I have a brief question for Dr. Lynch.  He mentioned the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 in his statement.  It is something I have been asked about quite a bit.  Irish Sign Language was recognised as a State language in 2017.  Yet, a four-year honours degree in Deaf Studies from Trinity College Dublin is not accepted as a teaching subject by the Teaching Council.  Is that going to happen?  People are very anxious to know if Irish Sign Language will be taught in our schools to our students.  </p></speech>

Perhaps she might want to comment, in particular, on the funding for IHREC.  I am sure she will have a view on that.</p> <p>  On the question of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, we will pursue that.  I am not familiar with what the exact position is on the issue.  Given that the Act has now commenced, hopefully, that approach should be possible.</p> <p>  To deal with a few of the other issues in relation to departmental roles, we are very conscious that different Departments have very different roles in relation to the UNCRPD.  As the Deputy might expect in many areas of cross-Government co-operation, some Departments are very enthusiastic and interactive and others are perhaps not so.  We have similar experience in other areas such as early years, youth services and so on.  Therefore, it is a challenge to encourage full participation by all.  In our implementation plan for the UN convention, one of the areas that we will look at is identifying the best architecture and way of encouraging co-operation and collaboration between Departments.  It is vital to get all of it right.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on a few points raised by Ms Gibney raised because they are very important.  I want to respond to, and agree with, a number of points she has made.  In the context of the human rights and public sector duty, the Minister is actually going to speak on the topic this afternoon for local government reports that have been launched by Disability Federation Ireland.  It is an IHREC-funded initiative.  We also place a great emphasis on it.  In our own Department's statement of strategy, we placed a very specific emphasis and included a specific addendum setting out our approach to that requirement.  We regard it as being of particular importance.  That is going to grow in emphasis in other Departments, as the awareness around it grows.  </p> <p>  In terms of some funding issues, the new round of European Social Fund funding prioritises funding for employment and training.</p><p>We will push that as much as we possibly can.</p><p> As for a response to disability during Covid, I take the points Mr. Harris made about how people with a disability were treated and the experiences they had.  We laid a great emphasis on supporting them as much as we possibly could.  Disability organisations were represented on a vulnerable persons sub-group that NPHET established, and our Department was closely involved in that.  The Department put a lot of effort into co-ordinating and communicating with organisations, people with a disability and people representing people with a disability to keep them in the loop on initiatives and what was happening as the pandemic continued.  It is probably true to say we ended up developing an even stronger relationship with a number of organisations on foot of that.  Of course, I accept there is much more to be done in that regard.</p><p> As for the publication of reports, I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, are anxious to publish the capacity review as soon as they possibly can.  That work is being done on a framework for an action plan.  That report should be published in the not-too-distant future, and I absolutely take the point that it forms a very important backdrop to what needs to happen in the future.</p><p> Those are my responses to the various points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Tully for her questions.  As for our funding, we are a merged institution and an equality and human rights institution.  To give the committee a bit of context, we are only now the same size as the bigger of our former legacy bodies, the Equality Authority, was in 2008.  That was a single mandate organisation.  We are at a point where we have had a straight budget in recent years as we have been able to develop and build as an organisation.  We are now, however, turning into what we describe in the human rights and equality world as a multi-mandate organisation.  We are taking on new mandates such as this independent monitoring mechanism and, similarly, the co-ordinator role for the mechanism for the optional protocol to the convention against torture, OPCAT.  We also took on this year the role of domestic rapporteur for anti-trafficking.  We are at an inflexion point where we will seek increases in our budget and an expansion of our overall organisation over the coming years.  It is helpful to be able to put that out today, so I thank Deputy Tully for asking the question.  We are absolutely ready as we are to act as independent monitoring mechanism but I think it is something we will grow as an organisation over the coming years.</p> <p>  I am also very happy Deputy Tully raised the issue of data.  I feel like we are continuing to speak about this at every forum I go to.  It is absolutely central to the ability to measure and monitor CRPD implementation.  As a national human rights and equality institution, it is critical to all we do.  What we cannot measure we cannot change.  We do not have at the moment enough disaggregated data in this country for us to identify effectively which groups are being affected by which policies or to address those effectively.  A notable feature of the UNCRPD is Article 31, which stipulates that states must collect appropriate statistical data relating to people with disabilities.  We have been calling for this, and the OECD, the EU and the UN are consistently calling on public bodies to collect and publish disaggregated data.  What we come up against when we do this is a response from the State relating to the GDPR and data privacy, which it believes is a barrier to this.  We hold a very strong and clear position that that is not the case and that the collection and publication of this data can be done within the legal confines of data protection law because it is done for non-discrimination purposes and to drive the equality agenda.  The failure to maintain disaggregated data does not only run the risk of concealing these human rights and equality violations; it is in itself a significant breach of international human rights law on the part of the State.  It is therefore really important to continue to push for better collection and publication of aggregated data.  We have put forward recommendations on this and on how the CSO, for example, can play a part in this.  We work with Departments to help push on this and we are happy to provide any more information that could be helpful.  The Secretary General mentioned the public sector duty.  While it is great to see that appearing in the Department's strategy statement, an audit we did showed that, unfortunately, 80% of Departments were not yet in compliance in their most recent round of strategy statements so, again, we really need to push for the public sector duty.</p></speech>

I thank Commissioner Gibney for raising it.  I totally agree with her points in that regard.  To confirm, the National Disability Authority has begun a disability data audit and is reviewing key elements of its own internal operations in the area of data management to establish its key objectives in this area.  Importantly, that data audit is intended to cover all available data resources relating to disability, covering national statistics, research databases and administrative data.  In addition, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is developing an equality data strategy as part of its ongoing work on equality budgeting, which our Department is closely involved in as well.  We are very strongly supportive of that.  I absolutely take the point about the importance of data and the requirement to be able to extract data relating to disability, to disaggregate it accordingly and to judge progress in that regard, particularly for equality budgeting.  We are highly supportive of those areas and will push ahead with them.</p></speech>

That has given me a chance to remember a few more points that may be of interest to the committee.  First, in July of this year new obligations will come into force for public bodies with the transposition of the open data and reuse of public sector information directive.  This will introduce the concept of high-value data sets associated with important benefits for society and economy.  The committee may be interested in that.  Second, the UN Human Rights Council has noted that governments and international actors should start as soon as possible to gather adequate data on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.  We have just touched on Covid-19, but that is another really important data set for us to look at in the context not only of the pandemic but also of the Government response to it and how that has been impacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#H00700"><p>I am in Leinster House.  I welcome our guest speakers.  It is good we are speaking about disabilities because I always feel it is an area we need to get stronger on.  I am really glad about and welcome the fact that Ireland for the first time has a Department with the word "disability" in its title.  That is a good sign.  I agree that both the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, should make an annual statement to the D&aacute;il on Ireland's progress in implementing the UNCRPD, commencing this year.  We have to make sure that happens.  I ask that as a committee we do so because it is very important.</p> <p>  We have spoken about data.  I had a question about that but I am glad to say it has been answered.  We need to look at that.  Many people I work with say to me it is a matter of the social cost of living with a disability.  There are huge issues in that regard.  We have spoken about education and employment.  Transport is another issue we need to look at.  We need to recognise the need to support persons with a disability to stand for elections.  If we have learned one thing, it is that it is so important now that everyone gets to do what they want to do in life.  One could not get a better statement than "a vision for a better life".  How can we improve the participation of and consultation with people with disabilities across all disabilities and ensure that the hard-to-reach are included?  That is where I have a big concern: that we make sure everybody is included.  Ms Gibney spoke about Covid.  Our disability sector had been really affected by Covid, and the Government needs an emergency plan.  We need to have that in place.  I ask that we look at that.</p> <p>  I was a bit surprised by the employment figures.  They show Ireland to be the country with the lowest rate of employment of persons with disabilities.  That is unacceptable.  There are huge challenges here and we need to address them.</p><p> Dr. Lynch spoke about an implementation plan being in place by 2022.  He might provide more information on that.  It will be the key for this.  I thank all the speakers.  Many of the questions I had have been answered.</p></speech>

Regarding the suggestion by IHREC of the Minister making an annual statement to the D&aacute;il, we saw that in the letter it wrote to Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on 11 June last.  I have been speaking to the Ministers about that and they will certainly consider it.  They are open to looking at that.  It is appropriate they would respond to the commission and they will respond shortly.  They will also write to the committee in that regard.  That is a positive and important suggestion.</p> <p>  Regarding standing for election, it will be of noteworthy value for the committee to learn the Bill we are now preparing  includes provision to enable people with disabilities to stand for election.  This was previously provided for in the miscellaneous provisions Bill.  That is a valuable process for the future.</p> <p>  In terms of the implementation plan and how we will do it, we have started working on it by having initial discussions and preparing what we call a concept paper with the NDIS steering group just this week.  We are asking for its view in the next short period.  We hope to develop a consultation document by September.  We will then consult widely on that in the autumn.  We would hope, ideally, to have a draft of the implementation plan by the end of the year, by December, with a view to the Government signing off on an implementation plan early in 2022.  That is the timescale we have in mind.  As I said, we regard this as an important document that would set the roadmap for how we implement each component of the convention, including elements Deputies and Senators have rightly identified are not adequately covered at present and areas that require more attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.646" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#J00500"><p>I will briefly touch on the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on participation.  I remind everyone the UNCRPD is a groundbreaking UN convention.  It is different from other ones because it involved people with disabilities in its development and design.  Key to its implementation in any domestic situation is the continued participation of people with disabilities.  I am a year in my position as chief commissioner.  Within our organisation we have built in structures to make such participation a part of what we do all the time in the make-up of the commission around me and in our disability advisory committee, which advises us on issues of disability.  One of the most enriching parts of my experience to date has been the ability to interact with people who are affected by the issues we discuss.  Unfortunately, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann does not yet represent people with disabilities.  There is a major under-representation of people with disabilities in public life.  Until there is such representation, there is major obligation on this and every committee to make sure those voices are central to policymaking in every step of the way.  Participation has to follow that step by step by step.  As I say every day, nothing about us without us.  Honestly, it has been the biggest lesson for me so far in my role as chief commissioner and it is one I want to make sure this committee holds dear throughout the work that it does.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#J00700"><p>I thank the three witnesses.  I am glad we seem to be narrowing down on the issue of a timeline for the optional protocol.  It is welcome to hear we are not waiting for an external process in terms of the UN but that an internal set of factors, which are within the control of the State, will determine the timeline for ratification of the optional protocol.  Given the Department is looking towards December or January next year with respect to the legislation on decision-making, we should seek to have the optional protocol ratified in parallel with the implementation plan in January 2022.  That seems to be the natural time whereby the State will have addressed the gaps it has identified.  It will have identified the gaps in implementation and addressed known legal failings.  That would be the appropriate time.</p> <p>  I sat through the entire previous Oireachtas term during which we went from signing to ratification and ratification was delayed year after year because we were told we needed to get things in place before we could ratify.  Now its seems the optional protocol is going through the same process.</p> <p>  There will be an iterative development to this and even in cases that are taken but the UNCRPD is already law.  The optional protocol will not make it law; it is law.  The optional protocol will simply ensure persons are able to hold states to accounts.  It is an instrument of strengthening implementation.  It is fundamental not only for the individuals but for society because it internalises that set of expectations of how we live together and treat each other.  It we look to the parallels on the European Court of Human Rights on the general data protection regulation, individuals holding the State to account and reminding it of the collective commitments we have made have helped to drive implementation and create that energy for it.  In doing that, they do a service to the State and the wider public body.  </p> <p>  Professor Schefer appeared before the committee recently and I was struck by what he said.  He specifically said the optional protocol is an integral part of what the UNCRPD means.  He said we are used to the fact that the European Court of Human Rights creates a body of law.  He spoke about how the case law under the optional protocol had the participation of individuals in reporting on the optional protocol, which allows a country to give the input it needs.  Basically, it is about that collective strengthening and the building of a body of law and of case law.  It is not about catching out countries; it is about working and learning.  </p> <p>  Can we move towards a January implementation alongside the implementation plan?  It seems the complaints process could be put in place in a twin-track process, as Deputy Canney suggested, during the autumn.  The implementation plan will not be a set plan; the implementation will be ongoing because needs will be made evident.  That is where the funding of IHREC, disabled people's organisations, DPOs, and legal aid procedures, if necessary, comes into play.  We should put the multiple facets in place in the autumn to ensure we have many people looking to implementation and monitoring if it is working on ongoing basis.  We will not get to a point where Ireland has everything right but we will get to point where we have a vision for it and that will evolve.  Those are key aspects.  Do the witnesses believe we should move towards that January date?  What should we have in place in respect of an ongoing, empowered monitoring of development post-implementation plan and the raising of ambition?  Another aspect is the extent to which the Department is looking to case law emerging from the UN committee and taking it on board.  </p> <p>  The recovery and resilience strategy was mentioned.  I am sure the Chairman will be able to confirm if the committee is writing to ask how disability is being reflected in that.  Regarding the making of a statement to the D&aacute;il, interestingly,  we had sought an equality statement in parallel with the equality budgeting process.  That proposed statement reminds me of that.  I would appreciate if Mr. Lynch would advise how the Department intends to press to ensure the budgetary process specifically reflects the duties on equality and human rights because we are entering a budget cycle.</p> <p>  We have heard about a new Department taking on a new brief.  The key issue is every Department needs to take on this brief.  They should already be doing it under the public duty to an extent and should scale it up.</p><p>What measures is Dr. Lynch's Department taking with regard to the gaps between other Departments?  We have had quite a few experiences as a committee of issues getting kicked from one Department to another and gaps emerging, for example, between education and health.  That is a very clear example of where we have new health services being developed but the diminishment of educational supports and services at the same time.  Is, for example, Dr. Lynch's Department part of the bridge in that regard?  Could he give us an example of how he is navigating the gaps between Departments and, indeed, perhaps bridging some of the areas of ambiguity within Departments to make sure they are held to account?</p><p> There are so many interesting points.  I thank the witnesses very much.  Apologies that I probably went over time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Gibney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#K00300"><p>I believe most of those questions are probably directed towards Mr. Lynch.  I am happy to pick up on one thing, however.  I think it is very helpful to posit the 22 January date.  Personally, I would probably do it tomorrow if we could.  Absolutely, let us set a date as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Mr. Harris and I were chatting ahead of today's session to try to find an analogy for the optional protocol to the UNCRPD.  The best we could come up with was a topical analogy to say that it is like playing a football match without a referee.  Essentially, by implementing the optional protocol we are providing for a kind of backstop.  The Senator is correct; it will build capacity and capability in the judicial system to deal with these types of complaints and issues.  I would also suggest that because this does not exist, cases and remedies are not sought because of people's poor experience with them to date here.  Once that is put in place, however, I would imagine we will see an increase in cases coming forward and, exactly as the Senator described, what we will have then is a building of case law.  The State needs to see it as being a capability exercise that can really assist in identifying issues and allow the Department then to deal with those issues.</p> <p>  That is all I wanted to comment on.  I think most of the other points are related to the Secretary General.</p></speech>

On the timeline for the optional protocol, I very much take the Senator's concerns into account and the points made by Ms Gibney.  We have to be very careful about what is realistic and what we can do at a particular point.  We want to be ready to support the protocol before we ratify it.  I have a concern that if we attempt to ratify the protocol before we are ready to give expression to it, we will run into difficulties in that regard.  My particular concern is to make sure the decision support service is actually in place as opposed to it simply being provided for in law.</p> <p>  I stress it is ultimately a Government decision when this can and will be done.  I am listening very carefully to the views of the committee as to the timing of it.  As I said earlier, our original timeline was in the context of assuming the UN reporting cycle would be to roughly the middle of next year.  That is the basis on which we were pitching implementation of the optional protocol.  We are still at that timeline in my mind because of the importance of the decision support service and having it in place.   Obviously, we need to take advice from the Attorney General's office as to the legal requirements relating to this and Government needs to make a decision.  We will not, however, be found wanting in trying to press ahead with everything that is required for the optional protocol as soon as we possibly can.  I absolutely take on board the concerns to do that as soon as possible.  I just want to get the sequencing right.  I know Government is committed to doing that as quickly as it possibly can.</p> <p>  With regard to the budgetary side and equality budgeting in particular, our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are jointly leading an equality budgeting initiative that is looking at the equality impacts of budgets.  That is a very important component which we have not been able to do in the past and which we are now pressing ahead with.  We did it on a preliminary basis last year and we are moving much further on it in the current year.  That is important.</p> <p>  In terms of bridging the gap between Departments and so on, I would mention the transitions working group, which will meet on 23 June.  That is aimed at bridging the gap and trying to ensure smoother transition, for example, between education and employment and the transition from education into employment.  We are working on those areas as much as we possibly can.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins also asked about how we encourage other Departments to work with us and deliver their side of the bargain, so to speak.  We work closely with individual Departments.  The best example I can think of a positive area of progress in which I have taken part recently involved Tusla - the Child and Family Agency - and the Health Service Executive with regard to supports for children with additional needs.  A set of issues were identified by the Ombudsman for Children over a period where there was a clear difficulty in transitions between Tusla-based and Tusla-funded services and those for the HSE.  I am pleased a protocol has been developed and is now being implemented successfully.  Previous issues with regard to gaps and a lack of transition between agencies have been satisfactorily addressed, in my view.  I am not saying everything is perfect but it is an example of where we can encourage Departments and agencies to work together and show this can happen in a meaningful way.  The protocol on the disability side has been a good example of that.  It has meant smoother working and transition, particularly for children with a disability as they move towards the age of 18 into young adulthood, where there was quite a gap and quite a difficulty because of the responsibility of different agencies.</p> <p>  We will continue our work in that regard.  We are acutely conscious, both here and in other areas of our brief, of the difficulty in securing a good join between the responsibilities of different Departments.  The last thing we want are interdepartmental disputes or disagreements as to who is responsible for what.  We tried very hard to negotiate and work with Departments to make sure that does not happen and that where there is a grey line as to who is responsible for what, we can sort that out.  It behoves us all to do that.  Again, I refer back to the implementation plan, which will be an important element in that regard.  I hope that covers the essential elements of Senator Higgins's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#K00600"><p>Many questions have already been answered.  I will follow up on two areas.  I was delighted to hear Dr. Lynch talk about implementation in terms of making Departments work better together.  I want to pick up on the issue around data, which I think is incredibly important.</p> <p>  We hear over and over at the health committee about the fact that services and the roll-out of policy are hamstrung when data on what people need are constrained and not available.  Making sure Departments are joined up in their data collection is crucial.  Obviously, with regard to disability, data on health would be very important.  We heard previously about issues around registers for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer.  That can really impact outcomes because it relates to how easy it is for a person to access services and care.</p> <p>  My question is not just on how we can optimise this or the challenges to data sharing between Departments.  Obviously, there will probably be challenges and difficulties.  Given the past few months, however, what are the concerns or challenges in terms of data security?  We must ensure that where data is being collected on people in terms of preventative health or accessing services, we are mindful that while we are utilising that data during the UNCRPD process, we are also safeguarding it and walking that tightrope of general data protection regulation, GDPR, and people's human rights.  That is one issue.</p> <p>  As so much has already been covered, my second question is around our definition of disability, which various NGOs have raised with me a number of times in recent months.</p><p>We have a number of definitions for disability such as those in the Disability Act 2005, the Equal Status Act and the census.  Some are broader than others.  Will the witnesses inform us with what definition we are working?  Do multiple definitions being in play pose a challenge to the implementation of something like the optional protocol?  Have we had any advice on this issue from the Attorney General's office?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021061700002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for that important question.  When we talk about the UN convention, we should not lose sight of its main achievement which is changing our understanding of disability, moving away from a medical model that view disabled people as lesser and requiring them to become more like non-disabled people.  Unfortunately, that has been most of the history that disabled people have lived through.</p> <p>  The UN convention recognises that disability comes into play when impairments interact with both environmental and attitudinal barriers.  The Statute Book's definitions of disability do not, in many respects, bring that to life.  They approach disability more from a medical-based model which still informs the system that sees disabled people as less than or as having to conform or needing help or needing to be treated as opposed to being empowered.  It has a more practical consequence as well in that it tries to create an exhaustive list of disability whereas in actual fact disability is much broader.  We know a significant percentage of people at some stage in their life will experience disability.  While it is appropriate for the Statute Book to categorise disability where it can, it should not seek to codify or to make an exhaustive list.</p> <p>  The census is a great example of this.  As an autistic person, I cannot actually answer the disability question on the census because autism is not an option.  It is an example of how we are losing data visibility because we are too defined and confining in our approach.</p> <p>  Regarding full implementation and reaching everybody with this convention, we have talked a lot today about how we bring the convention to life in practice and also the optional protocol.  The committee should not lose sight of Articles 12 and 14 of the convention.  These relate to deprivation of liberty which has a lot of consequences, particularly for older people who may be in nursing home care.  Ireland had reservations around these pieces of the convention.  The commission has expressed concern on several occasions about the draft heads of Bill and the deprivation of liberty.  While the Bill has been delayed because of Covid-19, it is important that a timeline is established around when the legislation will proceed.  Critically, as we recently asked the commission against torture to ask the State, when that Bill proceeds, it must be clear how it is intended to ensure the Bill aligns with international human rights standards.</p></speech>

The Department has a specific data protection policy which provides us with a clear statement on the Department's commitments to protect the rights and privacy of individuals.  We have a privacy notice, a data subject rights policy and a clear policy on breach of data.  We set significant store in these in terms of protecting people and ensuring that they are handled properly.</p> <p>  When we are dealing with data and how it functions, the CSO, Central Statistics Office, is leading on the quality data strategy.  That will hopefully help to create a more consistent and joined-up approach to data.  I take the point made by Ms Gibney and Mr. Harris on this area.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the different definitions of disability that are used.  The equality Acts have a broad and inclusive definition which is in line with the social model of disability and is compatible with the UN Convention.  The definitions in the Disability Act tend to be narrower and refer to a substantial restriction in the person's capacity and so on.  This is an area we are conscious of in terms of being clear on the definitions that we should be using.  Clearly those definitions have to be compatible with the UN convention.</p> <p>  One item on our workplan this year is actually a review of equality legislation.  Within that, we will have an opportunity to review the definitions of disability.  Given that there are different definitions, we want to move away from one which relies on medical models and move to one which is clear and close to social-based models.</p> <p>  In our area of access and inclusion models, it includes early years education.  It uses the social model in its definition of disability in the spirit of the convention.  It does not require formal diagnosis of disability.  It is a more inclusive, workable and appropriate definition.  The area of definitions of disability is important to us.  The review of the equality legislation will be a particular concern in that regard.</p></speech>

Particularly in our work around the public sector equality and human rights duty, there is this reluctance around the collection of equality data over legal concerns.  We are absolutely clear that the collection of the equality data, including special categories of personal data, can and should be undertaken by public bodies in compliance with European and Irish data protection legislation, GDPR and the Data Protection Act.  That provides that the personal data is for the specific purpose of ensuring that there is no discrimination in carrying out functions.  In other words, if it is clearly defined and for the purposes of promoting equality, it can be collected lawfully.</p></speech>

It is almost daunting to be the last speaker because many of the questions have already been covered.</p> <p>  I am ambitious for this committee and it is great to have a January 2022 deadline.  We have all been asking for a timeline.  One big issue for me is implementation.  It is transformative and is about attitude.  It will cross every part of our society, economy and our community.  From our engagement with Departments, I feel they box-tick this convention.  They show up to the meetings and yet hand deliver back the responsibility to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We all know that the implementation of this convention is for everybody, from the shopkeeper right up to the Taoiseach.  Every Department needs to start disability proofing and coming up with a strategy to ensure disability is the default option in how they carry out their functions.  For example, it could be the Department of Health making equipment and screening machines disability friendly.  It could be the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine putting creative thought into a TAMS, targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, grant for accessible farmyards.  I feel for all Departments that this is just a box-ticking exercise.</p><p>It is handed back then and too much pressure is given back to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, when this is everybody's responsibility.  I would like people's opinions and thoughts on that.</p></speech>

I will keep it brief as I know we are coming up to time.  I will give an answer similar to what I mentioned with regard to local authorities.  If Government be doing this.  It has now been on the Statute Book for seven years and, unfortunately, 80% in the most recent round failed to fully comply with it in their strategy statements.</p> <p>  With regard to starting to assess, address and report, it is a framework which is ready-made for Departments to now implement.  They are saying it will take account, not only of disability, but all equality and human rights issues.  That is important.  Another thing we have been calling for is an Oireachtas committee on equality, human rights and diversity.  This is something we saw during Covid-19 in particular, in terms of a lack of scrutiny within the legislative process.  We have been calling for this since 2016 and it would assist Departments and the members, as legislators, in this work.</p> <p>  When one is talking about implementation, it is important to mention some of the key concerns we have.  We will be reporting formally on the first period.  Our key concerns are lack of participation, which applies to Departments, and if there is one thing Departments need to embody, it is increased participation of people with disabilities in decision-making; key legislative gaps, around which Mr. Harris has given some detail; the slow pace of the institutionalisation of disability services and with regard to the articles related to life and health, we have concerns around mortality rates, people with disabilities taking more medication than those without, increasing waiting lists and very low levels of timely completion of assessment of needs.  In terms of health outcomes, persons with disabilities are twice as likely to live in consistent poverty, compared to non-disabled people and half as likely to be employed.  Those are some of the headline concerns in terms of implementation.</p></speech>

I tried to unmute unsuccessfully.  I was just thanking Senator McGreehan for her questions and saying I agree implementation is so much about attitude, culture and positive engagement as opposed to box-ticking.  Within our own Department, we are hugely bought-in to what we are trying to achieve and I get the same sense of buy-in from many other Departments.  Obviously, Departments and agencies have huge agendas in other areas.  The constant challenge is to persuade, cajole and encourage people to come along this road as well but, as Ms Gibney rightly said, this is the law and not some optional extra.  It simply has to be done.</p> <p>  This implementation is about attitude.  One of the things we are doing is that each Department is to have its own implementation actions and specified actions for implementation of the convention.  It is not simply a case of doffing the cap or ticking a box.  Each Department is identified as having its own specific areas it needs to deal with.  They are engaged in a whole load of other areas but it is important they be encouraged and we will continue to encourage them.</p> <p>  In terms of equality budgeting, it is important to note a network of equality co-ordinators has been established in each Department and disability is a key strand for that and in terms of extracting and understanding the data and funding related to disability, this will be an important part of that process.  I was struck by what Senator McGreehan said about being ambitious for the committee and it is good to hear that.  As I think I noted at the beginning, this committee is a key element of the overall implementation process, because of the role of national parliaments in monitoring the implementation of the convention and acknowledging the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's, IHREC, important independent role in that regard.</p> <p>  We have a good architecture in which to press ahead with implementation.  The committee has, in this Department, a strong advocate for pushing ahead with implementation.  I commit and I know my colleagues do also, to working closely with other Departments and agencies to implement the convention.  The fact the convention is in existence has helped us move forward in terms of provisions within the assistant decision-making capacity legislation and the establishment of the disability participation consultation network, all of which were shaped by the convention.  We are committed to continuing our work on implementation.  We look forward to working with this committee in its important work.</p></speech>

Where many plans have failed was in terms of having vague goals and buzzwords such as "ongoing" have often been the words we have heard again and again and again.  Having defined, measurable goals is key to success.  To that end, we have talked a little bit about representation today and if I was to leave the committee with one idea of where we can begin to make progress it is with regard to how important representation is.</p> <p>  One of the commitments of the comprehensive employment strategy is that by 2024, all public bodies should have 6% of their staff having a disability.  It is vital that goal is achieved, not just at an entry-level role because the key way we will influence public policy in this area is when it comes to Departments having a responsibility to report.  We need to see people in leadership roles who have a disability and know the importance of this policy area.  That goal of 6% is something which needs to be monitored closely and we need to ensure it is realised by 2024.</p></speech>

I know so many of our employees in the Civil Service who have to make a business case to get assistive technology and they are often turned down because it is in county councils or a Department budget, but if they were in a private company, they would get it.</p> <p>  Having the opportunity to upgrade within the Civil Service is about assistive technology and advancing that grant.  It is a huge issue for me and the people involved.</p></speech>

I need to bring a couple of issues to people's attention before the meeting proper starts.  Apologies have been received from the Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness.</p> <p>  I remind members and participants to switch off their mobile phones because they cause interference.  For the purposes of the Official Report, I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are also requested to remove their face coverings when speaking in order to ensure that their contributions can be recorded adequately.  They can put their face coverings back on when they have concluded their contributions.</p> <p>  We have a number of witnesses with whom to discuss the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, a Private Member's Bill.  We extend a welcome to our guest speakers and to those who may be watching in on the Oireachtas channel.  We are joined by: Ms Annmarie O'Connor, business manager, national development, Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS; Ms Michelle O'Hara, manager, south Leinster, MABS; Mr. Michael Doherty, regional manager, north Munster, MABS; Mr. Paul Joyce, senior policy analyst, Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC; and Mr. Ed Farrell, CEO, Irish League of Credit Unions.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to continue detailed scrutiny of the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018, a Private Member's Bill tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  This is the final public hearing on the Bill in advance of the preparation of the committee's report.</p><p>The format is that Ms O&rsquo;Connor will give a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. Joyce and then Mr. Farrell.  The opening remarks will be followed by a question and answer session with the members.  I call Ms O&rsquo;Connor to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my MABS colleagues, Mr. Michael Doherty and Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Hara.</p> <p>  While we support the objectives of this Bill, unfortunately, advising on the rate is not within our expertise.  Instead, we aim to show people on the lowest incomes should be able to access the lowest rates possible when they borrow.  If this market can only deliver at a rate that risks our clients falling into further debt or being locked into poverty, then action is surely needed.  We strongly assert that low-income households do not naturally migrate from legal to illegal lending.  MABS clients are capable, astute and resourceful.  They are fearful of the dangers of illegal lending.</p> <p>  The risk of migration to illegal lending too often colours this particular debate.  There is a risk of unintended consequences, but similar risks arise in legislating all the time.  Those risks are mitigated not by a reticence to legislate but by a broader focus on the other measures needed for legislation to have the desired pro-social impact.  Occasionally, clients come to MABS at a point of borrowing or having borrowed from an illegal lender, but only when other avenues have been exhausted and usually only out of pure desperation.  On 10 May 2021, a major provider of high-cost credit announced it was stopping lending.  Since then, we in MABS have been working with colleagues in key stakeholder organisations to ensure there is a coherent operational response to address any fallout and to ensure people facing difficult circumstances and hard choices do not turn to illegal moneylenders in the absence of alternatives.</p> <p>  Actions are needed in four domains: policy, legislation, regulation, and operations.  MABS can actively work on operations, but, respectfully, we submit that a holistic policy focus on the credit, financial inclusion and other needs of households living on low incomes or coping with a sudden income shock is needed so that they do not get caught in poverty traps due to high-cost lending.  If MABS can work with all stakeholders to build financial resilience through innovation and a commitment to address this challenge, then we think we can potentially bring many borrowers along a pathway from high-cost, to near-prime and mainstream lending.</p> <p>  The main issue we see in our casework is a lack of income relative to fixed costs, a related lack of financial resilience and a contraction in the choices remaining to access credit when it is needed.  This is either due to a systemic lack of income or to an insufficiency of income due to a changed circumstance.  When a financial buffer in the form of savings is not there, some households borrow at a very high cost to bridge a gap.  Despite what we hear about unprecedented levels of post-pandemic savings, we do not see this in our casework.  Just now, more of our clients seem to be falling behind.</p> <p>  Our submission highlighted the role of the poverty premiums we see in our casework all the time: late fees, so-called dishonour fees, overdraft fees, disconnection fees, not being able, for example, to afford to bulk buy nappies or other essentials to get a lower unit cost, a previous history of arrears, and so on.  All of this means it can cost more just to get by in the poorest households.  We highlighted the pain or pressure points that can occur such as a car breakdown, a washing machine giving up, or a bill that is higher than usual.  More profound are the effects of loss of hours, a relationship breakdown or a bereavement.  Add to that the practices of institutional creditors and their agents with a singular focus on collecting amounts owed, and you will see how our clients can become quite desperate and vulnerable and how loyalties can transfer to a high-cost lender, who can sometimes be viewed as a friend.</p> <p>  Timing is key when pressure is applied.  Last year, in our pre-budget submission, we suggested a need for breathing space to enable us to work with our clients for a period of three months, during which they would face no pressure from their creditors and we could work to find a sustainable solution.  Unfortunately, some of the biggest household expenditures are becoming more immutable to change through budgeting alone.  Accommodation costs, for example, absorb a greater percentage of our clients&rsquo; incomes, leaving them with little scope for savings and more at risk of falling behind on other bills.  This leads, in turn, to their financial exclusion and a risk they will not be able to access affordable credit when it is needed.</p> <p>  MABS is supportive of the objectives of this Bill.  We strongly believe it is within the capacity of all the main stakeholders to work together so that no household has to avail of rates so far from the market norm and to bring the risk premium down.  To do this we need to explore what share business, credit unions and banks might underwrite, what other innovative solutions could emerge in the market, the role of personal insolvency, the impact of reducing the poverty premium, the use of alternative data on payments in potentially building a positive credit score, the potential to encourage or incentivise saving, the impact of new forms of finance, such as buy now pay later, BNPL, finance, what unmet need the Department of Social Protection or other Departments might address, and what the response from charities might look like.  Our clients want to pay.  It is costs, not behaviours, that present the primary challenge.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in the meeting.  We cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  Witnesses attending remotely from outside the parliamentary campus have been made aware that full privilege may not apply.  I ask Mr. Joyce to proceed.</p></speech>

We made a detailed submission last November.  Since then, there have been many appearances before the committee from a number of people such as the Centre for Co-operative Studies and the Social Finance Foundation, SFF.  The debate has moved on as a result of the number of appearances by different witnesses.  The scope of the legislation seems to have narrowed to a number of issues, one of which was understanding APR and how it works in particular for short-term loans.  Loans of under a year always carry high APRs.  Another was that perhaps a tiered system would be best in terms of creating maximum interest rates.</p><p>Another was that tiered rates might be introduced depending on the length of the term of the loan.  I also note that Deputy Doherty made a number of requests for information from the Central Bank of Ireland at the last debate, when the director of consumer protection appeared before this committee.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Doherty that perhaps a standard of three times the market rate might be an appropriate rate to strike and he requested data from the Central Bank on interest rates charged by various lenders.  That seems to be the nub of the issue.  </p><p> I wish to make a couple of observations.  It is not true to say that there are no maximum rates of interest that can be charged by moneylenders right now.  Each moneylender applies for a licence annually and sets out the rate that it proposes to charge and the Central Bank either agrees or does not agree to that rate.  A fact that is often missed in the media debate on this issue, in terms of the scandal of moneylending rates and so on, is that the State actually authorises each moneylender to charge what it currently charges.  If one looks at the moneylenders register, one sees that some moneylenders have two different rates, one for short-term loans and the other for longer-term loans.  A number of lenders also charge collection charges and a different APR applies for such charges.  It is also worth noting the advisory note at the top of the register which reads as follows: "Please note that while the below register provides detail on the maximum rates a moneylender can charge, each moneylender may have a range of additional products with lower APRs and costs of credit available."  That is a particularly interesting statement in the context of setting maximum rates.  It seems to suggest that there is some degree of competition among moneylenders.  The fear that Ms O'Connor has articulated and which has been articulated by many is that by setting maximum rates, the licensed moneylender option will be cut off and people will migrate to illegal moneylenders.  Discussions with the industry, with the Consumer Credit Association which licenses moneylenders and with Provident, which has withdrawn from the market, on how this might work would be worth considering.</p><p> The director of consumer protection at the Central Bank suggested that setting one maximum rate might lead to a situation where licensed moneylenders would just extend the term of their loans, thereby defeating the purpose of having a cap in the first place.  Obviously that fear could be dealt with by having a tiered set of rates depending on the length of the agreement.  The Minister for Finance in his contribution made it very clear that APR is significantly affected by the term of the loan if the latter is less than one year.  That is correct.  He said that he agreed completely that current interest rates are too high but that a sudden change of this magnitude could be very difficult for the industry.  There seems to be a broad consensus emerging that existing rates are too high.  We all probably accept that but setting maximum rates needs to be well researched and needs to still allow for some measure of profit for licensed moneylenders in the market.</p><p> On the issue of collection charges, 14 of the 35 lenders currently on the register purport to charge collection charges.  Our legislation is totally outdated in this regard.  Section 103 of the Consumer Credit Act obliges the moneylender to inform a borrower that payments can be made at the business premises of the moneylender but nobody actually does this.  It would be more expensive to go to the business premises of the moneylender in the first place.  What is extraordinary is that the legislation has not been updated to allow borrowers to make electronic payments.  If there are going to be tiered rates for different lengths of agreement, they have to distinguish between home-collected loans, which are obviously much more expensive for the lender to service, and loans that are paid by electronic means which are obviously going to be far cheaper and should attract much lower rates.  </p><p> It seems to us that a cap, or caps, is needed and tiered rates seem like a good idea.  It will be interesting to see what response Deputy Doherty gets to his request to the Central Bank to provide data.  Some broader questions also apply here, some of which were touched on by Ms O'Connor.  In our lengthy submission in November we touched on a number of them.  Credit unions are seen as the main alternative source of credit to licensed moneylenders should a lot of the latter leave the market.  It would be useful to evaluate and review the It Makes Sense loan scheme to understand the problems with it.  Our understanding is that while a lot of credit unions participated in the scheme, a number of the larger unions did not.  </p><p> There are obviously huge issues of income inequality in our society.  In that context, the supplementary welfare scheme needs to be looked at to see whether the urgent needs payment mechanism is actually working for people who, as Ms O'Connor suggested, get into temporary financial difficulties when their washing machine or cooker breaks down, for example.  There is also the issue of the minimum living wage which a number of organisations, including the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice among many others, have suggested should be set at &euro;12.30, which is approximately &euro;2.10 above the national minimum wage.  </p><p> The last point I would make is that apart from maximum interest rates for licensed moneylenders, we should also consider maximum interest rates for other lenders.  We gave an example in our November submission of an absolutely scandalous loan that was offered by a sub-prime lender to a client in the boom years.  We would also like to see the consumer credit legislation changed in some other areas.  Top-up loans are banned, for example, but there is no limit on the number of loans that a customer can have simultaneously which defeats the purpose of the top-up loan ban.  </p><p> This committee is also looking at the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill.  In our submission on that legislation, we made the point that consumer credit legislation in Ireland needs to be properly codified.  We have an Act and a number of statutory instruments.  It is about time that the legislation was updated into one cogent statute that people can understand properly.  There are two very significant directives in this area; one is the 2010 directive on consumer credit and the other is the 2016 directive on mortgage credit.  They were both transposed by statutory instrument, thereby depriving the Houses of the Oireachtas and the committee of the opportunity to debate them properly.</p></speech>

Following Mr. Farrell, we will hear from Deputy Doherty who has submitted a further detailed amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018.  I wish to restate clearly the support of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, for the principle of the Bill.  Putting a cap on the interest rates of moneylenders is the right thing to do.  I welcome this opportunity to outline the view of the ILCU and will briefly, by way of conclusion, put our position on this issue in the broader context of credit union policy.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  On moneylending, t</font>he ILCU believes it is vital that the Government ensures that extortionate interest rates are not charged.  Credit unions know first hand how they trap families and individuals in a lifetime of debt.  Everyone, whether employed or not, should have access to affordable credit. <br/><br/>Credit unions are part of a social movement with a financial purpose and are not financial institutions with a corporate social responsibility programme.</p><p>Putting that ethos into practice, credit unions have, as the committee knows, rolled out the personal microcredit scheme, otherwise known as the "it makes sense" loan.  The original aim was to prove that credit unions could offer a loan product that matched the convenience and ease of moneylenders' offers, address their exorbitant rates and operate within prudential lending guidelines.  In an excellent co-operative effort with a range of agencies we have done just that.</p><p> The Bill the committee is considering is not simply aspirational.  It exists in a context where an alternative exists and which the league is anxious to promote.  It is in this context that we support the proposal for the introduction of a cap on moneylenders' interest rates.  We note that the Bill proposes the amount of APR chargeable on loans by licensed moneylenders shall not exceed 36% and, in our view, this is appropriate. </p><p> We understand that there is concern that a cap may ultimately lead to a reduced supply of loans from licensed moneylenders, thus abetting legal lending.  However, the league does not believe that an interest rate cap will result in increased lending by illegal moneylenders.  Our rationale for this is twofold.  First, as I said, is the fact that the credit union movement is an alternative source of credit which is in place as well as the international experience of where such interest rates caps exist.  To expand on that point, I will refer the committee to a report on interest rate restrictions on credit for low income borrowers which was conducted by the Centre for Co-operative Studies in UCC.  The report states that there is no empirical and undisputed evidence that interest rate restrictions result in an increase in illegal moneylending.  </p><p> In the UK, it was feared that the price caps on payday loans would push a large percentage of people towards illegal moneylending.  Citizens Advice in the UK has said that caps on payday loans have not led to an increase in illegal moneylending, with analysis of debt held by Citizens Advice clients showing that the number of loan shark debts has remained constant since the introduction of the cap.</p><p> Regarding fears of illegal moneylenders, the ILCU believes consideration should be given to the introduction of an interest rate cap over a period of years, thus providing as fluid a transition as possible.  This could be achieved by way of a stepped down approach, so to speak, in advance of reaching the expired cap over a number of years.  This would allow time to monitor the situation and take relevant steps, if and when required.</p><p> Credit unions are a social movement with a financial purpose.  This issue has been a priority for the ILCU over several years.  The wider policy context for credit unions and the committee is delivery by Government on its plans, as outlined in the programme for Government, which is for credit unions to become the community banking sector they have the potential to become.  That bigger issue is outside the scope of today's conversation, but it is imperative if credit unions are to grow and deliver on the range of services people want from a people-led community-based movement.  Moneylending is simply one example among many of the failures of conventional banking.  I again thank the Vice Chairman.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped there will be no more technical difficulties.  It is frustrating that we cannot have these meetings in Leinster House given all of the technical difficulties we are having.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses to the committee and appreciate, not for the first time, their time and input on this Bill and the wider issue of moneylending.  I welcome Mr. Farrell, CEO of the ILCU; Ms O'Connor, business manager, from MABS, and her colleagues; and the Free Legal Advice Centre, especially Mr. Joyce who is a regular attendee at these committees on various subject matters.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements and submissions on the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill which I introduced in 2018.  A previous version of the Bill was published a number of years ago.  I want to begin, as the Vice Chairman said, by drawing attention to a submission I made on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in to the committee regarding the Bill.  I understand it has been shared by the Vice Chairman.  </p> <p>  The objective of the Bill is to end what I believe is the immoral status quo which permits moneylenders to charge interest rates of 187%, or up to 280% when charges are included.  The Bill seeks to end that by capping the interest rates moneylenders can charge.  It is very welcome that key stakeholders, such as St. Vincent de Paul, MABS, the Social Finance Foundation, the ILCU, academics and UCC, are involved.</p> <p>  We have a report from 2018.  Others, including the witnesses before us, have supported the objectives of this Bill.  I have listened carefully over the past number of months to submissions and opinions from all of the stakeholders in the committee and those that have engaged with me.  My submission proposes to amend and improve the Bill if it is to progress to Committee Stage, which I hope it will.  It should be, given the moral imperative at stake.</p> <p>  I have made a submission to the committee and have attached an addendum to that which lays out the pre-legislative change I seek.  The proposed amendment would move from an absolute cap based on APR to a relative cap based on the total cost of credit.  This would put in place a restriction whereby the total cost of credit charged by moneylenders, including fees and charges, could not cost more than three times the market average.  The Central Bank would govern this cap by way of regulation.  I note Mr. Joyce's comments on my request from the Central Bank for some of the data on what is on the market at the moment.  We have not received that as a committee, but I understand it will come to us within the next week. </p> <p>  The Central Bank would govern the cap by way of regulations, with the market average calculated through information gathered from credit institutions and credit unions.  It would also be, under the amendment I propose, phased in over a three-year timeframe, allowing for a smooth transition as recommended by a number of stakeholders.  Others may have a view in terms of the timeframe, but that is what I am proposing. </p> <p>  Other provisions of the proposed amendment would require the Central Bank to assess the interest rate restriction and make recommendations periodically to the Minister for Finance so that he or she can develop regulations to restrict interest rates further, as appropriate.  I hope committee members will consider my submission and the proposed amendment, and do what I believe is the right thing as a committee by progressing the Bill to Committee Stage after we have completed the legislative scrutiny.  That is my piece regarding this submission.  I have made a submission which the committee has agreed to accept.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Farrell restated the support of the ILCU for the principle of the Bill and its proposal to cap the amount of APR to be charged at 36%.  While I have said that I propose to move from an absolute cap based on APR to a relative cap based on the total cost of credit, I welcome the fact that the credit union movement supports this Bill.  </p> <p>  In the marketplace, for a 12-month loan of &euro;1,000 a typical credit union would charge &euro;62 in interest while a moneylender could charge &euro;560.  Can Mr. Farrell comment on his view on this difference, ethically and in terms of cost it imposes on borrowers?  To tell the truth, if there is one message I want to get out from this committee it is exactly that.  If people go to a credit union it will charge, on average, &euro;62 to borrow &euro;1,000.  People who go to a moneylender will be charged up to &euro;560.  A wise person will make a journey to a local credit union.</p></speech>

Credit unions, by law, are capped, as it were, at a rate of interest rate of 12% per annum.  Moneylenders are capped at 200%, or 300% if charges are included.</p><p>As Mr. Joyce said, there might not be a cap at all but it is certainly in the 200% or 300% space if there is.  The credit unions cannot impose any extra charges so it is a maximum of 12% in total.  There are no other charges on transactions or anything like that.  Some credit unions would charge less than 12% but on that sort of small money, I suppose, it is about the social ethos of credit unions.  It is not that a credit union would make much of a return at 12% but this was the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre </i>of credit unions when they started in the late 1950s in Ireland and access to credit was a problem for many people.  That reason has stood the test of time in the 60 years since credit unions started.<br/><br/>Credit unions exist to facilitate people who have an ability and willingness to repay.  That is important as well as it is other members' money that credit unions lend.  The board and staff of each individual credit union have a fiduciary responsibility to govern the credit union and mind the money.  One member's money might be lodged as savings and this facilitates the sourcing of credit for other members.  There are over 200 individual credit unions in the Republic of Ireland and 500 or 600 branches of credit unions within the Twenty-six Counties.  It is what they are there for.  That is if there is a willingness and ability at all for the proposal, the borrower, the client or the member.<br/><br/>They are called &quot;members&quot; because they own the credit unions and are not shareholders as such.  They are financial co-operatives.  That is what credit unions are for and members should be encouraged to go in and see if credit can be arranged for them.  It is an average of ten times cheaper than we have seen from the bigger moneylenders or door collection moneylenders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#E00200"><p>Okay.  I am proposing a limit, as author of this legislation, three times the average cost of credit.  Taking a six-month to two-year old charge of interest on a &euro;1,000 loan, if the legislation is enacted as I propose, it would mean the cost of credit that a moneylender could charge would be a maximum of &euro;186 for that &euro;1,000 loan.  That would clearly be down significantly from &euro;560 and it would be phased in over a three-year term.  For the first number of years, the charge could be higher.</p> <p>  What is Mr. Farrell's view of that proposal?  I have another couple of questions that could be taken before I ask Ms O'Connor a couple of questions.  There is a repeated argument from the Government that legislation to cap interest on moneylenders would drive people to the hands of illegal moneylenders.  The witnesses have rejected the claim, citing research by credit unions and the authors of the 2018 University College Cork report.  Will Mr. Farrell elaborate on that?</p> <p>  It is really important that credit unions are enabled to provide credit to borrowers, including those who have availed of high-cost credit and loans from moneylenders in the past.  How, in the view of the witness, could that be better facilitated?  Does he have any comments on the fact that the Government has failed to increase the interest rate cap imposed on credit unions from 1% per month to 2% per month?  I will leave it at that but I have other questions if time permits or I can come in again.  I have a series of questions for the representatives of MABS and FLAC.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#E00300"><p>As I have said, credit unions have a maximum rate of 12% and the phasing in of a 36% rate would be six times better than the current rate for other lenders of between 200% and 300%.  For the good of the country, if there is a plan to get to a 36% maximum rate within a stepped process, it would bring the cost of credit and the amount a borrower must repay from 300% to approximately 30%.  At that stage, it could be a case of happy days.  We could all reflect and see if it needed to go further.  A rate of 36% sounds very expensive when interest rates are at zero or negative.  When credit unions put members' money in banks today, they get negative rates on that money, so 36% might sound ludicrous.  For very small loans of perhaps &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 over six months, it is probably not as outlandish as it may seem.  As I have said, in the context of rates of 200% to 300%, it is certainly a big step forward.</p> <p>  I indicated in my opening address that the league and seven, eight, nine or ten other organisations, including some of those before the committee today, have been working on the It Makes Sense loan as part of a task force under the auspices of the Social Finance Foundation with the Department of Social Protection, Citizens Information Board and a range of stakeholders.  During that time we have had various other research mini-projects within the overall task force trying to get under the bonnet of the legal and illegal moneylending system, trying to understand behavioural patterns, what makes people loyal and what are the strengths.  People are obviously stuck with them or loyal to them, whether it is a legal or illegal operation.</p> <p>  This research and the research within the UCC report tends to stack up and indicate there will not be an explosion in the sector.  Time will tell and nobody could guarantee one scenario over another.  We can look to research findings and experience in other countries, and there are caps in other developed European countries.  There are other examples where there has been no loss of control.</p> <p>  As Deputy Doherty mentions, there is a proposal from the Minister on the cap on credit unions' own rates.  Since credit unions started in the late 1950s - the first legislation for credit unions was in 1966 - the cap has been 12%, or a 1% per month calculation.  That was before computers proliferated so it was probably just a simple calculation of 1% on a manual ledger system.  That cap has not changed in 60 years.  Four years ago the Minister for Finance's credit union advisory committee surveyed credit unions to see how they felt about credit unions having a maximum rate of 12% versus moneylenders having a rate of 200% and 300%.  Approximately half of credit unions indicated they would like the flexibility to go above 1% per month above the 12% rate but half felt the 12% rate was enough and part of their social ethos was about the possibility of subsidising small loans to more vulnerable people at that 12% rate.  Some of the bigger credit unions that would do more loans said it would be nice to have the flexibility.</p> <p>  The Minister's intention is to bring about legislation to allow the 1% rate go to 2% per month, which would be 24% per year, and that is still two thirds of the 36% rate that has been mentioned.  If that comes to pass, credit unions seeking that flexibility will be happy because the boards of the individual credit unions will then be able to decide if they want to increase the rate.  As I stated, on a purely commercial basis they would not make money at 12%.  At 24% they would not be making much money but at least it would pay more of the cost to administer the loan.  Many other credit unions will not go above 12% because they feel it is part of the overall offering and average rates will even out.</p></speech>

I appreciate Ms O'Connor's comments that MABS supports the principle of this Bill.  I have outlined the changes I would like to see but could the witness describe to the committee the kind of cycle of debt that borrowers and some of the MABS clients fall into as a result of interest charged by moneylenders?  Could she expand on that?</p><p>There is also the issue mentioned by Mr. Farrell that if moneylenders are capped, that will force them into illegal sources of credit.  Ms O'Connor has rejected this argument as well.  Perhaps she will elaborate on that point, which is important.</p><p> What is also important, and it is wider than this but so central to it as well, is the point she made in her opening statement about the broader set of policies that are required to promote financial inclusion and tackle financial exclusion.  I note the excellent and comprehensive Building the Box report, compiled and published by National Traveller MABS in September 2020.  It is important reading for all of us as legislators.  The Government has not published a financial inclusion strategy for the past decade and that is something the committee needs to pursue.  Quite frankly, it is a disgrace.  My proposal provides for a cap on the interest moneylenders can charge over a three-year period, but it also allows for ancillary policies to be implemented such as some of those Ms O'Connor signalled in her opening statement.  Can she outline what some of those policies should be?</p></speech>

In our submission in November, we described the issue as being as much about economics as about ethnography, so it is something that arises in particular communities.  It is habituated.  It is cultivated by the people who lend in this way.  It is targeted at certain individuals and demographics.  Certainly, in the research we did for the submission, we saw that with people parenting alone and single females parenting alone.  It is about two cohorts, as I described in the opening submission.  One is the cohort who live on a low income all the time and are targeted for particular events.  I guess that when one always has to say "No", it is important to be able to say "Yes" sometimes.  One of the things advisers say to us is that the moneylender can be viewed as a friend.  It is a convenient model of lending.  There is not a lot of judgment involved in it and that is important.</p> <p>  We have another cohort.  We are seeing in our data more recently an increase in the number of males using this type of lending as well as an increase in the number of waged people using it.  In those cases what we think is happening is that people experience a loss of income and cannot re-engineer their finances quickly enough so they have a gap to bridge.  Then they have an urgent need and they look to the licensed moneylender to bridge that gap.  We think there is significant potential for us to work with clients to bring them across.  As we said, we use the words "near prime" and that might be what that higher rate the Deputy is proposing is, albeit lower than what is currently on offer in the licensed market from high-cost lending to near prime and then to mainstream, to get it to be as low as possible.</p> <p>  Regarding the illegal lending, we highlighted this because we have looked at the research, both from UCC and other international research.  We have also looked at our own experience.  The people who use licensed moneylending are well aware of the risks of illegal moneylending so that pathway from licensed to illegal is not a natural one.  We think that perhaps it has coloured this space.  In fact, sometimes when regulation in this area is proposed, the providers of high-cost credit highlight the risk of the contraction of the market and the migration to illegal lending.  We need to look underneath that.  We said in our submissions in November and today, which is very much with the idea of a tiered approach over a period, that if the change that is currently proposed was implemented, it is a perfect opportunity to situate that within a broader policy on financial inclusion.  We have set out all the things that could be done.  They are all possible.  They are not high-cost policy measures.  They are more about a focus on the stakeholders working together to bring the range of things that are possible to bear on this issue, so that we approach it strategically and bring all the stakeholders involved together.  Each has a role to play, and that is the backdrop needed for introducing this change.  It is positive to hear what the ILCU said.  That is important.  That is one element of it.  There are probably other solutions and innovations possible within the fintech world and so forth.  This is a great opportunity to tackle this issue and to do much better by the clients we support.</p></speech>

I worked for many years as a family support worker and I saw at first-hand the scandalous rates that were charged.  Indeed, I worked with the credit union and MABS to help many of those families to get out of the grip of the moneylenders.  In my experience, many parents, particularly lone parents, were paying their entire children's allowance each month for years to the moneylenders.  The witness talked about the hook.  Just before people had finished the particular loan, at perhaps &euro;100 or &euro;50 from finishing the loan, they would be offered another loan.  It just kept ticking over for a long time.</p> <p>  MABS is a fantastic organisation.  I worked with it in the Coolock-Darndale area for 20 years and it had a fantastic relationship with the community.  I fully support Deputy Doherty's amendment and hope that it is accepted and that we deal with this issue.  I have a question for Mr. Farrell relating to one of my constituents.  He has a loan from a credit union.  He paid his loan weekly across the counter, as many people do, but during lockdown, credit unions were closed and he was unable to pay until he made different payment arrangements.  He recently applied for a car loan, not from the credit union, and then discovered he had a bad credit rating due to the fact that he was unable to pay that loan, even though he has finished paying it.  Does Mr. Farrell think that is widespread and has he heard of similar cases?  I do not know what the responsibility of the credit union is to ensure that this person's good reputation is restored - he had an unblemished reputation in terms of credit - and that this can be removed in some way from the register.</p></speech>

The credit unions, thankfully, were essential services during the pandemic so if a credit union was closed it is news to me.  We kept a weekly check-in with credit unions to ensure they were able to continue servicing the members.  The door of the credit union may have been closed but people could telephone or email to make an appointment, so they were not closed from a business point of view.  They may physically have been trying to keep the directors, staff and members safer by allotting time.  I would be happy to look into that.  A monthly report has to be sent.  The Central Credit Register is one of the things Ireland Inc. had to do coming out of the International Monetary Fund arrangement.  There had to be a better credit referencing system.  The Central Bank had to put that in place, but it is strange that he would have found himself on that if he was not able to pay the loan because the credit union was unable to take the money from him.  I will follow up with the Deputy directly and we will see what we can do, if that is okay.  Obviously, I have no sight of that from here at present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#F00900"><p>Yes, I do.  I was concluding with Ms O'Connor.</p><p>I echo the comments of Deputy Paul Donnelly and commend all the organisations on the work they are doing.  It would be valuable for the committee to hear from them again about the overall debt situation and where people are at.  We hear from the Central Bank's reports that there are surpluses in savings but there are two types of stories and, indeed, multiple stories, in society.  Not everybody is in a situation where they are wondering what to do with all their savings.  The organisations present, and their clients and staff, are dealing with very difficult stories and I commend their work.  It is important that we hear from them again later in the year.</p><p> I welcome FLAC's submission.  In his opening statement, Mr. Joyce stated that he shares some of my concerns about the Minister bringing forward his own legislation.  I have been very clear on this.  We first published legislation on this matter in 2013.  Our job is to try to make sure there is a cap on interest rates and end the scenario where these companies can charge 288%.  I do not care who does it or whether it is my legislation or the Government's.  I just want it done and I do not want it delayed.  However, I do not like that the Government has said it is planning its own legislation when this Bill is finishing pre-legislative scrutiny and about to go to Committee Stage, meaning it could be a number of months away from enactment.  Mr. Joyce raised his own concerns about that.  I appeal to the Government to work with this Bill and amend it in whatever way it wishes to try to get something through on this issue, which has gone on far too long.</p><p> Mr. Joyce also warned that a cap based on APR may not be appropriate given the uneven impact on APR as a measurement based on the terms of a loan.  A number of other organisations have said the same, as has the Department of Finance.  I have heard that clearly.  What is Mr. Joyce's opinion on my proposed amendment, if he has had a chance to hear about it and understand it?  I am proposing that we move away from an absolute cap based on APR to a relative cap based on the total cost of credit phased in over three years.  What are Mr. Joyce's views on that proposal?  In simplified terms, the Central Bank would develop the regulations on this.  It would have to have a basket of loans that are in the market and after three years the rate could be no more than three times the cost of credit, with the Central Bank working out the interim or transitional steps within that three-year period. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#G00200"><p>It is good to hear that the approach has been adapted.  The problem is the question of collection charges.  There is still a lot of collective credit and clearly the rate that should apply to that would be higher, on the basis that the cost of collection is greater.  That would be one issue.  The move towards electronic collection of loans will be a significant development.  I understand Provident and others facilitated electronic transactions during the course of the pandemic so the costs of collection were not incurred.  The other question that occurs to me immediately is on the length of the loan.  If a moneylender offers a six-month loan and a 12-month loan I would think the cap on those two loans should be different, on the basis of the length of the loan.  Maybe that is a factor that needs to be looked at as well.  A lot depends on what data the Central Bank comes back to the Deputy with.  He mentioned three times the market rate but is that for the same length of loan?  Collection charges are also an issue.</p> <p>  As another observation, in an ideal world people would join their local credit union, save with it and borrow money from it.  However, as has been said already, a significant number of people use moneylenders uniquely or as part of a suite of lending options.  The risk of migration is not particularly great but it would remain to be seen if the rates that were struck led to a number of licensed moneylenders leaving the market.  That may or may not be the case and I do not know whether their opinion has been canvassed about this.  There may be a risk of migration.</p> <p>  Everybody supports the approach the Deputy is taking and I completely agree that, given that this Private Members' Bill has been in pre-legislative scrutiny for quite some time and a lot of work has been done on it, it would be a pity if it was now overtaken by a Government Bill, which would have to be initiated and on which there would be further debate and so on.  This is an urgent issue and it has been so for many years.  Perhaps a co-operative approach between the different parties is required.  The Deputy has helped by seeking information from the Central Bank on rates to help him arrive at a cap or series of caps that would do the least damage and the most possible good. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#G00300"><p>I appreciate Mr. Joyce's comments.  I know our submission came quite late in the day but I want to tease out the issue of collection charges.  This is an opportune time to move on this issue because the pandemic has impacted on the way moneylenders have operated.  Door-to-door collection was the nature of moneylending and is one of the reasons many people go to a moneylender, because of the ease of access.  They are there on people's doorsteps and they are familiar with their family and children, which lines up the next level of borrowers and so on.  However, that has changed as moneylenders have moved to an online system of collection.  They were forced to do so by the pandemic and that shows that the system can operate not just on a door-to-door basis.  The principle of this legislation is that the cost of credit should be no more than three times what is available on the market, and that includes things like collection charges because they are part of the cost of credit.  Whether a company is involved in door-to-door dealings could be taken into account by the Central Bank but the cost still should not exceed three times what is available on the market.</p> <p>  Mr. Joyce's point about the duration of the loan was well made and speaks loudly to the fact that APR was not an appropriate way of dealing with this issue.  The proposal here is for three times the cost of credit of what is in the market.  If, for example, the credit union offers a loan of a duration of a year and the cost of credit is &euro;50, that means the moneylender can only charge a maximum of &euro;150 for the cost of credit for that term.  If the credit union offers a six-month loan with a cost of credit of &euro;30, then the moneylender will only be permitted to charge &euro;90 for that same amount of credit.  It is the same amount of loan but for different durations and both the moneylender and the credit union charge a higher interest rate because of that.  The principle is to benchmark the rates against what is in the market and apply a maximum of three times that rate.  To tell the truth, I am still a bit uncomfortable with that because it is still very high but my job here is to get it moved away from 288% down to an appropriate level.  The legislation allows for further reporting on this matter to see if it needs to move further based on Central Bank reports. </p></speech>

Nowadays, most houses have a laptop or one member of the family can facilitate paying electronically.  I do not know whether that is the future of licensed moneylending.  It is also quite true that many licensed moneylenders and customers have that kind of relationship where they call to the door.  I do not know if that is on the way out but clearly, paying electronically should attract a much lower rate of interest.</p><p>At the moment, each licence holder is authorised to charge up to a maximum rate of interest depending on the length of the loan and collection charges and so on.  It brings me back to the question I raised as to what extent there is competition in the licensed moneylending industry.  If, therefore, a maximum rate of three times the market rate was put in place, would the maximum become the minimum or would licensed moneylenders compete with each other to offer lower costs of credit?</p></speech>

I will make a final comment as I know this is the end of the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, which has been quite lengthy.  I hope we can now get the pre-legislative scrutiny report and move to Committee Stage.  The question I will ask has been posed to me by somebody else so I am plagiarising.  If we as an Oireachtas committee were to design a system, would we allow for moneylenders to be licensed and charge 288%, all in, for the cost of credit or annual percentage rate, APR?  Would we allow for a moneylender to call to the doors of homes to collect the weekly payments?  We simply would not.  We would not allow a bank to do it; we should not allow a moneylender.  Just because it exists today does not mean we need to tolerate it into the future.</p> <p>  This legislation is about modernising and protecting those customers who sometimes fall foul of moneylending.  Perhaps unbeknownst to them, credit was available that was much cheaper, affordable and sustainable.  Mr. Joyce made an important point in terms of the future.  I can remember as a young gas&uacute;r the insurance man calling to our house every month to collect the insurance from my mum.  That does not happen anymore.  Things move on.  Door-to-door collection should not be happening.  It is a model that suits the moneylender.  It builds up knowledge of when a christening or communion is taking place or when someone has a hospital appointment or family emergency.  That is okay but in my view, it preys on vulnerabilities in a family network.  We need to make sure there is a proper financial inclusion strategy and that credit unions and others are in a position to lend to consumers who need access to credit in a quick way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.704" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061700002#H00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Are there any other responses?  We will move on.  I will make a couple of quick comments.  I compliment the credit unions and also Deputy Doherty on bringing forward this proposed legislation.  Hopefully, it will come to the stage he aspires to as soon as possible.</p> <p>  One issue that has been brought to my attention over the years is a loan to repay a loan from whatever source.  It is always dangerous territory.  If a person gets into difficulty arising from an existing loan they are attempting to repay, they will get into more difficulty unless there is a careful evaluation of the situation and the response is tailored to meet the ability of that person to pay.  Otherwise, he or she will get into difficulty.  That applies at a time when interest rates are low and hopefully, they will remain that way.</p> <p>  The other issue is that borrowing rates with regard to house loans and mortgages at present are, in some cases, three and a half times the gross income of the earner or variations of that amount.  I must say, from my experience in dealing with loan applications through the local authorities, etc., I believe that is at the limit of the towns.</p> <p>  Another thing that has come to my notice is the number of people who got loans from lending institutions on an interest-only basis.  The interest-only basis encourages people to borrow more, unfortunately.  The lenders will say they will try to see if people are capable of dealing with the loan and if they are, the lenders will perhaps facilitate them again.  It does not always work that way.  Eventually, the day of reckoning arrives and everything comes together at the same time.  Some lenders - I am not talking about the credit unions or the people present - do not always wish to accommodate the borrower to the extent the borrower would like or had anticipated when the loan was originally taken out.</p> <p>  I worry about this final point because it will have a knock-on effect on all borrowing.  As far as I can see, house price inflation at the moment is at an all-time high.  It is a huge disadvantage to first-time borrowers, who see this on two sides.  On one side is the investor or vulture or whatever one wishes to call them and on the other is a person, who for very genuine reasons, will say that he or she wants to sell his or her house to move further away, buy a cheaper house and have no mortgage.  In actual fact, that displaces the first-time borrower as well.  The first-time borrower must face somebody else with the ability to access cash in fairly substantial amounts competing with him or her in the market.</p> <p>  A couple of issues, therefore, need to be monitored in the future with a view to trying to ensure that we do not come to a crash, like we did before, and find many properties in negative equity.  Everybody borrowing at present should have careful regard to the fact that rapid inflation can lead to negative equity.  While negative equity is not a real problem to a person who is not selling or does not have to move to a different location, it presents a serious problem and impact for someone who needs to move on for one reason or another.</p> <p>  Before I close the final round of questioning, would anyone like to comment?</p></speech>

I commend the credit unions on the role they play in financial services in Ireland.  Like the Vice Chairman and others in the committee, I believe it is very important that we try to expand the role the credit unions play in the financial services system in this country, whether it is to deal with the issue of moneylenders or with those outlined by the Vice Chairman when it comes to housebuilding and providing financing to people to achieve home ownership.  I thank them for that.  Hopefully, we can process this legislation promptly.</p></speech>

As I have explained, this provision is necessary for technical reasons because, without it, lands owned by the Land Development Agency, LDA, would be considered relevant public lands and would confuse matters within this legislation.  Basically, that means the LDA would be offering itself back the land it already has so there would be an issue of circularity.  That is the technical reason.  That is the only reason I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The main role of the LDA should be strategic land assembly, as is done very well in other countries, and to ensure there is a sufficient pipeline for housing, including social, affordable and cost-rental housing.  The focus of this Bill and of what the Minister has been saying is on State lands currently in public ownership.  That is a good and worthwhile focus but the LDA should also be trying to build up the pipeline and land bank so there will be a continuous supply of land that can be used for housing in coming years.  We really need to move away from the current circumstances whereby many land banks are controlled by a small number of larger developers, which squeezes out the smaller builders, who have an issue.  If the LDA engaged in strategic land assembly and if it were putting in place infrastructure and amenities at the same time, not only would the cost of housing be reduced for everyone, there would also be better supply and better infrastructure and amenities.  That is why LDA should have CPO powers to acquire land needed for housing, not just the limited powers envisaged in the Bill, which relate only to access and ransom strips.  That is what my amendment seeks to do.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about it.</p></speech>

I will explain the logic of my slightly subsidiary amendments.  The section of the legislation in question is one of the weaker ones.  It is not a new one in the sense that while the original general scheme of the LDA Bill brought before us in 2019 by the then Minister, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, did not include this provision, he made it very clear that a limited CPO power would be included in the Bill.  That was subsequently confirmed by Mr. John Coleman from the LDA.  The problem is that this is not what was originally envisaged in the national planning framework, to which the origins of a land management agency can be traced back.  It was always the desire of the senior civil servants who initiated the idea of an active land management agency and those other State actors who have been supporting such an initiative, such as the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to have a body with very powerful CPO powers.  It would have those powers for two reasons.  The first is so that when negotiating with other public stakeholders, it would have strong powers to ensure they would come to the table and provide land at the appropriate price.  It would also mean the active land management agency would be able to force holders of land, public or private, who are not using it to bring it to the table.  That is a key provision for any strategic land management agency.  In the absence of that, it would only be a matter of small strips of land that would be necessary to purchase compulsorily to gain access to a bigger piece of land the LDA already has - I refer to ransom strips - is really a fundamental weakness and one of the great tragedies of this legislation.  It is an enormous missed opportunity.</p> <p>  Part of the reason for what I describe is that if we were to give comprehensive CPO powers to the LDA, as currently constituted, as in a commercial DAC, potentially competing with other DACs, it would run afoul of state aid rules in the EU and there could be legal challenges in the European courts, as happened with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  Therefore, it is about protecting the original Fine Gael idea of a land development agency as a commercial residential developer rather than a strategic land assembler.</p> <p>  My two amendments are straightforward.  One is to put the focus on land assembly and transfer to those bodies that should be building the homes we want, namely local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  The second amendment, drafted by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, is to ensure local authorities are not subject to any CPO powers because that undermines the right of elected members to approve or object to the disposal of land under section 183 of the local government legislation.</p></speech>

It should use aggressive compulsory purchase powers to take that land into use, force existing private owners to bring it into use or simply take it from them.  Quite frankly, we need a body that is monitoring, like a hawk, the available zoned building land or, indeed, land that is not zoned but would be suitable for delivering public and affordable housing, and is pouncing on that land to ensure monopolistic control of the building land bank is not in the hands of a relatively small number of private owners, which is currently the situation.</p><p> The logic behind amendment No. 195 is to insert the use of compulsory powers into the Bill as a key part of what the LDA should be doing.  The amendment should probably include buildings as well as land.  I might reconsider that for our amendment on Report Stage because I presume the Government will not agree with it.  The way in which empty property in the hands of private owners is just sat on for years and years on end is, frankly, obscene.  It is staring communities throughout the country in the face that existing property is being sat on, is empty and is derelict or whatever, just to wait to see the value of it appreciate and decide strategically when or if it will be developed.  That just should not be allowed.  We should have an agency that goes after that property and land aggressively, to bring it into use for public and affordable housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their amendments and contributions.  I will make a couple of general points.  I would not underestimate the positive effect of the activation of public and State-owned land into the housing market and the effect it will have in driving further private land activation.  We have seen examples of that through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  Land hoarding is not something anyone should support nor should the State, which is the biggest land hoarder in the country.  It is estimated we have enough zoned and serviced land to provide approximately 114,000 homes.  It is very significant to be able to pass this legislation so we can actually get on with developing homes on State-owned land.  I do not want to go over old ground, but I repeat this Bill is to supplement enhanced delivery by local authorities of both social and affordable, not to replace it.  It is an addition to that delivery.</p><p>On amendment No. 192 moved by Deputy O'Callaghan, amendments Nos. 193 and 196 moved by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and No. 195 moved by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Kenny, Murphy, Smith and Barry, I will not accept these amendments because it is not possible to do so.  Section 59 sets out the agency's powers to acquire land compulsorily.  It provides that the agency may acquire land where the land is required to provide access to relevant public land and land owned by the agency or to facilitate the provision of infrastructure required by housing on relevant land or land owned by the agency.  It may only acquire such land if it has first made a reasonable attempt to acquire the land by agreement.</p><p>That is effectively giving the appropriate compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers to the Land Development Agency to acquire ransom strips in particular.  There were no CPO powers at all in the original draft general scheme in the last Oireachtas.  This is completely different legislation.  The agency will have proportionate CPO powers.  I am not saying they will not grow in future but we must have regard for state aid rules.  That is, frankly, a consideration as well. </p><p>The LDA will, and should, be primarily focused initially on developing public lands and where it seeks to acquire private lands it is intended that it will primarily purchase these through agreement.  Most of us would want agreement in those instances, but we really want to get on with the particular nine sites the LDA has at the moment and to expand that further.  The intention of the Bill is to provide the LDA with appropriate CPO powers to enable it to purchase, as I said earlier, ransom strips.</p><p><b></b>It is not appropriate that this section be amended to widen the scope of the LDA&rsquo;s CPO powers.  On the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin about other public stakeholders, the LDA will not require CPO powers to deal with other publicly-owned stakeholders because the Government will direct them to do so and to transfer land where required.  More broadly, the Law Reform Commission, as members will know, is examining CPO law.  I expect those recommendations by the end of this year.  It has been ongoing for five years.  I am sure Deputies are aware of the existing complexities of our CPO system.  Reform is needed in that space so we look forward to the Law Reform Commission report. </p><p><b></b>I also want to reiterate the LDA will not in any way affect the primary role of local authorities as housing authorities.  I have said this on a number of occasions.  It just simply will not.  It does not matter how many times members say it will; it will not.  The LDA will not purchase local authority lands.  If they are offered for sale by local authorities, of course, it will.  However, the LDA will not be CPO-ing any local authority land.  Local authorities will be the main drivers of housing delivery.  That is why, just last week, I gave an instruction to local authorities to buy more land to enhance and increase their land banks, some of which will effectively be used up over the next three or four years.  The Department and I have changed the way we will reimburse local authorities so they will be reimbursed earlier.  I want to build up the public land bank our local authorities have for the delivery of social, affordable and cost rental.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendments as tabled by Deputies and have given my reasons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.731" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#B00300"><p>I reiterate that the role of State lands is critical.  It is critical we get affordable, cost-rental and social homes on to State lands.  There is no question about that.  When any of us talk about housing supply to the people involved, be it small builders, the not-for-profit sector and, indeed, local authorities, all of them say one of their big constraints is around getting access to land.  Much development land is controlled by a small number of people who sit on it and release it on a slow basis over time, so they can attain the sorts of prices they want.  That is a key issue.  The Land Development Agency, if it was wide enough in its ambition and it took on the role originally envisaged for it, could play a key role in strategic land assembly.</p> <p>  I am not clear on the Minister's response.  He stated compulsory purchase was not possible and cited  state aid rules, but he also said CPO powers may well grow in future.  How is it possible they may well grow in future but it is not possible at all to give those powers now?  In terms of CPO powers and what we are talking about, the idea originates from the 1973 Kenny report.  It is not new.  That report has been through an all-party Oireachtas committee, which looked at it years ago, and many people have looked at it since.  The majority opinion has been that it can certainly be implemented.  To say that we must wait for the Law Reform Commission report, 48 years on from the Kenny report, does not hold water.  </p> <p>  This issue is incredibly important in terms of what the Land Development Agency should be doing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right.  CPO powers do not always have to be used but they give a land development agency, or a strategic land assembly agency, power and clout to be able to negotiate.  This was done very well in some other countries, where municipalities, a land agency or the state were given strong CPO powers.  They did not always use those powers but it allowed them to negotiate, assemble sites and put in the infrastructure to ensure a good, continuous delivery of housing at affordable rates as it was needed, whether cost-rental or social.  This would allow us to get out of these supply logjams.  A key part of the supply logjam is, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated in its recent report, that the private sector simply cannot deliver on the demand.  It is incapable of doing so even though Ireland has some of the highest house prices in western Europe.</p><p>To continue to rely on a small number of developers who hold most of the development land and landbanks and keep that role and power in their hands is a massive mistake in terms of solving the housing crisis, which is what we all want to do.</p></speech>

They strengthen the negotiating hand of anybody in discussions.  As the Minister well knows, unfortunately, a large number of the commercial semi-States which have some of these landbanks that are not being used cannot be directed by the Government to transfer land.  For example, the bus garages in Dublin city, whether it is Donnybrook or Pearse Street, are sites of enormous strategic importance particularly in terms of residential and mixed-use developments.  Without a CPO power, if the owners of those lands do not want to engage with the LDA or engage with it in on favourable terms, the agency's hand is greatly weakened.</p> <p>  If the Minister is committing not to allow local authority land to come under CPO, I cannot understand why he would not support the Association of Irish Local Government's amendment No. 196 because it simply seeks to put that in the legislation.  I will not labour the point, however.</p> <p>  On the one hand, the Government approved the removal of section 183 land disposal powers from local authorities and elected members.  That means basically significant tracts of local authority land could be transferred to the LDA without the approval of elected members or indeed the transparency of the section 183 process.  At the same time, the Minister says he want the local authorities to buy more land.  Why not just let them deliver the housing on the land they own?  That is why it is going to undermine the role of local authorities.</p> <p>  As we have already seen with St. Teresa's Gardens, the big projects will be transferred to the LDA while local authorities will be left, in the main, doing smaller infill schemes because the Government will not give them the money or improve the approval and procurement process to get on with it.  The big delay in large local authority schemes is the lack of investment by the Government and the bureaucratic four-stage process.  I will not labour these points, however.</p></speech>

If one takes Shanganagh, it was the non-elected executive that proposed the transfer of that site to the LDA.  It was Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the usual suspects, which supported it.  We opposed that transfer because we had been campaigning for years for the council to build public and affordable housing on that site.</p> <p>  I am not quite sure how the relationship between the Department and county managers and so on works.  They are certainly not told what to do by the directly elected representatives.  It was the non-elected executive's proposal to transfer the land to the LDA.  That was because the policy of this Government and its predecessor wanted private finance and private investment involved in the development of public lands.</p> <p>  I will not labour the point but it slowed the process.  I remember Brendan Kenny explaining to the housing committee in the previous D&aacute;il how, if the local authority built on its own land, there was one process for finance, planning and so on.  With the Minister's proposal, there will be three processes.  The evidence speaks for itself in my opinion.</p> <p>  On the substantial issue of the amendment itself, does the Minister recognise that the problem of private owners hoarding land suitable for housing is a problem?  Everybody else does.  If the LDA is not going to be the agency to deal with that problem, who will deal with it?  To me, that would have been one of the central purposes of setting up such an agency, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, going right back to the sort of thinking behind the Kenny report.  Does the Minister recognise it as a problem?  If he does, why on earth would he delay this when we are setting up an agency that could have the power to actually do something to deal with the significant problem of land hoarding and activating privately owned land that could be used for housing to help us to address the housing crisis?</p></speech>

Not a week goes by without some new statistic showing how bad the situation is getting.  We see house prices and rents rising while, at the same time, not enough houses are being delivered to meet demand.  We have a huge issue with capacity and the provision of housing.  We know speculators are hoarding land and trying to maximise the profits they can make on it.</p> <p>  Is the Government prioritising the ability of landowners and speculators to make profits over the rights of people to have housing?  If we do not provide strong CPO powers to use that as leverage, I have no problem with paying a fair rate for land.  We know there are speculators out there.  Does the Minister believe there are people holding lands to maximise profits while we are in the middle of a housing crisis?  If he does, like everyone else here does, then action needs to be taken against these speculators.</p></speech>

That is based on advice from the Attorney General.  Deputy Gould is right that we need to get the increase in supply and capacity.  For places like St. Kevin's in Cork, people should support housing developments and not object to them.</p> <p>  We have to get real on how we use State-owned land and on the effect that such land being activated will have on the rest of the sector.  Land hoarding by anyone is wrong.  These are the matters that have to be addressed.  All public representatives have a responsibility to ensure that housing is delivered in those areas they represent and do not continue to find reasons to oppose housing developments for working people.  That is where this legislation is significant.  Along with the Affordable Housing Bill, this will be the most significant housing legislation passed by this Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The CPO powers are proportionate.  Of course, measures can evolve into the future as with any State agency.  I see that happening.  However, what we need to do right now is to focus on developing the land we have.  We must also ensure that, if there are strips or parcels of lands inhibiting that development, then the agency has the requisite powers to deal with it and it will do so.</p> <p>  I look forward to all Deputies supporting the Bill after we have concluded Committee and Report Stages.  Everyone, to varying degrees, said we would need a land management agency.  The main Opposition spokesperson said we need that but he does not want it to plan to develop homes.  I am not sure where other Deputies are on that.  Fundamentally, we need to get this passed to capitalise the agency and to get it developing the lands it has for social, affordable and cost-rental houses for people who badly need them.</p> <p>  I am not accepting the amendments.</p></speech>

Genuine concern has been expressed by organisations such as the Irish Council for Social Housing and various homelessness organisations that, other than on local authority sites where there is a pre-existing agreement to have that higher percentage of social housing, such as at Shanganagh, where the 30% is obviously welcome, there seems to be a working assumption on the part of the LDA that, in the main, there will be 10% social housing.  Even where increased funding may be made available or increased affordable housing will be provided for on sites, the social housing output will be limited, and that is very retrograde.</p><p>My view at all times is that the tenure mix should be determined by local need based on the housing needs demand assessment of the local authority and the views of the local elected members because they are best placed.  I do not understand why we often hear references, both in the presentations of the LDA and in the section before us, to Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  That Part applies to private housing developments, which are currently set at 10%, although I warmly welcome the Minister's commitment to increasing that to 20%.  Nevertheless, LDA land should not be constrained by Part V of the Act but rather it should use its land on the basis of identified housing need.  Therefore, unless the Minister can give me a coherent reason Part V should even be referenced in the Bill, I see no reason it should be there.</p><p>In general, any of the major sites we have examined, whether they are being transferred to the LDA, being developed by the local authorities or being pushed into questionable joint ventures, have had about 30% social housing, and in fact some are 40%, such as in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Part V, therefore, and the 10% social housing requirement it implies is a real problem if we are to tackle both the social housing and the homelessness crises.  Accordingly, I would be interested to hear the Minister's rationale for including lines 19 and 20 of the section.</p><p>I might deal with my amendments in this grouping in three parts because they involve three distinct sets of arguments, but I will be brief when I come back in on the other amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.761" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#E01500"><p>The Deputy is referring to amendments Nos. 203, 206 and 211.  I invite the Minister to respond on amendment No. 197 and we will then move on to amendment No. 198.  The Deputy's amendments will be discussed in that grouping.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#E01600"><p>The audio was breaking up somewhat, so I missed some of the contribution but heard the broader point that the Deputy raised.  The amendment seeks to remove from the section the reference to Part V of the Planning and Development Act, as he outlined.  Part V should be the bare minimum, however.  If the reference to Part V were removed, it would mean that for joint ventures or anything else in future, there would not be the bare minimum provision of Part V, and much LDA land will be well in excess of that.</p><p>While I understand the point the Deputy is making, to reiterate, the main deliverers of social and affordable housing are going to be the local authorities and we are tooling them up to do that with the biggest budget in the history of the State, and we intend to advance that further.  They will be providing housing, but the LDA will be providing significant amounts of social, affordable and cost rental housing, which, to be fair, is what everyone wants.</p><p> It is not possible for me to accept the amendment, or any amendment to Part 9, on Committee Stage.  I will explain the reason for that.  I will not be accepting any of the amendments Deputies have tabled to Part 9 of the Bill, as I intend to introduce substantial amendments to this Part on Report Stage, in particular on sections 73, 75 and 76.  I mentioned that my intention is to align the provisions of Part 9 with the provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill, which will conclude in the Seanad tomorrow and come into the D&aacute;il next week.  The LDA Bill was published in advance of the Affordable Housing Bill.  They are two very significant pieces of legislation.  I thank Members for their co-operation with them because they are both important.  While Members may not agree with every aspect of the Bills, they will agree that the delivery of affordable homes for working people to buy and to rent is important.  It is an absolute priority for me, for the Government, and I suggest for the Members opposite.  I am going to align the provisions of the Affordable Housing Bill and Part V of the Planning and Development Act on cost rental and affordable purchase with the LDA Bill.</p><p> Affordable housing is a priority for all of us.  I understand Members have their own views on how Part 9 could be further refined, but I ask them to withdraw the amendments so that we can consider them on Report Stage when I will be in a position to bring Government amendments on this particular Part.  The purpose of that is to make sure there is an alignment between the definitions on affordability and eligibility with the LDA Bill.  I know Members and their teams have put some effort into tabling amendments on Part 9, but I cannot accept them because we are going to return to them on Report Stage, as I have outlined.  I ask Members opposite to consider withdrawing the amendments at this Stage and reserving the right to reintroduce them on Report Stage when they see the Government amendments.  We can address them in the round on that Stage.</p></speech>

Will the Minister commit that the Report Stage debate will not be guillotined by the Government?  That is very important.  If the Government seeks to introduce a guillotine at the Business Committee, given its D&aacute;il majority, we will not have time to discuss and vote on amendments on Report Stage.  It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that.  It would also be helpful if he could give us a commitment that the Government will not guillotine the Report Stage debate.</p><p>The Minister spoke about the importance of the need to maximise the use of State lands for housing, with which I agree.  The amendment seeks to remove the substantial exemptions for commercial and other reasons.  If we are to maximise the potential of appropriate State lands for housing, it is very important the exemptions in the Bill are removed in order that we maximise what we can do in terms of affordable housing, cost rental housing and social housing.</p><p>The other amendments in the group that are in my name are amendments Nos. 201, 202, 207 and 212.  They relate to social housing.  I am very concerned about this section.  I note the Minister's commitment here and in the media that he is going to address the issue on Report Stage.  I am very concerned about these sections do not mention social housing.  They refer correctly to cost rental and affordable purchase but social housing is not mentioned at all.  The effect of that would be to limit social housing to just 10% on LDA land and public land, as specified under Part V.  That is a very concerning part of the Bill.  It is welcome that the Minister has committed to addressing it, but we are not sure how it will play out.  To be frank, 20% is not enough.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that this must be done on the basis of housing needs assessment.  That is the logical way of assessing the needs in an area.  Currently, we have more than 8,000 people living in emergency accommodation and 120,000 households on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies.  The idea that social housing on these State lands would be limited to 10% or even 20% of the mix is unacceptable.  Until recently, 100% of public land was used for social housing.  I agree there needs to be cost rental and affordable purchase as well.  I have no issue with that, but these sections do not even mention social housing, and would have the effect of social housing only being delivered at 10%.  That is serious.  It is positive that the Minister is going to address this, but the indication that it is only going to be up to 20% in certain areas is deeply insufficient.</p><p>The effect of amendments Nos. 202 and 207 would be to change the 50% baseline of the mix of affordable and social housing and cost rental in the Act to 100%, but if my amendments are accepted it still allows for some degree of flexibility.  I want to hear what the Minister says about Report Stage and if he will commit to the Bill not being guillotined so that we will have time to reintroduce the amendments if we are not happy with the way he has dealt with them.  We must have time on Report Stage to move, discuss and vote on these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#F00500"><p>To expedite matters, I will go through all of my amendments in this group.  They are three different types of amendment.  My argument on amendment No. 198 is exactly the same as Deputy O'Callaghan's.  There should not be an exemption from any provisions that seek to maximise the delivery of social and affordable housing on public land.  Therefore, I endorse his argument.  That is the reason we tabled the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 203, 208 and others seek to ensure 100% of the homes on public land are public homes.  It is one of the core differences between most of the Opposition and the Government parties.  I do not see any set of circumstances where unaffordable, open market-priced homes at &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 should be built and sold on public land.  We need social and affordable homes for purchase and to rent.  Therefore, that is the purpose of those amendments.</p> <p>  I have four amendments, Nos. 206, 211, 214 and 215, the latter two which were again submitted by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, representing the local government sector.  All of those amendments seek to do the same thing, which is to ensure it should not be the Minister who decides the tenure mix on any site.</p><p>That is not the function of the Minister or his Department.  In fact, they do not have the data to make those decisions.  They are giving a methodology to local authorities, the housing needs demand assessment, HNDA, and any decision on tenure should be made at a local authority level based on the HNDA.  That is the whole function of that exercise.  This arbitrary setting of tenure percentages, often determined by the commercial interests of the developer rather than local housing need, is a really bad way to make housing policy.  Therefore, each of these amendments provides for the role of the local authority and elected members in determining tenure mix.  The implication is that all that would be done in the future on the basis of the housing needs demand assessment and the future city and county development plans, which is the correct evidence-based way, not for a Minister to arbitrarily pick figures out of a hat, or, indeed, the LDA or the LDA in a subsidiary with a DAC and a joint venture with a private sector interest determining those percentages on the basis of investment decisions which, for example, I am concerned may happen in the Dundrum central site.  I will not withdraw any of the amendments, irrespective of what the Minister is promising to come back with on Report Stage because from everything he has said to date, I believe that his amendments will still leave open the possibility of some level of unaffordable open-market price homes of &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000 being delivered on public land and that is not what that land should be used for.  </p></speech>

The Minister said we will align the Bill on affordable housing with the LDA Bill and so on, that there will be a series of amendments to that effect.  Will he clarify what "social housing" is?  I refer to the eligibility criteria and particularly the income thresholds and what the Minister envisages.  There is a problem in respect of the cohort of people who are eligible for social housing, for Part V and whatever proportion of LDA developments shall be social housing as against, for example, cost rental or affordable purchase.  My fear and suspicion, given that the income thresholds have not risen for a decade, is that there is a concerted policy to make fewer and fewer people eligible for social housing and that consequently, the proportion of LDA developments that will be social housing will become smaller and smaller.  Cost rental, which is essentially a higher rent of social housing will slowly but surely substitute for traditional social housing with a differential rent scheme.  If we are to fully understand the potential implications of the LDA, we need to know who the Government envisages as being eligible for social housing in the future as against, for example, cost rental.  It is a bit difficult for us to understand terms like "affordable" if we do not know the income cohort which the Government envisages will be eligible, compared with social housing.  Otherwise we do not know what "social housing" means or who it will be for.  I would like that clarified.</p> <p>  With amendment No. 200, we are simply trying to prevent any transfer to anyone other than the local authority or approved housing bodies.  We believe, as has been well rehearsed in this debate, that this would ensure the transfer and completion of ownership of the planning authority or to persons nominated by the planning authority and nobody else, that is, no disposal to any other interests.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.793" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#G02600"><p>I appreciate the Minister suggesting that he will seek to address it on Report Stage.  I want to progress the Bill but it is very clear that the Opposition wants to ensure that this is purely a land amalgamation agency, whereas the Government wants to ensure this is an agency that builds affordable homes for people.  The Minister has already said that in places like Dublin, the 20% Part V provision, which Deputy Boyd Barrett thought had been removed, plus the remaining 80% will be affordable, that is, 100% affordable.</p> <p>  My amendment seeks to put that into legislation in order to ensure the maximum affordability and to ensure that the nominal price of the land is as low as possible.  I appreciate there may be drafting issues.  I take on board the Minister's suggestion that it will be addressed on Report Stage and thank him for considering it. </p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister is talking about increasing the 10% Part V social housing requirement to 20%.  The core of the facts here is that public housing should be built on public land.  We cannot stand over any development that will allow private developers to build private houses on public land, which are unaffordable to the majority of people.  We understand that the housing crisis affects everyone, including renters, people looking for social and affordable houses, and those trying to buy private houses.  Public land has to be used to deliver public houses.  That is where we and the Minister fundamentally disagree.  Allowing private developers and speculators onto public land is not something that we can support.</p> <p>  On amendments Nos. 214 and 215, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said about the tenure mixture, the local authority must be able to outline the housing need in its locality.  If the Minister or LDA are to say what the tenure mixture is, it should depend on the housing need of that area, city, town or community.  We are saying that to solve the housing crisis, we need to build public houses on public land.</p></speech>

A core policy of the Green Party is 100% public housing on public land, which I continue to call for.  I led the initial programme for Government negotiating team last year, where this would have stood at 60% private housing on public land.  That has dropped from 60% to 30% and, today, to 0% in our major cities where the housing crisis is felt hardest.  This amendment will allow for cost rental, affordable purchase and social housing to be provided for to a maximum in Dublin and Cork.  All of these housing models provide affordable State homes to people who need and deserve them.  I thank the Minister and his team.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.  I would like to retain the right to come back on Report Stage, as others have said, to speak to this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.798" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061700002#H00400"><p>I will start with the comments from Deputies Duffy, Higgins and McAuliffe.  I thank them and the Chairman for their engagement with regard to Report Stage amendments that I will table to substantially increase the affordable quotient in our major cities, as Deputy Duffy said.  I thank him.  We will have a 100% social and affordable requirement.  For those who say that this Bill is not transformative from the one published in the previous D&aacute;il, these measures are significant.  We will increase the baseline for affordability to a minimum of 50%.  Any decrease would require a positive resolution by the D&aacute;il.  I will table that type of amendment to section 9 on Report Stage.</p> <p>  I will address points made by Deputies Gould, &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett.  The LDA will provide housing above and beyond what local authorities will provide on their own lands.  It will be on LDA lands.  The housing needs demand assessment came up at the previous meeting.  It is a new tool for all local authorities.  Local authorities know on the basis of our research how much social, affordable and private housing, if we are allowed to use the word "private", is needed in their own areas.  If the LDA is developing a site of State agency land and, in that area, there is a requirement for far more than the minimum 10% social housing, it would be increased up to 50% because we have set a requirement of 50% affordable housing.  Most of us recognise that there is an urgent need to address those working people who have found themselves stuck in a rental and unaffordability trap.</p> <p>  We are the first Government to roll out a national cost rental scheme.  We and our colleagues in government, Fine Gael and the Green Party, will have a national cost rental scheme rolled out within a year.  We will have people in cost rental homes this year.  Should the Affordable Housing Bill pass, which I earnestly hope it will, with the support of Opposition Members as well, we will have people in affordable purchase homes this year.  That is what it is about for all of us.  It is about making change in this area to improve the lot for our people, especially those who are so acutely affected.</p> <p>  I will address Deputy O'Callaghan's question about Report Stage.  The scheduling and length of time on Report Stage is not up to me.  It is a matter for the Business Committee.  I am guided by it as we all are.  I intend to table specific amendments on Report Stage.  We were not delaying them in any form.  It is simply a phasing of them in conjunction with the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is when we will make sure that the definitions of "affordability", "proportion" and "ratios" will be brought in.  It is up to each Deputy who has tabled an amendment to move or withdraw it at this stage.  For the purposes of doing our work efficiently and appropriately, I have suggested that amendments be withdrawn.  Deputies can reserve the right to reintroduce them.  I will table Government amendments on Report Stage, which I hope will be soon, because I, my Government colleagues and others who have spoken here want to have this legislation passed by the recess because it is urgent.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about social housing.  Social housing is defined and eligibility for it is being reviewed.  I note his comments at the previous committee meeting.  He believes that social housing lists should be open to everyone.  He is entitled to that view.  That would mean that millionaires would be on the social housing list too.  I do not agree with that and think that social housing should be focused on those who need it most.  We will expand the provision of social housing.  To take the Deputy's point in the manner in which it was put, the review of the eligibility criteria and income limits is being done and is expected to be completed in the coming months.  The affordable housing eligibility and criteria fit into that and to what we will do with our social housing.</p> <p>  I thank Deputies Duffy, Higgins and McAuliffe for withdrawing their amendments while reserving the right to table them again on Report Stage.  It is up to other members how to proceed but I will not accept any of the amendments.</p></speech>

I wish to thank the members of the committee for their work and attention to detail.  It has been a useful and important debate.  While we have disagreed on aspects of it, there is a concerted view among all of us that we need to utilise State lands better for the good of our people and to make land that has been lying unproductive productive for one of the most basic requirements, namely, to provide homes for our people.  This has been a significant step forward.</p> <p>  I wish to thank the Chairman, the committee staff and my own team.  It is a different type of committee hearing.  We are all in different rooms and have to come to the committee room for votes.   However, I think the process has been most efficient.  That is down to the Chairman's stewardship of it.

I also remind members that they are only allowed to attend the meeting if they are physically present in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, any member who is participating by Teams would confirm that he or she is on the grounds of Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  The meeting has been convened to consider the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  </p> <p>  It was agreed at the private meeting of the committee on Tuesday that due to the clash with parliamentary questions on transport that are currently taking place in the D&aacute;il, I will be as flexible as possible in respect of the consideration of this Bill.  In that regard, if members who have submitted amendments are not present when the section arises, I propose that those sections will not be dealt with at the time but will be taken at the end of the Bill.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I also remind all members that should a vote be called, members must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.</p> <p>  We will now proceed with consideration of the Bill, to which 27 amendments have been tabled.  Does the Minister wish to speak on every section of the Bill or just on those sections that members have queried?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 2 provides that the IANS may describe itself as Air Nav Ireland or ANI, which will assist the company to develop its commercial branding into a strong, unique and recognisable identity.  The use of IANS, while suitable for the legislative provisions of the Bill, may not have a strong enough impact in the commercial world.  The Finnish air navigation service provider describes itself as Fintraffic, while in Denmark it is Naviair and in Norway it is Avinor.  Using Air Nav Ireland or ANI, as proposed, will support the new company in exploiting its commercial opportunities, while still retaining the official name of the company and its Irish form.</p></speech>

The intention of this amendment is to enhance the financial influence the State has over its commercial company.  While the IANS will be a fully commercial State company, transitioning from a commercial company with regulatory functions, it must also be aware of its continuing obligations to the State.  This amendment provides comfort, certainty and clarity to the company and the State in financial matters.  The provision may never be needed.  Indeed, I cannot think of any recent case where it may have been considered.  Providing this clarity will ensure that there is no uncertainty in the future when it comes to financial matters.  It is <i>[Interruptions]</i>, considering that we are forming a new company.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 7 seeks to strengthen the Irish aviation safety regulatory framework applied by the IAA concerning aviation activities of the Irish Coast Guard. These include search and rescue, medical transfer and firefighting.  These are currently regulated at national level.  This amendment will align the regulatory and oversight activities by the IAA with European aviation safety regulations.  </p><p>Amendment No. 18 provides that the Minister for Transport may make regulations to exercise the option of Regulation No. 2018/1139 on common rules in the field of civil aviation to apply certain elements of the European regulations to coastguards and search and rescue aviation activities.  Currently these activities are regulated by member states at a national level.  It is done in this State by the IAA.  </p><p>The main roles of the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, are to rescue people from danger at sea or on land, to organise immediate medical transport or to assist boats and ships within the State's jurisdiction.  The IRCG is responsible for a response to and co-ordination of maritime accidents which require search and rescue, counter-pollution and ship casualty operations.  It also has responsibility for vessels traffic monitoring.  The IRCG has contracts for five helicopters, which are provided at bases at Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo.  The main IRCG activities aviation activities include search and rescue to people, the service of paramedical assistance to persons in remote or difficult access situations and the transfer of persons for urgent medical attention within the island of Ireland to and from the UK mainland.  </p><p>Currently the European aviation safety regulations do not apply to aircraft and personnel in coast guard aviation activities.  IRCG aviation activities are regulated at national level by the Irish Aviation Authority in the form of an air operator's certificate and the national search and rescue approval.  The air operator's certificate allows an operator to perform specific operations of commercial air transport and the national search and rescue approval provides for remediation exemptions that are necessary to operate outside the requirements used to conduct commercial air transport without which some of the search and rescue operations would not be possible.  In practice, the IAA already applies commercial air transport standards and procedures to the majority of IRCG aviation activities.  These amendments formalise that and will serve to strengthen and clarify beyond doubt the regulation and the oversight by the IAA of aviation activities of the Irish Coast Guard.</p></speech>

By this restructuring the IAA will become a regulator without a commercial mandate.  As such, governance of the IAA will be more along the lines of the governance that now applies to the Commission for Aviation Regulation and not to a commercial company.  Nevertheless, as a company structure it must, of course, abide by the obligations under the Companies Act 2014.  That Act provide more flexibility to a single member company in respect of reporting and annual requirements.  While this amendment does not change the structure of the IAA, it does allow flexibility for the Minister for Finance to facilitate it becoming a single member company to avail of more suitable reporting and annual requirements.</p><p>Section 23 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act restricts the Minister for Finance in the transfer of his share except where required by the Companies Acts.  This amendment removes that restriction.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.1008" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021061700002#D02700"><p>I move amendment No. 20:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 57, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 9<br /><br />AMENDMENT OF AIR NAVIGATION AND TRANSPORT (AMENDMENT) ACT 1998</div><b>Amendment of section 13 of Act of 1998</b>  	<b>81.</b>Section 13 of the Act of 1998 is amended by&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (5): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(5) The aggregate at any one time of moneys borrowed under this section shall not exceed&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) in the case of daa and any of its subsidiaries, from the Dublin appointed day, &euro;5 billion, and<br /><br />(b) in the case of Cork Airport Authority and any of its subsidiaries, from the Cork appointed day, &euro;100 million.&rdquo;,  </blockquote> </blockquote>and<br /><br />(b) by the deletion of subsection (6).&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment sets the DAA's statutory borrowing ceiling at &euro;5 billion.  The DAA's current statutory borrowing limit is just &euro;2.2 billion.  The DAA funds its investment programme from its own resources and many of these programmes are financed by borrowing.  The DAA is subject to a statutory borrowing limit under the provisions of section 13 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998.  The DAA's development plans are conditional on it surviving the impacts of Covid-19 and positioning itself to recover both financially and strategically.  The delivery of a statutory mandate to operate, manage and develop both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport depends on the company having access to the necessary liquidity.  To date, the DAA's statutory borrowing limit has been amended by way of statutory instrument.  However, my Department has been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that legislation should be enacted to provide for a greater increase and to confirm the existing power over these limits.  Given that this ceiling is set in primary legislation, a limit of &euro;5 billion is considered appropriate as it needs to accommodate a relatively long timeframe.  Any further amendments to increase the limit will require primary legislation.  Importantly, and irrespective of the level of the statutory borrowing limit, the DAA is still required under legislation to obtain my consent and the consent of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and for Finance prior to entering into any new borrowing, even if such new borrowings are within the statutory borrowing limit.  Amendment No. 27 simply reflects these changes in the long title.</p></speech>

I support the amendment.  With regard to the implications, we are to have a national aviation strategy review and this committee has, in the past, looked at the possibility of a new governance structure for aviation to replace the DAA or Aer Rianta.  Would that proposal have implications for this legislation?  In the context of any proposals that might come out of a national aviation strategy review, would the legislation and its provisions be reviewed?</p></speech>

We are creating a framework for borrowing.  This ceiling was raised by way of statutory instrument in recent months to enable the DAA to get access to funding during the Covid-19 crisis.  No matter what it does, the DAA will always require the approval of the three Ministers, the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance, in respect of borrowing.  There are safeguards in that regard.</p></speech>

I have followed every minute of it.  In principle, I have no difficulty with a higher borrowing ceiling being permitted.  I have no issue but I have questions along the lines of those of Deputy O'Rourke's.  Does this higher borrowing ceiling reflect Shannon Airport coming back under the DAA umbrella again or under the umbrella of a new entity?  This provision only came to my attention in recent weeks.  I am going on a slight tangent but this cause of concern should be shared.  In trying to raise capital, IAG has set up bonds relating to its landing slots at Heathrow and other European hubs.  While I know the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, must insist on certain safety checks, when an entity wants to raise liquidity, it is very important that we know what type of assets are being leveraged to get capital loans of that kind.  I know landing slots do not necessarily belong to our country but I was certainly very concerned to see them used as loan collateral.  If IAG was to run into major financial trouble, certain key strategic landing slots for flights from Ireland to Britain and continental Europe could disappear overnight.  When Dublin Airport or any other aviation entity in Ireland is raising major liquidity, it is important that we know, to some extent, the kinds of collateral they are using to leverage this liquidity.  I have no difficulty with the amendment in principle.</p></speech>

This amendment enables the DAA to raise liquidity to manage and develop both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport.  With regard to safeguards, the DAA will be required to get the approval of the three Ministers.  The DAA has extensive plans.  We anticipate a return to growth in all of our airports and in the aviation industry.  As the Government, we will be monitoring that.  We have put in place significant supports for our airports and airlines through those horizontal measures.</p><p>We will continue to do that.  As the Deputy knows, aviation is currently in flux and, as a result, we are constantly ensuring we have the necessary supports in place.  That will not stop with this Bill.  We are just ensuring the DAA has access to that liquidity.</p></speech>

The number of political voices commenting on this matter has increased so is the Department thinking about it?  Is this solely dealing with the current constitution of DAA?</p></speech>

The Minister of State's comments on this amendment and section specifically reference the DAA.  What are the implications of this for Shannon Airport Authority?  What provision is made for a situation where that authority wants to raise liquidity?  Is it dealt with differently or is there a different provision?  Must it seek the permission of the Ministers Finance, Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform in the same way as the DAA?</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's question directly, Shannon Airport Authority would have to seek consent as well from those Ministers.  Shannon is different, I suppose, and although the DAA covers Dublin and Cork, rest assured that we want to protect the mid-west region as well, including Shannon.  We are acutely aware of that.  This does not have an impact on Shannon and it is specifically an issue for the Bill.  Shannon has sufficient borrowing capacity now and, as the Deputies know, we are in constant contact with Shannon Group.  We are looking at the future of the mid west and ensuring it has a viable future.  This has no impact on Shannon but it is just dealing with the statutory borrowing limit in primary legislation.  To answer the Deputy's question, consent is also required for Shannon.</p></speech>

I do not believe that has been fully been the case over the past 15 months.  Shannon is quite unique when compared with Dublin and Cork airports because, as the Minister of State knows well, it encompasses several entities.  There are heritage sites and Shannon Commercial Properties, etc.  One of the big problems in the past 15 months has been with the heritage sites under the umbrella of Shannon Heritage.  We were explicitly informed that there were potential liquidity issues arising in and around last summer.  There was a campaign undertaken by me, Deputy Carey and all the people in the mid west to have the sites reopened.  That was at a point when they may not have survived.</p> <p>  I suppose our concern is that in a normal trading year we worry about airports and what is landing.  The heritage sites tend to operate by themselves.  What became very apparent last year was that these sites are so intrinsically linked.  There were cash flow problems for the heritage sites and if they are in a stage of jeopardy or flux, does it have a knock-on effect for the airport?</p> <p>  Last year, we could establish that Shannon Group is not able to move capital from one of its entities to the other, which also gives rise to challenges.  Deputy Carey is right to ask the question and although we appreciate the answer, it does not reflect some of the challenges faced in the past year.  Liquidity was one of those that specifically relates to the heritage sites.  We have had separate debates about whether this should come under a different entity.  The reality is that element is still part of Shannon Group and if one entity is failing, it damages the others.  We must reflect on that as well.</p></speech>

Shannon is completely separate from the provisions of this amendment, however.  I assure the Deputies, from dealing with stakeholders in the region, of the importance of Shannon Group and the heritage sites.  I met a number of stakeholders on the ground on the future of Shannon Heritage.  We want to ensure that is viable, although we all recognise that a reduction in international travel has had a severe impact on those sites.  That has been recognised and support has been given over a wide range of areas.  That includes the employment wage subsidy scheme.  I am very cognisant of the questions relating to the Shannon heritage sites, Shannon Airport and the overall picture in the mid-west region.  That is a different debate but I assure Deputies that work is ongoing in that regard.  I am in constant contact with the different stakeholders.  The amendment has no impact on that.  I am working hard, and I know all the Oireachtas Members from the area are doing the same, for the mid-west region.  We want to ensure there is a viable future for those heritage sites.  I reassure members that this amendment does not affect that in any way.</p></speech>

Staff will have no less favourable terms and conditions on transfer.  This is explicitly referred to throughout the Bill.  The wording of section 110 provides this protection.  However, staff of the commission are split between members of the commission's own scheme and members of the single public service pension scheme.  The commission's own schemes are closed to new members and can transfer with the IAA replacing the commission to administer those schemes.  The members of the single public service pension scheme need a new arrangement.  The Bill does not specify this new arrangement.

I sought a reply from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it is always referred back to the Department of Transport.  Perhaps this amendment will give the Minister of State an opportunity to shed some light on that dispute and bring the committee up to speed about when to expect a resolution to be reached on this long-standing issue that has caused serious concern and grief for former employees of the IAA.</p></speech>

Two submissions have been made about section 41(7) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, which provides that a dispute about superannuation benefits may be submitted to the Minister for Transport for final determination by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are being considered in accordance with that statutory provision, as the Deputy highlighted.  The appeals process is ongoing so I am not in a position to be able to provide any more comment.</p></speech>

It is a long-standing issue.  I have been raising it for years.  In this D&aacute;il, I have tabled five or six parliamentary questions, which all get the same answer.  The Department has received two submissions and they are with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Parliamentary questions about it are automatically transferred from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform back to the Department of Transport.  It is like a merry-go-round.

The IAA has a major presence in County Clare.  Many of its workers and former workers are based in the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton's, constituency.  This superannuation dispute has been a long-running saga.  As Deputy Carey said, it does not seem to be any closer to being resolved.  A memorandum has issued from the Minister of State's Department to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it has been a long-running saga.  We are looking for both Departments and the IAA representative group to come before this committee to hear both sides of this.  That matter is still outstanding and having a memorandum between Departments pending action is probably holding everything up.</p> <p>  I join others in saying that this needs to be expedited.  The D&aacute;il will rise in five or six weeks.  My crude understanding of how things work is that a Department reports costs to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be accepted or refused, and if the report is refused, it needs to be revised and sent back again.  It is important to establish exactly where this is.  If this is something to be approved, we should get it approved and get things back to retired members.  We need an expeditious update on this.  It has gone on for too long.  I welcome the Minister of State coming back to us and thank her.</p></speech>

Where the particular class of licensed person is less than 50 then 50 per cent of their actual number by function shall suffice.  </blockquote>(4) The Licence Holders Forum shall also comprise such other representatives of stakeholders in aviation safety as determined jointly by the representative of the Irish Aviation Authority and those persons appointed pursuant to subsection 3. <br /><br />(5) The Licence Holders Forum shall adopt its own procedures including arrangements with respect to the promotion of candour and the treatment of confidential information. <br /><br />(6) The Irish Aviation Authority shall consult the Licence Holders Forum at least 28 days in advance in relation to the following&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) its proposal of a draft statement of strategy pursuant to section 29A.

I move amendment No. 8, which relates to a licence holders' forum.  There are regular Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, forums where the airlines and the IAA meet and where operational and other issues are discussed, but some of the unions that represent licence holders have been excluded.  This is a practice that cannot go on and this amendment would rectify that.  We are calling on this legislation to oblige both the IAA and the Irish air navigation service, IANS, to establish a stakeholders' forum to include the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, and the other unions representing other licence holders, which would meet every quarter to discuss and consult on relevant issues.  </p></speech>

The Minister of State is likely to have seen these amendments before.  She may have received them at short notice, but it would be interesting to hear back from her about the general thrust of them.  She will appreciate where they are coming from and what we are trying to achieve.  They are put forward in good faith.  The licence holders' charter would involve pilots and other licence holders.  Engineers and cabin crew are licensed by the IAA but have no mandated way of interacting with it.  That has implications.</p> <p>  IALPA is looking for a pilots' charter, and similar charters for engineers, cabin crew and operators etc., which would plainly set out the rights and responsibilities of each party and how they should interact with each other.  A pilots' charter is intended to make the relationship between the regulator and the individual pilot licence holder more explicit and protected under the new Act.  It would aim to ensure proper consultation on proposed new regulations, that queries are answered and there is a right of appeal on IAA decisions, particularly as they impinge on licence holders' exercising of their rights. </p></speech>

It would allow more voices in the room.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on it but, certainly, from what I have read of it, and in my deliberations with IALPA, I do not believe it materially changes the intent of the Bill.

I will come in after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.1066" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021061700002#G01500"><p>I thank the Deputies.  I certainly understand the intentions and the spirit of these amendments but I cannot accept amendments Nos. 8 or 9.  Amendment No. 8 proposes to establish a licence holders' forum in national legislation.  First, it must be borne in mind that regulations governing pilot licences, and commercial air transport and standards, are developed at EU level.  The process for developing EU regulation is transparent and it provides for input from all stakeholders.  Indeed, the basic regulation 2018/1129 specifically requires the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, to involve social partners and other stakeholders when consulting on EU regulations.  It is this EU-level focus that is the most effective means of influencing standards.</p> <p>  The IAA is the competent authority under many of these regulations.  It does consult and engage with stakeholders.  However, if the intention is to influence those standards, this amendment is not the way to do that.  The way to do it is engaging at EU level.  The IAA currently runs many different stakeholder events, often to address new or emerging issues.  For example, my Department and the IAA held a symposium in Dublin Castle on the introduction of the EU unmanned aircraft system operations regulation.  This involved both airlines and employee representative bodies.  Other events can be targeted to a specific group, such as airport safety managers, to focus on specific topics.  </p> <p>  The forum structures and stakeholders at these events need to be responsive to the particular issues that are being addressed.  Once the new single aviation regulator is established, I expect and will ensure that this engagement will only develop further, in a collaborative way, and will involve the most comprehensive and effective stakeholders.  I expect communication will be improved with licence holders and the engagement will be responsive and follow good practice.  We will have a new board and chairperson all dedicated to open, transparent decision-making.  </p> <p>  This is not a question of stakeholder engagement being useful or not.  It is just a question of the most suited form of that engagement.  That is where I understand the spirit of these amendments.  To place this forum in national legislation would, in my opinion, lead to an inflexible and ineffective form of engagement, which would not contribute to a collaborative approach to regulation.  Instead, it would place a formal, rigid and unresponsive structure in place at national level.  In particular, the amendment fixes in primary legislation the forum's membership, participants, meetings, matters it considers and communication from the IAA.  I question whether that is where we want the new regulator to dedicate its resources.  We should just be mindful of that.  </p> <p>  I consulted the IAA to highlight the concerns raised on stakeholder engagement, which this amendment is trying to address.  I am conscious there is a perception that some stakeholders are not receiving an equal hearing.  I have been assured that as the new regulator is embedded, there will be a renewed emphasis on broad and inclusive stakeholder engagement.</p><p>Such a forum for all licence holders will be on its agenda.</p><p> On amendment No. 9, which proposes the establishment of a licence holders charter in primary national legislation, it is important to note that licences for commercial aviation are issued in accordance with EU regulations.  The rights, obligations and privileges of individual licence holders derive from these EU regulations.  The European Aviation Safety Agency published these regulations and associated guidance materials.  I understand that the published consolidated document for air crew licences runs to over 1,700 pages.  Interpretation is driven by this material and if any stakeholder can seek clarity from the European agency directly.</p><p> On the amendment on a forum, the level at which we legislate is very important.  If the intention is that the licensing system is operated in an integrated and transparent manner, the focus should be on a pan-European approach, not on primary national legislation.</p><p> I support the principle of open, transparent communication.  However, the prescriptive roles and procedures set out in this amendment are not suited to that aim, nor are they the most effective way to bring it about.  A particular issue of this amendment is that it requires formal written guidance but not from the body that develops the guidance.</p><p> I understand the desire to have a written charter setting out an understanding for all partners to consult.  Such a charter would provide clarity to all stakeholders.  The IAA has this with its customer charter.  That is set out clearly and is available on its website.  I have been assured by the IAA that it is committed to consulting stakeholders, including licence holders, on strategy in the coming months.  This consultation will include plans for future engagements with licence holders.  While I support the engagement of stakeholders, it is a different matter to prescribe such engagement in national legislation.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</p><p> I appreciate the intention of these amendments.  I am not in favour of setting a legal obligation to establish such a forum or charter within primary national legislation.  This would not provide the flexibility to effectively manage consultation and stakeholder engagement.  However, I will ask my officials to follow up and engage with the IAA to ensure that other forms of effective engagement can be progressed and implemented.  I hope that explains the reasons I cannot accept these amendments.</p></speech>

Would she be open to further engagement before Report Stage?  It sounds like she is open to what we are trying to achieve, at least in spirit.  She may view the proposal as a bit rigid.  If there was a way she and I could meet while this legislation is being debated and before it is finalised, I would appreciate it as it would improve the current position.  I will leave it at that.  The Minister of State might engage with us before Report Stage.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State's response.  The amendments are born out of a reality that does not reflect some of what she said regarding the opportunity for stakeholder engagement.  While the Minister of State is offering the opinion that the proposals are too rigid, there needs to be some sort of accommodation to improve the current state of affairs in which important stakeholders feel excluded from a number of important forums.  I also appreciate the Minister of State's commitment to follow up with the IAA, it is important to engage with other stakeholders, including Deputies, in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

However, she accepted that there are stakeholders that feel left out of forums.  I agree with previous speakers on the need for the Minister of State to meet us in the middle to find a solution.  It is all well and good going back to the IAA but there needs to be some sort of structure, shape and timeline for stakeholder engagement and a facility to ensure that also happens at a European level.  There will need to be further engagement without us to find a solution that works for everybody.</p></speech>

(1)The Irish Aviation Authority shall periodically review the crew peer support programmes provided by the holders of air carrier licences or otherwise made available by them to crew pursuant to the requirements of CAT.GEN.MPA. 215 to Annex IV (Part &ndash; CAT) of Regulation (EU) No. 965/2012. <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(2) A comprehensive review of each such support programme shall be conducted by the Irish Aviation Authority at least every three years and no more frequently than at one year<br /><br />intervals, in respect of which it shall consider the following&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) the nature of the programme having regard to the size and diversity of the air carrier in question,<br /><br />(b) the ability of the programme to provide access to the requisite range of expert supports,<br /><br />(c) the accessibility of such a programme including encouragement as to its use and the freedom of crew to access an alternative crew peer support programme to meet their personal needs,<br /><br />(d) the adequacy of confidentiality arrangements,<br /><br />(e) the involvement of crew representatives and recognised stakeholder groups in establishing and supporting the programme,<br /><br />(f) the selection and training of peers, and their independence from any conflicting management or supervisory functions within the Air Operator&rsquo;s Certificate holder or otherwise,<br /><br />(g) the provision of adequate resources to the programme,<br /><br />(h) the provision of mental health professionals to support peers when required by programme users, and<br /><br />(i) the accessibility of programmes services and support by online and other electronic means. </blockquote>(3) In conducting these comprehensive reviews, the Irish Aviation Authority shall seek feedback from users of the programme to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with maintaining strict confidentiality concerning the identity of crew and their personal circumstances.<br /><br />(4) In the event of any deficiency in a crew peer support programme being found during a comprehensive review, the Irish Aviation Authority may direct changes to any such programme, which shall be binding. That shall be without prejudice to the ability to the Irish Aviation Authority&rsquo;s power to direct changes in respect of deficiencies other than those identified during a periodic comprehensive review.<br /><br />(5) The Irish Aviation Authority shall convene the Crew Peer Support National Forum which shall be chaired by the Irish Aviation Authority&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer and include representatives of: <blockquote> 	(a) the air carriers that it regulates and any persons engaged in the provision of support services to them or on their behalf;<br /><br />(b) pilot associations and other recognised stakeholder groups and any persons from those associations engaged in the provision of support services to them or on their behalf. </blockquote>(6) The Crew Peer Support National Forum, which shall receive secretariat services from the Irish Aviation Authority, has the following functions&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) the sharing of best practice on crew peer support programmes,<br /><br />(b) encouraging the implementation of cooperation and joint resource sharing between different crew peer support programmes,<br /><br />(c) the development of a common (anonymised) data base to identify trends and to monitor the effectiveness of crew peer support programmes,<br /><br />(d) making recommendations to the Irish Aviation Authority as to the requirements of crew peer support programmes, and<br /><br />(e) creating or encouraging the provision of a national crew peer support programme under a separate structure, whether through co-operation between programmes, or by other means, and to be accessible&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) by all crew irrespective of their employer,<br /><br />(ii) by crew not willing to use the programme made available by their employer for personal confidentiality or other reasons, and<br /><br />(iii) to crew who are out of work.&quot;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>The amendment is also in the name of Deputy O'Rourke who, I am sure, would like to speak to it as well.</p><p>This amendment is more from the heart than the head.  It proposes to establish a standardised peer-to-peer support programme for the industry.  A number of incidents have motivated it but the most high-profile tragedy was the Germanwings crash of 2015.  It is recognised that pilots need to be provided with support programmes to deal with personal and mental health issues.  This should be done in a way that does not necessarily impact on licensing.  I ask that this be considered.</p><p>Aer Lingus has a good programme.  Other airlines have varying programmes at different levels.  We need a standardised peer support programme across the industry.  We believe we could be a leader in this and it is something that should be brought in.</p></speech>

I also took from the conversation that there are schemes in place but they vary and, in some instances, are little more than box-ticking exercises that do not really grasp the issue at hand.  A comparison was made between the employee assistance programme and the need for peer support together with the opportunity that might be afforded to suspend a licence temporarily without any assumptions being made in relation to it.  A comparison was made on the nature and extent of the schemes in place for smaller companies against an appreciation of the cultural differences between companies, including internationally.</p> <p>  The important piece regarding confidentiality is that it should be peer to peer but with a degree of removal.  That point was made about smaller companies in particular.  If the schemes were in-house, they did not provide for the type of confidentiality that is needed.  The representatives pointed to the challenges of Covid and the implications it has had for people.  They mentioned issues like sexuality that, again, can be difficult for people to contend with and to share with people they are working with daily in a very closed setting.  That is where this amendment comes from.  From listening in an open way to the representatives, there is, at the very least, significant room for improvement on the regime in place at the minute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-17a.1090" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2021061700002#J00300"><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 10.  This amendment relates to a crew peer support programme.  Peer support programmes are governed by EU legislation, mainly Regulation No. 2018/1042.  This regulation introduced new requirements for support programmes that require operators to enable, facilitate and ensure access to a proactive and non-punitive support programme that will assist and support flight crew in recognising, coping with and overcoming any problem that might negatively affect their ability to exercise the privileges of their licences safely.  Such access shall be made available to all flight crews.  These requirements came into effect in February this year.  I understand the European Aviation Safety Agency will review their effectiveness next year.  Our Department and the IAA will be feeding into that and will be consulting industry about that review.  This is an important safety issue; of that there is no doubt.  A proactive and non-punitive support programme will benefit the aviation industry, crews and the public, which is why I strongly support action in this area.  However, the place for that action is primarily at EU level as it is an area of EU competence.</p> <p>  The IAA is already the competent authority in respect of this EU regulation and already ensures every operator is compliant with it.  The amendment proposes a further national level requirement that includes national reviews and a single national forum.  It prescribes the timings, areas covered by the review, actions the IAA will take and the establishment of a national forum and its functions.  The IAA is operating within a larger, integrated, single European civil aviation system.  Replacing this programme and forum at a national level in primary legislation does not address it as a pan-European requirement.  If the programme needs a review or engagement needs to be strengthened, that should be done at European level with a focus on the European Aviation Safety Agency with the EU making programmes that can be developed there.  This should help to ensure a pan-European approach can be taken.</p> <p>  In addition, the EU-level approach will avoid conflict between Irish national requirements and the EU area of regulatory competency, or for applying a non-level playing field to Irish industry.  It is my view that primary legislation is not suited to a hard code or a forum structure of rules and procedures in an area where the competence is at European level.  That is the reason I cannot support this amendment but, again, I understand the intent of it.</p></speech>

It would be helpful for the Minister of State and her Department to hear from IALPA on these issues.  I know there is some engagement, but no one is better able to articulate these issues than the people who have lived them.  That is also important between Committee and Report Stages.</p></speech>

They put these issues forward to the Department but I do not think they have received replies.  The Department got these amendments at quite short notice.  This legislation will not be enacted today.  It is very important the Minister of State, with her officials, facilitate a meeting with Evan Cullen of IALPA and his team.  I have heard warm tones in the Minister of State's response and she gets exactly where IALPA members are coming from.  While she might not accept the amendment as worded in its entirety, there is some scope here.  As Deputy O'Rourke stated, I ask that, between now and the next Stage, the Minister of State would engage and see where some of IALPA's concerns could be accommodated.</p></speech>

We all accept there are new levels of maturity in how mental health is dealt with, including peer support programmes and, particularly, the requirement for confidentiality so people feel free to deal with the issue.  If this is going to be dealt with under an EASA review, there are two things to consider.  I agree with Deputy Crowe and Deputy O'Rourke, in particular, on the need to engage with IALPA and, beyond that, to facilitate IALPA to engage with this EASA review.  It is obviously vital that they and other stakeholders across Europe have their voices heard on what they require, which they will know given they are the people who are operating in the field.</p></speech>

(1) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with air carrier operating licence obligations (which is deemed for these purposes to include an air operator certificate) and compliance with any other <br /><br />obligation of any air carrier the Irish Aviation Authority may cause such investigation as it thinks fit to be carried out. <br /><br />(2) The Irish Aviation Authority may, for the purposes of subsection (1), direct one or more authorised officers&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) to carry out the investigation, and <br /><br />(b) to submit to the Irish Aviation Authority an investigation report following the completion of the investigation.  </blockquote>(3) The Irish Aviation Authority may define the scope and terms of the investigation to be carried out, whether as respects the matters or the period to which it is to extend or otherwise, and may, in particular, limit the investigation to matters connected with particular circumstances. <br /><br />(4) Where more than one authorised officer has been directed to carry out an investigation, the investigation report shall be prepared jointly by the authorised officers so directed and this section and sections 63H to 63J shall, with all necessary modifications, be construed accordingly.

 <blockquote> 	(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement,<br /><br />(b) whether it occurred negligently or intentionally,<br /><br />(c) the degree to which the infringement endangered public safety,<br /><br />(d) any relevant previous infringements by the air carrier, and<br /><br />(e) the principle of proportionality  </blockquote>(5) The Irish Aviation Authority, as soon as practicable after&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) a decision to impose an administrative fine is confirmed under section 63L(3)(a) or <br /><br />(b) the court decides, under section 63L(3)(b), to impose a different fine, </blockquote>shall give the air carrier concerned a notice in writing, requiring the air carrier to pay the amount of the fine concerned to the Irish Aviation Authority within the period of 28 days commencing on the date of the notice. <br /><br />(6) An air carrier shall comply with a requirement referred to in subsection (5).<br /><br />(7) All payments received by the Irish Aviation Authority under this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct. <br /><br />(8) In this section and section 63L a reference to a decision to impose an administrative fine shall be construed as a reference to a decision by the Irish Aviation Authority to impose such a fine. <br /><br /><b>Appeal against administrative fine </b><br /><br /><b>63L.</b>(1) An air carrier that is the subject of a decision to impose an administrative fine may, within 28 days from the date on which notice of the decision concerned was given to it under section 63K(5) appeal to the court against the decision. <br /><br />(2) The court, on hearing an appeal under subsection (1), may consider any evidence adduced or argument made by the air carrier, whether or not already adduced or made to an authorised officer or the Irish Aviation Authority. <br /><br />(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the court may, on the hearing of an appeal under subsection (1)&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) confirm the decision the subject of the appeal, <br /><br />(b) replace the decision with such other decision as the court considers just and appropriate, including a decision to impose a different fine or no fine, or <br /><br />(c) annul the decision.  </blockquote>(4) The court shall, for the purposes of subsection (3), take into account the matters set out in section 63K(4). <br /><br />(5) In this section, &ldquo;court&rdquo; means&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) the Circuit Court, where the amount of the administrative fine the subject of the appeal does not exceed &euro;75,000, or <br /><br />(b) in any other case, the High Court.  </blockquote><b>Circuit Court to confirm decision to impose administrative fine </b><br /><br /><b>63M</b>. (1) Where an air carrier does not appeal in accordance with 63L(1) against 15 a decision by the Irish Aviation Authority to impose an administrative fine on the air carrier, the Irish Aviation Authority shall, as soon as is practicable after the expiration of the period referred to in that subsection, and on notice to the air carrier concerned, make an application in a summary manner to the Circuit Court for confirmation of the decision. <br /><br />(2) The Circuit Court shall, on the hearing of an application under subsection (1), confirm the decision the subject of the application unless the Court sees good reason not to do so.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote><p>I commend the people who put the amendment together on the level of detail.  This deals with the issue of graduated sanctions.  At present, and as proposed in the Bill, the IAA is limited to one sanction for entities, airlines, maintenance organisations, airports, flying schools and licenceholders not in compliance with regulations.  This is the removal of the licence or permit.  Not surprisingly, this means the IAA could be reluctant to impose such a drastic sanction, which is problematic in terms of effectively regulating the behaviour of those entities that come under the authority's remit.  It is argued that the IAA needs to be able to apply graduated sanctions in addition to the ultimate sanction of removing a licence or permit, and the lack of such graduated sanctions weakens the IAA's effectiveness.  People will appreciate the concept of graduated sanctions and the ability to influence the behaviour of organisations.  There is a comparator.  The banking regulator, the Central Bank, has the ability to apply graduated penalties and routinely does so as part of its regulatory activities.  The inclusion of this section, which would permit investigations and allow for the application of graduated sanctions if wrongdoing were found, would be an important regulatory development in the sector.</p></speech>

I cannot accept amendment No. 17 and the related amendments Nos. 19 and 25.  However, I agree with the sentiment.  The ultimate sanction of losing a licence should not be the only sanction available to the regulator.  Sanctions must be effective and proportionate.  I recognise that having a single sanction only may weaken the IAA's response to issues.  Withdrawal of a licence, approval or certification, which is available at present, can have a significant impact on an individual's livelihood or a significant financial impact on a commercial operation.  This is why I agree wholeheartedly with the intentions of the amendment.  I have examined the detail of the amendment and must commend the Deputies on their efforts.  It is very extensive and includes a detailed system of administrative fines, including investigations, reporting, decisions, appeals and ultimate recourse to the courts.</p> <p>  I bring to the attention of the Deputies that the provisions are already provided for in the Bill.  Fixed charge offences are provided for in section 72.  Summary offences may be declared by the Minister for Transport by means of regulations made by the Minister.  The Minister may prescribe the amount of each fixed charge and may prescribe different amounts for different fixed charge offences and for different classes of aircraft.</p> <p>  Section 72 was drafted specifically with the intention of addressing the lacuna in enforcement identified by having this single action.  While the detail of the penalties will be left for regulation, I suggest that the Bill as initiated will achieve the same aim as the proposed amendment without the need to prescribe full sanctions in the system.  I suggest this is the most effective and efficient implementation that meets the aim of the proposed amendment.  We are already making provision for the tools for a graduated response within the Bill.</p></speech>
