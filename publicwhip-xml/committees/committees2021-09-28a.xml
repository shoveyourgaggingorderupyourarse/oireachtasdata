No apologies have been received.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is attending remotely.</p> <p>  As we return to participate in committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility and to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending and to adopt good hygiene practices.  Those in attendance should always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after meetings.  Masks should be worn at all times during meetings except when speaking.  I ask for co-operation with the guidelines.</p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  The business before us today is as follows: minutes; accounts and statements; correspondence; work programme; and any other business.  Before we proceed, I propose that we reserve 20 minutes at the end of the meeting to go into private session to deal with sensitive correspondence and housekeeping matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The first business is the minutes of the meetings of the 16, 21 and 23 September.  They have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters in relation to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The next business is the four sets of accounts and financial statements that were laid before the D&aacute;il between 20 September and 24 September.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address the accounts and statements before opening the discussion to the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#A00400"><p>The accounts that have been presented are from the Property Services Regulatory Authority for 2020.  That is a clear audit opinion.  The next accounts are from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and are also from 2020.  Again, there is a clear audit opinion.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority got a clear audit opinion for 2020 but I draw attention to a number of items.  First, an organisational capability review report issued in April 2020, which was commissioned by the authority.</p><p>The review found a number of recommendations relating to inadequacies in data management, data analytics capability, IT capability and industrial relations capability.  If members would like to read more about that, we have put a link into the document that is before the committee in pdf format, in order that they can go straight to that in the financial statements if they wish.</p><p> The second item relates to the results of a European Commission audit that identified significant shortcomings in the weighing and reporting of pelagic fish landings and the lack of controls and enforcement over catches of bluefin tuna.  This issue has been going on for a number of years.  Further work is required to address the weaknesses that they found.  </p><p> Finally, note 8 to the financial statement discloses that salary overpayments of &euro;861,000 have been written off.  Members can also read more about that by using the link.</p><p> The final set of financial statements presented is for Teagasc 2020.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Do any members wish to ask questions or comment on the financial statements?  I call Deputy McAuliffe.</p></speech>

It could relate to a small error in this case but it is substantial.  Has the Comptroller and Auditor General any view on that specifically?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#B00400"><p>It goes back quite a number of years and relates to the application of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts.  Initially the advice that the organisation received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was that certain allowances were not to be included in the cuts and subsequently it was determined that they should have been included in the cuts but in the meantime, the staff had continued to receive salaries at the higher level.  This matter has been to and fro between the organisation and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over a number of years.  At one point - and this is why they recognised a debtor - they were going to recover the payments from the staff but then it was determined after industrial relations negotiations that it would not be recovered.  Technically they have to write off the debt that they had previously recognised, so it is quite messy.  However, at the end of the day, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has decided that collection is not required.</p></speech>

We can certainly obtain that information.  The payment persisted for perhaps three years before it was determined that it was an overpayment and it stopped.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#B00900"><p>My first question was answered by Mr. McCarthy in his last remark.  Does Mr. McCarthy reckon it was three years that these payments were made for?</p></speech>

Can I take it that this was uniform across the agency or the authority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#B01200"><p>Yes, it was a general misinterpretation.  There is no question of it being applied to certain staff members but not to others who were on the same allowance.  It was a misinterpretation at a whole-of-agency level.  Anybody who was getting the allowance continued to get it without interruption.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#B01300"><p>Mr. McCarthy references an April 2020 review which made a number of recommendations regarding data management inadequacies, data analytics capability, IT capability and industrial relations capability.</p><p>Is Mr. McCarthy satisfied that the review is being implemented?  Can he make a comment on that?</p></speech>

It was obviously a very comprehensive review for it.  I do not have the detail.  There were quite a lot of recommendations, 46 in total.  It has a plan of implementation.</p></speech>

I am happy.</p></speech>

As usual, we will request an explanation for any significant non-compliant procurement over &euro;500,000 or delays in laying the accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  We will move on to No. 3, correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that are not flagged for discussion in this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in regard to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee's web page.  We held over a number of items from last week and will address those first.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged matters for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The first item is No. 751 from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the OPW, dated 4 August 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding the ongoing discussions between the OPW and the landlord of Miesian Plaza which is now the headquarters of the Department of Health.  It concerns the OPW's failure to address the mismeasurement of floor space in the contract for the lease of Miesian Plaza, which was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is expected to cost the taxpayer about &euro;10 million during the lifetime of the lease.  The OPW has been in negotiations with the landlord since 2018.  Previous correspondence from the OPW, No. 667B, stated that a meeting took place on 3 June, but no further information was supplied other than to say that both parties are committed to continuing the process.  </p> <p>  We agreed to request the agenda of the meeting referred to in the correspondence, the minutes and details of the matters discussed, including the outcome of the meeting, and the agenda for the next meeting and when it is scheduled to take place.  In response, the OPW stated that it is intended to meet the landlord again in August and the only matter for discussion was "The resolution of the measurements issue", but that the discussions are sensitive and all meetings are held on a confidential basis and without prejudice.  The OPW states that it will keep the committee informed of progress and we requested quarterly updates on this matter in a report on our engagement with the OPW.  It is proposed to note and flag that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputies Imelda Munster and Catherine Murphy flagged this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#C00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  That correspondence is now a couple of months old.  I heard what the Chair said at the end of his contribution.  I was about to suggest that we write requesting an update and see what progress had been made.  The OPW is giving us quarterly reports.  If we want to chase this specifically, we could write to it again for an update.</p></speech>

We need to make sure we do not go beyond that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#C00800"><p>Okay.  It mentioned in previous correspondence that it would not have a physical meeting.  It will now be able to meet face-to-face and it is to be hoped that will bring about better results in terms of resolving this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#C00900"><p>We all know that the only item on the agenda is the measurements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#C01000"><p>Absolutely.  Measurements and pounds, shillings and pence.  I thank the Deputies.</p> <p>  No. 753 from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 30 July, encloses the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to the committee's report on the examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister responds to the recommendations in all of the committee's reports.  In this case, we made five recommendations, two of which were accepted, one of which was partly accepted and two of which were not accepted.</p><p>Those accepted relate to a breakdown of individual taxes within the excise duty category in Revenue&rsquo;s accounts, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and tackling bogus self-employment.</p><p> The first recommendation not accepted concerns a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, and this committee&rsquo;s request for an independent investigation into the financial and sectoral implications of that agreement.  Revenue states that the matter was discussed by the Committee of Public Accounts in 2000, that Revenue does not have the powers to set up and commission an independent investigation and there is no legal basis for it to do so.</p><p> The second concerns a 2019 EU Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  We requested a copy of the report and Revenue&rsquo;s reply.  Revenue states that the audit has not been completed and that it does not have a timeframe for its completion.  I suggest that we follow this up to request a copy of the material requested once the audit is completed and that we note and publish this correspondence.  Is it agreed that we will follow up on looking for the audit report and that we will publish the correspondence?  Agreed.  I have flagged up this item for discussion, as did Deputies Catherine Murphy, Carthy and Munster.  We call for a report on that in one of the five recommendations made.  Basically, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is saying that it does not have the power to set up such an investigation.  Some could take this as a refusal.  The amount of money being lost is an important issue.  That sector has exploded with online shopping and fast food delivery and so on over the past decade.  There could be a very big loss there for the public purse.  I suggest that we will write back to them and ask them what they can commission.  I certainly would not be happy, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, to have a situation where there are potentially tens of millions of euro, or more, that should be going into the PRSI pension fund and which the State and the taxpayer is losing out on.  I suggest that we would do that.  I will now bring in the other Deputies who also had flagged this very important issue for the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#D00200"><p>It is indeed and it is not just the State that would be the big loser here.  It also affects the individual employees when they come to require pensions and welfare payments.  There is a very different status.  We saw this very clearly with the case of RT&Eacute;.  It is a potential loss but it is also very precarious employment.</p> <p>  I believe that social welfare or social protection is another avenue here.  I could be wrong but if I remember correctly, I read recently that they declined to do a piece of work on this.  This is an area we should look at because it really is there, where the determination in the scope section occurs, that is the origin of the issue.  We should certainly consider that avenue as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092800002#D00300"><p>I fully support the Chairman's proposal.  We may have given Revenue an avenue out by being prescriptive in terms of requesting that they commission an independent investigation.  I am very disappointed, however, that Revenue has said that it does not have the powers to set up such a commission and that there is no legal basis for them to do so.  They are not offering a proposal to do anything.  As has been rightly said, this has potentially serious long-term implications for workers' social protection entitlements.  In the short term, there is also a very different obligation on an employer with employees, as opposed to an employer with people who are defined as being self-employed in the context of day-to-day entitlements for employees such as sick leave, the protections that are in place and even the requirements with regard to the minimum wage.</p><p>This is a hugely important issue and it is going to become more acute over the coming period.  I therefore agree with the Chairman's proposal that we write back to Revenue asking what precisely it intends to do to carry out an analysis of the level of revenue that has been lost to the State, the number of workers impacted and the financial cost and implications for said workers.  It is crucially important that Revenue assess that.  This is a decision it made as a result of a social welfare appeal hearing many years ago.  It must not be dropped because there are potential knock-on implications for workers in many other sectors.</p></speech>

Are there any plans to do similar reports on other areas of Covid-related spending?</p></speech>

That is the additional piece of work I am doing.  We commenced a piece of work around HSE procurement of PPE but because the HSE had already commissioned KPMG to do a piece of work looking at the procurement processes and so on, I decided not to proceed with that examination pending the receipt of the KPMG work.  It is actually quite a good piece of work.  There are lessons to be learned there in relation to procurement, so I would not propose doing additional work at this stage on PPE procurement.</p> <p>  On the report I will be publishing on Thursday, a number of chapters in it deal with the expenditure as a result of Covid-19 but it is more to do with schemes than with procurement.  For example, I have chapters on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  I also have a chapter giving an overview of where the expenditure was as a result of Covid restrictions in the first year of their operation.</p></speech>

Revenue concurred in its response.  I highlighted this when reading the response.  It states: &quot;We intend to conduct standalone and multi-agency site visits as part of our 2022 compliance programme, cognisant of the recommendation of the Committee in relation to the number of site visits, subject to the prevailing pandemic restrictions&quot;.  It goes on.  That is positive in that we recommended a minimum of 4,000 visits per annum across all employment sectors.  It is welcome that Revenue has concurred with us on doing that.  I propose that we write to Revenue asking if it can do an examination or review if it cannot carry out an independent investigation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 755B from Ms Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, is dated 29 July 2021.  It is a delayed response to our letter of 29 April.  CHI attributes the delay to the HSE cyberattack.  CHI provided information to the committee in February regarding non-compliant procurement and we then wrote to CHI on 29 April requesting answers to four questions.  The first was requesting further details and the rationale for expenditure of &euro;121,000 on the <i>chi.jobs</i>website and &euro;83,000 on public relations.</p><p>The second question was whether consideration was given to obtaining public relations, PR, expertise from within the public service.  The third question was what is the proportion of PR expenditure used for preparing CHI staff for appearances before Oireachtas committees.  CHI stated that it is a small proportion but did not provide a figure.  Lastly, we sought an information note regarding job retention across the three children's hospital sites.  Generally, detailed responses have been provided to the questions.  It is proposed that we note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Matt Carthy has flagged this item for discussion. </p></speech>

We have had particular discussions around Irish Water and its grid.  Irish Water springs to mind where one has statutory bodies that have no competitors spending tens of thousands of euro, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of euro, on PR exercises.</p> <p>  I see that Children's Health Ireland has referenced a public information campaign, which was rolled out in an integrated manner and launched by the CHI at the Connolly Hospital.  All of that is very laudable but at some point there needs to be an analysis done on whether there is a better streamlined mechanism of arranging and managing PR because if every statutory body, Government Department and semi-State spends huge sums on public relations then there must be an argument for a more efficient way of doing things.  I would appreciate if we could mark a note for our work programme to see if there is a mechanism, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or another appropriate Department, to analyse whether public savings can be made across all of these bodies.</p></speech>

We note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 761 from Ms Marie-Claire Maney, Chairperson, Tax Appeals Commission, dated 10 August 2021 providing information requested by the committee.  Members will recall our meeting with the commission on 8 July and this correspondence arises from that meeting.  It includes the following detailed information: the previous case management system that was written off; appeals before the commission that are stated for the opinion of the High Court; case management conferences; appeals being dealt with by the commission that were initiated by the Criminal Assets Bureau; and confirmation that the commission has implemented the committee's last recommendations to it.  I propose that we note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Matt Carthy wish to discuss the correspondence.</p></speech>

I think we were quite impressed with them when they came in as they were quite forthright.  The tables certainly demonstrate that a lot of work has been done to deal with outstanding cases.  At this stage the caseload looks manageable, which is useful.  In July, for example, the commission told us that 78 appeals were on hand relating to assessments by the Criminal Assets Bureau with the highest one valued at &euro;22.5 million and the lowest one at &euro;2,000.  That just shows the kind of money that can be at the centre of this work.  I find the information that the commission gave us to be very useful and it certainly backs up what they said when they were in with us.</p></speech>

There was a High Court decision issued on that on 20 December 2019.</p><p>That matter has been in open court.  The determination which was enclosed with the case stated that the quantum under appeal for unpaid PRSI was &euro;40,000 as per Revenue's estimation of the due account.

It is extraordinary that they were using their own phones, insurance cover and so on.  It is worth reading just to get a flavour of it because I think more and more we are going to be looking at the issue of precarious employment.

It relates to the DART underground project, on which &euro;45 million had already been spent when a Government decision was taken in 2015 not to proceed with it and to look for lower cost solutions.  Another &euro;1 million has since been spent.  The current position is that in January 2021, the National Transport Authority commenced the preparation of a route alignment options and feasibility study to establish a DART tunnel route.  It was intended that it would form part of the integrated public transport network and meet the long-term passenger demand in Dublin city centre.  The Department anticipates that the study will be concluded in the third quarter of this year.  I propose that the committee request a copy of it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The committee also asked the Department to provide details of State investment in the current Irish Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter service, and whether the State will own the helicopters.  The response provides details in relation to the operation of the contract and clarifies that the State does not own the helicopters.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. </p></speech>

We see this every time there is a big infrastructural project in terms of the impact on particular businesses.  In some cases, it can wipe them out.  I propose that the committee write to the Department of Transport to request a note on how it plans to deal with individual homeowners and businesses that will be affected by the project.</p></speech>

This project is the game changer.  I recall Barry Kenny making the point that if it came online, it would ensure there would be up to 100 million journeys per annum.  It is the kind of project that requires to be done if are to get to grips with the transport element of our climate obligation.  It is an expensive project, but it has a lifespan.  We need to make sure that in terms of the work already done money is not wasted.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am not getting into individual events.  The Secretary General's letter does describe many of the events.  I do not have a view on the quality of what was done or the impact of it but I do welcome the fact that the Department is undertaking an exercise to try to establish what the impact has been and whether it has been a success from that point of view.  Again, there will be further information in relation to Galway 2020 in the report on Thursday and it may be something the committee would wish to examine further.</p></speech>

I propose to note and publish the aforementioned correspondence and hopefully the evaluation that is under way will shed some further light on the matter.</p><p>No. 782B is from<b></b>Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 11 August 2021 providing information requested by the committee relating to the national broadband plan, NBP.  The Secretary General sets out progress on the project and states that &quot;Momentum is building on the project and as of 30 July over 12,000 premises are passed and available for connection; this compares to the 4,000 referenced in my letter of 7 July.&quot;  According to the correspondence, a further 8,000 premises have been passed and are ready for connection, although not connected yet.  Information in also provided on the use of existing infrastructure.</p><p>Regarding penalty clauses, the correspondence sets out the nature of the contract and its provisions for dealing with delays.  In terms of unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the contractor can seek additional time to meet contract milestones and, in those circumstances, no penalties apply.  In other circumstances, the contract provides that penalty provisions relating to delays to delivery of the network apply to any delays that occur from the end of contract year two, which will be 1 February 2022.  Should the contractor miss milestones from that date, penalties will apply for the duration of the build period.  Therefore, no penalties are applicable to the current delays.  It is proposed that we note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Last week, we agreed to engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on 14 October and we will request an up-to-date briefing on the contract in advance of that meeting.  I am flagging this correspondence because this is a major issue given the size of the capital project involved.  While the response sets out that the Department can withhold payment, it does not set out penalties as they were described to me and to others in the D&aacute;il Chamber prior to the contract being signed.  In the section of the correspondence that refers to penalty clauses in the contract, the Secretary General writes that subsidies will only be released on achievement of the contract milestones.  In other words, the contractor will only get paid for the work that is done but the clear commitment at that time, as I recall it and which is on the record of the D&aacute;il, was that there would actually be specific penalties.</p><p>In his reply on that section he went on to state that the contract makes provisions for dealing with delays in the delivery of the network arising from unprecedented events such as Covid-19 and that NBI can seek additional time and no penalties would apply.  He said the penalty provisions relating to delays in the delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of year 2 of the contract.  There should not have been a big delay because work on telecommunications were operational throughout the Covid period, as I recall.  I am open to correction on this from other committee members.  There was no suspension of work on communications works during that period.  The first paragraph of his reply dealing with the penalty clauses in the contract is of concern to me. </p><p> In his reply he said reporting on costs and revenues to the Department would subsequently be released only on achievement of the contract milestones which are verified through an independent certification process.  This means that NBI is only paid a subsidy when the milestones have been met and verified.  There is clearly no penalty.  That was confirmed by the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  NBI will come before the committee on 14 October and it is essential that we raise these matters with it.  This process could drag on for a considerable period of time.  Deputy Murphy wished to raise this as well.</p></speech>

I remember that debate very clearly because we discussed things like road projects where, for example, if a lane is closed there is a penalty for the duration of the loss.  Essentially, it was to keep this on track.  During Covid-19 the need became even more obvious.  If people are going to relocate to work remotely it is all the more important that there is an availability of broadband throughout the country.  Nobody disputed that this project was required.  The concern was that it was going to cost a lot of money and there was a question mark over the capability of the people who were awarded the contract to deliver on it.</p> <p>  I take some issue with what has been said by the Secretary General.  The figure quoted was 4,000 and it was stated it should be 12,000.  It was supposed to be 20,000.  What were the milestones?  It is an improvement on 4,000, but if NBI does not meet the target will there be slippage in terms of an accelerated programme?  That is one of the questions we can put to NBI on 14 October.</p></speech>

The first reply referred to 4,000, but in this correspondence it is stated that an additional 8,000 have been added to that in terms of premises passed.  The actual target runs into hundreds of thousands.  I will not quote the correspondence, but it is a much larger figure than that.  It is multiples of that in the first year.  Deputy Carthy had flagged this item.</p></speech>

The first is that it does not outline anything regarding the contracts that NBI has agreed with contractors.  I understand that one of the contractors is based in England and did not perform at all during Covid-19 and the lockdown period, whereas the other company did.  The second issue concerns page 2 of the letter which refers to information on the use of existing infrastructure.  I have huge concerns about this.  Where Eir infrastructure is already in place and is based in what we would call an amber area, we find that Eir is not prepared to connect to any property in the that area even though it already has the infrastructure in place.</p><p>It is extremely difficult where there is infrastructure in place bordering on an amber area or a blue area.  There seems to have been no engagement with Eir in dealing with that issue.  It is something that we need.  We could have a far faster connection of premises if there was the engagement with Eir with regard to the borderline areas in the context of the blue and the amber areas.  We need to take this up with the Department as to why that engagement has not taken place with Eir.</p></speech>

I pointed out at the time that Eir was allowed to cherry pick.  It picked large groups of homes.  It was very clear.  I said it to the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, that Eir had been allowed to hold the whole network to ransom because to get by it or to extend that out it does not have to do anything.  Eir controls it.  It controls the main road here in terms of the main lines.  That is what has happened.</p></speech>

Permission was given to Eir to service those 150,000 premises.  The bad news is that there is no obligation on Eir as a private company to go 1 yd or 1 m further than that.  Yes, we should raise it with the Department.  As I recall, Mr. Griffin was not there at the time, but I raised it at the time with the officials and the Minister.  There is no obligation on Eir to go 1 m further than it has gone.  It has the rich pickings.  The Deputy will recall that there were three interested parties up until that day, and after that date two of the other interested parties - one of which was the ESB - pulled out.  That is why.  We should raise it with them on the day that they are in, but unfortunately that was the deal set at the time.  It looked good because 150,000 premises were going to be captured, but the problem is that this allowed that part of the network to be captured and made it difficult to get by, with no obligation to go any further than that.  This made the rest of the contract so unattractive that the other two bidders pulled out.  This is what actually happened with it.  The Deputy is right that this is a serious issue, and we will raise it with them on the day they are before the committee.  Perhaps they are now engaging with the private company but it is like a lot of other things in that the State does not hold the cards here, unfortunately, Eir does.   The committee will request an up-to-date briefing from them and will have them in on the day.  That very much needs to be a focused meeting on the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  No. 788 B is from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, received on 15 September 2021, providing information requested by the committee in relation to data centres and Ireland's electricity grid.</p> <p>  Last week we considered correspondence on this matter from the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, and agreed to forward the correspondent to the committee that shadows the Department, and to request information on expenditure on contingency measures to prevent rolling blackouts.</p> <p>  This item focuses on a national strategy for data centres, which is set out in the Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Policy, which was published in 2018.  While the statement acknowledges the considerable challenges to the capacity of our electricity grid posed by data centres, it does so in the context of regional development and what it refers to as "high quality, sustainable jobs", although it is unclear how much employment is created by data centres in the long term.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also states that he and his Department are acutely aware of the challenges that significant electricity demand poses, and that his Department is engaging with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to encourage investment by large energy users on renewable electricity generation.</p> <p>  It is proposed to note and publish this item.</p><p>I also propose that we forward it to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the information of its members.  That is important.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

It is on the second page and starts with, "The statement also acknowledges that as large customers of electricity, data centres also pose challenges".  It goes on to talk about energy and states that "the Government will seek to ensure that any downside costs of growing energy demand are minimised by encouraging data centre investment in regions where we have infrastructure capacity to facilitate investments".  Regarding that statement, can we ask the Department what analysis was done in that regard and what detail was being worked from?  This statement is asking us to trust its interpretation, but I would like to see the evidence.</p></speech>

Is it agreed that we will ask the clerk to seek that information from the Minister and his Department?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 793 B is from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive, Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.  It is dated 14 September 2021 and provides information requested by the committee regarding the procurement process for the installation of CCTV at racecourses, which we have been monitoring, pardon the pun.  The correspondence states that the number of tenders received exceeded the IHRB&rsquo;s expectations and that the evaluation process is under way.  It goes on to state that 25 unique sites are involved, with differing infrastructure and requirements, and that the work is more complex than it might seem.  The Chief Executive, who is retiring on 30 September, advises that an update will be provided to the committee when the evaluation process has been completed.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Deputy Munster wishes to comment on this matter.</p></speech>

Can we write to the IHRB to find out if that undertaking is still on target?  Reading the correspondence does not give much comfort or faith in that regard.  We were given that commitment and it would be worth our while to write and see if the board is still sticking to that deadline.</p></speech>

It is encouraging, however, to know that plenty of offers have been tendered in this case.  We will, though, request that clarification from the IHRB.  Only two racecourses are covered now, so we will request that information from the board.  I thank Deputy Munster.</p> <p> The next category of correspondence is category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 708 C, from an individual, is dated 1 July 2021.  It concerns an alleged incident of bogus self-employment.  The correspondent names a company.  We must be careful in this regard because it is an allegation.  The specific details, including the name of the company, should not be discussed.  I ask members to observe that stipulation, because there are potential legal implications.  I propose that we thank the correspondent for his letter and suggest that he bring this matter to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 721 C, from an individual, is dated 7 July 2021.  It raises concerns regarding the national children's hospital.  It is proposed to advise the correspondent regarding the role of the committee and its ongoing focus on expenditure on this project.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

That is fine.</p><p> No. 756 is from an individual and is dated 3 August.  It is a further submission to the committee regarding the management of State property assets by the Office of Public Works.  No. 758C is from the same individual and is dated 27 August.  The individual in question is advocating for a public property agency to replace the Office of Public Works.  This is a policy matter and, as such, one for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  In accordance with the correspondent's wishes, we will forward the previous correspondence to the committee and I understand it is to consider the matter.  In May this year, we published our report on our engagement with the OPW.  I therefore propose that we await the publication of the OPW's accounts for 2020 before taking any further action.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 757C is from Deputy Carthy and is dated 3 August.  It is a request for the committee to examine the appointment, now declined, of Ms Katherine Zappone as UN special envoy on freedom of expression.  The matter has been comprehensively dealt with by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and I understand the committee is to engage with the Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach tomorrow.  As the matter does not relate to what it accounts or reports to the Comptroller and Auditor General and so as to avoid unnecessary duplication, I propose we do not take any action on this matter.  Is that agreed?  Deputy Carthy is the correspondent.  Is he happy with that?</p></speech>

It is dated 6 August 2021 and relates to Screen Ireland.  We addressed this under No. 729B last week, which was from Screen Ireland.  We agreed to request that Screen Ireland provide the committee with an update on its undertaking to contact the individual in question, as well as a breakdown of the percentage of its funding in recent years that has been allocated to companies associated with board members.

As the information is unsubstantiated, I request that members do not go into the detail of the correspondence at this point.  As the body concerned receives significant funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, through Sport Ireland, I propose we request the consent of the correspondent who raised the issue to forward the correspondence to Sport Ireland to respond to the matters raised and to consider the matter further at that point.

It is not obvious what controls are in place, particularly on the part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding a grant awarded to this particular body.  The Chairman said the claims are unsubstantiated and that may well be the case but there are significant concerns.  I am concerned about the governance around this and how decisions were made for the location of this particular facility.  I have had some correspondence with individuals about this.  It is difficult given that the committee does not have direct responsibility.  We will have officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before the committee at some point and we need to explore with them what controls the Department has over the awarding of funding and what it requires in return in terms of governance.  It may be advisable to write to the Department in the meantime inquiring what controls it has in that respect.  Every reply I get advises me that this is an independent body.  However, public money is being allocated.</p></speech>

One is that we request Deputy Verona Murphy - Deputy Catherine Murphy can confirm if this is okay - to forward the correspondence to Sport Ireland and request a response to the matters raised, at which point we will consider the matter further.  Is Deputy Verona Murphy happy with that proposal?  Is she still with us?  Is it agreeable to the committee that we do that?  I take it that is agreed.

Agreed.  That completes correspondence.</p> <p>  The next matter on the agenda is the work programme.  An up-to-date work programme has been circulated.  Members will note that representatives from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, will be before the committee on Thursday to discuss NAMA's 2020 financial statements and special report 111, which concerns progress on the achievements of NAMA's objectives as at the end of 2018.  Also on Thursday, the Comptroller and Auditor General will publish the 2020 Appropriation Accounts, which address voted expenditure, including of Government Departments and offices.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will also publish the 2020 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services.  As agreed last week, we will take time to review those publications closely to prioritise areas for examination in our work.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 7 October, we are scheduled to engage with the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, including representatives from the State Claims Agency, on the NTMA's 2020 financial statements.</p><p>The following week, the week of 14 October, we are scheduled to engage with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  On that day, we can hopefully make some headway on this broadband issue.  The Department&rsquo;s 2020 accounts will be available by then, including up-to-date expenditure on the national broadband plan.  On 21 October we will engage with Tusla on its 2020 financial statements.  </p><p> As the D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit the following week, namely, from 25 October to 29 October, this brings us to 4 November, when we plan to engage with RT&Eacute; arising from its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media &ndash; that is some Department. </p><p> As circulated to members yesterday, Deputy McAuliffe has proposed that the committee engage with the Department of Transport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland to examine expenditure relating to the MetroLink project.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has indicated support for this proposal and has also raised the possibility of inviting the National Transport Authority, NTA, before the committee in respect of expenditure and the extension of the DART line and BusConnects.  I agree that these are two very large areas of expenditure that are very important and were not scrutinised by the committee.  I suggest we look to schedule a date when we consider the work programme next week at which time we will have the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s 2020 material available to us.  We will also have the Department of Transport&rsquo;s accounts report.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

I appreciate the Chairman&rsquo;s raising of the correspondence in respect of the MetroLink project and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  We are in bit of a difficult position in advance of the publication of the review of the national development plan but what seems clear from the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s comments at the weekend is that there have been project delays or budgetary issues in respect of metro and it is important that we get to the bottom of those.  It looks certain now that the project will enter a new phase where there will be full funding available.  It is important, in advance of us going to the procedure of the railway procurement order, etc., that we have transparency on what has been spent and on what progress has been made.  Focusing specifically on the MetroLink project may be of benefit because my fear would be if we bring in all of the related issues in respect of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, that we may be here for several sessions.  I will take guidance from the rest of the committee on that point.</p></speech>

I support Deputy McAuliffe&rsquo;s proposal.  This should be a directed session.  I also want to flag that for some time on the work programme we have had the agreement of Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come in on the issue of emergency accommodation.  Recent events have pushed the issue around the private provision and the oversight of emergency accommodation right up to the top of the agenda.</p><p>If possible, it would be good to schedule that sooner rather than later, it is to be hoped before Christmas, so that we could have a proper look at how we are doing those things.</p></speech>

Maybe we should write to the Department of Transport to look for a progress report on that.  There are a number of important projects in rural Ireland that we want to be included in the NDP, primarily based on the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  While I understand the projects on the east coast are very important, there are also hugely important projects on the west coast that need equal focus and attention.  If the clerk could write to the Department of Transport to seek a report on where progress is being made on the all-Ireland strategic rail review, I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

If the clerk writes to the Department at this point and we have some advance information, that would be helpful in trying to focus that meeting.  The point is well made that if we are going into a meeting with minimal information or only what is reported in the media and are trying to deal with a number of matters, we could require several sessions.  If we get the information we request at this point, we will perhaps be in a better position.</p></speech>

Given that these matters have been on the agenda for so many years, it is appropriate for the committee to examine the expenditure to date and the plans for the next number of years.  If we can limit the discussion to the matters Deputies have raised, that will help us when we sit down with the Department in, it is to be hoped, the near future.</p></speech>

It would be useful for members to examine that in advance of the meeting we intend to have.  The investigation underlined a number of commitments and analysed what is happening from a policy perspective.</p> <p>  On Deputy Dillon's point, it is not about whether projects are more or less important.  There are other committees which can advocate for the importance of projects.  I do not disagree with the Deputy.  The potential for public spending issues is our role and that is why I am inviting MetroLink in at this point.  The fact there is potential for there to be errors in the way this is managed is where we need to focus.</p></speech>

On the basis of the contributions, there are a number of very specific items, including MetroLink, the DART line, BusConnects and the all-Ireland rail review mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  I propose that we write to the Department prior to our meeting to request an update regarding progress on these issues and expenditure on them to date.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, remote participation from outside Leinster House is not possible for members.  Thankfully, we are beginning to emerge from under the dark shadow of Covid-19.  However, there are still risks and members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and every second seat has been removed or is spaced to facilitate social distancing.  I ask members to note that, to observe those positions, to try to maintain social distancing when entering and leaving the meeting and to use masks at all times, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation, which I am sure we will have.  We are all aware of how it works.</p> <p>  We have a rota.  Going by the apologies we have received and the attendance at the meeting, we will allow 15 minutes per group.  We will go round the table in the usual fashion.  We will start with Fine Gael and then move to Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, SDLP, Alliance, Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in again, Labour and the Green Party, in that order.  Some parties or groups may or may not be represented at the meeting.  That is fine.  We will move on if they are not.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses are welcome.  It is a pleasure to have them with us and I thank them for joining us.  We have an engagement with the Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation.  We are pleased to welcome: Dr. Anthony Soares, convener, Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation; Ms Tara Farrell, CEO, Longford Women's Link; Ms Aoife N&iacute; Lochlainn, Brexit policy officer, Irish Environmental Network; and Mr. Chris Quinn, director, Northern Ireland Youth Forum.  Mr. Quinn is under time pressure.  We will try to take any questions for him at the start.  I ask members to be conscious of that.  I am delighted to welcome our guests on behalf of the committee.</p> <p>  Those who are accustomed to presenting at Oireachtas committees will be aware of the note on privilege, but I will recap.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts of the Leinster House campus is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  The witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter, should they wish, for further guidance.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  If I need to give directions to any member or witness on parliamentary practice, I ask that they abide by that direction.  They should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p> <p>  The group will open with Dr. Soares, whom I invite to make his opening statement.  After we have heard from all the witnesses, we will take questions from the members in the agreed order.</p><p>I call on Dr. Soares to make his opening statement.  He is welcome and I thank him for being with us today.</p></speech>

I am the director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies and convener of the <i>ad hoc</i>group and, as the Chair pointed out, I am joined by representatives from three of the other organisations involved in the group's work: Dr. Aoife N&iacute; Lochlainn, Brexit policy officer of the Irish Environmental Network; Ms Tara Farrell, CEO of Longford Women&rsquo;s Link; and Mr. Chris Quinn, director of the Northern Ireland Youth Forum.<br/><br/>Joining together a range of organisations from Northern Ireland and Ireland, the <i>ad hoc</i>group was established in May 2020 to act as a prime contact for purposes of meaningful consultation between cross-Border civil society and regional, national and EU bodies, on matters relevant to co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  Organisations participating in the <i>ad hoc</i>group are on the front line of the study, promotion, support and delivery of North-South and-or east-west co-operation initiatives across a broad spectrum of areas of interest and have decades of accumulated experience.  They are organisations that see North-South and east-west co-operation, as well as wider international co-operation, as being essential to the ongoing peace and reconciliation process on the island of Ireland and to equitable and sustainable socio-economic development.<br/><br/>The primary objective of the <i>ad hoc</i>group is to secure the continued means to co-operate within and between these islands thereby ensuring that agreements, policies or legislation developed or enacted by relevant regional, devolved and national governments and the European Union, are conducive to the maintenance of the conditions necessary for co-operation within and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  In the first instance, in light of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland, the <i>ad hoc</i>group and organisations involved in its work have been engaging with relevant decision makers, including the European Commission's task force for relations with the United Kingdom, the withdrawal agreement joint committee, representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Northern Ireland Executive and the specialised committee on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.  The <i>ad hoc</i>group is committed to working with others to safeguard co-operation and good relations within and between these islands, and looks forward to doing so with those who are currently making decisions that will affect the future landscape for co-operation and the maintenance of relations between our peoples.  The <i>ad hoc</i>group believes that in order for all interested parties, including the Irish Government, to properly monitor the impact of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions from North-South co-operation, there needs to be sustained and effective engagement with those who are intimately involved in such cooperation.<br/><br/>The Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation, which brings together a range of organisations with decades of accumulated experience in North-South and east-west co-operation and relations, represents an invaluable asset in this regard, and calls on all parties to continue and deepen their engagement with the <i>ad hoc</i>group, including through the bodies established under the protocol.  Such engagement with the <i>ad hoc</i>group will ensure that organisations from the Republic of Ireland can offer their own perspectives on the extent to which they are able to engage in co-operation.  It is our belief that no serious monitoring of the impact of the implementation of the protocol on the conditions for North-South co-operation or on their east-west relations, can take place without hearing directly from those involved in such co-operation who are based in the Republic of Ireland.  We would be pleased to answer any of the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I was reading their opening statement and position paper.  They stated that there are organisations which see North-South and east-west co-operation, as well as wider international co-operation, as essential to the ongoing peace and reconciliation process on the island of Ireland and to equitable and sustainable socioeconomic development.  That is music to my ears.  I welcome that, particularly since there are aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been implemented, including the North-South consultative forum and the civic forum in the North.  Do the witnesses feel that they fill that gap?  The most important question I have for the witnesses is about what they want us to do.  As already stated, I read their position paper.  They outlined the best environment in which co-operation takes place.  I would like to hear from the groups about how they make that co-operation happen and what we can do to help.  I know there are people present who can bring to life some of the points they have made and I would be interested in hearing them do so.</p></speech>

We could not agree more about aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been implemented.  In recent years, because of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the lead-up to that and during the negotiations, a light has been shone on the absence of structures for engagement with civic society.  The Senator mentioned the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.  That was replaced by a six-member advisory group, which was mentioned again in the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  We still have to see what exactly is happening with that.  I suggest that a six-person advisory panel is not a substitute for the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I agree about shining a light on the absence of an all-Ireland consultative forum, which was suggested in the Good Friday Agreement and reiterated in the St. Andrews Agreement.  There was a call on the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that it came about.  We have yet to see that happen.  The Senator asked whether the our group fills some of those gaps.  I would not necessarily say that we would fill it.  We cannot presume to speak for other groups but we are organisations that are intimately involved in North-South co-operation and in conversations on a North-South basis between a whole range of organisations with all sorts of areas of interest.  We are having those conversations in the absence of any structured mechanism to facilitate them.  We also engage with other civic society groups.  We have a meeting this afternoon with another group of civic society organisations in Northern Ireland to discuss some proposals relating to structured mechanisms for engagement with civic society.  We are coming together and those proposals have been developed Katy Hayward of Queen's University.</p> <p>  Regarding what we would like the committee to do, for my part, one thing that we are really conscious of, as mentioned in my introductory statement, is the implementation of the protocol.  Article 11 states that the protocol should ensure "the necessary conditions for North-South cooperation".  I urge the committee to assist and support us in our cause in any of those conversations about whether those conditions are being maintained.  Organisations based in the Republic of Ireland need to be seated around the table.  You cannot talk about North-South co-operation and whether conditions are being maintained by simply speaking to organisations at one end of that, which would be Northern Ireland groups in that case.</p><p>It has to be all of us together involved in that co-operation.  I would urge the committee to support us in ensuring those conversations involve both sides of North-South co-operation.</p></speech>

We provide services to approximately 1,200 women and children annually in a wide range of areas.  We also engage in widespread regional and national advocacy.  I am a member of the board of Irish Rural Link and the chair of AONTAS, the national adult learning organisation.  We have been engaged in cross-Border all-island work primarily through the Centre for Cross Border Studies but we also have other projects in recent years.  We believe that working at a grassroots level is absolutely critical if we are to see meaningful co-operation and community development alongside an empowered civic society on these islands.  Initiatives we have been involved in include the Ad-Hoc Group for North-South and East-West Cooperation since last year and previously the New Common Charter initiative which is driven by the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  That is an initiative to empower civic society across these islands, North-South and east-west.  We have individual projects, including one on pushing boundaries with women's tech in Belfast which examines the role of women in non-traditional spaces.  We have a pilot project with the Northern Ireland Rural Women's Network supported through the reconciliation fund called From Grassroots to Government which is about advocacy and women finding their voices.  AONTAS, of which I am chair, has a new initiative called the Network for Adult Learning Across Borders, NALAB, which is an umbrella partnership of leading organisations in the field of adult and community education.  That gives a flavour of the kind of work we have been involved in.</p> <p>  As Dr. Soares says, what we really need is the committee's support around the implementation of the protocol in Article 11 and for us, amidst all the work we are doing, it is critical that there are proper functioning mechanisms and structures for engagement that include organisations from the South like ourselves as well as the North.  Otherwise we are not going to see meaningful engagement or the true spirit of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement replicated.  The questions we ask of our elected representatives is why those structures are not either functioning or in place.  We also have to look at the long-term outcomes and impacts on communities.  Looking at the last 18 months, civil society organisations have been to the fore of the Covid crisis.  Most of our services were designated as essential.  The question we ask is if we are deemed as essential during the Covid crisis and were relied upon to ensure that supports were delivered to communities, surely we are also essential in this context.</p> <p>  We are engaging in this work with our counterparts in the North because we believe in it.  We believe in the value of the work and we believe in the need to uphold the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement in its totality.  Obviously there are funding supports in place, such as the reconciliation fund, and they are very welcome but it is not just about the financial resources, it is about the impact that our work has and the energy that is required to maintain it without the proper structures that we can then feed into when we are looking at the impact of what it is we are doing.  Obviously, dialogue is very important, that is what we are engaged in, but what is the longer term impact of our work?  We cannot maintain this on our own.  We need the structures.  I am concerned that many civil society organisations will not be in a position to continue working in isolation on their own initiative.  I hope that the committee might also share some of these concerns.</p></speech>

Obviously, Ireland is a single biogeographic unit.  We have the same issues and challenges around climate change and biodiversity on both sides of the Border.  In 2019, we co-operated to produce a report on identifying the main risks to environmental integrity on the island of Ireland posed by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  Obviously, the main risks identified were regulatory divergence.  Now since the finalisation of the trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland some of these risks have been partially mitigated.  However, we are in the very early days of post-agreement to address our shared environmental issues such as climate and biodiversity.  We need to co-operate cross-Border but for that co-operation to be effective and practical we need shared policies, standards, aims and objectives.  It is not clear how strong the protection against divergence on environmental standards in the trade and co-operation agreement will be into the future and the strength of protection afforded by non-regression of standards and rebalancing mechanisms on future divergence has been criticised and critiqued by quite a number of UK environmental and social policy advocacy organisations.</p> <p>  What we see with the trade and co-operation agreement and the protocol is the extent to which what is agreed is focused on trade.  Obviously, environmental impacts go beyond trade.  Therefore, what are the solutions?  Our report in 2019 highlighted the potential for the Good Friday bodies, in particular the North-South Ministerial Council, to work on advancing environmental shared policy and practical co-operation and also to provide a forum for discussion on policy and regulation.  However, even at the best of times it has to be said that these Good Friday bodies are quite impenetrable to most of civil society.  They are essentially engaged in highly diplomatic processes and NGOs such as ourselves have very few routes for engagement on the matters under discussion.  Dr. Soares has spoken about the need for engagement with civic society on both sides of the Border to ensure co-operation can not only be maintained but also thrive.  Currently, on the environment, it is very hard to see where the avenues for engagement with NGOs are, particularly, as Ms Farrell mentioned, those NGOs south of the Border.  We need structures for engagement.  The question on the all-island consultative forum is a very good example.  A consultation forum which would provide an opportunity for citizens and NGOs to discuss environmental co-operation across the island is the sort of undertaking we need in order to see any real all-island change or progress on the environment.</p> <p>  I thank the committee.  Apologies again for my camera not working.   </p></speech>

Briefly, I represent the Northern Ireland Youth Forum which is a youth-led regional body in the North of Ireland.  Without repeating what many of my colleagues have said, I would echo their sentiments.  The question asked was what do we want members of this committee to do and how can we make more safe co-operation happen.  I can inform the committee that the youth forum has just received some funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs to set up a North-South youth forum.  This is something for which we have worked for 13 years.  It was very much based on the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  Part of that lobby involved a lobby for a Northern Ireland youth assembly, which has just been established this year under the speaker of the house in Northern Ireland.  We are very much pushing towards making that a sustainable and a very youth-led body.  The North-South youth forum is a big project of ours at the moment.  In terms of what can the committee do, essentially, there are four asks.</p><p>We have a survey open at the moment in which we are asking young people North and South what their issues are and if they would like to be involved in a North-South youth forum.  To date, they have spoken about having an interest in mental health, human rights, environmental issues, education and discrimination.  We want to push that, particularly with young people in the Twenty-six Counties, over the next two or three months.  It would be amazing if the committee could help us with that.  We also want to-----</p></speech>

It is great to hear from them and for them to hear our views and questions.  Moving on from Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s point on the North-South youth forum which was, I believe, set up in July, this is a good development and I hope the panel shares that view.  We see the leadership coming from young people across the island.  This is very important as young people have to listened to.  They often lead by example and have the best views.  We can all learn from our youth.  I have met Mr. Quinn over the years and visited his office at one point.  It is important that we build on all of this.</p> <p>  Brexit has been a significant issue for many people in different sectors across these islands and we must look at its impact on young people.  What impact have Brexit and the protocol had on young people?  What are their views and thoughts on Brexit?  Do they believe the protocol protects them in any shape or form?  I would be interested in hearing some of their views on that issue.</p> <p>  The youth assembly has been set up and a citizens&rsquo; assembly is now of the utmost importance because that is where we will all learn.  I would like to hear the panel&rsquo;s views on those assemblies.  If we have these assemblies up and running and working well, how important will they be in helping this island and these islands to move together?</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s move on the NI Youth Assembly is a very positive one.  Incidentally, I am the rapporteur for a cross-Border education initiative looking at student mobility and opportunities across the island.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science would be extremely interested in talking to Mr. Quinn's group and having its input on some of the barriers facing further and higher education.</p> <p>  In my portfolio, an issue that always comes up with me is the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, in particular in respect of the future of our island and how young people can be involved in shaping our constitutional future.  They tell me they need a citizens&rsquo; assembly specifically on that issue.  Is that being discussed in Mr. Quinn&rsquo;s group?  If so, how might young people have an input?</p> <p>  I ask Ms Farrell the same question.  I am familiar with Longford Women&rsquo;s Link and the brilliant work it does.  I know the challenges arising from the pilot project and other projects on which the group does great work.  We must work collectively to try to get those projects mainstreamed in a better way in order that we have an improved interface between what Longford Women's Link is doing and the political system.  Women are saying to me that they want to look at the constitutional future of the island but they want to have an architecture in place.  We have seen from experience the positive results of a citizens&rsquo; assembly.  Is that issue being discussed by women&rsquo;s groups?  How does Ms Farrell see this developing in the future in terms of women&rsquo;s groups across the island being involved in setting up a citizens' assembly?</p></speech>

The questions they asked are right up our street as a youth forum.  Young people have been talking about North-South co-operation for quite some time.  As I said, our lobby has been going on for 13 years.  The other ask I was going to come to was about young people having an opportunity to engage directly with decision makers like this committee.  In the North, we have a political champions group that meets young people regularly and is part of the architecture of the North-South Youth Forum.  We would like to set up something similar and perhaps have the opportunity to bring young people to this committee.  That would be a solid ask.</p> <p>  There are two pieces of research I can refer to in the context of the protocol.  One took place in May, as we approached the centenary of partition and the establishment of Northern Ireland, and the other is our Looking Beyond Borders research which asks young people's views on legacy matters, Covid-19 and contemporary issues.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, young people are talking to us about the big societal issues.  They are talking about Covid-19, poverty, housing, educational underachievement and discrimination.  That is not to say that the constitutional question is not important.  It still is important. However, young people are very focused on overcoming these big issues that we are facing across the island of Ireland.  They are talking a lot about having a space to talk about legacy matters.  They want to have a part in a conversation about a potential Border poll and they have expressed their frustration about not having a say on Brexit.</p> <p>  With regard to the protocol, our latest survey suggests, according to the statistics that I am seeing in front of me, that the big issues for young people are around human rights and climate change.  Some 42% of respondents to our latest survey talked about human rights being the number one issue.  Only 7% of young people who responded talked about Brexit being the big issue for them.  This survey is live at the moment.  Many young people are saying that they do not really understand the protocol or care too much for it.  The bigger issues for young people are discussions relating to identity, culture and their role in society, particularly Protestant or unionist working class young males and where their role is in society right now.  The latter are a group we very seldom hear from.  My hope is that forums like ours, the North-South Youth Forum, or a civic forum, can very much help to engage people who feel disenfranchised.  I am conscious of time so I will pause and allow other colleagues to come in.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her kind remarks about Longford Women's Link.  She has been a great supporter of our work over the years, particularly on women in political life.  Her question is quite timely because we recently contributed to a piece of work with Dr. Joanna McMinn from Ulster University, funded through the reconciliation fund, around women's views on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland and Ireland.  We have had some very interesting conversations.  I brought together two groups of women from Longford and Roscommon and the conversations we wish to have are on the things that matter to all of us, namely, health, housing, education and well-being, and the future for our young people on these islands.  That is what took up the main conversation.  We have seen some very good outcomes from the citizens' assemblies here regarding a number of different issues.  It would be a fantastic start to have those structures, in order to have somewhere to feed these reports into.  There are a lot of conversations happening in women's groups around, for example, the impact of Covid, the impact of Brexit, the protocol and people looking for clear and accurate information but the communication flows are not always great.</p><p>The media has its own angle on various aspects of this.  We have seen Covid be predominant in the headlines over the last 18 months, with not as much about the impact of Brexit, protocol implementation and so on.  A citizens' assembly would be helpful.  The conversations that we are hearing are about the issues that are impacting women and their families across communities.  These include health, education and domestic violence, which has exploded in the last 18 months and is a real concern for many families and communities.  Having a platform or forum where those issues could be brought to the fore, North and South, with the mechanisms to be fed into future policy and future discussions, would be helpful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021092800002#J00600"><p>The value of the conversation is enormous.  It is essential that people have dialogue about co-operation.  One thing that I would stress is that we as community organisations, both North and South, are involved in trying to engage with all sorts of bodies and with decision makers within the Commission, the UK Government, a specialised committee, a joint committee, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government, particularly through the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the North-South Ministerial Council.  We at the Centre for Cross Border Studies are fortunate because we can use some of our core funding to undertake all of these numerous engagements.  They are engagements to ensure that we maintain the necessary conditions for North-South co-operation and also east-west co-operation and relations.  Many other organisations are not resourced to do that.  They are involved in numerous engagements.  There is a question of resources.  They are engaging in these conversations, which are taking them away from what they are funded to do, which is normally delivery of essential services and essential work.</p> <p>  I stress that conversations are great and we must keep dialogue going continually as part of the peace and reconciliation process, but there is significant frustration.  The conversation must lead to action and we must see joint action, with us working as a civic society group with political leaders and representatives, so that we can see these issues being progressed.  If we cannot see concrete action being undertaken and progress being made, then it leads to frustration and community organisations starting to withdraw.  That is a significant risk to North-South co-operation.  We are starting to see some indications from organisations of pressure they face and the changing circumstances they see in the political landscape of both North-South and east-west co-operation.</p><p>They are starting to feel the pressures to focus on the work within their own jurisdiction due to the enormous amount of energy that is needed for it and the lack of resources.  If the political conditions are not conducive to or encouraging of co-operation or if community organisations are not asked to be involved in these types of co-operations, there will be a risk of people going back to those days when we turned our backs on one another.  Conversations that just lead to further conversations and not to concrete action, in addition to the pressures on resources, are issues which we need to be concerned about and need to address together.</p></speech>

People will find that on this committee, what we need and want is a sustainable architecture to get the interface between politics and civil society right and to make it count in order that we do not have a whole industry around the protocol and other things.  We need focused action that will help implementation.  The implementation deficit, be that in the Stormont House Agreement, the St Andrews Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, is where the challenge lies for us all.  Everything we do should go towards addressing that implementation deficit because we have seen what can happen when there are vacuums.  It is a curse on all our Houses that there has not been implementation.  It should be done wherever it can be.  The Irish Government has a major role to play in this, as do the British Government and committees like this.  I hope we will have an opportunity to engage with the <i>ad hoc</i>group, or even individually, as was done with the Longford Women's Link and the youth forum, in order to further tease out the issues, in particular, around barriers that we can collectively help to break down.  We are all trying to address what has come from partition and how partition has not served us across this island.</p></speech>

I would first like to establish what the impact of the protocol has been on the business interests with which the <i>ad hoc</i>group engages?  Does the group see itself as an information gathering organisation and if so, what is the feedback at present in regard to it?  Given some of the comments today, has the group's level of engagement diminished in any way since the introduction of the protocol?  What is the current status in that regard?  What is the feedback from counterparts in Northern Ireland on the protocol?  What are the issues involved or do they see it as a positive?  What feedback is being received?</p><p>I was interested in what Mr. Quinn said about the North-South youth forum that recently received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Quinn's organisation could have a good standing in regard to that sort of work, provided it is representative of all sectors of society.  As he rightly pointed out, our youth do not provide us, as policymakers, with enough input.  Any avenues that enhance opportunities to meet policymakers would welcome.  I would like to see the group linked more with the workings of the shared island unit.</p><p>They could play a very important role in that regard.  The working going on in unit is critical to the young people of this world and the generations to come.  They need to have their say.</p><p> I was also delighted to hear about the work that Ms Farrell is involved in.  My colleague, Deputy Joe Flaherty, from Longford is very supportive of the work that she does and has a lot of praise for it.  I am delighted that she is working with the shared island unit.  If we are going to get along on this island, organisations such as hers will be fundamental to that .  Co-operation needs to continue at all levels, and from the bottom up in particular.  If engagement does not take place at the lower echelons of organisations, our future will not be great.  It has to take place across society as well.  I look forward to the feedback.</p></speech>

The Centre for Cross Border Studies's third quarterly survey on conditions for North-South and east-west co-operation.  The first quarterly survey was carried out in March.  It focused on civic society organisations and local authorities on the island of Ireland and their views on their ability to co-operate on a North-South and-or east-west basis following the end of the transition period and the beginning of the implementation of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  In the context of co-operation, what comes up time and again is the fact that it is about the political conditions.  This brings me to a very important point.  Article 11 of the protocol refers to maintaining the necessary conditions but that does not necessarily imply an understanding of what we see has been the conditions necessary for co-operation.  For us, these include the political conditions, the social conditions - that is, communities themselves and their support for North-South and-or east-west co-operation - and the material conditions, namely, the access that we have to goods and to people in order to undertake that co-operation, and the regulatory context which provide the framework.  The feedback we received from the quarterly survey is that people are concerned about the deteriorating political conditions for co-operation.</p> <p>  On information gathering and sharing, our group is really important in terms of the conversations we are able to have as organisations that are involved in co-operation on a North-South and-or east-west basis.  We are constantly exchanging information, raising issues, trying to find solutions and that is what forms our engagement with decision makers, including the joint committee, the Commission, the UK Government's Cabinet Office, etc.  That is really important to us.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about feedback from organisations in Northern Ireland.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies is based in the great city of Armagh.  We are a Northern Ireland organisation, although, obviously, we work on an all-island basis.  We have received a lot of feedback on the impact of the protocol on flows of trade.  In the context of co-operation, however, it is about the sense organisations have regarding the kind of support they have.  Do they feel as if they have the backing of politicians, the political leaders, in one or various jurisdictions in terms of them engaging in that co-operation?  I will hand over to Mr. Quinn who has been very sensible and used the technology to raise his hand.</p><p>I will go through the questions as logically as possible.  I sit on many groups such as this and am invited to speak to secretaries of state and with the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, and with the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, and the message is the same every time.  Civic society groups are frustrated that we are not part of the conversation.  The fact that the protocol has become a political football is very unhelpful.  As seen on the news today, unionism has issued its own position on it.  While we should not ignore unionist and loyalist concerns around the protocol, it is important that we work together to find a solution.  I am interested in hearing, through the North-South youth forum and other such vehicles, what the issues are which affect young people in the south of Ireland.  What are the issues affecting businesses across the island of Ireland?  What is the solution here?  How can we in civic society be engaged in the conversation to bring solutions?</p><p> In terms of risks, we saw violence on the streets in April of this year.  Seeing more of that is a fear of many here.  There is a real need to create safe spaces for people and from my perspective, young people, to have a conversation around the difficult issues.  We should not ignore the issues relating to identity and the constitutional question of a potential border poll.  We need to have those conversations, otherwise the risk of discontent and disconnection will continue to simmer.  </p><p> In terms of engagement, I think my colleagues would agree this has not really changed since the protocol.  I am proud to be part of a very strong and vibrant voluntary sector which works both locally and on a North-South and east-west basis.  That will still be there but there is much work to be done to promote understanding and education on what the protocol is.  My opinion, and this is not the opinion of the youth forum, is that we need to educate young people and people in general about the need for some kind of mechanism.  I do not know that everyone understands that with Brexit, there has to be some sort of protocol or agreement.  When I talk to people on the ground, and young people in particular, there is a lack of understanding on what is a very complex issue.  My call is very clear, and is about creating those safe spaces and investing in things like the all island women's forum and North-South youth forum, pushing towards an all-island civic forum.  It is important that members of civic society have a say in how those structures are set up and that they are sustained. </p></speech>

It is very difficult to understand the impact, especially in the Republic of Ireland, and to follow the work of these committees let alone to engage with them.  One of the major problems, as Dr. Soares has said, is that we lack any resources to deal with this, to follow the work, to exchange information and to do the much-needed advocacy that we need to do North-South.  That for us is one of the major problems.  We have not been able to grapple with our new post-Brexit environment because we lack the resources and we lack the forums for engagement.</p></speech>

I was interested in what Mr. Quinn had to say in regard to the feedback from young people and also his views on the protocol.  The protocol is a conversation we could have all day.  I am very interested in getting more feedback from young people and youth forums on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  They could teach us all a lesson or two and they could waken up some of our politicians in Northern Ireland.  We need to simplify things.  We need to take a step back, have a little respect for each other and learn to work with each other better.  In that regard, I hope the witnesses have a fruitful future and I also hope the group gets relevant funding to broaden its wings on a North-South basis.  Anything I can do in regard to helping to open that door to the shared island unit with my colleagues here, I would certainly like to do that.  I again thank the witnesses for engaging today.</p></speech>

It has been very interesting.  They talk in their paper about the political conditions and the social conditions for full North-South and east-west engagement.  Necessarily, the North-South bodies are more numerous as there are more obvious practical and logistical areas of co-operation, but particularly in the context of the sense of loss that some are feeling, that can sometimes be misinterpreted or even distorted as being an imbalance.  The witnesses said they have further meetings with colleagues today.  Are there any additional structures, or perhaps a refreshing or re-presentation of east-west structures, to address that perception that North-South is more adequately provided for?  Although it might go beyond their remit, are there additional mechanisms that the witnesses think would be helpful for addressing that perceived democratic deficit in terms of opportunities for people politically in the North and the South, but particularly in the North, where there are no MEPs, in order to feed into decision-making at an EU level?</p> <p>  I was struck by Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn's point about the already complex architecture of governance arrangements that have sprung up from the protocol and the difficulty for organisations in navigating them.  I am glad I am not the only one who is becoming a bit bothered by all of the structures that are there, without potentially creating more.  Of course, there are more needs.</p> <p>  My last question is about engagement with the Executive, with the UK Government and with the European Commission.  The witnesses referenced at section 3.4 of their position paper a lack of detail, particularly in terms of how the UK will discharge its responsibilities.  Perhaps I am picking it up incorrectly but is there a bit of a difference in interpretation?  The witnesses might expand on the point that is made in section 3.4.  I suppose I will begin with Dr. Soares but any of the witnesses can pick up on those points.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021092800002#O00100"><p>I thank Ms Hanna for those questions.  I will combine some of them..  On the perceived imbalance between North-South and east-west structures, Ms Farrell's opening remarks mentioned an initiative which the Centre for Cross Border Studies managed but it was not our creation.  It was a creation of civic society organisations North and South and involving civic society organisations in Scotland, England and Wales which developed the new common charter for co-operation within and between these islands.  There is a willingness there.  People already co-operate on an east-west basis between the island of Ireland and Great Britain so it is not just Northern Ireland civic organisations, it is organisations based in the South.  We work with and are in constant dialogue with our counterparts in Great Britain.  That new common charter was a kind of expression of that.  It is almost an expression of the gap.  In terms of governance and administration, there is the British-Irish Council that brings together the administrations of the devolved administrations, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Irish and UK Governments, but there is no equivalent for civic society.  There is a gap there and the new common charter was pointing towards that.  One challenge that has been mentioned is the trade and co-operation agreement and the mechanisms set up with the various committees and the intricate network or mechanisms under that which, as Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn pointed out, add another layer of complication for civic society organisations which have to track them all.  If you are working on environmental concerns, you really do need to pay serious attention to all those committees and see how that is panning out.  However, it also presents an opportunity.  Within the trade and co-operation agreement there is a civic society forum that brings together the domestic advisory group for the UK and the European Union.  There is an opportunity to redress the east-west balance within that domestic advisory group that the UK would set up to link the island of Ireland, and particularly Northern Ireland in this case, and Great Britain.  However, it also points to another concern and complication.  In co-operation, whether North-South or east-west, we have to avoid that the mechanisms under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, do not speak to the mechanisms set up under the protocol because what happens under the TCA will have an impact on the operation of the protocol.  The two things have to communicate with each other.  There has to be a bridge there somewhere that we are channelling information across those two very important agreements.</p> <p>  Yes, there are challenges around the democratic deficit but there are solutions.  There are mechanisms there that the existing institutions could provide us with some of those channels.  The North South Ministerial Council continues to have under its remit an EU dimension.  In it, the Northern Ireland Executive meets with the Irish Government and may discuss EU policy and try to influence that development of EU policy.  On Northern Ireland, we continue to have an office of the Executive in Brussels.  We need to really reinvigorate that.  Northern Ireland has to keep an eye on what is happening in the Commission and try to be on top of the policy that is being developed.  It is not necessarily about keeping an eye on the possible draw-down of EU funds, it has to be a bit more proactive looking at the development of policy.  It is also about engaging with the Irish Government's representation in Brussels as well.   That is another communication aspect.  There is a possibility of a democratic deficit but another way to address that is to ensure that the civic society engagement that was set up under the Good Friday Agreement is properly established in a proper Northern Ireland civic forum and an all-island consultative forum.  Perhaps that could then be developed to create some all-island civic forum too.</p><p>The position paper on engagement with the UK Government, the Commission and the Northern Ireland Executive, and how the UK will discharge its responsibilities, was perhaps published in 2020.  I cannot recall.  I recognise that both the UK Government and European Commission have been trying to engage with civic society.  We had visits by Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi on his own.  We also had visits by Lord Frost on his own.  We have also had joint visits, as co-chairs of the joint committee, engaging with civic society organisations.<br/><br/>To properly address that potential democratic deficit, we have to make that engagement more structured because at present, it is the beginning of a good effort but it is <i>ad hoc</i>, like our group.  We are called to a meeting, people express their views and then we do not actually know what happens, then another meeting is called three months later.  A serious issue here is transparency.  For this to work properly, we need to have agendas and minutes, and people knowing who is at the meetings.  Even organisations that might not be at the table should at least know who will be at the table and they can communicate their views to those organisations.  We need to work on a proper structure for civic engagement to properly address that potential democratic deficit.  I will hand over to my colleagues now.</p></speech>

That is the theme running through this.  That also speaks to the point about engagement with political leaders, the UK Government and EU institutions.  The engagement is sporadic and fragmented.  We need a clear roadmap with deadlines and pathways of engagement.  As Dr. Soares said, we have been at various different meetings.  We give our input and we are listened to but there is no definition of the who and the how afterwards, or of where we go next.  We need a clear roadmap on that level of engagement.</p></speech>

To build on Ms Farrell's point, we need action.  We talk regularly to decision makers and at times, it feels like there is a lack of action and a lack of follow-up.  Regarding a focus for solutions, as the committee has heard, much of our work is <i>ad hoc</i>.  I am trying to keep an organisation afloat during a pandemic and a global economic downturn, when unfortunately the Department of Education in Northern Ireland has ripped an axe through the voluntary youth sector and many organisations underneath it.  We are working with vulnerable young people and trying to bring them to tables like this one today, which takes much work.<br/><br/>On a solution focus, perhaps there is an opportunity with PEACE PLUS to bring much-needed resources to organisations such as ours.  PEACE has been kind to our sector and our organisation, and to me personally.  It has kept me in a job for many years.  The problem with PEACE funding, as one will hear often, is the bureaucracy that comes with it.  If the committee has any influence around the tables it is at, I ask it to ensure that PEACE PLUS enables us to do more for sustained North-South, east-west co-operation.  If at all possible, could it look at the level of bureaucracy?  The paperwork that comes with these things often takes away from doing the face-to-face work that is so important.  If we get PEACE PLUS right, that might be an opportunity for civic society organisations to do sustained work on North-South and east-west co-operation.</p></speech>

To what extent do we need to return to the mapping exercise on North-South co-operation that was done by the Irish Government a couple of years ago?  It identified about 140 areas of North-South co-operation.  Should we conduct an audit on how things have turned out in practice in the intervening years, particularly from Brexit going live?  What lessons or action plan can be derived from that piece of work?</p> <p>  My next group of questions are for Dr. Soares but I urge other people to feel free to respond.  I want to get a sense of the different organisations that work across the Border.  To what extent are EU and EEA nationals employed or engaged?  How difficult are things becoming in that regard?  </p> <p>  Does Dr. Soares want to take the opportunity to put on record some of his concerns about EEA nationals in terms of the implications of the electronic travel authorisation, ETA, scheme that the UK Government envisages in terms of its Nationality and Borders Bill and what it may be contemplating in terms of the common travel area?  What are the potential risks arising from what was said by the Home Office in recent weeks and the fact that there are a few issues up in the air?</p></speech>

The North-South mapping exercise is an issue.  At the time, following its undertaking, one of the things that we noted was the following about the technical notes that were produced by both the UK Government and the European Commission, which essentially were almost the same technical note that accompanied the eventual publication of the mapping exercise on North-South co-operation.  Both technical notes pointed out that the exercise may not have captured informal, local community level co-operation on a North-South basis.  This is one of the reasons that the <i>ad hoc</i>group is also really important because most of the co-operation that we undertake takes place at an informal, local community level.  We are very keen, as we monitor the conditions for North-South co-operation and whether they have been maintained, that we capture all of that co-operation and not necessarily just the 142 areas of North-South co-operation that were included in the mapping exercise, which essentially looked at the regulatory underpinnings and the extent to which EU regulations supported those areas of co-operation.<br/><br/>For many of us who are involved in the North-South and east-west co-operation it is not the technicalities and regulations that keep us alive but the vigour, heart and passion that keeps us doing what we do.  However, it is important that we do not dismiss that and include, as we look at the conditions for North-South co-operation, that we pay close attention to that.<br/><br/>In terms of the question on whether we should have an audit and a refreshing, that is one of the purposes of the <i>ad hoc</i>group.  We can provide that evidence to those who are responsible for the monitoring, and Article 11 of the protocol, and give direct evidence in terms of how our co-operation is progressing, following the implementation of the protocol as it proceeds.</p><p> On the issue of EEA nationals employed or engaged in cross-border work or activities, we knew this would arise when the UK decided to withdraw from the European Union.  We talked about it and it has come about.  I refer to the whole issue of uncertainty.  If it happens that someone who is not a UK citizen or an Irish citizen is involved in cross-border work, there is uncertainty as to whether that employment is secure.  From the employers' perspective &ndash; we are particularly worried about this because of the various issues employers are dealing with - cross-border employers may become more reluctant to employ cross-border workers.  There are various issues around that, not only in terms of citizenship but also in terms of taxation issues.  In particular, as we move towards more remote working, especially for those resident in the Republic of Ireland and employed by an Northern Ireland employer, what are the implications in terms of their tax liability if they are engaged in remote working?  We must be aware of that and work to ensure it does not become an obstacle to employers employing cross-border workers in the future.</p><p> Regarding the issues of electronic travel authorisation and the changes to some of the documentary requirements for intra-CTA travel for citizens who do not have Irish or UK nationality, which will come into effect on 1 October, as members are probably aware, we were fortunate in that the policy team in the Home Office responsible for the common travel area engaged with us to talk us through some of those changes and their implications.  The Home Office CTA team was very clear there will be no changes to travel across the land Border here and that some of the policies were already in existence.  However, we pointed out to the team that even if we are talking about the continuation of existing policies, it has to understand that the context has completely changed.  Brexit has completely changed the position and created all sorts of uncertainties.  Any alterations to intra-CTA travel must be handled very carefully.  These issues are adding an extra dimension of uncertainty, particularly with regard to the potential implications for those who are not UK or Irish citizens with respect to their travel between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  We must be very careful in how we handle any of those changes coming into effect on 1 October.</p></speech>

My mind strayed a little bit left field when EEA nationals were discussed.  There is a conversation to be had on that in addition to what we are talking about with respect to asylum seekers and young people who are refugees.  There is often a strong focus on EEA nationals across the board but there is some work to be done on how we engage with young people seeking asylum on the island of Ireland, both North and South, and the impact Brexit might have on them.  Linked to that is some work we are doing on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  That conversation is important in the context of everything that we are discussing today.</p></speech>

I also apologise for the interruption of the dog.<br/><br/>I represent a Border constituency and a significant number of issues have had an impact on all of us since Brexit in particular but also since the onset of Covid.  These include the furlough payments North and South and how it impacted us.  I have constituents who have worked a lifetime in the South but live in the North.  They pay taxes and so on but were left outside of those support payments.  I also want to draw Dr. Soares on the issues of cross-border taxation and all that it involves, which he spoke about in reply to Dr. Farry's question.  I am interested to hear about that.  It might be useful if we, at some stage, invited the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to speak about these issues in order to give us an insight into cross-border taxation and how this committee can have an impact on that.  Has the <i>ad hoc</i>group had or requested much engagement with Government Ministers, particularly in regard to the Citizens' Assembly?  I am keen to hear the group's thoughts on the engagement regarding that.  While we welcome the all-Ireland women's forum and other levels of engagement, we are still facing a deficit in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Some of the guarantees and promises made therein have still not been addressed, specifically on a bill of rights.  Had that been in place, life might have been a lot less complicated for those of us who represent people on the Border.  If Dr. Soares can talk about those issues, I would be keen to take his thoughts into consideration.  I thank the witnesses for a valuable morning.</p></speech>

In case he has to disappear in the next few minutes, I will deal with some of those issues quickly.  As for Covid and the supports thereon, in addition to Covid public health restrictions and how they were implemented on either side of the Border, these are common issues.  We work with European partners in border regions across Europe.  They face the same issues in terms of the timing of the imposition of public health restrictions on either side of a border, the lifting of public health restrictions, the different types of supports made available to their citizens and how that affects cross-border workers.  These are common issues that have been felt to varying degrees across European Union borders.  We have seen this at first hand with our own Border.  It is highlighted to us especially through our flagship Border People project in respect of which we are grateful for the support of various stakeholders, including the North-South Ministerial Council's joint secretariat.  We have seen this at first hand with citizens who live at borders or have to cross our Border for work or other purposes.  They are the people who always fall between the cracks and have to deal with the differentials in timing and supports.  Sometimes it is a minefield and they have to scramble around for the correct information.  In that regard, our Border People project tries to signpost the correct direction.</p> <p>  On the taxation issue, I am sure the members are aware of the work of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition.  It has been highlighting the taxation issue, which had existed previously and is not a new issue.  It is simply that the onset of Covid and the changes to how we work, including the move to remote working, have focused a light on that particular issue.  The Cross-Border Workers Coalition is doing great work.  It has been engaging with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in trying to address this issue and seeing what the impacts of resolving that issue would be.</p><p>We would support them in that and we would encourage all sides to find a solution.  It would not be that difficult to find.<br/><br/>In terms of engagement with the Government Ministers, I will briefly reply and then I will hand over to my colleagues.  The <i>ad hoc</i>group has had very good engagement with Ministers, but also with officials.  We would like to really thank officials on the Irish Government side, particularly the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs who have engaged with us on various occasions, and also the shared island unit.  Also, as individual organisations, to varying extents we have engagements with Ministers in Northern Ireland, and in the Republic of Ireland as well.  We are really grateful for that engagement, but it is just the nature of that engagement and what it leads to that is the question.  I will hand over to my colleagues.</p></speech>

Before I leave, I wanted to add some comments around the issue of Covid.  It is obviously a huge one and young people have talked a lot about how their rights have been impacted from a North-South perspective.  Based on some of the conversations we have had, one of the good things is young people are becoming more accustomed to the language of rights and they have talked about human rights as a key priority area.  On Covid-19, a massive number of young people felt that it impacted on their right to have a say, and that is both North and South.  They felt left out of the discussion.  They felt that their mental health had deteriorated significantly throughout the pandemic and that the issues around access to information were big.</p> <p>  In terms of cross-Border issues, young people talk a lot about healthcare, education and transport as well as economic disadvantage.</p> <p>  I am glad that Ms Gildernew brought up the bill of rights as well.  That is a pertinent issue that young people are really engaged in at the moment.  I guess there is frustration.  In many ways, there is a perfect storm brewing.  People are very frustrated.  There is a massive disconnect.  There are all these things going on at the minute, with the Brexit Protocol and Covid-19.  In the North, you have universal credit and welfare reform issues and rising poverty, and across the island of Ireland we are seeing issues around housing and homelessness rocketing.  People are really frustrated and I guess the theme of today is to give people a space to have a say on these issues that are really important.</p> <p>  If the Chairman does not mind, I will excuse myself now.  I thank all the members for the opportunity to speak today and I thank Dr. Soares for bringing me in.  Hopefully, I will see the committee again along with some young people.  Hopefully, the young people will be doing the talking the next time.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Quinn.  I appreciate he was under time pressures today.  I thank Mr. Quinn for making time in his diary to accommodate the meeting this morning and wish him the best of luck with his next engagement and, indeed, his good work.</p> <p>  Mr. Finucane wanted to come in.  He indicated, if he wants to come in at this point.</p></speech>

I am familiar with Mr. Quinn's work.  He does excellent work and I was glad to see him before the committee today.</p> <p>  One point we may consider is that Mr. Quinn referenced the live survey he and his group was conducting.  It would be very interesting when the survey is completed - I can follow-up with Mr. Quinn after this meeting to see exactly when that is due to be completed - to see the representative nature of that survey.  I was quite interested in some of the feedback with the figures and the topics that Mr. Quinn referenced in one of his earlier answers.  I do not need to frame that as a question, given that Mr. Quinn is not here, but that is something that I can follow-up on.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Farrell, Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn and Dr. Soares.  I cannot remember who referenced this earlier.  We rightly have a lot of focus on trade and the politics as to where we are at this moment in time but it is important to particularly offer our youth and our women's network, and the environment as well, the ear of this committee.  Given the nature and the composition of this committee, it is important that we hear those voices.  I would welcome that.</p> <p>  I have one fairly specific question.  There has been some reference to PEACE PLUS funding.</p><p>I would be interested to know whether any of the groups the witnesses are involved with or that they represent benefit are due to benefit from this next phase of the PEACE PLUS funding?  Is there a concern, given the political climate and the refusal of unionists to attend meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, that the funding and the vital work that it facilities would be under threat?</p></speech>

In terms of PEACE PLUS, I note, speaking here as a director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, that we responded to both public consultations around the development of PEACE PLUS and highlighted our own priorities around that, which, obviously, given the nature of our organisation, would focus on the ability of organisations to undertake cross-Border projects.  We also highlighted the need for people-to-people projects.  There has to be a real balance between those larger projects and the funding that goes to larger organisations, as well as funding going down to grassroots organisations to enable them to do the great cross-Border work that they do, which is both people-to-people in nature and invaluable.  I am hopeful that the PEACE PLUS programme, once it hits the ground, will enable us to do that.</p> <p>  In terms of obstacles to finalising that in terms of signing off on the PEACE PLUS programme, I would really hope that nobody puts obstacles in front of that because it is absolutely crucial to a whole range of organisations, North and South.  It is also a vehicle because of the way that this new PEACE PLUS programme has been structured.  It can also bring partners outside of the immediate eligible area.  It is not only for the six Border counties on the southern side.  It can involve partners from as far away as Cork.  It can also involve partners from Great Britain.  It can involve partners from elsewhere.  There is the ability to do so.  I really stress that we do not need political obstacles in front of signing off something that is of immense value to civic society organisations and other organisations across the island of Ireland.  I will leave it at that and maybe hand over to Dr. N&iacute; Lochlainn, if that is okay.</p></speech>

We also made a submission to the consultation on PEACE PLUS and, along with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Environment Link, we wrote a letter to the Special European Union Programmes Body regarding our concerns about the level of funding for nature and biodiversity.  We really welcome that environment and climate will receive quite a bit of funding in the next round.  However, a large proportion of that will go on infrastructural expenditure such as transport.  What we are arguing is that nature and biodiversity deserves a much larger piece of the pie essentially and we would hope to see, when the programme is finally signed off, that biodiversity, nature and the marine would see a larger share of the funding.  I would be very hopeful that our membership groups in the Border area will be in a position to apply for PEACE PLUS funding for cross-Border environmental projects.  Certainly, we will be working with them to make sure that they have the capacity and knowledge that is required to make an application in the first place.</p></speech>

We are dealing with further scrutiny of the EU proposal COM (2021) 281 to establish a framework for a European digital identity.  To preface our discussion, an observation from the Data Protection Commissioner was circulated to members earlier this morning.  It is available on our Microsoft Teams portal now.  I suggest that members read that document straight away.  It is short in length but heavy in content, and relevant to our deliberations today.  The document has also been sent to members by email.  Following its engagement on the COM (2021) 281, the committee will decide on how it wishes to proceed with its scrutiny of this proposal.  We will have a short private meeting immediately after the conclusion of this public session.</p> <p>  I welcome witnesses from the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank them for coming in today at short notice and facilitating this meeting going ahead.  From the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, I welcome: Ms Mair&eacute;ad McCabe, principal officer in the telecommunications policy and regulation division; Ms Catherine McDonald, assistant principal officer in the telecommunications policy and regulation division; and Mr. Rory Hinchy, staff engineer in the office of the chief technology officer.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I welcome: Mr. Barry Lowry, Government Chief Information Officer; and Mr. Declan Hickey, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p><p>Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member participating via MS Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  One should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p><p> I call on Ms Mair&eacute;ad McCabe to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is happy to attend the meeting today to discuss the proposed revision of the eIDAS regulation.</p> <p>  I am Mair&eacute;ad McCabe, principal officer leading the telecommunications policy and regulation division of the Department.  Joining me are my colleagues, Ms Catherine McDonald, assistant principal, working in the same division, and Mr. Rory Hinchy, staff engineer of the office of the chief technical officer.</p> <p>  The primary policy focus of our division in the Department is on the telecommunications sector.  While the eIDAS regulation is not a telecommunications issue, the EU Telecommunications and Information Society Working Party is currently considering this proposal at European level and this Department is leading discussions in the negotiation.  It is expected that the negotiating period will be approximately one year from June of this year.</p> <p>  Our main area of interest in the Department is the oversight of the trust services element of the proposal and we are taking expert inputs from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, on the e-identification, eID, aspects of the revision.  Inputs from the Department of Justice and the Data Protection Commissioner will also be needed in respect of GDPR and data protection aspects, and other Departments and bodies will be consulted as necessary.</p> <p>  The working party, having held an initial discussion with the European Commission earlier in the summer, is now engaged in ongoing detailed discussions on the proposed revision.  This is currently at a very early stage and involvement of a range of stakeholders will be required as we move towards finalising agreement.  Planning for implementation, particularly in and around the toolbox which is to be established, will require at national level significant cross-departmental inputs.</p> <p>  Having been fully in force since July 2016, the regulation is now facing a revision, and the intention is that putting new rules in place will pave the way for more successful application of secure digital identities into the future.</p> <p>  The new proposal provides a framework for a European digital identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents and businesses in the EU.  The EU aims to introduce a more harmonised approach to digital identification rather than the current divergent approaches in place across the various member states.  Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European digital identity wallets, which will be accessible from their phone or other devices.  They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe.  Very large online platforms will also be required to accept the use of European digital identity wallets upon request of the user.</p> <p>  For the main proposed revisions to the regulation, the significant changes include: mandatory provision by EU states of digital wallets; improvements to management of remote signature; establishment of a common toolbox for European digital identity; harmonisation with other relevant pieces of EU legislation; adaptation to the much-changed digital landscape since 2014 - the time of the original regulation; and the proposal also foresees four new qualified trust services to meet market demand.</p> <p>  With regard to ensuring the security of the eIDAS regulation, the regulation requires notification regarding cases of security incidents.  The supervisory body must currently provide the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, with a summary of notifications of breach of security and loss of integrity received from trust service providers.</p> <p>  While it is the intention of the European Commission that security aspects of the regulation be replaced with rules and procedures under the EU network and information security directive, NIS II Directive, that directive, as the committee will be aware, is currently under active negotiation at EU level.  Accordingly, whatever alignment is necessary will only emerge once that legislative file has progressed to an advanced level.</p> <p>  As to trust services in Ireland, there are two qualified trust service providers established here.  One provides qualified time stamp services and the other provides qualified electronic signature and electronic seal services.  This small market has the potential to grow and is not a hindrance to the development of digital services in Ireland.</p><p>Customers can purchase trust service products, such as an e-signature, from any trust service provider in any member state in the EU.  If they want a product that is a qualified and therefore a trustworthy product, then they get it from a qualified trust service provider.</p><p> In terms of implementation of the 2014 eIDAS regulation in Ireland and formal appointment of a supervisory body for trust services, Article 17 of the regulation requires member states to designate a supervisory body to regulate trust service providers within its jurisdiction.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has approved the designation of ComReg as the supervisory body under, and for the purposes of, the 2014 regulation.  Work is now under way now to progress this designation, including considering the practicalities of formal designation, the legislation necessary to amend ComReg&rsquo;s statutory functions, either primary or secondary, the provision of appropriate enforcement powers and an appropriate funding mechanism.  The Department will engage extensively with ComReg and other stakeholders, as appropriate, with a view to designation as soon as possible.</p><p> It should be noted that the fact that a supervisory body has yet to be designated in Ireland under the 2014 regulation does not mean that trust services are not available in Ireland.  Such services exist and an oversight mechanism was put in place in 2010, provided for under the Electronic Commerce Act 2000.  This is operated by the office of the chief technology officer in the Department.  However, formalising the designation under the 2014 regulation now requires a much more comprehensive regulatory regime to be put in place for ComReg, which includes enforcement powers and will necessitate the development of the requisite level of expertise in the body being nominated as supervisor.  The regulation sets out certain tasks for the supervisory body, requiring it to supervise trust service providers; investigate breaches of the regulation and take enforcement action as appropriate to remedy such breaches; co-operate with supervisory bodies in other member states; and report annually to the European Commission and ENISA on activities and breaches.</p><p> An integral part of the role of the supervisory body is to grant and withdraw qualified status to trust service providers.  The term "qualified" is used for those service providers which can prove that the services provided by them fulfil the requirements laid down in the eIDAS regulation.  It does this based on the results of audits of trust service providers conducted either by itself or by a conformity assessment body.</p><p> As regards the main changes proposed in trust services in the revised regulation, while the proposal is ambitious in terms of the digital wallet, the changes proposed to the trust services element are generally less so.  In response to the dynamics of the markets and to technological developments, it is proposed to expand the current eIDAS list of trust services with the introduction of four new additional services, including the provision of electronic attestations of attributes, electronic archiving services, electronic ledgers and the management of remote electronic signature and seal creation devices.  The introduction of a trust service framework for the electronic attestations of attributes is significant and will be fundamental to the introduction of a digital wallet.</p><p> The other main changes to the trust service provisions of the 2014 regulation include proposing to align the cybersecurity risk management obligations with those in the NIS 2 directive, permitting the Commission to introduce implementing Acts to set out the conditions applicable to trust services established in third countries, a suggestion that the tasks of supervisory bodies could be supplemented by the Commission using implementing Acts, and a requirement on providers of web browsers to facilitate the use of qualified certificates for website authentication.  Initial views are supportive of the regulation.</p><p> We are happy to take questions on the proposal and to hear the views of members.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to meet them today to discuss the European Commission&rsquo;s draft legislative proposal for the European digital identity framework.  I am joined by my colleague from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Mr. Declan Hickey.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, one of my responsibilities as Government Chief Information Officer is to take forward the soon to be replaced public service ICT and eGovernment strategies and elements of the Civil Service reform 2030 programme.  Another responsibility of my office is to work with our equivalent offices across the EU and EEA in shaping European Commission technical programmes and initiatives and to support Departments and representatives where they are involved in related policy or legislative discussions.</p><p>The European digital identity framework is one such project.  My colleague, Declan Hickey, and I are both involved in technical meetings related to this initiative and we have also been assisting our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications with their contributions.  On that basis, I would like to take my few minutes to brief the committee on the technical aspects of this programme.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Next Generation EU recovery package, which is worth &euro;750 billion, was established to complement and support each country&rsquo;s own national response to the crisis, and to provide the means to invest in the transformation to a more green and digital economy.  The EU Digital Compass then sets out the EU&rsquo;s vision for a digital future in a way in which, the EU claims, will also support it in meeting objectives in the European Green Deal, thus helping Europe to reach its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.  It cites the use of video-conferencing to help reduce flight emissions and digital technologies to help create a greener approach to agriculture, energy use in buildings and more sustainable city planning.</p><p> The EU Digital Compass uses the four points of the compass to identify the main goals to reach over the next decade.  These are as follows: first, a digitally skilled population and highly skilled digital professionals; second, secure and substantial digital infrastructures; third, digital transformation of businesses; and, fourth, digitisation of public sectors.  The EU has stated that the successful delivery of the Digital Compass will require an increased focus from governments on better digital services and better interoperability across all levels of government and across public services.  Equally important, they argue, is the concept of a trusted, user-controlled identity, one which allows citizens to control their own online interactions and presence and make full use of online services throughout the EU, while preserving their privacy.</p><p> It is this ambition which has led to the EU re-thinking and revising its plans and ambitions for an EU digital identity.  Electronic identities, eIDs, or digital identities and related infrastructure are foundational for digital transformation and to enable delivery of services for citizens and businesses.  A functional self-sovereign digital eID, which puts citizens in control of their own data and privacy, would be a big step towards transforming a wide range of public services.  It is generally recognised by the UN, OECD and EU, among others, that government sponsored digital identities can protect the most vulnerable by ensuring that citizens are protected from personation and receive their entitlements accurately and in full.  As the World Bank pointed out: &ldquo;Robust and inclusive identification systems are crucial for development, as enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 16.9, which mandates countries to provide &ldquo;legal identity for all, including birth registration.&rdquo;"  For individuals, proof of legal identity is necessary to access rights, entitlements, and services.  For governments, modern identification systems allow for more efficient and transparent administration and service delivery, faster and more responsive services, and increased security.</p><p> The August 2021 G20 Digital Ministers&rsquo; declaration acknowledged the growing importance of digital identity, especially where &ldquo;easily usable, reliable, secure, trusted, and portable&rdquo;, in providing citizens and businesses with a safe and privacy-compliant access to digital services.  The declaration also referenced the potential of digital identity in humanitarian and emergency scenarios and its potential contribution in the attainment of the aforementioned United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, Target 16.9: &ldquo;to provide legal identity for all&rdquo;.</p><p> The EU eIDAS regulation set out to harmonise the mutual recognition of electronic IDs and trust services in Europe.  While approximately half of the member states notified their eIDs for the purpose of mutual recognition across borders, others, including Ireland, were more hesitant, being concerned about the outdated concept behind the architecture and the practicalities of how it would work on a day-to-day basis.  The concerns of this group were proven justified when a review of the eIDAS regulation by the Commission highlighted the need to improve upon the regulation, both with regard to trust services and eID.</p><p>In particular, the evaluation highlighted several specific challenges with the eID approach, including weak implementation, low uptake by citizens, difficulties in interoperability, limitations to cross-border utilisation, lack of convenience, complexity of the notification process and the limitation of the service to the public sector only.  The Commission admitted that only about 60% of the EU population in 14 member states was able to use its national eID cross border and only 14% of key public service providers across all member states allow cross-border authentication with an e-identity system.  The number of successful cross-border authentications per year was also very small, although it is on the increase.<br/><br/>The evaluation concluded that a framework for European digital identity was required that both acknowledged and addressed the implementation challenges associated with existing digital identity legislation and, equally, would help deliver a workable and popular self-sovereign identity solution for citizens.  On 20 September, in her state of the Union address, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated:</p><blockquote>	Every time an App or website asks us to create a new digital identity or to easily log on via a big platform, we have no idea what happens to our data in reality.  That is why the Commission will propose a secure European e-identity.  One that we trust and that any citizen can use anywhere in Europe to do anything from paying your taxes to renting a bicycle.  A technology where we can control ourselves what data is used and how. </blockquote><p>The ambitions for this European e-identity include that it will be actively used across Europe; will be available to any EU citizen, resident or business in the EU that wants to use it; will be used for public and private sector transactions; will include credentials; will be operated via digital wallets available on mobile phone apps and other devices; and will give full control to users to choose which aspects of their identity, data and certificates they share with third parties and keep track of such sharing.<br/><br/>The new proposal for a new European digital identity framework was published on 3 June 2021.  The proposal consists of a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 as regards establishing a framework for a European digital identity, an annexe to the regulation and a recommendation on a common Union toolbox for a co-ordinated approach towards a European digital identity framework.<br/><br/>From an OGCIO point of view, while we have an interest in the development of the legislation, our main focus will be aligning with any technical solution - much as we did recently with the digital Covid certificate.  At this stage, while the Commission seems to have a good understanding of timescales and the required resource commitments - about 60 full-time equivalents and &euro;30.8 million estimated for the implementation of the proposal between 2022 and 2027 - the detail on the actual technical approach is thus far limited.<br/><br/>The early draft of the regulation states that the financing will support costs linked to maintaining, developing, hosting, operating and supporting the eID and trust services building blocks and it may also support grants for connecting services to the European digital identity wallet ecosystem and the development of standards and technical specifications.  The regulation states that the underpinning technologies should be developed towards the highest level of security, user convenience and wide usability.  It states the ambition that all European digital identity wallets should allow users to electronically identify and authenticate online and offline across borders for accessing a wide range of public and private services and also serve the institutional needs of public administrations, international organisations and the Union's institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.  Achieving this while making the app a viable alternative to commercial equivalents and one that will encourage substantial uptake will be challenging.  The process should be helped by one of the early deliverables, namely, a toolbox for a European digital identity framework.  This is planned to include a comprehensive technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references and a set of guidelines and descriptions of best practices.<br/><br/>The technical work regarding technical architecture, references and standards by member states and the Commission has not yet commenced but will start shortly.</p><p>In summary, this is an important initiative and aligns well with the discussions we have been having in Ireland with respect to increased use of digital wallets and credentials.  However, much needs to be done to move this from being conceptual to successful implementation.  I thank the committee.  </p></speech>

I thank both of the contributors.  I read their opening statements last night and again this morning.  There is a lot in them.  They are quite technical.  I do not think I have ever had anybody talk to me about this kind of stuff when I was canvassing a local or general election for a candidate.  At the same time, it is important that we are aware of what is being progressed.  I note that we can have a political opinion on it but, at this stage, it does not look for any kind of ratification by Parliament.</p> <p>  I thank both contributors for their opening statements.  I have a few questions on them.  I am looking at the European digital strategy about cutting fuel emissions and allowing more video conferencing.  There is a certain irony in the fact that members have to be on the campus to have this meeting and that we cannot do it remotely.  This is the exact kind of thing that should be able to do.  I appreciate that there are constitutional questions involving that however, over time we should try to make sure that people can work remotely as much as they choose if they are able to do the job appropriately. </p> <p>  First, I have a few questions to Mr. Lowry.  Is there any scope for this to be applied to things like the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, or even in proving one&rsquo;s identity on platforms such as Facebook or Twitter?  We talk about anonymous accounts, bullying, and so on.  I know this is a little away from the basic premise of this.  Could it be applied so that one has to show one's identity to establish a Facebook or other social media accounts, to eliminate the trolling elements and the anonymous bullying that goes on online?  </p> <p>  On the cost and the financing, does that come out of the Central Fund or can Revenue charge for services?  Is that part of the scheme?  From an individual&rsquo;s point of view, a digital wallet may be of benefit.  However, if that were to be done, what would its benefit be to an ordinary member of the public, or to any of us, our family members or friends?  Could we open bank accounts in other countries?  Obviously, the digital Covid certificate is working very well.  What else can we do with this?  What is envisaged that can be done with the eID technology, if we all had these digital wallets? </p></speech>

I will try to answer them all.  First, this at a conceptual stage.  As the Senator picked up, it is hard for the public at this moment in time to get an understanding of the benefits of this.  However, what members of the public do understand, because they are using the technology, is the concept of downloading a Ryanair or Aer Lingus boarding pass, and putting it on their Apple, Android, or whatever other phone wallet.  This is broadly similar to that.  In fact, one of the things that the Commission believes is that they have given too much control over this ecosystem to the commercial sector, and not enough control to governments.</p><p>I am sure the commercial sector would debate that, but it is certainly one of the things about which people are thinking.</p><p> In terms of how one gets benefits out of it, Senator Horkan has given a really good example of how the Commission should be taking this forward, which is the European health insurance card.  It would be very easy for people to carry one on a device, like a phone, and simply have fewer things to carry.  That is certainly part of it, but also the Commission talks about other things, such as, for example, if you wanted to hire a car in, let us say, France, that you could have your driving licence and insurance documentation on your phone as well.  These are documents we carry all the time and we do not have to make a specific point of remembering them because we think we might hire a car for a day while we are on holidays.</p><p> In terms of other benefits, Senator Horkan has given a really strong benefit of one of the cross-border dimensions to this, which is opening a bank account.  I remember a couple of years ago I was giving a lecture at Trinity College.  It was to a master's class in digital marketing.  I was asked a question by a young Frenchman who had got a job in Microsoft.  He said that when he came over to Ireland, he could not rent an apartment because he did not have a bank account.  He could not open a bank account here because he did not have an address in Ireland.  That is a case in point whereby his identity could be verified by his own nation, France, and it would make life a lot easier for him.  This is the European concept of the free movement of people.  Senator Horkan has hit on one of the real potential areas for selling this concept to the public.</p><p> The final matter that was raised relates to social media.  Of course, this is a completely different debate about whether a government should do this.  Senator Horkan's question was whether it would be technically possible.  The answer is that it absolutely would be.  In fact, one of the things that the President was hinting at in her speech was that often if we go onto a new website it will encourage us to sign up to it using our existing Google, Facebook or Microsoft credentials, if we have those.  What they get out of that is they know which websites we are going to and they get a greater understanding about us.  The idea is that this European approach would mean that we would control that data and that privacy rather than the commercial entity which is giving us the capability of doing that.  We could turn that around the other way and use our European identity to verify ourselves to open social media accounts and so on, but that in itself would require different legislation and a debate about the protection of people online versus the privacy of people who want to go online.  I will leave that to experts like Senator Horkan rather than comment on it.</p></speech>

As the Chief Information Officer, Mr. Lowry, is definitely the expert over me on that kind of thing.  The Facebooks of this world are under pressure to not allow anonymous accounts.  They are also under pressure to prevent fake news being put out there as if it is real.  There will be a large appetite on the part of lots of people, including criminals and others, who would like to have an anonymous existence and, perhaps, operate out of other jurisdictions.  There is an appetite for us to be able to know who is behind what goes up there and the people who are making the comments.</p> <p>  I am conscious of time so I will ask my final question.  The committee has discussed the cyberattack on the HSE.  In terms of the security of the data, would it be held by each nation or in a big European cloud somewhere?  I know it is all in the cloud anyway, but who minds it and how is it protected?  We all use online banking, mobile phone data and lots of tools that present a risk.  Has anyone been looking at the security aspect of it?  Has there been much exploration of that in this particular revision of the regulation, given the access to the identities of 300 million or 400 million people that would be seen as being as verifiable as a passport?</p></speech>

There is then an interoperability system that enables any digital Covid certificate to be read in France, Germany or another part of Europe.  We could go that way, whereby nations would still control their own data and use standards for interoperability.</p><p> One of the strengths of the digital wallet is that it goes a bit further because it allows individuals to carry their own identity with them, and to use it themselves.  In other words, a government would provide the credentials.  For example, we would provide a digital driving licence credential but we would not actually know why that was used, or that the person had gone to France and hired a car, or whatever.  That gives more privacy to the individual.  When the term "digital sovereignty" or "private sovereignty" is used, that is what it means, namely, the person is in control of his or her own data.  This architectural landscape will be designed following consultation with all parties to try to get a balance between maximum security, maximum usability and maximum privacy for the individual.</p></speech>

A passport is effectively a paper credential which says something.  It says you are a recognised citizen of the State of Ireland and Ireland gives you a credential - a passport - which proves that.  A digital passport is no different.  What would happen is that, a bit like the digital Covid certificate, Ireland would have its own unique identifier which can be read by other countries, and it would work exactly the same way.  It would be perfectly feasible to create a digital equivalent of our Irish passport.</p></speech>

This is a highly technical area and Senator Horkan has touched on many of the issues I would have raised.  I will try to keep the conversation flowing.  Mr. Lowry said this is very conceptual at the moment and is in its infancy.  Can he explain the next steps in trying to develop a technology like this?  What type of inputs will Ireland have?  I note Mr. Lowry said we had aligned with Europe in this regard.  Can he explain the next steps and how long it will take?  Obviously, it is hard to identify that now but the concept is good.  Can he explain what input the State will have and how long it will take to roll out those steps that will bring us there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#K00700"><p>I will do my best.  The next year is going to be a very important year for the legislation because work will continue on two fronts.  First, the legislation itself will be further developed and consulted upon, and our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will focus very much on that.  Our main focus will be on this idea of a common toolbox.  The target is that it will be signed off by September 2022, so we have just less than a year to complete the work.</p> <p>  I think it will be a long and arduous road.  The reason I think that is that, as I said in my opening statement, some countries have put a big investment into implementing the eIDAS initiative while others held back a little bit.  In regard to those countries that proceeded, eIDAS was largely built on the concept of chip and PIN, and those of us who are using online banking will remember our little card reader and how, in order to transfer money, we had to put our debit cards into the card reader, put in codes and so on.  That costs a lot to implement.  I know that, for example, in Hungary every citizen owns a chip and PIN reader because of the eIDAS legislation.</p><p>They are going to want to try to ensure what they have achieved so far coexists with where the new model is going.  To try to get a technical approach that embraces all these is going to be difficult.  Other countries, like ourselves and Austria, believed from the outset that this should have been developed using mobile phone technology.  However,even then the challenge is going to be great because first of all there is the question of whether we are going to focus this on the main players, that is, the Android operating system for phones, which is Google-oriented, and then of course the Apple operating system as well.  Europe is a little reticent to do that because it is giving the two American giants a big say in how the European digital passport will work, so all that must be negotiated.</p><p> Finally, the whole point of this is to be inclusive.  Some of the difficulty with apps, as members are probably aware, is around people with older phones, less advanced phones or the newer Chinese phones which are emerging and are cheaper but do not meet the same standards.  How we actually get apps that work in the same way in every single phone is going to be a big challenge.  It might well be we will look at different models for how we do this, to make it easier.  For example, the digital Covid certificate is very light-touch.  All the processing is done by states in their own infrastructure and what the user gets out of it is simply a credential which is easily read by any phone with a camera on it.  It may well be we will look at options like that as well, but all of that is still to be decided.</p></speech>

What type of supports will we get?  Have we put aside a budget to further develop this?  Even within Mr. Lowry's own unit, how many people are working on this?  Is there a dedicated unit?  Does it have targets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#L00300"><p>From the European perspective, they have identified what they believe they need to drive the central solution and it is &euro;30.8 billion over five years, from 2022 to 2027.  That money might include some grant to the member states to do some work on their end.  For example, the digital Covid certificate had a small grant to cover some of the cost states committed to it, but not all of it.  One of the other options available to us is to use things like Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, funding.  We have used that for a number of things.</p> <p>  The underlying premise that an individual can carry his or her own credentials on his or her phone should he or she choose to do that is a very good one and something we have been starting to explore in Ireland as well.  I hope some of the investment we might set aside to that in the State will also cover what happens at a European level.  For example, if we said to the public that rather than having to remember to carry your driver licence every time you are driving in your car, would you also like a version to have on your phone which garda&iacute; would accept if they stopped you, many people would say they would.  Often when going to the gym or somewhere like that, I would not have my jacket and would not have my driver licence with me, but you always seem to have your phone with you wherever you go.  There are examples where the people will be very supportive of this.  Certainly, there is a consortium within Ireland made up of insurance companies, banking, An Post and various others, which thinks this is a really powerful tool and could be used in many ways.  Those organisations will be very keen to see Government sponsor this and make it happen.  During Covid we have all gotten used to just touching a screen with our card and having it scanned.  Many people now simply carry their card on their phone.  Many people are very comfortable with where this technology is going and the opportunities offered.</p><p>I think that in Ireland we would be doing much of that anyway regardless of what was happening in Europe.  Obviously, the events in Europe will strengthen our determination to move forward as quickly as we can on this. </p></speech>

I will pick up on some of the queries that have been raised with us, particularly in the area of data protection, monitoring and enforcement.  I appreciate that there are many questions still to be answered on this matter.</p> <p>  Is it the case that there is a question over the concept of data minimisation and how that will be ensured, and enforced?  Is it the case that the proposal allows member states three options to provide the wallet app?  Is there the potential that the private sector would have access to highly confidential and sensitive personal data?  How is this aspect being considered and how will it be managed?</p> <p>  Mr. Lowry or his office said previously that it is not yet known where responsibility will lie for enforcement of the obligation on the private sector digital service providers.  Mr. Lowry, is there any further update on that?</p></speech>

If I can use the recent digital Covid certificate, because obviously we had a couple of good conversations about that at the time, what we did there was we went to the Data Protection Commissioner and set out a potential proposal that basically was built on a privacy first basis.  In that solution the data that is made available for the purpose of travel is different from the data that is made available for the purpose of indoor dining, for example, because it is all very privacy-oriented so we could design this in a very similar way.</p> <p>  What will drive this is how the public want to see it developed as well because, in Ireland, we use this concept for digital Government services where it is not just user-centric - in other words, a group of civil servants deciding what is in the users' interest.  It is user-driven - in other words, we meet the users, ask them what they want and we let that drive the solution.  What we will certainly be presenting in terms of our input into the EU discussions is what the Irish people tell us they want.  The features of the contact tracing app were all chosen by the public.  That was the way the Irish public wanted the app to be designed so the Irish app differs slightly from other European apps.</p> <p>  I would like to see us develop our own concept of a digital wallet that is driven by the Irish people but meets European standards and guidelines, and then introduce a degree of inter-operability.  In other words, if someone chooses to download their driver licence in the future, and their private sector insurance certificate, because they want to hire a car both of those can be read and understood in France, Germany, Spain or wherever they might want to hire a car.  I suspect that is the way we will go.  As I said in my opening remarks, the discussions on how the technical model will look are only beginning in the next few days so it is very early in this process.</p></speech>

Are their concerns that sensitive personal data might get into the hands of actors, whatever their intentions, that one did not intend to have control of or access to such data?</p></speech>

This is the system that is used in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and a few of the forward-thinking European countries, which is very appealing because it supports what you might do on the phone.  In terms of how the digital postbox will work as it becomes more established if, for example, the RSA makes the driving licence available in the digital postbox you can get it transferred there.  That digital postbox is entirely personal, it is safe because it is in the cloud and it would be accessed using a MyGovID account.  A person could choose to download a credential from a personal digital postbox to his or her phone for a specific purpose.  In terms of what we might also do - we have received some feedback on this which the public might be interested in hearing - a person will be able to choose to get his or her motor insurance certificate from, say, Aviva in a version that can be also stored in a his or her digital postbox, but it would mean the insurance provider would not know anything on that digital postbox other than what the person is required by law to reveal to it.  There are obligations with regard to a driving record and so on about which a person must tell his or her insurance company, but it would not know anything more than it is entitled to know through the basis of insuring his or her car.  As such, the person is controlling the access to his or her data and also the privacy of his or her data.  In the case of a phone change, the person can delete everything from the old phone but the information is still safe in the digital postbox and it can be downloaded onto the new phone.  That is one model in terms of how we see this might work.  We are interested in the Commission's views, and those of member states, on how they might see it working.  I am sure we can come up with something that is workable on a pan-European basis.  That is really important.  One of the things that frustrates people when they travel is that the rules are different in every country.  Hiring a car can be so frustrating when it should not be.</p></speech>

The Government is open to continuously evolving how we do things, even replacing MyGovID if something more popular or more secure comes along.  In terms of public uptake, it is very popular; they like it they way it is.  I suspect that we would, probably, align with that model.  Unlike the rest of EU States, Ireland does not have the concept of the national identity card but it does a State approved electronic ID for use with State services.  We have never extended that into private services, but again the public might want to see movement in that space.  That is open for political debate then.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mair&eacute;ad McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#N00500"><p>My understanding is that the negotiation period will be up to one year.  In the small number of meetings that have been held at working party to date, so many questions have come in from all of the member states and, in many cases, the Commission is taking them as new questions on which it will reflect such that I would imagine that there will be small but significant adjustments to the text as we proceed.  As much of what is proposed in the text is at quite a high level, with not a lot of detail supporting it, there are many questions.  For example, today some of the articles dealing with those services are being discussed.  There will be many questions coming in the direction of the Commission, which will need to consider the full implication of the new linkages being identified by member states.</p><p>I imagine that Mr. Lowry has more information on the technical discussions, but I understand that they will begin towards the end of this week.  The Commission is trying to avoid technical-, standards- and specification-related questions coming in at the working-party level, because these should be dealt with in the parallel technical discussions.  It will be challenging to marry the legislative discussion that is happening on one train track with the background technical discussions.  Mr. Lowry&rsquo;s point about making it user-friendly, user-driven and workable is the ultimate aim.  However, because there are so many different views from different member states, it will be challenging.  </p><p> On the last question on protection of data, there have been numerous reassurances from the Commission that there be no profiling, no data collection, and no mixing of identification data with personal data from other services.  There will be that physical and logical separation of one&rsquo;s personal data.  Trust service providers, TSPs, of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of the attributes.  The intention is that there will be in-built protection from a data protection point of view.  However, obviously, we will be checking in with the Data Protection Commissioner as the proposal progresses and as the text evolves.</p></speech>

I want to move onto the purpose of today's meeting, which is to look at COM/2021/281.  One of the key things that we, as a committee, have to decide is whether this breaks subsidiarity rules.  That is my question for both Ms McCabe and Mr. Lowry.  In their professional capacities, and in their respective roles, do they believe that COM/2021/281 breaches subsidiarity rules?  I will start with Mr. Lowry and then I will call Ms McCabe.</p></speech>

At this moment in time I do not believe it will.  However, it is far too early in the process to give a clear answer to that question.  Obviously, in all discussions, we will try to create legislation and a technical solution which meets the interests of Ireland and the Irish people; that reflects our different views on privacy and data control, etc., to many of the other member states; and that makes sure that any solution that is chosen, as well as the legislation, reflects the will and the desires of our own people and how they would use this facility.  At this moment in time I do not have concerns, but it is bit early to give a final answer on that.</p></speech>

As the proposal evolves in discussions between member states, there will be very much a desire to ensure that subsidiarity rules are not breached.  At this stage we cannot say there are any specific concerns, but we probably need to keep a close eye on it as the negotiations progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#O00700"><p>I will return to Ms McCabe.</p><p>Not too long ago, in 2019, the Data Protection Commission had issues around the public services card.  It found that people accessing public services in Ireland should not be required to have a public services card.  It was across a range of areas.  That is why I am putting the question.<br/><br/>My second question is more for Mr. Lowry.  Ms McCabe is co-ordinating this project.  I note that she says in her opening statement:</p><blockquote>	The primary policy focus of our division in the Department is on the telecommunications sector.  While the eIDAS regulation is not a telecommunications issue, the EU Telecommunications and Information Society Working Party is currently considering this proposal at European level and this Department is leading discussions in the negotiation. </blockquote><p>That seems a slight contradiction in terms.  In one breath, she says it is not a telecommunications issue, yet the EU Telecommunications and Information Society Working Party is dealing with it.  We are dealing with personal data.  When the public services card came into operation the Data Protection Commission stated at the time that it had concerns with it.  What happens if we get to a point whereby this framework progresses, and it is suggested that it is breaching GDPR rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mair&eacute;ad McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#P00200"><p>While I did confirm that our main focus in the telecommunications policy and regulation division is on the telecommunications sector, since we are holding the pen at working party level, there is a concern to ensure that all the relevant inputs are made, including consulting for example with the Data Protection Commission to ensure that what comes out at the end of the legislative discussion is fit for purpose and will not breach any rules.  I am afraid I cannot comment on what happened with regard to the public services card.  Mr. Lowry may wish to comment on that.  I want to reassure the committee that a very close eye will be kept on any new suggestions coming in from the Commission that would in any way go near to breaching GDPR because that is not allowable in European legal terms.  We are conscious of the fact that as the technical discussion proceeds, the Commission in a way is giving itself quite a lot of freedom through giving itself power in the revision to produce a number of implementing Acts.  It behoves us all from a cross-departmental perspective to ensure that whatever is in the top line of the legislation itself, that the technical detail of what goes into the implementing Acts will not end up breaching in any way what we hold dear in terms of GDPR.</p></speech>

The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has approved the designation of ComReg. </blockquote> <p>It looks to me that while it has been approved, there is not a designated body.  Given that it is seven years after 2014, why is it that ComReg was not the designated body before now?</p></speech>

It has taken some time and consideration of a number of options for us to identify that there was potential to appoint ComReg, to enter into discussions with it, and then to move towards the formal designation once we obtained a ministerial decision.</p><p>There were some delays encountered from the volume of work due to Covid and the time it took to arrive a decision to appoint ComReg.  It is in safe hands in that there is that oversight of trust service providers at the moment.  There are only two in the market and there is a very active process in train to designate, ComReg as the supervisory body.  Looking to the future we could anticipate that there would be substantial growth in the number of trust service providers, including in Ireland.  We need to get it right in the primary or the secondary legislation that we double check back that ComReg is a good fit for this.</p></speech>

How does this proposal differ from the digital Covid certificate, DCC?  Could I say that the digital Covid certificate is almost a pilot project of what they are proposing?  It is a European wide project.  The data held under the digital Covid certificate is retained by the host nation or the individual country.  How will this differ from the digital Covid certificate and is the DCC the model?</p> <p>  One of the main concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner with the public services card back in 2019 was whether the private sector would be able to get access to data.  What is being proposed here would have infinite data on individuals that they can use across the European Union.  Knowledge is king, and the controls over it.  How will this not be abused?  The whole issue comes under cybersecurity.  As I understand it , the subsidiarity point effectively supersedes the rights under various EU treaties for an individual state with regard to control of its affairs.  The questions concern the digital Covid certificate versus what is being proposed here, the whole area of access to data and who will own the data, and can it be open to abuse.  Perhaps Mr. Lowry will flesh this out.  Reference is made to banking facilities.  Has the Central Bank been consulted on this particular communications directive?  I am trying to get the point where I am happy that it does not breach subsidiarity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-28a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021092800002#Q00500"><p>The digital Covid certificate is probably a template for how interoperability can work across the EU and the EEA member states.  The digital Covid certificate itself is what we would call a "credential".  In other words, it is a proof given by the Government of Ireland that an individual who is resident in Ireland, has received two vaccinations, or has recovered from Covid, or has successfully had a negative test, either a PCR test or whatever it happens to be.  This is what we call a credential.  In the same way that a person's driver's licence is proof that he or she has passed the driver test and has not driven such a way that it has been taken back for a regulatory breach of driving rules.  In much the same way in the private sector, a car insurance certificate is proof that a person has been through the process of insuring his or her car, which means that should the person have an accident and is at fault then the other driver is protected.  We call all of these things credentials.  The digital wallet seeks to find a way to safely collect all of these credentials together and can use them in a way where the individual has full choice and full control.</p><p>That is important.  When this idea of individual sovereignty or self-sovereignty is talked about, it means you control what happens to your data.  That is obviously compliant with the GDPR and it is how we have always understood data works.  If I decide to go and get health insurance I would have to reveal information about my health to that provider because it is entitled to know it for the purposes of how it insures me and how much it will cost.  That is what the GDPR call proportionality and specificity.  The insurer does not need to know other information about me, such as my bank details and so on but obviously if I took out a car loan it would be entitled to know some of that information, and so on.  The purpose of this is to ensure that for every transaction I wish to complete, parties involved in that transaction, whether it be a public service or a private one, only see the information relevant and pertinent to that transaction.  If I no longer require that transaction with them, they no longer see that information about me.  Those are really the underlying GDPR principles that have to be applied in this model.  If they are not successfully applied in this model then the European data protection commissioners will insist they revise the model until it is acceptable.</p><p> I have not read the input into this session from our Data Protection Commissioner but I suspect that is broadly what it said because it can see how it works.  However, it will be ensuring all principles of GDPR will be adhered to right through the process.  Mainly, those are that as an individual I can participate in this, entirely through my own choice, and I can cease to participate in this through my own choice and my data will be removed.</p></speech>

On the Data Protection Commission, a deputy commissioner, Mr. Dale Sunderland, wrote to us this morning because we wanted to get the commission's input.  In summary, it states that:</p> <blockquote> 	In conclusion, at this preliminary stage and taking account of the formal assessment carried out by the EPDS, the DPC along with the EDPS and other EU data protection authorities now awaits the advancement of the draft proposal both at EU level and in terms of proposed implementation in Ireland. As noted above, the development of the technical architecture and the implementing acts will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the data protection implications of the framework for a European Digital Identity. </blockquote> <p>What is the timeframe on this?  Where do we go from here?  How long will this take?  What is the next stage of the process?  When does Mr. Lowry anticipate it will be in place?</p></speech>

That is hugely ambitious but that is its hope.  That means it needs, fairly early on in the process, to get a reasonably detailed draft it can send to the European data protection commissioners to get their response and adjust the legislation accordingly.  We have seen it, for example, with the European Data Governance Act, DGA, where they were quite late going to the European data protection commissioners and their input has required some very significant changes to that legislation.  That is the way it must work.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Lowry believe it to be proportionate?  Can countries opt in or out?  For argument's sake, let us say it is up and running and we have a cyberattack on Ireland.  Can we come along unilaterally and say we are not using the app or the wallet anymore for a period?  Is the fact the EU is looking for it to be mandatory proportionate or should countries be able to opt in or out?  We had a cyberattack not too long ago on the HSE and there are probably others we are not aware of.  Do we then have the capacity to unilaterally decide at that moment in time that we are not using this European-wide digital wallet app?</p><p>I call on Mr. Lowry to respond, please.</p></speech>

If several member states opt out then the legislation and the technical solution is not meeting the basic European principles of the free movement of people which this is seeking to underpin.</p> <p>  When the Commission speaks about monetary aspects of the legislation, it seems to be talking about what is mandatory in respect of service providers.  In other words, if a service provider wants to get involved in this, it will have to follow specific rules because that is the only way that the Commission can give its citizens, the citizens of Europe, the reassurance that this ecosystem is privacy-centric and secure.  It will not be mandatory for citizens to use it as they will still have alternatives.  That is why what it needs to be is very compelling.  In other words, it is much more convenient and even safer-----</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee today.  The committee has already gone into a great deal of the detail.  I want to check a particular matter.  I understand that we are talking about the electronic identification, ID, and the wallet.  In fairness to Mr Lowry, he said that the whole idea for this to be successful is that it has to be a sellable entity that makes people&rsquo;s lives easier and that it is easy to use by end-users, depending on with whom one is trying to interoperate with.  Security and privacy then have to be perfect and we hope that we can ensure all of that.</p> <p>  Ms McCabe spoke about a one-year negotiation.  At that stage we then have something that is closer to an end-deal or proposal with whatever questions remain, whereas the legislation is going to be carried out on the basis of the information known now over the next three to four months or so.  How exactly is this and the interaction with the Commission going to work?  What is the foreseen timeline on talking about something being an end product and when we can look at solutions?  I accept what Mr. Lowry has said earlier in that there are certain technical issues that people will want to use, such as legacy technologies they have already invested in, whereas we are looking for something like the digital Covid certificate, DCC, where one has multiple DCCs, whether those relate to banking, passports or whatever else, on one&rsquo;s phone.</p></speech>

While the Commission has identified a one-year negotiation period, it could go longer.  In the meantime there are regular working party discussions, where article-by-article consideration takes place.  That negotiation will be twin-tracked with the technical discussions that are just kicking off at the end of this week.</p><p>It is geared towards the preparatory work that must be done on the technical standards, specifications and so forth.  In the meantime, the Department will reach out to various stakeholders to ensure that there is a common understanding of the text as it involves and that Ireland&rsquo;s inputs in this regard will hit home.  In a way, the whole purpose of the working party negotiations is to allow member states to challenge the Commission's thinking and to double-check that there are no unforeseen consequences in what is being proposed.  Active dialogue will be ongoing at national level and that will feed into the working party discussions.  At certain points, the Commission will refer back to the working party on areas of concern.</p><p> The ongoing discussions are geared towards the development of a toolbox.  In respect of developing the end product, pilot implementation projects will be undertaken in various member states and representatives from those will all be talking to each other concerning the architecture and standards.  Turning to the implementing acts that were mentioned several times this morning, the devil in those details will have to be worked out at the level of technical subgroups.  Therefore, we are looking at the deployment of the digital wallet and the Commission is striving for that to happen within 12 months.  Again, that seems ambitious regarding whether it is doable.  An assessment will be conducted by the Commission some 18 months after the deployment of the new digital wallet to see whether it is working well in practice and what, if any, changes might be needed.</p></speech>

In a perfect world, then, everything would get sorted out between the individual member states and the Commission and the digital wallet would be ready to go.  People moving to Spain, for example, or elsewhere, will be facilitated in opening bank accounts.  Like any good system, it would then be assessed and reviewed six months later and any required fixes will be undertaken.  That makes complete sense.</p> <p>  Ms McCabe and Mr. Lowry mentioned that there are only two trust providers within the State now.  ComReg is likely to be the supervisory body.  There may be issues with an over-reliance on the private sector.  This point brings us back to the information security scenario and how it is foreseen that that aspect will be dealt with.  I do not suppose that it is beyond our ability to employ software engineers and designers to ensure that we can come up with something that does the business, even if that involves using an outside firm.  I imagine there would be some capacity in that regard because there is no shortage of such firms in the State.  I ask Mr. Lowry to respond to those points.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right.  Regarding how we can progress a technical solution, our eID infrastructure, which we propose that we use, that is the MyGovID infrastructure, is entirely owned, end-to-end, by the State.  It is unique in Europe and globally because there was no private sector involvement in its design and ownership.  We obviously used contractors and companies-----</p></speech>

If we take an example such as the creation of the digital Covid certificate, we used an Irish partner based in Waterford for that project.  It is very good and probably one of the leading technology companies in Europe.  The Department of Health and the HSE, however, retained ownership and control of the rules for how the system works and the processes involved, etc.  Delivery was undertaken by several technology partners, including the OGCIO, the Revenue Commissioners and private sector companies.  I foresee this project working in the same way.</p></speech>

I suspect, as this starts to take off, that more capability will be introduced from Ireland in itself.  People in Ireland have been watching how eIDAS has developed.  It has been slow.  As I said in my opening remarks, the technology solution did not take the phone into account, whereas even in 2016, people generally thought that the phone was the future of carrying your identity.  We used it and it was something we were comfortable with.  As I said earlier, we now are using it for shopping and so on.  In Ireland, we will see growth in this area as it is recognised that this will move forward quite quickly.</p></speech>

People are consistently on and a kid might end up using a YouTube account connected to an email address, then information about a person's bank card number is requested, which that person might not be happy to provide.  People are already uploading information such as passports, driving licences and so on as a means of informing companies about age or other details, as second checks.  It is probably happening on some level.  If we had something that was secure and you only provided the company with the information that you wanted to provide, as opposed to the means of allowing an 11 or 12-year-old to spend &euro;400 in one day, which has not happened but is a consistent, constant worry.</p></speech>

The underlying principle that the Commission is using is that regulation can be used to try to moderate the behaviour of commercial companies and multinational commercial companies.  There may be some areas where we need to own the identification process ourselves and that is where we can maximise control and assurance.  That principle is absolutely right.  Then there is the challenge of how you open that up and in what way.  We are seeing it in Ireland with our own electronic identity, where it is only used for public services but people are asking why they cannot use it for banking or things of their choice.  That is reasonable.  We are moving into the next iteration of the digital world, which is the individual understanding it better and wanting control of it, and wanting to see what a company does with a person's data, such as an airline when a person books a flight online.  People might ask if the airline is doing something that it is not entitled to.  GDPR and all of these things are all layers of the same underlying principle, which is that no one should know anything about a person unless entitled to for the purpose of that transaction and the individual should always have control over what those transactions are, when they stop, and when data are deleted.</p></speech>

We are back to easy-to-use systems which deal with security and privacy.  It makes sense that it is owned by the State rather than subcontracted to a third party, while accepting that third parties will have the technical capacity to be part of the build and the maintenance.  That is a different kettle of fish.  I add my voice to what was said earlier, that if we are looking at creating better circumstances regarding anonymous accounts on Facebook and Twitter, the eIDAS infrastructure could provide a means to facilitate them to do it while also requiring an element of leverage from the Government and the EU.  That should happen anyway.  I do not think anyone would dispute that.</p><p>This is something which is often thrown at me.  While I have Mr. Lowry here, can he detail some of the issues which have arisen in getting the digital Covid certificate portal online for people who are living in the North and those who are living in the South and were vaccinated in the North.  My understanding is we are nearly there.  If I was to take a guess, I would say that service will be open for those two cohorts this week.  Can Mr. Lowry explain?  I would very much appreciate if he could give an absolute timeline.</p></speech>

We are going through the final security aspects.  The difficulty was we have to be able to prove that an individual is an Irish citizen, in a way that does not compromise his or her privacy and so on.  The transaction is that one has an Irish citizen in the North who has been vaccinated there and we are not entitled to see his or her health record in the North, so what we are-----</p></speech>

There are two parts to this.  The first is to be able to have the Northern Ireland digital Covid certificate and the second is we can basically run a minimum data set to the Department of Foreign Affairs and it can confirm that person is an Irish passport holder.

As of last night, I understand everything is well progressed and barring some unforeseen problem or disaster, the portal will be up this week.</p></speech>

It has been a most informative morning.  We are in the process of trying to put together our cybersecurity network in Ireland.  We have an abysmal system in place with an acting director in place and no director appointed..  We are in a pretty sorry state for a country that hosts some of the largest information technology companies in the world.  Are we putting the cart before the horse by talking about digital wallets when we are not in a position to guarantee those data will be safe?  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, told us last week that every Minister's telephone was encrypted and yet a Minister's telephone was in someway compromised.  We are not 100% how, but it was compromised.  I am excited by what Mr. Lowry is talking about.  I have been in information technology for most of my working life.  We are talking about a huge step forward and we can all agree the benefits are incredible.  However, the architecture of the entire infrastructure will be vitally important.  We cannot have a single server or location managing all these data.</p><p>Data is going to have to be distributed.  You can imagine what would happen if I had to rely on my medical records, for example, being available through this information system.  If I was in Spain, for example, and there was a power outage or something like that in Dublin, then I could find myself in serious trouble.</p><p> With the best will in the world, the sharing of data across different sectors, particularly the public service, is an issue.  One of my colleagues has mentioned travelling to Spain and opening a bank account there.  We have seen how successful the Criminal Assets Bureau has been at identifying people who are in receipt of social welfare and who are driving around in Bentley cars.  Those cars were repossessed to the benefit of the State.  Can we rest assured that this type of data would not be shared across Departments?  I refer, for example, to the Department of Social Protection sharing data with the Revenue Commissioners?  While I see huge benefits in being able to share such information, the rights of citizens have to be put first.</p><p> It was stated that most countries in Europe have a citizen's identity card.  A digital identity would subvent the identity card or allow us to have digital IDs on our telephones.  Will the latter give rise to a constitutional issue for Ireland?</p><p> Finally, I am sure that serious legislation will be required to get this scheme up and running.  It is a really exciting step forward and will provide citizens with a huge amount of flexibility as regards their data.  Do the witnesses agree that the scheme poses serious loopholes and risks?  Most of my questions are for Mr. Lowry.</p></speech>

On the first question, you could argue that this is putting the cart before the horse.  As the Senator will know, with any good idea, you need to get an understanding of what the potential is for the idea in order to start to get robust questions about it, which is what he has just given me.  What the Commission has tried to do in the statements and communications it put out is to get people to understand what it is trying to achieve and then to hear user concerns in order to shape the regulation.  I have absolutely no doubt that in due course the European data protection commissioners will take a detailed look into what is planned and will comment in a very detailed way on any modifications that would be required.  That relates the Senator's second question on how the scheme will be designed.</p> <p>  The one thing that this scheme will not do is create a huge bucket in which every single public and private piece of information about us will be held and can be disclosed to anybody who is interested.  That is what it will not do.  I think it will be a distributed data model.  We are used to that, conceptually in any event, because in Ireland, for example, our driving data is with the Road Safety Authority, our tax data is with Revenue, our welfare data is with the Department of Social Protection and so on.  Any data that is shared in Ireland must be underpinned by a data-sharing agreement that has to be written in line with the GDPR.  Under the new process, there is a data protection officer in each public service body who must basically confirm that he or she is satisfied with GDPR compliance before it is allowed to proceed.  I know from the digital Covid certificate that we had to go through reviews by the data protection officer in the HSE, the data protection officer in the Department of Health and our own data protection officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before we could even go to the Data Protection Commission to get its views on the way forward.  So I think that we have a very robust data governance system in Ireland.  We will absolutely uphold that as we introduce this initiative or any other initiative.</p> <p>  In terms of the actual broader sharing of data, the key point is the idea of individual sovereignty.  I understand that if I want to buy a car, I may need a driving licence.</p><p>I may need them to know that I am legally entitled to drive that car.  They may need to know that I have proper insurance and so on.  All of that requires data sharing.  We were used to doing it by simply bringing along forms.  This might be a way in which it can be done more conveniently, for example, on the day when one is supposed to be picking up keys or whatever that happens to be.  We need to make sure that people are not retaining data for longer than they need to.  If a person moves from one insurance company to another, the previous insurance company cannot keep the same levels of detail and so on.  We need to protect that.</p><p> On the constitutional issue around the citizen's identity card, the one thing that underpins the MyGovID at the moment is that it is not mandatory.  It is a choice by people who want to receive their public services online.  Obviously, where that happens the State has an obligation to protect all of its citizens by making sure that personation is not taking place.  The State has designed a process that enables this to happen but it is not a mandatory process.  If a person wants to carry out the old manual process then he or she is very much entitled to do so.  We are seeing, however, that more and more people want the digital process because it is simply so much faster.  I do not see any compromise with the Constitution.  It will not be mandatory and people do not have to opt in.  It is entirely their own choice.  They can opt in for a period of time and then opt out again.  Again, that is entirely of their own choice.</p></speech>

Today we have spoken a lot about the use of the digital Covid certificate.  It is only anecdotal, and I have nothing to back it up, but after the majority of the population registered for the Covid vaccination we suddenly saw a spike in scam calls to mobile phones and so on.  I have always wondered whether there was a correlation.  Has any research being carried out into that area?  It is rather peculiar.  Either these criminals were all people who had nothing to do during Covid and exchanged their outside criminal activities for inside criminal activities, or else something else went crazy.  During that period we started to get these scam calls.</p> <p>  The great thing about the public service is that my PPS number allows me to access every public service and I can immediately be recognised.  I can see how this could develop in time and how a person's PPS number could tie all of the services together.  It is the one solid number that identifies the person.  </p> <p>  On the personation issue, even with the best will in the world it can happen.  Reference was made to social media here.  I have been impersonated on social media and I believe that most public representatives have at some stage or other.  Anything that will secure that element is something we want.</p> <p>  On the voluntary aspect of opting in or opting out, to a certain degree we are being pushed into a situation from a digital perspective where we really have to opt in.  It is becoming more and more difficult to deal with human beings in a bank, for example.  Even now when I go into my local branch across the road on Grafton Street there are more machines than people to talk to.  The opt in will slowly become mandatory.  The Department constantly talks about how comfortable we are with mobile technology and with digital technology.  That is a good thing but it is also a bad thing insofar as this comfort has put it into a situation where we no longer question things.  Back in the good old days when I was teaching IT I used to say that for every keystroke one makes on a computer somebody somewhere is watching it.  This is one of the crucial aspects we are going to have to look at as we move into this digital wallet: who is watching who, and can we guarantee that when I get on my mobile phone I am not going to be scammed with every keystroke I make?</p> <p>  I do not see a subsidiarity issue with this.  I see us coming in line with the EU, but I would hope that as we do we take all of the cybersecurity and security issues into account.  I thank all of the witnesses for their attendance this morning.</p></speech>

Is Senator Dooley still online?  No, he is not there currently.</p><p>I wish to clarify one point with Mr. Lowry.  Could private or public facilities, operators, institutions or businesses insist on the use of a European digital wallet in order for people to perform transactions with them?  That moves into the area in which the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland had issues.  The fundamental issue is that people should not be barred from accessing services if they do not have a public services card.  How does one deal with that in a European context?  Could private operators and state institutions insist on the use of a digital wallet in order for people to carry out any form of transactions with them?  Would that breach general data protection regulation rules?</p></speech>

Some of the writings and analysis carried out by the media on the whole concept of the European digital wallet have stated that there is an element of tension or a catch-22 situation.  Private sector organisations will not invest in supporting the European digital wallet if there is not going to be uptake.  They will want assurances from the Commission that the public want to and, indeed, will use it.  I do not envisage the regulation will require that if a person wants to hire A car, he or she can only do that using an EU digital wallet.  That would be difficult to implement because no two smartphones are the same.  It is a big step to assume that, for example, we could write an app called the EU digital wallet, make it available to everyone with a phone, and that it would be used successfully.  We will have to come up with alternatives and offer people choice.  I suspect that is where the legislation will end up.  As I said earlier, it is early days, but people are right to be concerned and that  needs to be represented in the discussions.</p></speech>

If I were a consumer shopping in another European country or in Ireland who wanted to use the wallet, could that shop or state institution refuse to use it by saying it does not recognise it and request another form of identification or whatever?  The corollary or the flip side of my previous point also needs to be asked.  Will Mr. Larry address that point?</p></speech>

They came together and established a set of rules which all users, including retailers, of Mastercard or Visa card are expected to use.  People are familiar with that.  By extension, they can choose to carry their physical card into a shop and use contactless payment or the phone equivalent as the shop will accept either form because the technology enables them to do that.  This will progress using choice.  If a person keeps his or her credit card on their EU digital wallet - the intention is to enable that - and wishes to proffer that in a shop, I do not think it will cause problems for the shop because, at the end of the day, credit transactions are underpinned by the infrastructure already in place.</p></speech>

I see everyone smiling; being on mute is a fairly regular occurrence by now.  I wish to come back at this stage, because I was conscious of time constraints at the start.

The British were aghast at the concept of it.  It was said it would bring down the government.  There is a touch of that about some of this and how possible it is.  On balance, having listened to the last two hours there is a lot of potential for it to go well but it requires buy-in.  Everyone said we would not do chip and pin and now all we see are people tapping cards and phones.  People are not carrying cash even though only a couple of years ago when I, along with the Chairman, was a member of the finance committee the chief executive of Bank of Ireland said at the time that Irish people like cash and want to have cash in their pocket.  Now most businesses tell me they are taking in a fraction of the amount of cash compared to pre-pandemic times.</p> <p>  The public service card was voluntary but mandatory.  It was voluntary if one wanted to have one but it was mandatory if one wanted to get social welfare benefits.  There were certain aspects to it.  There is always a fine line when it comes to data sharing.  I benefited from being on the finance committee where we discussed such legislation in the last term.  Equally, there are issues with freedom of information and GDPR.  There are a lot of conflicts going on.  I am not necessarily sure that I subscribe to Senator Craughwell's conspiracy theories on scam calls.  I presume his 5G improved once he got his vaccines sorted. </p> <p>  In terms of where we are going with this, do we have a timeline?  There will be a year of consultation.  I anticipate that just like metro and lots of other things it can be delayed.  The roll-out of the digital Covid cert was very rapid.  When will we see this?  Is there an appetite right across the EU, including the Commission and member states, to say that this is positive and to get a verifiable EID so that people can have their driving licences and passports, open a bank account, get car insurance and properly prove their identity while also having protections in place to ensure that people in Revenue do not know about people's health data and the people in the health system do not know about people's Revenue data and so on?  I do not believe they are challenges.  I bring my digital Covid cert to a restaurant and staff can verify it is valid without knowing much else about me.  </p> <p>  When might we as consumers and members of the public see a tangible benefit from this?  I appreciate that there are 27 countries involved, but do the witnesses have any idea of the timeline involved?</p></speech>

In order to publish the toolbox, that means we have basically agreed how it is all going to work.  It will take just over a year - 13 months - to agree a technical solution.  I believe the legislation is broadly working to the same timetable.  It will be ambitious.</p> <p>  Among the 27 member states, several are concerned.  Their concern is driven by the technical capability within their countries.  In some of the EU member states chip and pin is still very popular, as it was in Ireland five or six years ago.  Countries move on.  The overall target is aiming at a new euro by 2030.  I guess people have realised this will be a slow burner.  It depends on which way one looks at it.  Eight years can go by in the blink of an eye or seem like an eternity.  That is probably a realistic timescale.  </p> <p>  They think that by 2030 perhaps 80% of people will be actively using this in some shape or form.  If we look at how our society has operated over the past few months in terms of going into restaurants with electronic certificates and probably paying electronically, a figure of 80% is probably about right.  I do not think every nation will achieve 80%, but I certainly think Ireland will.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms McDonald, Mr. Hinchy and Mr. Hickey for their attendance and for engaging so comprehensively with the committee.  They have given us much food for thought.  This initiative appears to be very ambitious and, if done in the correct way, very worthwhile but there are still a number of obstacles to overcome.  I think that would be a fair comment.  We might have Ms McCabe and Mr. Lowry back in as this issue progresses.  Mr. Lowry got the DCC correct.  He did a very good job on it in a very short period of time so he has a track record and good form on this.  We will be guided by him and Ms McCabe and we look forward to further engagement.  We want to get this right.  We have to move to the digital age but at the same time we must protect the rights of citizens, particularly our own citizens here in Ireland.  Is it agreed the committee will now go into private session to decide our next steps?  Agreed.  I thank everyone for attending today at such short notice.</p></speech>
