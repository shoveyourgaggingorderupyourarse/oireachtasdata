At last week's Zoom meeting, we made a decision on the speaking order and seating arrangements.  If there are non-members present, they should note members will receive preference.  That is a decision of the committee and I will enforce it if needs be.</p> <p>  I remind members to turn off their mobile phones.  Members are requested to ensure, for the duration of the meeting, that their mobiles are turned off completely or switched to airplane safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not sufficient for members to just put their phones on silent mode as this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The agenda for today is the consideration of the motion regarding the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2020 and briefing on the review process of the Virapro hand sanitiser.</p></speech>

Under the terms of the order of the referral to the committee, we must consider the matter and having done so report back to the Seanad no later than today, 24 November 2020, and to the D&aacute;il no later than tomorrow, 25 November 2020.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, and his officials for the first session today.  The Minister is accompanied by Dr. Kevin Smyth, assistant secretary general, and Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer State bodies division with responsibility for the horse and greyhound fund.  The witnesses are welcome to today's meeting.  I now ask the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and congratulate his county on its tremendous win at the weekend.  It gives joy to the rest of the country to see a county win a provincial championship for the first time in 85 years.  It is good to be here with the committee members today.</p> <p>  An important pillar of Government policy is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to economic and social development across a wide geographic swath of the country.  The horse and greyhound racing industries make a valuable contribution to our economy.  It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of &euro;1.9 billion with direct employment of 29,000 people, and the greyhound sector provides an estimated 12,000 people with economic benefit.  The thoroughbred industry, in particular, brings a high level of international investment into Ireland.  Government funding, in addition to supporting these key industries presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment leading to a flow of income right through the economy, therefore providing widespread benefits for our society.</p> <p>  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level.  We are the third biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the United States as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally.  Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world class reputation for excellence in horseracing, greyhound racing and breeding. </p> <p>  The Government plan, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for living with COVID-19, does not provide, at any of the levels, for a return to full commercial operations.</p><p>This will impact significantly on the finances of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, both this year and up to the end of the time span of the plan in June 2021.  It is essential, in these circumstances, that additional Covid-related supports are made available to HRI and RC&Eacute;, reflecting costs incurred and changes to the trading environment.</p><p> These industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund, under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.36 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has therefore been reached.  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2021, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.</p><p> The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2021, include an allocation of &euro;96 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% going to HRI and 20% going to RC&Eacute;.</p><p> In order to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2021, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by &euro;96 million, to some &euro;1.46 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to this committee today.  The aggregate limit on the horse and greyhound racing fund has been increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009.</p><p> The 2017 Deloitte report into the economic impact of Irish breeding and racing, commissioned by HRI, indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry is estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.  Horse racing generates a very significant return to the rural economy in Ireland and a positive international profile for our country.  Of course, behind all the facts and figures are the thousands of men and women who, directly and indirectly, make the Irish racing and breeding industry what it is today.</p><p> The 2019 annual report for HRI indicated another successful year for the Irish racing and breeding industries.  The focus on ownership leads to a further increase in the number of horses in training and more horses competing.  There was also an increase of over 3% in attendance figures for 2019 and an increased demand for Irish horses at the sales, which was welcome given the uncertainty of Brexit.</p><p> As proven in 2020, albeit mostly behind closed doors due to Covid-19, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses are setting standards globally, and their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore Ireland's international prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level, despite other major racing nations having much larger populations and economies.</p><p> It is worth noting that Government funding, in addition to supporting this key industry, also presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy.</p><p> Horse Racing Ireland has engaged extensively with my Department and other key stakeholders on the significant risks to the industry as a result of Covid-19.  HRI has reviewed a number of scenarios and financial forecasts and has taken appropriate measures to mitigate the financial impact to the organisation and the wider industry.  The significant threat posed by Brexit to the current ease of movement of horses between Britain and France, in addition to the global nature of major breeding operations, illustrates that while Ireland, arguably, now has leadership position within Europe, its pre-eminence is not guaranteed.</p><p> According to the 2017 Power report, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly across the Irish economy.  It is estimated that in 2016, the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.</p><p>The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, highly rural areas.</p><p> The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system.  There is a strong commitment to improved animal welfare in this sector in the programme for Government.  That future funding in the sector is contingent on welfare standards being upheld on an annual basis and compliance with welfare standards in the sector will be strictly monitored.</p><p> My Department is committed to further strengthening the welfare standards in the greyhound industry in the time ahead.  Provisions in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which came into effect in May of last year, will make a real difference in this regard.  This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision of greyhound traceability.  The new Act will improve the governance of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity within the sector.  It provides the industry with real tools with which it can effect fundamental change and reform.</p><p> A key element of the new legislation is the provision, for the first time, of an IT traceability system for racing greyhounds.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann has advanced this system following a procurement process and it expects to have this system operational by year end.  Statutory regulation will follow in 2021 and this will provide a mechanism to ensure racing greyhounds are registered and traceable throughout their lives and enforcement mechanisms are in place.  The traceability system will provide for the recording of important life events in the life of a racing greyhound including birth, microchipping, registration, racing career, changes of ownership or trainer, location, export, retirement and end of life.</p><p> The sections of the Act commenced on 1 October 2020 and they signal a new era for greyhound racing.  They facilitate the board in focusing on its priority objective of achieving the highest standards of care and welfare of greyhounds.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019, when fully implemented, will enable R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to ensure the important heritage associated with greyhound racing in Ireland can continue under the appropriate rules and regulations.  </p><p> The greyhound industry is predominantly a rural industry with a strong urban support base.  The Covid-19 crisis has, similar to other sectors of the economy, resulted in a collapse of commercial activity in greyhound racing and a significant reduction of activity generally.  Recovery of the industry will require ongoing support to aid restoration of normal levels of activity and to adequately manage the welfare issues that arise.</p><p> The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  Betting tax was increased from 1% to 2% in budget 2019 and contributed &euro;95 million overall to the Exchequer in that year.</p><p> In conclusion, given the wide geographic distribution of these two industries, they are fundamental to the achievement of a more balanced regional economic growth. Relieving the burden on our major urban centres and nurturing rural economies is a key priority for the Government.  In this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution that they make to rural economic activity and employment.  The welfare of horses and greyhounds is a cornerstone of both industries and I am assured that HRI and RC&Eacute; are striving to ensure the highest standards for the sport and its participants, on and away from the racecourse.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has played a key role in providing this investment and has been instrumental in shaping the destiny of these industries.  </p><p> Brexit poses an array of substantial threats to the Irish economy and coupled with the fact that we are a small open economy naturally prone to volatility, it is difficult to predict what the future holds.  It is therefore crucial that we support these important industries that are facing the perils of Covid-19 and Brexit as we enter the year ahead.  Accordingly, I am seeking members' support to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann receive the funding provided for in budget 2021 and that the very important role played by these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend this regulations to the committee, and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#C00200"><p>At the outset, I want to tell the Minister that I am a native of county Kildare.  I very much support racing, which is really important, and I support the Minister's proposal.  When one looks at a great racecourse like Leopardstown, which HRI fully owns, we would not have that wonderful world stage today if it were not in the care of a body like the HRI.</p><p>I live not too far away from Leopardstown.<br/><br/>There are many challenges in this sector.  I accept that we are dealing today with the horse and greyhound racing fund, 80% of which goes to horse racing and 20% of which goes to greyhound racing.  When I first looked at this last week in the Seanad, I thought it was a phenomenal amount of money.  We are talking about &euro;96 million.  The cumulative aggregate to this industry since 2001 is &euro;1.36 billion.  I understand why it is that much but it is a lot of money.  What is critical is the governance of it.  I will make some further comments first before I ask one or two questions.  The funding will be increased.  As the Minister says, it will be &euro;1.46 billion.  That is a phenomenal amount of money but also a phenomenal commitment to Irish racing and one that I support.<br/><br/>Initially I was concerned but I wish to put on the record my thanks to the Minister's Department and his officials, because when I started to ask questions and ask for documentation, it was very much forthcoming.  I came at this with governance issues in mind and I am happy to say, having looked at the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports, that governance in HRI is strong.  Governance is the area I want to talk about today.  It is important because people need to know something about this.  I commend HRI on its strategic plan.  It has a plan and a vision, and it is also important we have that.<br/><br/>I wish to ask the Minister a question about the governance issue.  I understand there were one or possibly two vacancies on the board of HRI, with possibly a third in the new year.  I have looked at <i>publicjobs.ie</i>.  That is the website that has given me this information.  I ask the Minister to consider filling these vacancies quickly, with the prerequisites in terms of corporate governance, equestrian and all the other specialties.  That is particularly important.<br/><br/>I have two other questions.  Indecon carried out a very extensive report in 2012 and, I think, again in 2016, and the Minister himself referred to the Deloitte report.  There are many good recommendations in those reports that have never been implemented.  Working with stakeholders, I suggest that the Minister's officials in the Department, if they are mindful of this and think it is appropriate and right, dust down those reports and see which recommendations are still relevant today.  I ask that they be implemented because there are many good suggestions in the Indecon and Deloitte reports on the industry.<br/><br/>On the whole, I am supportive of the funding.  It is a huge amount of money, but we must consider the reassurances of the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose report for 2019 is, I understand, due on the Minister's desk.  There are now strong governance measures in place that we could not have always said were there.  I am in principle supportive of the proposals to fund the organisation going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments on and overview of the issues we are discussing today and the rationale for and the value of the funding.  I assure the Senator that a process will be gone through to assess candidates for the HRI board.  It is an open application process and recommendations will come to me with the qualifications of the people who have come through the process.  I assure the Senator that I will act on this promptly at that stage.  We will come at it from the point of view of ensuring there is a very strong mix of skills and talents that will complement the work of the board.  The Senator mentioned the importance of following through on and learning from the Indecon and Deloitte reports.  It is important they are followed through on.  He made an overall point about recognising the level of investment here.  He also very importantly recognises the fact that it gives a return and leads to a very genuine economic output, particularly in rural areas, and that provides a strong rationale from an economic point of view for the investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#D00250"><p>I will take two members together now in case we run out of time.  I call Deputies Carthy and Martin Browne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister for making himself available.  I, too, wish to put on the record that I absolutely recognise the value of horse racing and greyhound racing and those sectors to our regions and to many parts of the rural economy that are barren of many other economic stimuli.</p><p>That does not necessarily mean we should say blank cheques should simply be offered to any organisation.  Accountability and transparency are hugely important where public money is concerned.  The Department's proposal is that the best part of &euro;100 million be allocated to these bodies next year.  It can rightly be said that this is a recognition of their importance, but the funding must come with huge responsibility in respect of accountability and transparency.</p><p> People have been talking in recent days about the emails and the complaints about greyhound racing in particular that we have all received.  The biggest complaints I receive about funding going to horse racing and greyhound breeders are from the breeders themselves, horse breeders and greyhound breeders, people who love their animals and who have been involved in their sectors for years.  Their complaint is that the money does not come to them, that they get no support whatsoever.  That is why my question to the Minister is what exactly the conditions associated with this money are.  What accountability and transparency is put in place, not just to ensure, as Senator Boyhan said, that every penny that is spent is accounted for?  Obviously, that is crucially important.  What is the Department's direction as to how this money should be spent?  While there is an economic value to the sectors, it is not that every euro spent brings a return regardless of where it is spent.  Some places will bring additional support.  Just as in so many different areas, often it is the small local enterprise, probably somebody with a couple of horses or dogs.  Money going to them can reap a much greater proportional economic dividend than money to the large owners.</p><p> Will the Minister outline the objectives the Department sets when it gives money to these organisations?  I refer to the direction of the sports, the economic outturn that would be expected, where it would be expected the money would be delivered and, of course, the crucial issue of animal welfare.  Notwithstanding the fact that most people who are involved in these sectors treat their animals very well, we cannot deny that there have been some very serious allegations in respect of animal welfare.  They cannot be swept under the carpet.  Taxpayers rightly expect that if they invest this amount of money, the return they will get is that the animals are treated equally.  The difficulty I have is that it appears that these funds involve an 80:20 split that is arbitrary.  Why not 79:21 or some other figure?  Why are these funds not distributed annually on the basis of where they will have the greatest and most positive impact on both the sports and the economy, as I said?</p><p> The next question I wish to ask concerns the 2020 budgets of these organisations.  Have they been spent?  Is the Minister confident they will be fully spent?  We know that for a long period the organisations involved were not active.  We know that many of their staff were on the wage subsidy scheme or other subsidised schemes.  Has there been a preliminary analysis of the 2020 budget, considering that there was such an increase provided for in 2021?  Will the Minister give his view on the amount of prize money invested here?  I know that the argument the organisations involved make is that the prize money is the best way to ensure that the funding trickles down to all in order that it is distributed.  Has the Department ever carried out an analysis of where exactly the prize money goes and whether the redistributive formula is what it is set out to be?  Do the ordinary horse breeders in Donegal or Monaghan get a fair crack of the whip, pardon the pun?  They tell me they do not.</p><p> Going back to an earlier point, there is an additional &euro;12 million.</p><p>It has been said this is a Covid payment.  However, the inference that many people are taking is that, essentially, this will become the new base for funding.  It is a massive increase when we consider that in 2014 the value of the State subsidy was &euro;54 million.  It now come to &euro;96 million.  If this proposal is adopted, what additional standards and stipulations will be put in place?  The Minister referred to the legislation with regard to greyhound welfare.  How will that be marked against the funding given?</p><p> Notwithstanding the importance of these two sports, I am not sure the committee would come to the view that the best place for this additional &euro;12 million available to the Department would be horse racing and the greyhound industry when we consider, for example, how suckler, sheep and other farmers are struggling.  This is a particularly difficult year for many people.  The Minister has decided to invest an additional &euro;12 million, totalling &euro;96 million, in the horse racing and greyhound industry.  With that commitment must come a commitment for transparency and accountability.  I am eager to see the Minister's proposals to ensure the committee can have absolute confidence that the moneys in question are being spent in the best way possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I am from rural Tipperary where the horse racing industry is big, with Coolmore and Ballydoyle stud farms, as well as having many of the top greyhound trainers.  We want to see these sports thrive in Tipperary as well as throughout the country.</p> <p>  There are questions, however, as to how this money will be spent.  The amount provided to the sectors has risen steadily since 2014.  At that time the fund came to &euro;43 million.  Last year, it came to &euro;76.8 million, an increase of &euro;33 million.  As was said by other members, there are other areas in the agriculture sector which could do with that sort of funding.  Does the Minister believe that the money is being spent effectively?  Will he guarantee that the money is used effectively across the board?</p> <p>  Between 2015 and 2019, Horse Racing Ireland stated prize money went up from &euro;63 million to &euro;66 million, along with a significant increase in commercial sponsorship.  If it is bringing in more money than it was, why is there a need to increase the taxpayer subsidy to horse racing?  As Deputy Carthy said about Covid payments, horse racing had less in expenses this year but we are increasing its funding.  With the extra commercial sponsorship, has the industry considered rainy day funds for years such as this?</p> <p>  Of the extra &euro;9.6 million, much of that is going to wealthy horse owners and stables.  The smaller stables see little of it.  That has to change.  If we are asking people to subsidise a sport, it must be seen at local level.  It is the small stables and breeders which are in trouble and must get the most funding.  Has the Department considered getting the larger billion euro stables to contribute more to their sport and not have to ask the taxpayer to provide prize money?</p><p> Greyhounds and greyhound racing are part and parcel of rural Ireland.  With all that has been revealed in the industry over the past 18 months, is there any update on the progress made to address some of the concerns about doping and cruelty to greyhounds?  Did the Department seek any clarity on these issues before committing extra funding to the industry?  If it did receive commitments, is it following up on them to ensure they are done properly?  What level of oversight is there with the moneys spent?  There were serious questions about Bord na gCon in the past.</p><p> How much money makes it way to local greyhound trainers?  While Tipperary has some of the big trainers, we also have trainers with just one or two dogs.  Like the horse industry, they see little money from this fund.  For example, we have 3,600 people on housing lists in Tipperary.  The &euro;2.5 million in extra funding going to the greyhound industry this year would make a massive difference to the lives of those on the housing lists and to the council for providing houses.  There needs to be clarity from the horse racing and the greyhound industries, that everything with this funding is above board, as well as helping smaller trainers and breeders.</p></speech>

The horse racing sector contributes &euro;1.84 billion to the economy with 28,500 people employed by it.  Up to 13,000 people derive an economic benefit from the greyhound sector.</p> <p>  There is ongoing engagement every year between the Department, as the main shareholder, and the bodies involved.  We have a shareholder letter of expectation and engagement with both of them.  There are regular governance meetings within the bodies themselves.  There is oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as by the Oireachtas and this committee.  The bodies submit reports at the end of the year outlining expenditure, activities and results.  There is certainly much accountability and transparency in place.</p> <p>  Deputies Carthy and Martin Browne can feed into how the funding is spent through the committee.  All those in the horse racing and greyhound racing would engage with one another and feed in their views and considerations.  Both organisations in question have obligations to take on board any advice and feedback in that regard to ensure they are organised as best as possible to get the maximum return on the investment made in them.</p><p>That opportunity is there.  I have no doubt that any ideas Deputy Carthy has to better support that would be welcome.</p><p> The Deputy made the point about the arbitrary nature of the 80:20 ratio of funds.  That is how it has been since it was established.  It is arbitrary.  Like any organisation, both organisations have to make the most of the funding they receive and get the best value from that.  </p><p> On animal welfare, both organisations take this seriously.  There has been a particular focus on the greyhound sector in the last year or two, including Government and Oireachtas engagement with the sector and the work of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  There has been agreement that a minimum of 10% of funding it receives would go towards specific welfare measures.  Deputy Martin Browne also raised that point.   If one looks at what that involves, the last year or two has seen the establishment of a separate greyhound care fund, a Covid-19 greyhound care payment scheme during the cessation of racing activity during 2020, the progression of the traceability provisions of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 to devise a traceability model and a draft of those statutory regulations.  Greyhound care centres were established, the first of which opened on 28 October in Tipperary.  There are also financial incentives for the rehoming of greyhounds through additional supports through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, which was established and is operated by R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  There was an extension and increase of support under the RC&Eacute;'s foster care scheme to identify new foster homes in Ireland for retired greyhounds.  There are financial supports for rehoming agencies, the introduction of a greyhound injury support scheme to provide financial assistance to aid injured greyhounds to continue with a healthy life; the establishment of a confidential phone line to enable reports of welfare breaches to be reported for investigation by relevant agencies, an intensification of the inspection regimes of greyhound establishments and the rehoming of retired greyhounds in the US through Greyhound Pets of America, Finding Loving Irish Greyhounds Homes Together, FLIGHT, and Flying Irish Greyhounds, FIG.  There have been significant developments in the last year or two and while there is a 10% obligation on R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann in the funding it has received for specific welfare measures, it intends to exceed that.  It is underpinned by the new Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which was important legislation in providing a thorough and robust regulatory system for oversight under which greyhound racing can operate.  That gives a flavour.</p><p> Deputy Carthy raised prize money and where it goes.  Some 60% of the funding goes towards prize money.  In the horse sector, that is generally paid to six to eight finishers.  The Deputy is correct that there is an argument that prize money is very significant to the profile of the industry in its international competitiveness, which is a very important part of ensuring we are world leaders in the horse racing sector.  Many of the reports and much of the feedback and expertise would say that it is important it is underpinned in that way.  As I pointed out earlier, the &euro;76 million State investment contributes to an overall economic benefit of &euro;1.84 billion in horse racing, which is very significant.  It is open to this committee or anyone to come forward with ideas that would help grow the industry and ensure it thrives and gets best value for investment.  That is central to how both organisations operate and make their considerations.  If the Deputy has any specific ideas on this, they would be welcome.</p><p> Deputy Martin Browne made similar points to Deputy Carthy on how the money is spent.</p><p>As he says, it is a very significant industry in Tipperary and one the Deputy would like to see supported.  He made the point about the importance of welfare, which I covered.</p><p> Overall, there is a lot of common ground on the need to ensure that the funding is well spent, that it underpins both industries, and that they are supported at this particularly difficult time, given the pressures both sectors have had with Covid.  Most race meetings happening behind closed doors has meant there has been a significant collapse in income as a result of spectators not being able to attend.  That was a particular challenge last year and there will be further challenges in the year ahead.  In horse racing for example, the Christmas race meetings in Leopardstown are a really significant event in the racing calendar.  The cancellation of that event alone will see a &euro;3 to &euro;4 million loss to the horse racing sector, not to mention other local events that look unlikely to happen in the earlier part of 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#J00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the committee and giving some clarity on where the money is being spent.  I will support the motion in the D&aacute;il.  I would appreciate some clarification.  It is a lot of money, and accountability and transparency are important.  The Minister outlined where the funding is going, but I want to know about how the money will feed its way right down to the roots of the problems in the horse and greyhound industries.  It is quite possible that people at the top will be fighting for most if not all of this money.  I look at rural communities in west Cork and events such as the Durrus, Goleen and Drimoleague road trotting races.  Will funding get down to the ground for the likes of those committees and jockeys?  There is a jockey in my parish of Goleen, Deirdre Goggin, and she and others like her will find it very difficult to survive.  There has been a loss of spectators in the bigger arenas, and I worry that much of this money will only go to the very top and not get to the bottom.  Will the Minister outline how it will feed its way back into the horse industry?</p> <p>  On greyhounds, a motion is coming before the D&aacute;il tomorrow which I do not agree with at all.  The Minister's remarks here make it very clear that a big percentage of the money is going into greyhound care, payment schemes, care centres for greyhounds, foster homes, greyhound injury schemes, a confidential phone line, and the rehousing of greyhounds in America.  It is an opportunity that we cannot allow pass to give a percentage of the funds now becoming available to those schemes for the care and welfare of greyhounds.  We are talking about 12,500 jobs in rural Ireland in the greyhound industry and God knows how many more in the horse industry.  We cannot put that in jeopardy because, unfortunately, there are a few rogue traders who need to be straightened out.  This funding may help that.</p> <p>  Greyhounds have been a tradition in my area of west Cork.  Going back over 30 years, I remember my parents took me to Schull to see the winner of the English Derby, which was won by a greyhound that was lovingly treated and cared for by the Barnett family in Schull, and this brought great victory, pride and joy to our town.  That is happening in other communities.  We should not put any of that in jeopardy but ensure that there is animal welfare and that funding gets to the people on the ground.  Deputy Carthy remarked that suckler farmers and the sheep and dairy sectors are also people we support, but today we are focusing on horses and greyhounds.  I will certainly support the Minister but hope the money gets to those on the ground.</p></speech>

For those who want to see this industry continue into the future, I would say that animal welfare is core to that because a lot of the people I have spoken to who were previously fans of greyhound racing, in particular, were turned off by what they saw in those documentaries.</p> <p>  I have questions for the Minister.  We have heard that 10% of the money is being set aside by R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, for a care fund to develop and maintain a traceability system for the greyhounds.  I would have thought that traceability is a basic operational requirement, so it should not be included in the 10% that is going towards the animal welfare fund.  Will the Minister confirm if it is the case that the welfare fund is being diverted for operational costs such as traceability?</p> <p>  Will the Minister confirm that it is impossible to compare, on an annual basis, the reports on how the care fund is being spent because it changes each year?  Can we have a framework that would allow us to compare from year to year how much is being spent on care?</p> <p>  I welcome that the Minister said that there will be complete transparency and traceability of the whole life cycle of a greyhound, from the number bred to the numbers who die or are retired.  However, will that information be publicly available?  Will the Minister commit to there being a transparent and rigorous system of inspections of all greyhound breeders to ensure they are fully compliant with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the opening up of the greyhound care centre in October.  Will he outline what checks and balances have been put in place on those who run that greyhound care centre?  Will the Minister give a firm commitment to this committee that nobody who is involved in the running of that greyhound care centre has exported greyhounds to destinations that breach RC&Eacute;'s code of practice, which is that greyhounds should not be exported to countries that do not have adequate welfare standards?  If it was to come to light that a person who is involved in running that care centre has been involved in the export of greyhounds to countries that do not comply with the RC&Eacute;'s code of practice, will that person be removed and will that tender be taken away from him or her?</p></speech>

He made the point about the value of the investment in terms of what it does in rural areas and in terms of the importance of welfare.  He also made the significant point about the importance of the money being spread across all levels of both the greyhound and horse racing sectors.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that all levels are supported.</p> <p>  The figures from last year would indicate that in 2019, there were 370 horse racing meetings in racecourses of various sizes, and prize money is allocated to the bigger and smaller race meetings alike.  It is crucial that all levels of the sector are supported.  While we are a world leader in horse racing and in the thoroughbred sector, that can only happen if the sector is strong at all levels and if funding is spread across it.  That requires all levels to be supported.  It is important that HRI uses this funding in that way and ensures it is spread out.  That is an important point that was well made by the Deputy.  That needs to be kept in mind at all times in how plans are made and in how funding is spent.</p> <p>  On greyhounds, there would have been thousands of races at 16 different tracks in 2019.  Funding would have been distributed across all classes of dogs.</p> <p>  When somebody is breeding and in the sector, his or her objective is to have his or her horses either sold for breeding purposes or to supply others, or ultimately to see them racing and running, either at their local track or as high up in the chain as they can possibly go.  It is important that prize money is there for all levels of races so that there is that support and strong ecosystem in place.</p><p> Senator Boylan also emphasised the importance of the welfare spending.  I will give the Senator a breakdown of the spending around that.  Some &euro;1.32 million is provided for 2021 for regulation, integrity and traceability, while &euro;407,000 is provided for the national greyhound laboratory.  A total of &euro;991,000 is provided for care and welfare programmes and &euro;306,000 is provided for veterinary care.  As the Senator has said, the 10% threshold is being exceeded.  There has been significant progress in the past year or two in particular in developing those programmes and it is important that this continues.  I know R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is committed to that and as a Minister, I want to see that continue and be developed.  The Senator pointed out that the greyhound care centre opened in Tipperary.  I do not have an answer to the other questions the Senator raised on that.  We can prepare a note on that and I can come back to the Senator on those points.</p></speech>

While it may already be known, I want to put on record that I am chairperson of a rural Irish racetrack, namely, Kilbeggan racetrack, and I am a big breeder with one brood mare.  Having said that, it will be obvious that I will be supporting the proposals here.  Kilbeggan is a one-horse town but we have a racetrack and the vitality and the life that having that industry in our town provides for our community is unbelievable.  I note all of the figures that have been quoted today about the number of jobs created in rural Ireland through both of those industries.</p> <p>  From our perspective, how it works with the majority of the HRI money, which goes for prize money, is that the racetrack has to match that funding.  We have to come up with that money from sponsors within our community.  Likewise, the majority of the money HRI spends goes to development and improvement grants, where they give grants of 40%.  Again, we come up with 60% of the funding to match that.</p> <p>  With that in mind and with a view to the year that has been in it with Covid-19, some of those smaller racetracks, breeders and trainers are the big sufferers.  I would like to see the Minister work with HRI and RC&Eacute; in order that this money would filter down to the lower echelons of the industry.  The development grants have completed and hopefully there will be a new tranche coming out.  I ask the Minister that, along with HRI and RC&Eacute;, to ensure that this money filters down.  I mention the small breeder who would not be going to the big expensive stallion but to the lower quality horse, for which there is a market.  The sales for that market were upset this year and some of those involved even moved to the UK.  It would not have paid to go there.  Those people are the big sufferers.  I hope the Minister can work with both bodies to ensure that this money filters down, as has been said by previous speakers.</p> <p>  I have to comment on the debate to the effect that every year we come in here and we have members coming up with a punchline or a sound bite that is akin to selling the laying hen.  The figures are there and of the &euro;96 million that has been invested, &euro;95 million is being returned in the betting tax and then the income, whether it is through tourism or through the jobs I have mentioned in rural Ireland, is unbelievable.  We could take the money for one year and give it to one of these so called better causes that are mentioned every year but that would be like selling the laying hen.  What do we do the following year when the 40,000 people employed between the two industries are on the dole and there is no tourism income?  It is a fantastic investment in two seriously strong and important industries, not sports, in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  In the last Oireachtas, the Minister and I were both members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as it was then.  We did a lot of work with the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 and we dealt specifically with animal welfare issues.  I know RC&Eacute; has given out expressions of interest for care homes.</p><p>Many people have applied for them, been inspected and ticked all the boxes, but only two care homes have been given full ratification or notification by RC&Eacute;.  When will more care homes be identified and registered?</p><p> We are short on time but if the Minister has time I ask him to elaborate on Brexit, which was mentioned in the report.  This is an all-island industry and there are two racecourses in the North.  What ramifications may there be for them going forward?  The UK is our major market, along with the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

This industry has great involvement, particularly in rural Ireland, with thousands of jobs, and has gone through a very tough patch in the past seven or eight months.  In the Minister's Department, Covid has had a major impact on the marine sector.  It probably did not have the same effect on the dairy, beef or tillage industries but it has had a major impact on the marine and racing sectors.  That is why this funding is so very important.  It trickles down to every parish in Ireland.  We can all talk about our own parishes and how the greyhound and horse racing industry is an important part of them.</p> <p>  Some of us served on the previous committee and dealt in detail with the welfare issues.  I welcome the Minister's clarification and acknowledgement of what has happened in the past 18 months in particular.  The public wants to hear what is being done and where.  That is a great step forward and that is what we need to build on.  The welfare homes are obviously an issue but we have started them and we just need more of them to be rolled out.  That will be important to make sure we have confidence in the industry.  When tracks are closed with no spectators, one cannot get commercial funds to come in to fund anything.  There is a need for intervention at this stage.  The Laurels were held in Cork a few months ago.  There are usually 10,000 people at the Laurels night but there was nobody there.  Those are the kind of issues we are dealing with in the industry.  I welcome this funding.  It is important and we need to do more for the next eight or nine months because we do not know where this Covid issue is going to go.</p></speech>

Senator Paul Daly noted the importance of the smaller tracks and breeders and the pressure they are under this year as a result of Covid.  I agree with him and it is important that they be supported both by RC&Eacute; and Horse Racing Ireland.  I will relay his feedback, which concurs with my own, to those organisations.  He made a valid point about the necessity of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund for the support of these sectors and industries.  If we were to withdraw that funding from either of them, where would it leave them?  As regards employment, what is the alternative and what would happen in the following years?  That does not get enough recognition in the debates we have on this matter every year and that principle underpins the State support for both industries.  I take the Senator's point about the need to further develop care homes.  That is the policy being followed by RC&Eacute; and is my priority as well.  We will continue to liaise with the organisation to develop them.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about Brexit and horse racing, which is a significant challenge.  The tripartite agreement on the free movement of horses between Ireland, France and Britain has been significant in underpinning the racing and breeding sectors.  That is a real challenge at the moment and is something on which we are engaging with both the Commission and Britain.  We do not yet have an overall agreement, which we hope will be forthcoming, and we are all working towards that.  The fact that there is no overall agreement has meant many issues that require further examination and collaboration cannot be properly addressed.</p><p>As Minister, I am very much aware of the importance of this issue and will be working with both the European Union and Britain in that regard.  We will be one island from the point of view of animal health, so movement of horses between North and South will not be an issue.  It is the movement between east and west that needs to be resolved and requires attention.</p><p> Senator Lombard highlighted the significant jobs that both industries represent in rural Ireland.  I accept and echo his point.  He welcomed the welfare measures and the importance of moving on with the care homes provision.  He also touched on the pressure tracks and the sector are under as a result of Covid.  There is a significant increase in the allocation for the horse and greyhound racing fund in budget 2021, specifically because both State bodies are under significant pressure as a result of Covid.  Like many other sectors, particularly ones that are dependent on spectators for a large part of their income, they have not been able to hold races for a portion of the year, which has had very significant impacts.  There is an onus on us to work with these sectors to support them through this period, just as there has been an onus on us to work with all businesses.  In that context, we are working closely with them to ensure they are in a position to take up the batons and reins again after Covid and get back to a healthy level of income from traditional sources.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#N00200"><p>It is very disappointing that this increase in funding is so broadly welcomed by this committee.  This increase will bring the funding for the greyhound racing industry to a staggering &euro;19.2 million.  Last year, we learned that 16,000 greyhounds are bred every year to keep this industry going and almost 6,000 of them are killed because they fail to make qualification times or their performance has declined.  Basically, the industry kills about 6,000 dogs a year for not racing fast enough.  The Government continues to fund it and is now increasing the funding.</p> <p>  The animal welfare issues are bad enough but it is worth noting that this is also a loss-making industry.  Attendance at greyhound racing tracks fell by 55% between 2008 and 2018 and the combined losses for tracks between 2019 and 2022 is predicted to be &euro;30 million.  The Government intends to increase the funding despite the public outcry following the documentary that exposed unspeakable acts of cruelty in the industry, despite the fact that the industry relies on overbreeding and culling 6,000 dogs a year, despite a dramatic drop in both the number of people attending race meetings and advertising revenues, and despite the fact that only 16% of the Irish population agree that the Government should continue to fund the industry.  It is quite frankly ridiculous to see this conversation going on in the committee.  For too long, the greyhound racing industry has been kept alive by generous State subsidies  This is taxpayers' money and the Irish people do not want that anymore.</p> <p>  I am aware that many breeders and trainers treat animals well.  I am sure Senator Paul Daly is one of them.  In many instances they are the people in the industry who understand where I am coming from because the overarching standards of care in the industry are scandalous.  The ISPCA, which is the largest animal welfare organisation in the country, has stopped engaging with the industry because it does not believe it is serious about reform.</p><p>That is where we are at unfortunately.  The &euro;19.2 million the greyhound industry will receive next year will be six times more than the amount received by all animal welfare organisations.  The 10% going towards care and traceability is not enough when one considers that 60% is going into the prize money.  I strongly object to the increase in funding and the Social Democrats party and I will table a motion in the D&aacute;il tomorrow to reverse this decision and to gradually phase out funding for the greyhound racing industry and to increase support for animal welfare causes.  I do not understand how everybody can defend this or what the long game is.  Is it just to continue blindly pumping millions of euros of taxpayers' money into a dying industry that maintains these appalling standards of care and to keep defending it despite the public will to end it?</p><p> Many members have referred to the need for jobs and stated that this is an attack on rural Ireland.  What we really need in rural Ireland is investment in sustainable jobs.  The greyhound racing industry at present, when one considers the loss-making nature of it, the standards of care within it, the public disquiet about it, defines what an unsustainable job is.  What we need in rural Ireland is the opposite of that.  I will leave my contribution at that but I encourage members to consider their views on this based on all of this information which we often hear.  The facts put out by the national broadcaster last year have been disputed but have never been debunked.  Bord na gCon itself accepted that the facts put out in that documentary are true and it is our responsibility to take those into consideration when we are looking into vast funding such as this. I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

I thank him for allowing me to speak at this committee and I wish him the best in his role as Chairman.  I also wish the Minister well as it is my first occasion to engage with him.  I thank the Department and the Government for continuing to support what is a very valuable industry in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I know that the previous speaker, Deputy Cairns, is from rural Ireland but it is a different rural Ireland from the one that I grew up in.  When I grew up, there were greyhounds in the neighbouring farmer&rsquo;s yard, they were well looked after, like all the other animals, and it was an add-on and part of an industry of very mixed farms in south Tipperary, west Waterford and east Limerick.  It has diminished significantly but nonetheless the breeders, many of whom I know, look after the animals spectacularly.  In referring to that documentary, much of it was age-old film and sensationalism that was damaging to the industry.  Of all the people that I know, in the coursing clubs and who go to the greyhound meetings, and as the Chairman himself knows, in Thurles, Clonmel, Youghal and Limerick raise significant money for schools, sick children and different causes and charities at events such as nights at the dogs and at the racetracks.  It is part of our culture and heritage.  I look forward to debating the issue with my colleagues on the Social Democrat motion tomorrow.  Do we want to have a wasteland in agriculture?  It is going through a tough enough time at the moment.  I have no truck with anybody who seeks to neglect animals but every horse and dog owner has to have stables or kennels, pay veterinarian fees, buy tackle and support all of the additional associated industries.  This is all paid for out of their own pockets, income that they already pay tax upon from their jobs, or whatever, as farmers.  That is spent in the economy and supported.  I do not know what planet people are on to try to undermine, attack and erode this very successful business.  It is shocking and it is going on all of the time.</p> <p>  We have great prowess in the horseracing industry in Tipperary.  I will not mention any names but we are recognised worldwide.  Somebody mentioned that 40,000 jobs were involved in both industries.  How will those jobs be replaced?  Are the Social Democrats, who come up with these motions, or the protesters, going to provide jobs and incomes?  I asked the Minister that question and I am glad that he is supporting the industry.  </p> <p>  I certainly ask him to examine Bord na gCon to ensure that the right people are on the board who understand the industry and are involved on the ground, not high flyers and solicitors.  The problem with many boards is that the people who are on them are not properly equipped to understand the industry and it is very important that would be done.  I support this industry.</p><p>Many of these tracks are run by voluntary committees.  There are issues.  People give their time freely to support the industry and, as I said, there is a phenomenal amount of fundraising and support for different causes.  I ask the Minister to continue to give the funding but to ensure that there is transparency.  Any welfare issues have to be weeded out as there is no room for any of those people, good or bad.  We have the best of trainers who care for the animals and they resent being accused of animal cruelty and of being cheats.</p><p> I have one other issue.  Perhaps it is the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, who issued the instruction to release all the hares that were held for the coursing this year.</p></speech>

Anybody who has them should look after them.  However, there is this underbelly going on with the slaughter of these animals by other dogs and there is no talk about it.  Then we were forced to release all those hares, who were brought in by the clubs, well looked after, inoculated and everything else that was needed, in anticipation of the meetings and culminating in the international finals held every year at the coursing festival in Clonmel.  This is worth &euro;6 million to the town of Clonmel.  That is not going to happen now.  Apart from that, hares that are healthy are being slaughtered now and this should not happen.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to finish.  I am sorry for bringing that up but people who own the track greyhounds also own the dogs for coursing.</p></speech>

I spend a lot of time criticising the Government for things that I feel are not happening for many people but I want to thank it especially for this &euro;19.2 million for the horse and greyhound industries.  Like all sections of our community and all sporting interests, everyone is affected by this deadly virus.  There have not been any gate receipts for any event for more than nine months now.  </p> <p>  We have a vibrant greyhound industry in Kerry, including in Brosna, Castleisland, Tralee, and down even into south Kerry in places like Ballyduff and Ballyheigue.  People live for their greyhounds and their legs are broken from walking them day and night and looking after them.  There is talk about traceability.  The real greyhound owners have no problem with traceability or checking standards and transparency and they have nothing to fear.  Like many others, I was deeply disappointed last year with the RT&Eacute; programme, which threw the greyhound industry into a bad light.  It did not give a true reflection but perhaps there were some rogues.</p><p>We do not really know the background to it.  Maybe they were not there at all.  Maybe it was made up.  It is not true to say that 6,000 greyhounds were killed or that they went missing.  I reject and resent that very much.  Really, maybe they do not know where they went but it is a fact that when the dogs get older they are not as visible.  They are visible to their owners.  They foster them out to other people who want a dog in their homes.  That is happening and will continue to happen.  I assure the committee that it is in the interests of the people who own greyhounds and dogs, and the farmers who own animals of every creed and description, to look after their dogs and animals.  I was brought up with the idea that if we neglect or hurt an animal it will fall back on us.  This is the way the people of Kerry treat their dogs and horses.  They treat them better than themselves.</p><p> Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned Clonmel and it will be a savage loss to the economy of Clonmel.  Places such as Castleisland, Listowel and Tralee have suffered because of no track running.  They were all cancelled.  When the last lockdown began they were just starting and if they had known there would be a total lockdown they could have gone sooner.  Many jobs have been affected.  It is an industry, which is why I value the few bob the Minister is giving.  It shows the Government has an interest in the greyhound and horse industries.  We really need these sectors to continue for people's mental health.  People diversify in different ways.  All work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy and these people need their greyhounds like other fellows need their racing cars.  Everybody has a different idea of diversion.  Other people have antiques and people get into valuable pictures.  These people need to be recognised.  I thank the Minister very much for the funding.  I regret and resent the attack made on these sectors by the Social Democrats.</p></speech>

I have a question for the Minister.  The previous committee heard from representatives of harness racing who were seeking an allocation from the fund.  Has any plan been brought forward to examine funding for harness racing?  As the Minister knows, they came before the committee on a number of occasions and had plans made out.  Are they in the picture at present?  What is the position in respect of the funding of harness racing?  We have another section to deal with and I ask the Minister to be brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#Q00300"><p>I note the opposition of Deputy Cairns to the increase in funding for the greyhound sector.  She did not express opposition to the funding increase for the horse racing sector and confined her opposition to the greyhound sector.  She asked why we are providing extra funding and made the point that instead we should be reducing it and withdrawing it.  The rationale for funding of the greyhound sector is the same as that for funding the horse racing sector in that it is important funding to underpin both industries.  It underpins jobs and provides economic activity and return, particularly in rural parts of the country.</p><p>Without that support and funding through the horse and greyhound racing fund, the greyhound sector would not be able to operate.  Certainly, the sector would see significant job losses and a massive impact as a result of the withdrawal of that funding.  There would also be a significant impact on the horse racing sector were we to reduce our commitment to support that sector.  That explains the rationale for it. </p><p> The Deputy made points on the importance of welfare.  She pointed out a report on the number of dogs that could not be placed.  That report would be contested by R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann but it emphasises the importance of putting a robust tracing system in place.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is putting a lot of work into ensuring that is implemented and that is essential.  If we know where all dogs are at and there is full traceability in relation to changes of ownership, where they were born and right through their life period, that is the best way to ensure a clear commitment that their welfare is being monitored and validated.  That is why the funding is going towards that and that is important.</p><p> The Deputy pointed out that there has been a drop in numbers attending race meetings over the past ten years, which is the case.  There has been a change in the model and we have seen an increase in income for the greyhound sector from betting.  As has been pointed out by a number of speakers previously, due to the increase in betting duty from 1% to 2% we saw that increase to &euro;96 million last year, which covers the allocation to the horse and greyhound racing fund.  Racing rights from television coverage have also become a significant part of the model of income for the greyhound sector.  </p><p> There is a motion tomorrow, when we will discuss that in more detail and discuss the importance of continuing this funding.  I welcome, by and large, the strong commitment and support from the committee for the two sectors, while recognising Deputy Cairns's contribution and the points she has made, on which I have outlined my position.</p><p> Deputy Mattie McGrath made the point around the importance of the jobs and incomes that are supported and of transparency, which I would echo.  He made a point on some illegal activity.  I encourage the Deputy, if he is aware of any such activity, to immediately report it to authorities.  Anything like that is not tolerable and will not be tolerated.</p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's comments recognised the importance of the funding to rural Ireland and thanked the Government for same.  I acknowledge the Deputy's recognition of that and his support for the sectors.  Rural Ireland is represented in the recent budget across other sectors, particularly in agriculture, where we delivered an 11% increase in funding across agrifood over and above the budget last year to support rural Ireland.  We see that here in the horse and greyhound fund, too, because we recognise the importance of it, particularly in a year where the sectors are very challenged by Covid.</p><p> Deputy Cahill referred to harness racing and that is something I am engaged with.  I met with the Irish Harness Racing Association a couple of weeks ago along with some of my officials and there has been a further meeting with the association since then.  We sought a submission from the association following on from that and will continue to engage with it on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#S01100"><p>I welcome this opportunity to update the committee on the recall issued by the Department for Virapro sanitiser products.  I will briefly recount the specific issue that arose with ViraPro.  In the first instance, the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, notified the Revenue Commissioners regarding the import of a hand sanitiser product from Turkey to Ireland, from the same supplier of a product that had been tested in Denmark and found to contain excessive levels of methanol.  Arrangements were made to test the consignment and a number of other consignments that had already been imported into Ireland from the same supplier.</p><p>All consignments that were tested were detained, pending the results of the laboratory analysis.  Indicative test results were received on 6 October.</p><p> I wish to take this opportunity to correct one point in my statement to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 23 October.  When using information provided to me at the time I stated that results had been received on 8 October.  I should have said that preliminary results were received on 6 October.  Following receipt of these results, my Department informed the HSE of initial concerns about the safety of the detained consignments of sanitiser.  These concerns were based on indicative results only, without confirmatory results from a validated test method.</p><p> Confirmatory results were received on 16 October.  These confirmed that the composition of the registered product was not consistent with the approved specification and, therefore, there were concerns around efficacy and public health.  A compliance notice to recall this product from the market and from public use was issued to the supplier on Friday, 16 October.  The product was officially removed from the official register of biocides on Tuesday, 20 October and contact was made with the procurement service of the Department of Health the same day.  Then, on 22 October, my Department issued formal notification to the Department of Education and the HSE and apprised the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  My Department also took the additional step of issuing a public statement outlining the possible risks posed by ViraPro and advising the public not to use it.  I was advised of the issue that evening.</p><p> Since affected ViraPro sanitiser was removed from the national biocides register in October, my Department has been proactively engaging with the supplier to ensure its instructions to recall product are complied with in full and that no further sanitiser product from the original Turkish supplier is supplied and placed on the market.  My Department has also made arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners to detain any further consignments from the Turkish manufacturer in question and notify the Department.  At the same time, to assist with a wider EU level examination of how this product came to breach compliance with regulations on content, all confirmatory laboratory results are being shared with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF.</p><p> Responsibility for the withdrawal of products rests with the company concerned.  It had become clear by 22 October that the recall of products had not yet commenced.  Officials in the pesticide controls division continued to engage actively with the company to ensure a full recall could be made.  However, while the company demonstrated some compliance with the recall instruction, further deadlines of 28 October and, most recently, 12 November for a full and verified recall of affected ViraPro sanitiser products have not been met to my Department's satisfaction.  Officials of the pesticide controls division continue to engage with the supplier to ensure that the recall of all product concerned is fully completed.  I have taken the added step of asking the investigations division of the Department to carry out a full investigation into the circumstances around the importation of this product.</p><p> I regard the protection of public health as our key priority.  To ensure this, the Department continues to sample and test biocide products currently on the market to ensure their continued compliance with regulatory standards and thereby provide the necessary assurance of public safety.  In this regard, 75 sanitiser products have been sampled and analysed since the end of October.  I am happy to report that no safety issues have been found with any of the products checked.  I believe our actions, together with the arrangements made with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to detain consignments of concern from Turkey at the earliest stage were fully appropriate.</p><p> I am mindful of the need to ensure new sanitiser products are evaluated and registered in a timely fashion to ensure a wide range of safe products are always available to the public.  Accordingly, the number of staff members in the biocides unit dealing with product registrations is being increased significantly to ensure processing times of new applications are reduced.</p><p> Committee members will be aware that there has been a large increase in applications since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, with approximately 500 hand sanitiser applications compared with a normal 50 per year.  I am, however, satisfied that there are sufficient supplies of sanitiser available to the public to support the Government's actions on Covid-19, with more than 450 products currently approved and listed on the national register of biocides.</p><p> I made it clear in respect of the chronology of the engagement and the notification of the public that there are lessons to be learned from the point of view of the Department.  Given the nature of the recall, there should have been public notification when confirmatory results were available on 16 October and the issue should have been escalated in the Department at that stage.</p><p>There are lessons to be learned there.  I am also awaiting a report on the chronology around this and ensuring those lessons are learned for the future.  Certainly there is confidence regarding the sanitiser and what is available.  As a Department, we are taking strong efforts to ensure there is appropriate oversight of that, ensuring the available products are doing exactly what is required, and ensuring the issue which arose regarding ViraPro is expedited and completed to our satisfaction.  We continue to engage in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#U00300"><p>I thank the Minister for providing that statement and some additional information.  My first question relates to the clarification he provided in today's statement with respect to his previous statement on the late evening of Friday, 23 October.  He said that statement should have said the preliminary results were received on 6 October as opposed to 8 October.  In that same statement, he indicated that the compliance notices were issued to all four of the warehouses on 8 October.  Is that date also wrong?  It is just to try to get the timeline.  We now know preliminary results were received on 6 October.  The Minister's statement said that compliance notices were issued on 8 October.  Is that date still correct?  He also said that six additional samples of the product were taken for testing on 8 October.  Should that also have read 6 October?  Then he said the additional samples were submitted for testing to the Department's laboratory on 9 October rather than his original statement, which was that preliminary testing was on 8 October with further samples going on 9 October.  There is now a delay of three days.  I do not know if there is a significance in that but, perhaps, the Minister will clarify.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that his Department informed the HSE of initial concerns about the safety.  I gather that was on 6 October, so it was the day the preliminary tests were filed.  The Minister might confirm that and the basis on which that correspondence took place with the HSE.  Was that correspondence conveyed to the HSE as the health authority, in other words, in a public health capacity, or as a body that had ordered a lot of the product?  Was it expected that this was for internal management of the product that it had taken in or was it to disseminate the information?  The big issues is in terms of the dissemination of the information and the time lag from when concerns were first raised through the EU anti-fraud organisation, OLAF, and the Revenue Commissioners in September to the actual point of 23 October when this became public knowledge and, as we know, resulted in schools closing for a day and all the rest.</p> <p>  The third question relates to one I asked when we discussed this in the ministerial questions previously regarding the financial recoupment of the associated costs.  I know and gather that many separate Departments and agencies are engaged in trying to recoup some of the costs and, in some cases, have managed to have it fully recouped from their distributor or whatever the case may be.  Has the Minister put a cost of this debacle to his Department in terms of all these tests and, obviously, all the internal examination that needed to take place?  Is there a mechanism for the Department to recoup those costs, either from the original supplier or through another avenue?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that 75 sanitiser products have now been sampled and tested.  I welcome that.  It is the correct approach and I encourage that it be adopted as par for the course that these products are tested on a random basis from time to time.  There are 75 out of 450.  The fact they have all proven to be up to the adequate standards is also welcome.</p><p>Is this work going to commence and will the Department initiate a process whereby samples are taken from new products, either on a sporadic or comprehensive basis, in order that we can be assured that this will not happen again?</p><p> Having gone through the documentation the company provided to various Departments, including that of the Minister, it appears that it never gave the same information twice.  Even in respect of its product labels - I will not go through all the references - the word "de-ionised" was misspelled, suggesting a completely different word.  There are discrepancies in respect of communications, even with the HSE.  At one stage the HSE indicated that it could no longer access stock from the UK, but that it had secured additional stock from Europe and confirmed it was from the same factory.  The material safety data sheet provided to the HSE, however, shows that the products were different.  I am told that in one case, the health business service quote from the vendor referred to the standard to which the product conforms as EU Regulation No. 1223/2009, which deals with cosmetic products rather than medical ones.  All these discrepancies in the documentation the company provided to the HSE and the Department can be seen in hindsight.  Will there be a review of how these products are classified, particularly if we are to rely on paper-based assessments to allow them into the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#V00200"><p>As some of what I had intended to raise has been covered by Deputy Carthy, I will turn to the sanctioning of the company that supplied the product.  The product has been a cause of skin irritation.  In case people have long-term issues down the line, have we examined how the company of supply will be held to account?  In responding to Deputy Carthy, the Minister might answer my questions about the sanctioning of the supply company.</p> <p>  Given the current application process and the circumstances we are in, there has never been so great a need for this type of product.  The Minister stated the Department has employed additional testers or laboratory facilities, but how we can expedite the licence process, in light of the urgent need, while at the same time ensuring that we will not find ourselves in similar circumstances again?  Have there been any changes, based on the experience we have had, to the current application system and to the random testing of products after they have been licensed?</p> <p>  My final question goes back to one I asked the Minister at the previous session.  As he stated earlier, we have an all-island animal welfare policy.  Depending on how Brexit materialises this year or early next year, how will the all-island policy affect the licensing of products such as this one?  Will products that are not licensed here be smuggled, imported or whatever from the North, or from the UK through Northern Ireland?  Could such a scenario arise in this area post Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#V00300"><p>I welcome the Minister's statement on this issue.  It is amazing that the Department is involved with it in so many ways, given what its brief is.  I had not considered that it would be tied in to hand sanitisers and seeing what ingredients they contain, and the public definitely was not aware of that.  I might return to the nub of the issue, namely, what happened in Backweston and the campus itself.  Was a paper trail being followed, with documentation coming from a supplier?</p><p>Was testing actually being carried out on the campus itself?  How much actual testing of the product was happening in the Backweston laboratory complex in Kildare during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic?  Was it a case of companies issuing documentation in respect of their products, which was taken as legitimate, and the back testing not being done in the departmental complex as a result?  The departmental complex located at Backweston laboratories in Kildare is significant.  How much actual work was being done in those labs in the early days of Covid?  Were they fully operational, with full testing happening, and what was the output from them?  As I said previously, it is unusual that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was actually involved in this process.  I am concerned about the throughput in the labs themselves.</p><p> The real knock-on effect applies to the public and how it regards hand sanitiser.  We have one here in front of us and I was looking at the bottle as some of my colleagues were talking.  There is no indication of whether it has been approved, and if so, by whom.  It has to be googled to get such information.  Have we thought about putting stickers on bottles of hand sanitiser acknowledging that they are approved by Department?  Taking Bord Bia as an example, it has a major process of labelling its products so that the public is aware of their contents, their origin and that they are approved.  There is no label on hand sanitiser bottles to say that the product is approved by the Department or it is a product that it stands over.  If labelling can be used for food traceability, I do not see why the hand sanitiser companies cannot use it.  I googled the bottle of hand sanitiser in front of me and its origins are in Bulgaria.  Obviously I take it that the product is safe, but we need to have a system whereby a member of the public can pick up a bottle of hand sanitiser with due confidence in respect of the contents through labelling.  I ask the Minister to comment on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020112400002#W00200"><p>I thank the members for their questions and comments.  First, on Deputy Carthy's questions around the dates, the preliminary results were received on 6 October rather than 8 October, but the other dates are the same.  I would emphasise that the test results concerned confiscated consignments which had been confiscated at the outset and remained so throughout.  The Department issued a compliance notice to the warehouses to continue to detain the products on 8 October, and the day before that the Department contacted the HSE advising it to remove all ViraPro hand sanitiser products in use at the time.  That was on the basis that the product had been quarantined and most of it was HSE owned, so the Department contacted the HSE on that particular consignment, and then on 7 October it informed the HSE of the advice concerning ViraPro hand sanitiser products that it was using, recommending that they should not be used. That explains the correspondence with the HSE on the issue.</p> <p>  On the issue of financial recoupment, that is primarily a matter for those that ViraPro was supplying and is between them.  The Department is in an ongoing process with ViraPro with a view to closing out this particular issue, and it will be closed out before any further decisions are made.  Deputy Carthy also raised the importance of ensuring that there is confidence in the products in the market and pointed out that out of 75 hand sanitiser products have been tested randomly, there have been no public health concerns emerging from those tests.  He also asked if those tests will continue.</p><p>They are happening on a weekly basis and they will continue.</p><p> The registration of new products is a paper-based application where the company makes the application in terms of what the composition of the product is going to be, and seeks a licence to market it on the basis of the composition it is advising.  It is a paper-based process and testing does not take place at that time.  The important thing is that there is testing of what is on the market.  In terms of assessing that very question, the assessment would be that if somebody was making an application, we would certainly expect that the initial product would be compliant and that a particular effort would be made in that regard.  At the moment, it is paper-based.  It is essential that testing happens and the testing of the 75 products since then has given confidence in regard to what is on the market, and that will continue.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly asked about sanctions for a company and I dealt with that issue in response to Deputy Carthy.  That is an ongoing process and we will engage in that process until it is completed.</p><p> In terms of how Brexit will affect products and the potential for smuggling, in order for any product to be sold on the market in Ireland, it is legally required to have a pesticide control service, PCS, number from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Any advice that we have issued to consumers or to companies has made it clear that they must ensure there is a PCS number on it.  Any product that comes from outside the country would not have that and, certainly, the oversight mechanisms and audit mechanisms that we have in place in terms of testing product and following up, and any reports we would get, are important in regard to overseeing that.  We have made it clear to members of the public, as well as to retailers, that they should ensure any product they get has a PCS number.</p><p> In response to Senator Tim Lombard, I dealt with the issue about the application process.  On the numbers coming through the application process at the moment, there are 457 hand sanitisers or wipes registered by the Department that have been issued with a PCS number.  Of those, 373 would have been issued in 2020, so we can see there has been a massive increase in the number of hand sanitisers over the course of the year.  In addition, there are some 200 currently awaiting a PCS number and there is a 13-week wait time.  I have allocated additional staff to reduce that time and I am allocating more.  As members can see, of the 457, some 373 products with a PCS number have been issued over the course of the past year.  With regard to that approval mark or approval certification, the indication of that is the PCS number on the product.  That is what we have clarified for members of the public whenever they are purchasing product and also for companies selling them.</p></speech>

It was approved first on 21 April and, on 12 November, that product is still not off the market fully to the satisfaction of the Department, according to the Minister.</p> <p>  I also encountered this issue when I was on the council.  Why we need to go to Turkey to source something that is made in this country is a big puzzle to me.  We have all met parents and teachers since all of this broke.  There is massive worry and fear out there.  I had to remove this stuff from my own constituency office because I did not know about it until the story broke.  It dealt a big blow to the confidence of the general public in the use of hand sanitisers, and that needs to be addressed.  As far as I am concerned, the protection of public health is one of the key priorities.</p> <p>  What sort of assurances were received by the Department back in April when that product was being brought into the country?</p><p>Were there even any tests being done at that stage for it?  In the Minister's statement in the D&aacute;il, on 21 October, he stated that he contacted the HSE.  Why was there such a delay in contacting people?  Did the Minister know from the word go?  On 6 October, the issues were raised and the Minister was not contacted for a couple of days.  Was there any test done and what kind of assurance can the Minister give the public that these hand sanitisers, as Senator Lombard is saying, are safe?  Is there any testing ongoing on any stuff that is on the market that is being brought into this country?</p></speech>

I have just a few questions.</p> <p>  I put in a parliamentary question, PQ, to the Minister asking for a copy of the test results for this sanitiser and the amount of methanol that was used in it.  Unfortunately, it has not been answered.  Everything but that was written about in the answer.  What amount of methanol was in the product?  I am not expecting the Minister to know the ins and outs of it.  The Minister's officials can answer if he wants.</p> <p>  My understanding going back years in the Department is that it is a desktop exercise but then that the team would meet.  Am I correct in saying, because of Covid or whatever, that the team was not meeting when these products were being given the pesticide control services, PCS, numbers.  How often does the laboratory check these products?  Is there a printout of all the different products that have been tested in the laboratory?</p> <p>  On the 12 week delay the Minister talked about, there are people who have put in for PCS numbers in June and July who have only been contacted for further information in the past week or ten days.  That is longer than 12 weeks.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about the numbers and stated that more than 370 were given out this year.  Is it not correct that those were temporary numbers that were given out earlier on in the year?  Am I correct there was a decision made, because of the seriousness of the situation in Ireland, to give out these numbers?  Early on, the PCS numbers were basically thrown out fairly rapidly?  Was due process followed with all PCS numbers in that given time at the very beginning?</p> <p>  Finally, when does the Minister expect a decision for those who have put in for PCS numbers over the past five or six months whose applications have not yet been processed?  Thankfully, there appear to be vaccines on the horizon in the next six or eight months.  There is not much point in giving a PCS number to them next April or May, if we have an injection to give somebody that will result in his or her not needing hand sanitisers anymore.  The Minister talks about providing more staff.  How quickly will this happen?  The Minister came in previously and spoke about this.  In fairness, the Minister stated this service was being ramped up but the ramping up does not seem to be giving the answers in the number of applications that are still in.</p></speech>

As I say, there have been 75 of those done in the past couple of months.  There has been no issue arising from a public health point of view as a result of that.</p><p>I became aware of the matter on 22 October, the day on which the public was given notice of the withdrawal.  The Department dealt with it as an operational matter before that.  It is not unusual for issues like this to be dealt with by the Department.  Given the nature of this issue, there is no doubt that it should have been escalated to me earlier.  The Department, however, was dealing with it on an operational basis, as it would deal with any issue like this.  Preliminary results were available on 6 October and confirmatory results were available on 16 October, at which time the withdrawal notice was issued to the company. </p><p> The company supplying this product carries the legal responsibility to ensure that it is safe and complies with the licence to supply it.  In the event of a withdrawal, the company has the legal obligation to carry it out efficiently and effectively.  As I have noted, my Department is currently following through on that.  That process is ongoing.  I will comment further once it has been completed.  </p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about test results.  OLAF made contact with us on foot of tests conducted on ViraPro products in Denmark.  OLAF contacted the Revenue Commissioners after tracing some of this product to Ireland.  That product was confiscated and quarantined by the Department and tests were carried out.  Varying levels of methanol were detected.</p></speech>

The PCS numbers that were issued were not temporary.  All Departments have been impacted by the need to work from home in recent times, but the process by which licences and PCS numbers are issued must still be followed.</p> <p>  Regarding increasing throughput, as I outlined earlier the significant majority of the 457 PCS numbers currently issued to hand sanitisers or wipes were authorised this year.  There has been an increase in staffing numbers.  Normally a staff of four process biocidal product registration applications, in addition to carrying out a range of other duties in the pesticide control division.  Since the arrival of Covid-19 several other staff members within the division, approximating one and a half whole-time-equivalents, have been assisting with processing biocidal product registration applications.</p><p>A further two staff from across the wider laboratory are also assisting with processing registration applications on a part-time basis in recent months.  Since 9 November a further three additional staff have been temporarily allocated to the work area and it is planned to bring in four more to deal with the backlog.  </p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues Ms Kate Duggan, national director of services and integration.  I want to welcome her to the agency having joined us in August.  I am also joined by Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Mr. Ger Brophy, chief social worker.</p> <p>  The clerk to the committee pointed out to me that there are several new Members of the Oireachtas in the committee and that it would be helpful to have some general overview information on Tusla and its brief.  In this regard I have provided via the clerk a presentation slide deck which I used earlier in the year to brief Oireachtas Members on the 2019 annual report of the Child and Family Agency.  I hope the Members who were not at that presentation or are new to the Houses will find the information helpful.  I am happy at any time, as I have done since coming to Tusla in late 2019, to engage with any individual member of the committee or indeed the Oireachtas on any aspect of the work of Tusla.</p> <p>  I am aware the committee wishes to discuss some specific matters today, and I will be happy with my colleagues to address those both in this statement and in any questions might arise.</p> <p>  I would like to address some of the key issues that have been a feature of Tusla in recent times.  Tusla is considered an essential service provider within the meaning of the Government plans for managing the response to Covid-19.  In March of this year when it became obvious that normal life and activity for all of society would be fundamentally altered, I prioritised and have maintained focus on three essential services: front-line child protection; supports to children in care; and response to domestic and sexual gender-based violence.</p> <p>  In the first phase of lockdown significant and serious concerns emerged in these three aspects of our work thereby justifying the focus on them.  Of concern was the initial significant reduction in referrals to the child protection and welfare system, our restricted ability to visit children at home, challenges in maintaining contact between children in care and their families, and a then anticipated surge in domestic violence-related need.</p> <p>  Significant planning and crisis management on a 24-7 basis were used to mitigate some of the attending risks.  To give members some indication of the concern, we saw instances of referrals going from an average of 1,500 per week to 960.  Visiting children at home reduced to 30% of normal activity and while many remote means were used to connect with children and families this was nonetheless a concerning time.  However, I can assure the committee that those cases requiring priority response and visit received them.  Contact visits, known as access visits, for the majority of 5,900 children in care were in the main replaced with remote technology.</p> <p>  Now that we have reached level 5, we must remain focused on these priorities.  However, we are now receiving referrals of 1,300 per week.  We are visiting children at home on a routine basis and access visits for children in care are routinely happening.  Domestic and sexual gender-based violence services continue to report high demand and activity.</p> <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s education support service has been working to support children, families and schools to adjust to the new and challenging circumstances as they returned to school.  Additionally, our alternative education assessment and registration service noticed a significant increase in applications for home education in recent months.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to our staff, their representative organisations, F&oacute;rsa and the INMO, our partner organisations and statutory colleagues for their enormous flexibility and hard work as we continue to provide essential services during the pandemic.  I pay particular tribute to those in the community and voluntary sector who continue to support many children and families for whom the pandemic brings additional vulnerability.</p> <p>  Regarding improving services and performance, many members of the committee will be familiar with periodic commentary and reports on different aspects of the performance of Tusla across a wide range of services.</p><p>In the context of an ever-increasing demand, the agency continues to make improvements and these are often validated by external sources such as HIQA.</p><p> When I joined Tusla in September 2019, I assured the previous committee and the public that I would work to a position whereby Tusla would increasingly identify its own challenges, openly communicate these with the public and take the necessary steps to address those issues.  One recent system-wide example of this was in respect of the obligation of Tusla to report suspicion of child abuse to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Tusla identified a problem in its Kerry services; however, the approach was not, as traditional, in responding to this as an isolated incident.  Tusla immediately conducted a self-assessment nationwide, identified a 13% problem in this obligation and put in place the necessary corrective actions and audit to be assured in the future.  There was open and responsive engagement with key partners, the public and the media on this problem.</p><p> I fundamentally believe Tusla must continue to approach its problems and challenges in this fashion.  Serious issues and challenges arise for the agency, whether that is in compliance with the high bar set in regulations overseen by HIQA, achieving improvement in GDPR, which is a particular problem, or in consistently providing a timely quality service to all children in our brief.</p><p> The single biggest challenge in Tusla is consistency and whereas progress is and continues to be made on many fronts, we cannot be complacent because we know that the improvements are not everywhere.  In this context I expect we will continue to learn of problems and issues for some time to come while we work towards achieving this consistency.  It is for this reason that the reform of the agency on three fronts is critical.  These are practice, culture and structure, which all require attention and change.</p><p> I am aware that the board of the child and family agency is seriously concerned at the pace of progress in respect of the change of the governance structure that we have decided, and which requires approval outside of the agency.  This change is central to addressing several deficits, including in performance and accountability.  The current structure and organisation of the agency is, to put it simply, not good and while it remains, many problems will continue to occur and will require an overly centralised reactive response.  The board has raised the matters with the Minister, who has been very supportive of Tusla in his short time in office, and we look forward to an early and positive decision on this critical matter.</p><p> On the subject of the mother and baby home commission database, members will be aware of the recent attention to the mother and baby home commission database and the Government&rsquo;s intention for Tusla to be the host organisation for the database, pending new legislation to deal with many challenges for many people regarding their information and identity.  I am conscious of the commentary about Tusla during recent weeks.  I assure the committee that notwithstanding the very complex legal issues that remain to be resolved, the only focus of Tusla regarding adoption information will be to give the maximum support to all people, to treat them with kindness and understanding and to respect not only the rights but the needs of all.  The absence of legislation to deal with the provision of information will continue to be a source of great anxiety for people and the resolution of this issue is beyond the reach of Tusla.  We welcome intended legislation to address this.</p><p> Committee members had some additional specific matters which the clerk brought to my attention and I will briefly address those here and in our subsequent discussion.  With regard to social work recruitment, Tusla now has for the first full year a clearly understood pay and numbers framework.  This ensures that there are clear targets for recruitment by grade and profession, there is clear certainty as to what the agency can afford and not, there is a more realistic investment of energy in workforce planning and there is a greater likelihood that new resources can be allocated in an evidence-based approach.</p><p> The target workforce for 2020 is 4,784 whole-time equivalents, and with 4,698 in place at the end of the third quarter, this is the most stable the agency has been in respect of almost full employment since its establishment, and this is a significant milestone.  I expect in the coming weeks to be able to add to that number following the recent welcome budget decisions of the Government.  </p><p> Of the 4,698 whole-time equivalents in place, 1,674 are social workers, which is approximately 100 below the funded target.  Of the staff, 1,360 are social care workers and the increasing emphasis of any new developments has and will be in front-line grades.</p><p>I advised the previous committee shortly after taking up post that I was concerned about the dependency on agency staffing, which then stood at more than 650, and I undertook to address this matter as a priority.  By March of this year we had completed a large-scale conversion of agency staff to Tusla employment, and more than 400 took up that offer.  Agency staff use is now set at a maximum of 250 for the entire organisation, and we have in fact consistently operated below that since March.  This has not only had financial benefits to the public purse and benefits to our overall approach to retention but has also contributed to improved continuity of service for the children and families we serve.  Social work graduates are relatively low in number for the needs of the country as there are now many employing authorities all seeking social workers.  One hundred graduates this year expressed an interest in working with Tusla, some 70 of whom have been successfully hired.  Overall, 238 social workers started with the agency in the first nine months of this year.  That is more than the total for any full year since 2015.  In the same period there have been 130 leavers, including 14 retirees.  I have recently met the new Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the possibility of increased supply, and the board of the agency will consider corresponding measures to attract new graduates to this most complex area of work.  I also wish to note that in addition to this work being complex, I am concerned about the increasing threats and intimidation of individual staff.  While this comes from a relatively small cohort of people and we enjoy good relationships with so many, the online treatment of some individually identifiable staff is a source of serious concern.</p><p> As for foster care recruitment, we are very fortunate in the Irish context to have an alternative care system which is an international leader when it comes to the numbers of children placed with foster carers as distinct from residential care.  More than 90% of children in State care are now with foster carers, and increasingly we see a strong representation of relatives as foster carers.  There is little doubt but that recruiting foster carers remains a challenge.  The agency has recently completed its second annual national campaign aimed at raising awareness and encouraging others to consider fostering.</p><p> As for the making of reports to Tusla, I understand and am aware of the interest of the committee in the steps after a referral - or what the committee refers to in its invitation letter as a complaint - is made to Tusla and information or feedback that goes to the person making the referral, particularly where this comes from a school.  The agency receives a very substantial number of referrals from schools, both mandated and welfare, and local staff will support the school as part of the overall approach to ensuring safety for children.  Schools have, and use regularly, access to our local duty teams to discuss approaches to concerns in addition to the actual formal referral being submitted.  I am happy to address with my colleagues any more specific questions on that process.</p><p> The Child and Family Agency has many challenges in one of the most complex areas of personal social service provision.  Despite these challenges, enormous good work of a very high quality is carried out every day by our staff in responding to 20,000 open cases, 6,000 children in care, 6,000 children in education support, many thousands in receipt of family support and specialised teams upholding regulation in more than 4,000 cr&egrave;che and preschool services.  There are many other discrete parts to Tusla providing important services.  I am happy to take any questions and, again, I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.</p></speech>

All of that combined led to the very substantial concern that I talked about and was reflected in the significant reduction in our normal referrals by almost 540 per week for a number of weeks.</p><p> By the time we had reached level 5 we had attuned our services to ways of working.  We also accepted that we are an essential service provider in the sense of public and statutory services.  So we could not enter level 5 countenancing that we would substantially reduce our work, particularly because schools, cr&egrave;ches and preschools were all open.  Therefore, with all of the normal activity associated with what we do, the schools being open was a game-changer in terms of child protection.</p></speech>

There is a lot of frustration among those who are mandated to refer complaints due to a lack of consistency, which is something Mr. Gloster mentioned in his opening statement.  They feel that there is a lack of consistency, particularly regarding thresholds.  As to when complaints come in, depending on who one deals with on a particular day, he or she either follows through and comes back very rapidly.</p> <p>  Increasingly, a lot of schools have found that Tusla is bouncing back on principals and designated liaison persons with the child ultimately losing out.  In the words of one designated liaison person in a school, "there is a cover your ass culture in Tusla.".  They take a complaint, one will hear something back but, invariably and increasingly,  it falls back on the school staff who have training but training that does not equal what Tusla personnel have in terms of competency.  I have heard about that failing from the grassroots up in terms of education and those who are mandatory reporters.  I hope that the witnesses can address this matter, particularly the consistency of thresholds.  Is there consistency within counties, regions and public health regions?  Does Tusla look at cases where it has come up short and train people inhouse in its support centres?  </p></speech>

That is why I have pointed it out as being the significant challenge for Tusla and that is what Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, pointed out to us.  Is there an improvement agenda?  Absolutely.  We have a nationwide practice model called Signs of Safety, which is central to our approach to protecting children.  I am not a social worker but the model is very significant to our professional staff and is progressing.</p> <p>  I share the Deputy's concern about thresholds.  With 55,000 referrals a year, the processing of those does, unfortunately, end up ensuring that the most critical and higher end cases come first.  There is an increasing attempt to make pathways for all of the other concerns, including the use of extensive family support services.  The chief social worker will now comment on the school referral issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Brophy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#E00400"><p>When referrals come in to the social work department from schools and a variety of other sources, and schools are one of our top two referrers, the referrals are assessed in the first instance.  As Mr. Gloster has said, we have introduced a programmed called Signs of Safety.  Teachers may experience a series of questions that come from the duty intake social worker who, again, is trying to establish if harm is present.  We have gone around each of the 17 areas to ensure that there is more consistency than what there has been in terms of the application of thresholds.  That means, with the Signs of Safety model, we ask more questions, establish whether harm has happened and provide appropriate support.  Often times that would be welfare services that are based in the local community.  Working through that, if concerns continue, schools are perfectly free to, and often do, come back and have that discussion with duty staff on the second or third occasion.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Gloster to supply the document to this committee.  Moreover, the document should be circulated to those who are mandatory reporters.  I ask for that because the inconsistencies are devastating, particularly when one must go back to a family or child and basically say the issue has fizzled out so nothing will happen.</p><p>It is devastating and there must be full clarity and consistency in that.  I will speak later if another round of questions is possible.</p></speech>

I note that time is against us, so perhaps Mr. Gloster can respond at the end and he could send me written responses to any questions he cannot answer.  I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  The first issue is the significant drop in referrals to Tusla and the child protection and welfare system during the restrictions.  As Mr. Gloster said, referrals dropped from 1,500 to 960.  What supports were put in place for children at risk given that many of the usual supports, such as cr&egrave;ches, schools, sports clubs and other activities and agencies they are involved in, were not available to them?  What has he learned from this process and what would he do differently on the next occasion?  In addition, Mr. Gloster referred to the increase of referrals to 1,300 per week, but that is still a drop of 200 on the number before the pandemic.  This concerns me and raises a red flag because in other sectors we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of those trying to access services such as mental health services, addiction services and domestic violence services.  The reduction goes against the norm so perhaps Mr. Gloster will comment on that.</p> <p>  To return to domestic violence, there has been a dramatic and heartbreaking increase in the number of people seeking help due to domestic violence.  I have been in contact with refuges in my constituency and they have been inundated.  They often operate above capacity and have had to place mothers and children in hotels to keep them safe because there is not enough room in the refuges.  Tusla received an increase of &euro;68 million in funding in the last budget.  How much of this will be ring-fenced for domestic violence services?  For what, exactly, will the money be used?</p> <p>  I note Mr. Gloster's comment that the structure and organisation of Tusla are not good, and appreciate him acknowledging it.  I wish to focus on two areas.  According to data I received in a reply to a parliamentary question, at the end of August this year there were 3,799 children waiting to be allocated a social worker.  There is a clear pathway for a child to be allocated a social worker, and Mr. Gloster can correct me if I am wrong in this regard.  First, a concern is raised that a child is at risk.  That could be by a family member, member of the public, a teacher or youth worker, for example.  The case is then screened and if it is decided that there is still a risk, it is referred to the duty social worker.  If the duty social worker decides there is a risk to the child, the case is sent for assessment.  After the assessment stage, the child is put on a waiting list for allocation of a social worker.  At every stage from concern, screening and duty social worker to awaiting allocation of the social worker it is deemed that the child is at risk.  Having 3,799 children at risk while waiting for a social worker is simply not good enough and must be addressed.</p> <p>  I was also shocked to see that the area I represent has the highest number of children waiting for a social worker.  Some 833 children in Dublin South-West, Kildare and Wicklow have gone through the process I outlined and are deemed at risk, but they still have not been allocated a social worker.  Too many children are falling through the gaps.  What changes will be made to address this issue and to ensure that the position improves dramatically and very quickly?</p> <p>  My last point relates to retention of staff.  In my previous role as an addiction support worker, I attended numerous case conferences with Tusla.  These often occurred over time.  The people in attendance were the parent or parents of the child at risk, the teacher, support workers like me, social workers and area managers from Tusla.  Often the area manager and social worker who attended the follow-up meetings were not the same people who attended the first meeting.  This would have an impact on the continuum of care and continuity in the process.  I was the same support worker and the parent and teacher were the same, but the representation from Tusla was not always the same.  As Mr. Gloster mentioned, up to September this year Tusla has hired 238 new staff, but in the same time 116 people left Tusla and are not returning.  What is the impact on the service provided to children at risk of losing so many experienced people and replacing them with people who are only learning the role?  What will Mr. Gloster put in place to retain staff and ensure the continuity of care I mentioned earlier?</p><p>I did not need much time and I will take any answers I can get to my questions.</p></speech>

I will deal with two aspects regarding the unallocated cases and the provision regarding domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, services.  As the Deputy said, the number of unallocated cases remains a concern for us.  However, 94% of children in care have an allocated social worker and 75% of other children in care also have an allocated social worker.  Of those who are awaiting allocation, 44% of them are active on duty.  That means - to return to the Deputy's reference to the risk of harm or of abuse that may be in place - actions are being undertaken for those children's care by a dedicated duty team, social workers or by a rotating social worker off the roster.  It is a significant challenge for us.  It is one on which we have put a significant focus.  Certainly, since I joined the agency in August it has been a priority for me.  Since January to date, there has been a 31% decrease but, as the Deputy said, there are a number of areas with respect to Dublin-South-West, Kildare-west Wicklow and Dublin South-Central where it still remains a problem for us.  That is linked to a number of factors, including increased referral and the staffing rates within those areas.  Towards the end of the year we allocated initial once-off funding of about &euro;150,000 and have taken in additional staff to address that need.  Regarding additional resources in the allocation for 2021, the chief executive officer, CEO, might deal with that.  Our focus will be on those specific areas where the unallocated cases are a problem for us.  I reassure the Deputy those children who may not have a dedicated named social worker are actively being managed by the social work service within the Department.</p> <p>  Regarding DSGBV services, we all share the concerns in the demand we have seen for them in the context of Covid-19 and throughout the pandemic since March.  In terms of our services, I will leave it to the CEO to talk about the additional funding in the 2021 budget.  However, directly in respect of Covid, Tusla funds 60 agencies currently across Ireland to provide DSGBV services.  In terms of the accommodation we support, currently there are 143 accommodation units open, 103 of which are our normal units.  As the Deputy said, with the impact of Covid, there has been a reduction in about 36 with respect to social distancing and staffing.  There are 103 of the original 139 allocation.  We have funded 25 additional off-site units and an additional 15 safe homes.  The capacity currently is for 143 units and 106 of those are currently occupied.  Certainly we do share the concern about access being an issue, particularly in certain parts of the country.  We have commissioned an accommodation review which Tusla is undertaking, which will be finished in quarter 2 of 2021.  It will map out the existing accommodation units that are available in terms of geographical location and the type of service they offer, also identifying, as part of that, the future requirements, including the service model, as we move beyond 2021.  I will defer to the CEO to deal with the additional budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#G00600"><p>Briefly, the funding for domestic violence services within Tusla is a spend of &euro;25 million.  That is the current core budget.  The budget is increasing next year essentially to &euro;30 million, which is what the Deputy would have heard the Minister refer to in recent days.  That money is essentially broken into a &euro;2.7 million increase in core funding and another &euro;2 million will go directly to the funded agencies providing services as part of contingency support for them, as we see how the impact of Covid unfolds in the first half of 2021.  The impact is as much in the post-easing of restrictions as is it during the restrictions.  That addresses the money aspect.</p><p>I take the point about the structure and the Deputy was acknowledging what I had said.</p><p> On referrals, we are running at between 1,300 and 1,350 per week and we had previously been up between 1,490 and 1,500.  Those variations can happen, partly because the schools are settling down in the reopening phase and a lot of health professionals who would have been seeing children in routine circumstances are not seeing them in the same routine way because the health services are significantly redeployed and focused on different parts of the response to Covid-19.  There are a variety of reasons for that and it also has to do with catch-up in our system.  Once the referrals started to recover, the concern eased.</p><p> I mentioned the support for children at risk during the first lockdown.  I thanked the community and voluntary sector, in particular, as well as the school completion programmes and our staff in centres around the country.  The amount of work that went into making contact with and keeping an eye on children and families in a supportive way was extensive and I am satisfied with that response.  In addition, I mention children who might have been seen as being at risk in the context of the domestic violence space.  The Garda's Operation Faoiseamh was an outstanding contributor to public safety for some of the most vulnerable people during that March and April phase.  Now that schools and everything else are open, that is the most significant change.  I know there was a lot of commentary and discussion about schools as we were going into level 5.  Everybody clearly understands and accepts the need to keep the school system as open and safe as possible, not just for the educational benefits but for all the other issues that have been mentioned.</p><p> I could not agree more with the Deputy about the retention of staff.  It is part of the consistency issue that I and the agency are seeking to address but it takes time.  Our retention rates have improved, however, and our capacity to increase recruitment has improved.  The Deputy mentioned the additional funding in the budget adjustment of &euro;61 million to Tusla.  Part of that is correcting a deficit of &euro;13 million that was already there but I envisage being able to deploy approximately 100 to 120 additional front-line staff in 2021.  That would go a substantial way towards addressing the concern the Deputy expressed about the allocated cases because that is exactly where the resources and money will go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#H00200"><p>I have a lot of things to ask about but I will try to focus on five minutes' worth of issues.  The agency conversion was good work and it has helped with that stability of staffing and workforce, which is so important for all sorts of reasons.</p> <p>  The investment in mobile working through laptops, remote access, Wi-Fi dongles and so on not only reflects the way social workers work and enables them to work but it has been a major benefit in the face of Covid-19 to enable working from home and working remotely.  That has to be highlighted as a success of Tusla in recent years.</p> <p>  On the targets for the workforce, I would love to know more about the figure of 4,784 and how Tusla got that.  If one looks at the UK, a huge amount of work goes into trying to estimate the demand for social work services, both in staffing and in fostering and recruitment.  There are measures of flow in which one can guess the number of children who are likely to come into care based on demographics.  We have measures for the pressure so we know how many cases a social worker should be carrying.  Therefore, we should be able to work out how many social workers we need.  However, what I hear from social workers on the ground is frustration at the lack of administrative support.  The cases they carry still have a huge amount of paperwork.  I hear frustration from some senior managers on a hiring freeze and a struggle to get posts filled.  I would love to hear more about that kind of work from the witnesses because that ties in with all of the important points that were previously raised.</p> <p>  One of the other matters I would like to jump to is fostering.  How many people within Tusla do nothing but recruitment?  Recruitment of general foster carers is on a knife-edge.</p><p>We have an excellent system with excellent carers who provide an excellent service to vulnerable young people and it is really on a knife edge if we cannot keep recruiting.  How many people do nothing but recruitment?  How many of them come with a marketing or similar background?  My concern regarding keeping the service going is that we will rely more on private fostering, which has a significantly higher marginal cost, and children placed in private care also tend to be placed further from their home, which has all sorts of other impacts.  We also have huge runaway costs in terms of private residential units, so any information Mr. Gloster has on steps being taken on cost control for private fostering and private residential units would be useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#J00200"><p>That is a long list.  I will do the best I can to quickly respond.  Deputy Costello is correct that the agency conversion was very significant and it brought many benefits.  Our mobile technology went from about 3,800 people at the start of Covid and we took it right up to the maximum of about 4,300 to ensure that we could remotely work across the system and that has brought huge benefits.</p> <p>  To be clear, the workforce of 4,784 is not indicative of need.  The Deputy is quite right that is not based on a needs assessment.  What I am talking about is the funded workforce within Tusla.  In other words, that is the number we have money to employ.  There are lots of models around need and need identification.  I will let Ms Duggan speak in a moment about some of the approach taken to 2021 because the approach up to more recent years was somewhat historical.</p> <p>  Administrative staff have substantially increased in terms of grade 3 and grade 4 clerical officers, who support social work teams.  While there was an increase, it could always be more because, as the Deputy is aware, the regulatory burden on child protection services is very high.  The paperwork requirement is very high, but the situation has improved substantially from what it was.</p> <p>  I find the reference to a hiring freeze a little bit frustrating because since I came to Tusla there has been anything but a hiring freeze.  What there has been is complete clarity for each of our regions as to what its affordable workforce was, and they were allowed to recruit to that.  In 2020, that included an agreement with the Minister not to reduce any services because we had a deficit.  The deficit has now been dealt with in the allocation coming into 2021 but we were going to finish 2020 with a deficit and that was going to happen because we were not going to cut services.  The hiring freeze is somewhat debatable.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Duggan to talk about the fostering campaign in terms of fostering recruitment.  I do not have the exact number of people solely focused on the recruitment of foster carers.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on that.  We do have communications experts involved.  Ms Duggan might wish to briefly comment on the recruitment of foster carers and recruitment generally.</p></speech>

Within Tusla at the moment, there are approximately 5,913 children in care in Ireland and 91% of those are in foster care.  Some 29% of them were with relative foster carers and 71% were with non-relative foster carers.  Approximately 8% are within private foster care.  As the Deputy referenced, there has been a small increase in the number of children within private foster care placements.  That is linked either to the availability of foster carers within a particular area or within the match that is required in terms of the presentation of the particular child or children within the family.  Our priority within Tusla, as the Deputy is aware, is to provide the best placement for a child, relative to what the child needs or requires.</p> <p>  To date in 2020, we have 194 new foster carers approved within Tusla and 28 private applications for foster caring.  That is compared to 226 for the whole year in 2019, which was 193 approved within Tusla and 33 private foster carers.  I share the view that we need to look at fostering staff having almost an expertise in marketing because we are up against the private agency in terms of its capacity and the type of marketing it uses to attract carers and families within geographical regions.</p><p> What I can say is that in this year's Tusla fostering campaign, called Raising Amazing, a significant amount of work went into it from a marketing perspective, particularly in relation to debunking some of the myths that exist about the types of people who we want to become foster carers within communities.  A lot of work was done in respect of attracting minority families and letting them know that we want them to apply and to become foster carers.  Within that campaign we received a total of 311 enquiries, which was up 67 on last year's total.  A huge part of the campaign this year was around social media, and we had social media expertise supporting us on that campaign.  We had around 240,000 hits across all of the different social media platforms in Tusla, so we recognise the need to move into a different space in terms of attracting foster carers to Tusla and in debunking the myths so that people across Ireland, from all different types of families or units, understand that we want to hear from them in expressing an interest in becoming foster carers for Tusla.</p></speech>

We missed slightly the explanation Mr. Gloster was providing for the funding increase, because the signal went at the beginning of that piece.  He was telling us about the &euro;30 million available next year for the DSGPV sector.  I ask him to clarify this.  He was giving us a breakdown about how that is going to be spent and we only heard the last bit of it, so I would appreciate him going over it, and perhaps sharing his thoughts on how that relates to Safe Ireland and what it has put forward as being a national services development plan.</p></speech>

The Minister has now determined and announced an increase for 2021 to a total provision of &euro;30 million.  Of the &euro;25.3 million provided in 2020, the majority of that, about &euro;23.5 million, has been given directly to the 60 provider agencies that operate on our behalf in the space of domestic violence response, including Safe Ireland and many others.  All of the increase in funding in 2021 is going directly to that sector, so Tusla's own internal direct spend is not increasing.  The increase will essentially break down as follows.  A total of &euro;2.7 million will go into what is called core funding, so from January, the sector will increase by &euro;2.7 million.  The actual allocation to individual agencies has not yet been finalised within that because it is not simply a case of dividing &euro;2.7 million by 60 agencies, because although they all have needs, some have different pressures.</p> <p>  That funding takes the funding for the sector up to &euro;28 million, and in addition to that, provision has been made to set aside &euro;2 million specifically to support the sector through those organisations to respond further to what are unknown challenges that Covid has yet to bring for the sector.  However, all of that &euro;2 million will be spent, made available and utilised within the sector in 2021, so that will bring the total spend in 2021 to &euro;30 million.</p></speech>

On the issue of the mother and baby homes commission database, has the data privacy impact assessment, DPIA, on that been published?</p></speech>

In fact, I had a meeting with the team about it just before I came here today.  It is very active in terms of completing a full and robust data privacy impact assessment, which everyone would accept is required in the context of what is at issue here.  The database itself has not yet physically transferred to us, so that makes the data privacy impact assessment a little bit slower and more considered.</p><p>What I anticipate happening, if there are no obstacles, is that we will have concluded the report, based on everything known to us about a data protection impact assessment, by about the middle of December, or around 18 December.  Due to the public interest issues and the significance of the report, I intend to then publish it on the Tusla website.  The data privacy impact assessment is of itself an iterative process.  In other words, what we publish is open to further commentary and contributions from people and if it requires further amendment as we go on, we will do that.  My intention is that the data privacy impact assessment, from the best call we can make on it, will be published and available by around 18 December. </p></speech>

My final question is on the training around GDPR.  On 4 November, the Data Protection Commissioner published a finding against Tusla in relation to three breaches.  Two of them related to giving the details of foster carers.  The third was very serious, although I acknowledge that it was inadvertent, and involved someone giving the address and details of a child to an accused abuser.  Can Mr. Gloster reassure us as to the training provided on GDPR by Tusla?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#L00300"><p>I can certainly reassure the Senator about the training but I would not for one minute give her any significant assurance about the scale of improvement that has yet to be achieved.  This is a very complex matter and I have addressed it in the public domain on a number of occasions.  I have sat in front of some of the people affected by the more serious data breaches, including some cases to which the Senator referred.  All I can say to her is that one could not be indifferent to the impact on these people, regardless of the breach being accidental or unintended.</p> <p>  We had a very complex GDPR programme in the agency over the last while, in order to develop much of the technical expertise, but the reality was that we also needed to get out to the front line more quickly.  We started a process in late September of training 30 people per session, in two sessions a day, up and down the country.  It is online, fully interactive and taught by expert staff.  It is a good training programme on which there is very good feedback.  Our target is to reach over 3,000 front-line workers by the end of January and to date we have reached around 1,100.  A huge effort is going into it but we are some way off reaching a satisfactory level of GDPR compliance because we process information in tens of thousands of interactions throughout the year.  We are coming from a historical base, we are challenged and we have 350 locations across the country so there is a way to go.  However, I assure the Senator that no effort is being spared in this matter. </p></speech>

I begin by thanking Tusla for the work it does.  I thank all the area managers, the individual social workers and all those in the emergency services who work day in, day out with very vulnerable children who are going through a lot in their lives.  I can see that these people are under a lot of strain and I thank them because they are providing our society with an invaluable service.</p> <p>  I have a few questions about aftercare.  What is the fallout for those who do not go into education or training?  Where do those children go?  Are there any supports for those young people?  Recently I have noticed that there is a lot of sexual and gender-based violence towards the children who are coming into care.  Maybe that is something we need to teach in all our schools or go through with parents.  I do not know how Tusla will deal with that.  Many of the children coming into care now are struggling with their sexuality or struggling with having those conversations with their parents, who may not be as understanding as we would like them to be.</p><p>That is when relationships can break down.  I was not aware of the family support services that exist in Tusla.  I want more information on them because they are new to me.  I understand there is a support service for existing family units that may be struggling with issues.  What supports does Tusla put in place for those families, rather than having them break up?  </p><p> I am concerned about the 1,300 new inquiries being received weekly.  That is a massive amount.  Considering Tusla's staffing, there will be children who will not be seen as quickly as they should be.  It is important that children and young people know that if they are suffering, they should speak to the one good adult in their life who can be their voice in a very tough time, and that they can seek refuge somewhere.  Some people take the young people to Garda stations and they are taken into care under section 12 in that way.  There is help for children and young people who are suffering and it can be immediate if they are in danger.  I want people to know that.  Some people think there is a long wait for care, but that is not the case.  The services kick in very quickly when a child or youth is in danger.  </p><p> I want to know about aftercare and foster care recruitment.  I attended a number of meetings.  It is incumbent on people who are involved in the foster care system to encourage other parents and other family units, regardless of what they are, to get involved and to provide a safe, loving and caring home for a young child.  Recruitment meetings are really important and getting testimonies from parents and foster parents is the key to winning over new foster parents.  It is probably one of the best things I have ever done.  Sitting here is important but there is nothing quite like creating a safe place for a child.  I do emergency care now.  That is really important.  Parents, families and individuals need to know that they can make a difference in a child's life.  What is Tusla doing about recruitment, which is so important?  It is much better for a child to be in a family unit or family home than in a residential unit.  How many residential units are in the State?</p></speech>

I am genuinely very grateful to her for the comments she has made in the position she now holds.</p> <p>  Aftercare supports for young people leaving care are very extensive.  In many cases, these supports are provided up to the age of 23.  I am concerned that many of the supports are sometimes limited within the parameters of traditional continuing education.  There must be other options for people in this category.  We provided a great deal of additional supports during the Covid-19 response.  We extended all the dates on which people might have been due to leave care or exit formal aftercare.  We have extended those dates right up to Christmas to ensure that additional vulnerability was not brought to them.  There is no doubt that there is an increasing need for additional aftercare supports.  I am very glad to see it on the agenda, being driven by care leavers along with many groups such as EPIC and Aftercare Ireland that we engage with.  I think that is really important.</p> <p>  Before I bring in the chief social worker to speak to the question around sexuality for children in care and the impact of domestic violence as a feature of the lives of children coming into care, I will ask Ms Duggan to talk about family support.  The Senator is quite right that many people are not aware of it.  Some 24,000 people received a family support service from Tusla in 2019, as opposed to a child protection-type service.</p><p>After Ms Duggan has spoken about that, Mr. Brophy will speak about the issue around sexuality and the challenges for young people in care, and the director of finance, Mr. Smyth, will answer the question about residential units and spending on residential care paths.  We will try to do that as tightly as we can in the time available.</p></speech>

As Mr. Gloster outlined, a significant number of children and families access Tusla welfare services.  Those services are delivered by Tusla staff in conjunction with the community and voluntary sector.  Mr. Gloster referred to that when he spoke about how we have supported families and children in the context of Covid-19.  Simple examples would include how services, staff, and the community and voluntary sectors worked in partnership in each of the 17 local areas to support families during Covid-19, for example by providing advice and guidelines, offering food parcels or helping people to access online education at home.  It is very much around supporting families within the area of welfare.</p> <p>  Prevention, partnership and family support, PPFS, is a significant service in Tusla which looks at children and families who do not meet the threshold of being at risk of harm or abuse when there are concerns about supporting them to remain as a unit or access education or helping them to meet any of their wider holistic needs.  A significant part of that programme is the Meitheal assessment, which is done with families with inter-agency involvement to assess the particular needs of a child who is presenting with a welfare need, for example, or has a complex disability and is living at home.  It is a question of how the services in a child&rsquo;s life wrap around the child in identifying what they best need to support them and their families at home and prevent them from reaching a threshold for protection services or coming into care.  In the first six months of 2020, over 1,075 Meitheal processes were requested, which is an increase on last year.  Each of the 17 areas has family support networks that wrap around the child.  The needs are very much around welfare in relation to care, being able to access education and early intervention.</p> <p>  Another very significant group in relation to welfare are the children and young people's services committees that are in place in the various areas.  Again, this is a multi-agency approach to responding to the needs of particular families and communities.  It is very much around Tusla working with the community and voluntary sector to meet those welfare needs.</p></speech>

It raised significant concerns about the mental health of the members of the LGBTI community in their own homes.  We are very aware of that and are raising it through our own services so that people would be additionally aware of it.  People in that community need to circulate and socialise outside their own families, because sometimes they do not feel accepted in a more community setting.  Our fostering services are really attuned to the needs of each child in care and for those who have particular needs in terms of sexuality, they would certainly be addressed.  Over 90% of children in care have an allocated social worker.  They would be very attuned to those needs and they would be taken into account in case planning and care reviews that come up annually.</p><p>I wish to draw the Senator's attention to an excellent document on Tusla's residential services which was prepared during the summer by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I refer to the spending review.  In very simple terms, approximately 500 children avail of Tusla's residential services at any one time.  The care of those 500 children is split, with half in private residential care and a third each in our own services and funded agencies.  We can answer any questions about that.  It is quite a comprehensive report and will provide the Senator with a lot of information on care.</p></speech>

The campaign happened in the autumn.  We received several hundred initial inquiries.  They have to be followed up before the number of people interested in entering the assessment process becomes clear.  As Ms Duggan said, we are talking about issuing between 150 and 200 new approvals per year.  We will also lose people during that time.  Staying on top of this is constant work.</p></speech>

I would like to draw his attention to a recent report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on services in Cork.  The report identified unacceptable delays in respect of the child protection notification system.  Has there been an improvement in those services?  What improvement has arisen from that report?</p></speech>

The inspection in Cork was very specifically concerned with the child protection notification system.  Approximately 1,000 children in Ireland are on the child protection notification system today.  They have been through a very specific process.  HIQA's concern was about organisation, governance and the process of following up on the details of those cases.  A very detailed plan for this area was drawn up.  The plan was tested, scrutinised and monitored by HIQA and was to that body's satisfaction.  The plan has been accepted by HIQA and is well under way.  As I said in my opening statement, if I was asked for one word to define all the challenges that arise throughout a complex system like ours I would say "consistency".</p> <p>  To be fair to the Deputy, a report like that can crystallise concern in the mind of the reader and rightly so.  However, there are very significant examples and validated reports of very good work done by Tusla in Cork.  I would not want to lose sight of that balance.  The real test will be whether HIQA is satisfied with what it sees.  There are other concerns in the Cork area and other parts of the country, concerning not only child protection but the children in care service, the follow-up to care plans and so on.  Unfortunately, we do not see the very significant number of positive HIQA reports.  One was published today on foster care in the Louth-Meath area.</p></speech>

Recent media reports highlighted the failure to refer 365 cases of suspected child abuse in the Kerry area.</p><p>One report in <i>The Irish Times</i>said some delays were attributed to &quot;efforts by social workers to substantiate the abuse allegations before making a referral&quot;.  In asking these questions one tries to be as sympathetic as possible to those on the front line who had to go through each of the cases.  I understand that 122 cases related to suspected abuse of children under the age of 18.  Of these, 19 were given a high priority.  I understand that about 115 cases were deemed to be of medium priority.  <br/><br/>Mr. Gloster used the word &quot;consistency&quot;.  I have highlighted it in his submission to the committee.  Where do services in Kerry stand now as a result of this noted failure?  One does not want to attribute blame but if there are delays we must ask why.  Are delays a function of people within Tusla being overloaded or overworked?  Is an excessive burden placed on individuals or teams seeking to ensure these cases are dealt with appropriately and in accordance with protocol and law and that they are watertight?  Are people in Tusla getting the resources they need to triage these cases? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#P00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  As he rightly stated, in late 2019 Tusla became aware of an issue concerning the timeliness of referrals to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Such referrals were not being made within the desired timeframe.  We have to deal with approximately 1,200 cases per year in the Kerry area.  This audit indicated that of that number, 365 referrals were not made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a timely way.  As the Deputy noted, 122 of those were current cases and 243 were what we call "retrospective cases".  It is unacceptable that the Garda notification was not made in a timely manner in 122 current cases.  However, a social worker would be actioned to deal with any identified risks.</p> <p>  Immediate action was taken when Tusla identified that problem.  The notifications have all been made.  Tusla then examined the contributing factors.  As the Deputy noted, one of them concerned staffing.  There were also issues concerning practice and structure.  As the Deputy rightly said, interpretation of the correct timing of notifications was not consistent.  Views on when the notification should be made differed among social workers.  That can be caused by inconsistencies in practice in a certain area or varying levels of experience among social workers.  To immediately rectify that, a practice memo was developed in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was shared with everybody.  A staffing deficit was identified and additional staff have been assigned.  Services have also been restructured. </p> <p>  To ensure consistency, Tusla did not just look at the incident in Kerry.  The incident was understood as a symptom of a problem that could arise anywhere.  Other areas were audited to detect problems with Garda notification.  Tusla carried out an audit of 1,535 cases across 17 areas.  The organisation determined that there was a timeliness issue in 13% of those cases.  The practice memo and the associated guidance was shared throughout Tusla.  Our own audit team, which identified the first problem, will carry out another audit in early 2021 to check that this is no longer a problem.  We expect the changes to have been made by that point. </p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy's question on resources, the chief executive noted earlier that Tusla has a funded workforce of a certain size.  That is not to say that it is able to meet the increased demand arising from the increased number of referrals or the complex types of presentation we are seeing among children.</p><p>As Mr. Gloster referenced, there are going to be approximately 100 to 120 front-line posts going into the system in 2021.  My office is looking at targeting where that need is.  That work involves, for example, looking at the number of social workers per thousand children within the population.  It also looks at where there are issues with dealing with matters such as unallocated cases.  That is not to say that if we feel there are practice concerns or issues with how things could be done more efficiently, we will not look at those.  It is not about rewarding waiting lists but about recognising where there is a real need for additional resources.</p><p> In the challenging environment of recruiting additional social workers, we also have to look at the multidisciplinary approach to what a team looks like within a particular area.  One of the Deputy's colleagues referenced the administrative burden.  A report we have done demonstrates that we would be looking at a ratio of around one member of administrative staff to every four social workers to reduce that administrative burden.  We have to look within those extra 100 to 120 extra staff to see where they will deliver the greatest impact and where they are of greatest need to improve resources for 2021.</p></speech>

It was where there was a different interpretation, and what had to be brought to the agency was a consistency in interpretation so that everybody understood the basis, threshold and level we were talking about when it comes to the point in time in which the referral takes place.  That is the variation between being notified, receiving the referral, or maybe doing some of the initial teasing out and substantiation, whereas we have now clarified the point in time in which that referral has to be made.</p></speech>

I will ask my question.  We are endeavouring to understand how the culture of the Child and Family Agency works.  I accept the statement of the CEO today in respect of moving the culture on or changing practices, culture and structures.  We accept the bona fides of the CEO in that respect.  When we use a term such as "variation", it is meaningless to me.  It suggests to me there is a massive variation in practices in different parts of the country when it comes to timelines and to how cases are dealt with.  If we are to be helpful to our constituents, we need to have a greater understanding of the culture that exists within.  To be frank about it, notwithstanding the CEO's statement today, which I find very helpful, my perception is that there is still a long way to go before a lot of the practices that are happening within the Child and Family Agency are deconstructed such that the services flow more seamlessly, as constrained and all as it is by staffing and other administrative challenges.  That is the point, essentially.  There is more work to be done and we will have to revisit this.</p></speech>

I missed the start of the meeting as I was at a meeting of the Committee on Justice, so I apologise if any of these points have been touched on previously.  I get the feeling that the majority of them may be for Ms Duggan on social work.</p> <p>  Child protection is the biggest turnover and it is the most front-facing part of the profession.  Where are we at in the retention of social workers?  How many cases on average would a social worker have or how many social workers would a child have, say, in a ten-year period?  In many of the families I support, some of the kids are in the system for six to ten years and they are already on their tenth social worker.  There would not even be any recognition or acknowledgement from Tusla that the social worker is changing and then a call will be made by the new social worker to introduce himself or herself.  Then the process begins again of the same old questions the child has had to reveal for many years.  This is a real issue.</p><p>Does Tusla have an idea of the average number of cases a social worker would have?  Also, what is the average number of social workers a child could have throughout his or her time in foster care or on the files of Tusla?  Where can one access the exit interview data of the hundreds of social workers who have left in recent years so that we can fix the issues?</p><p> I also have questions on Tusla's view on the imbalance between the foster parent and the child having a social worker but the parent not having his or her own social worker who would be his or her primary advocate and support in what is a difficult situation.  Many parents seek family reunification and engage in the process but they are at a complete disadvantage when they enter a room in relation to a social worker's advocacy and who it is for.  I would like to know Tusla's views on introducing a system whereby the parent who is looking for reunification has his or her own social worker support and representation.  Sometimes Tusla will allow a family member to be present at those meetings but as the witnesses can imagine, many of these families come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  While the family member might be able to emotionally support the person, he or she definitely cannot advocate in the same way a social worker can for the foster family or the children.</p><p> I would also like to know what supports are in place in regard to family reunification for a parent leaving the prison system, especially if the other parent is absent or may be deceased and if the children are living with a family member.  I am supporting two men and one woman who are in the process of looking for family reunification on their release from prison.  They have all said the same thing to me, that they are being discouraged at each meeting in regard to the potential for them to have their families reunified, even if they meet the criteria.  Given that Tusla states that family reunification is a priority, what supports does it provide and what emphasis does it place on people leaving the prison system in terms of supporting  family reunification?  I hope the witnesses managed to take note of all those questions.  I can repeat them if they did not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#R00200"><p>In the general sense, the average number of staff involved throughout a child's is very variable.  The workforce tends to be more stable in rural areas than it is in the larger urban centres.  That is caused by a number of factors but I would say that the number of organisations and services across the entire spectrum of social services for adults and children and across the health system that require social workers simply means the job market for social workers is wide and varied.  That will always add to the movement of staff.  Child protection work is, of itself, extremely complex.  It is recognised as being quite a stressful aspect of the work.  Many people stay in it for many years but for some the turnover is faster.  I might ask Mr. Brophy to address the caseload question and the issue of reunification, including supports for people leaving the prison system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Brophy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#R00300"><p>On the caseload and the numbers of cases, it is hard to have a consistent number because each case depends on the intensity of the case, the number of children involved or the intensity of that child's individual needs.  Tusla has developed a caseload management system over the past eight or nine years.  We have worked out this system with front-line practitioners where each social worker, with his or her team leader, works out what is a manageable caseload for that particular worker and then we monitor that in terms of manageable and unmanageable caseloads.  That is what we are doing to measure whether caseloads are manageable or not.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked a question about the reunification of families, how important that is and providing support for parents.  That is a subject that is dear to my heart.  We have made great efforts with the introduction of Signs of Safety, which has been a significant move on this.  In this, we are involving the networks of families in supporting parents to create safety for children.</p><p>It is not just that we want a family member to come in with a parent, for example, but we want parents to actively get friends and family - people who they trust and know, and who are their allies - to be involved in creating safety for children.  We will work with that network with the parent.</p><p> There is a process involved with this and a series of steps in the Signs of Safety model, including the creation of danger statements and safety goals.  We work with children and we use the three houses method to get their views and incorporate them into the process as well.  It is a very complex system but it is certainly one in which we are working really hard to work with parents so we can include parents in their own solutions and the creation of safety for their own children.</p></speech>

I would not in any way want to take the committee down the direction of not being concerned.  Exit interviews are not mandatory in Tusla no more than they are in any other organisation.  They are attempted and some are done, so they are taken for what they are.  They contribute to learning but I do not have any analysis of them with me.  I will certainly ask our human resources team what analysis exists from exit-type feedback and I am quite happy to provide it and for it to be as public as it can be.</p> <p>  Turnover is a factor and the Senator hit the nail on the head in speaking about the fact that a child, whether in care or at home in the child protection surveillance system, having to tell his or her story repeatedly to new people is one of the greatest problems or challenges we face.  The mobility of the workforce is such now that it is quite difficult to avoid the problem.</p></speech>

I will touch on the family resource centre programme and try to get an understanding of the 2021 budget for the establishment of new family resource centres.  How many centres has Tusla been involved with over the past 12 or 18 months in establishing them nationally?  They are crucial and if there is one lesson Covid-19 has taught us, it is the importance of supporting people on the ground locally, whether it is in mental health services, services for people with disabilities or services relating to social contact and education.</p> <p>  I am involved with one or two committees in Mayo and we are very fortunate to have seven family resource centres located throughout County Mayo.  Unfortunately, there is only one in north Mayo and due to the geography of the region, it is not enough.  I would like to get an understanding of what is in the budget for the current programme and next year. </p></speech>

These are all individually commissioned centres, as the Deputy knows, with their own boards and history.  The approximate spend planned for next year on the programme is approximately &euro;23 million.  The family support programme allocation increased at the end of 2019 by approximately &euro;1.5 million and this was carried into 2020 and fully honoured.</p> <p>  There are family support services not in the family resource centre programme and I want to be clear about that.  When we speak about them we must do so in the context of all the other community and voluntary sector agents involved in family support services.  Coming to the end of this year, the family resource type of services and programmes have seen an additional allocation of &euro;700,000.  That is in the closing weeks of the year and it is specifically to support the work done and which needs to be done over the winter period in responding to the families we mentioned earlier who are experiencing pressure because of Covid-19.  I hope that addresses some aspects of the question.</p></speech>

I have looked at reports from 2019 and the allocated budget spend was &euro;16 million so it is good to see it is being increased.  I am currently working with the community in Erris and it is working with Tusla officials.</p><p>The people involved have set up a steering committee from five local parishes on recommendations from a previous application.  They have also done a needs analysis on the region.</p><p> This region has issues around access and distance to services.  There is also depopulation and lack of employment.  The witnesses will hear about this application and much more about it.  I look forward to working with Tusla on it because it is crucial that we deliver more services into communities.  The core principle of the family resource centre programme is community and that it is needs-led.  One action we can take post Covid is to try to deliver services better into communities and let them work and support people on the ground.  It is an important element.</p></speech>

Going to places like Mayo or even the Inishowen Peninsula in Donegal, the type of response and adaptability required is very different from a large urban centre.  It is exactly why the reform of Tusla in its practice, culture and specifically the structure, and doing what I call making Tusla "local", is as critical as it is.</p></speech>

It is a very broad remit, and as a first-time committee member there is much for me to take in.  It is great that the witnesses could come in and go through that.</p> <p>  My first question relates to Covid-19.  Has Tusla come across many children who have completely disengaged from education because of Covid-19?  I know it has been a really difficult time and children who were already finding school harder or had difficulties at school or at home would have found it harder to go back.  Has Tusla identified how many children did not go back into education and what level of supports is it providing to those children?</p> <p>  I am trying to work to see what Tusla's processes are and how it engages with different families in different instances.  I imagine there are very many difficult positions in which Tusla is involved.  From a process perspective, I imagine that for each of the scenarios, Tusla has an identified process that staff would follow.  In particular, if there is an allegation of sexual abuse of a child by a party within his or her own family, what process does Tusla follow?  Is that articulated anywhere or publicly available?</p> <p>  I have heard anecdotally that families are having different experiences.  It is clearly very distressing for families and children.  They are wondering if their experience is standard.  In the event that families feel they have had experiences that would not be best practice in their mind, what would be their comeback?  Do they have anywhere they can go or anybody they can speak to about the experience they had with Tusla?</p></speech>

That service continued to work, even during school closures, supporting the vulnerable children who would have already been known to those officers.</p> <p>  Approximately 6,000 children per year are made known to the Tusla education support service because of various aspects of concern around attendance and associated matters.  It is a relatively small but nonetheless important number in the context of approximately 1 million schoolchildren in the country.  Schools report to us twice per year with a particular emphasis on absence over 20 days.  Where the absence over 20 days is explained and understood by the school, it is not an issue for our service.  Where it is not explained, the focus of attention must be to ensure children's right to an education.  We also want to see that the many other needs and supports that help children to access education are followed through.  That is what the service does very well.</p><p>We do not yet have full reporting back from schools on the returning to school phase, but in addition to the twice yearly report of school attendance, the service has followed up with a large number of schools and is obtaining data.  It has nearly completed that process.  These data will identify the number of children who did not return to school after the Covid restrictions.  While those data are not finalised and need to be scrutinised with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and our own service, the head of the education support service has indicated to me that there is no major concern with regard to the number of children not returning to school after the Covid restrictions, as distinct from the number of children who would have been at risk of dropping out of school even in previous years, outside of the pandemic period.</p><p> Having said that, any child dropping out of school is a concern.  The support system for children who may not return to school is very extensive.  It comprises our education support service, the school completion programmes we fund in DEIS school areas and many other supports.  To be fair, the Department of Education itself went a significant distance to recognise the challenge for schools with regard to returning after the Covid restrictions.  Quite significant supports have been put into in that space.  It remains a work in progress but, at the moment, it seems to be going in accordance with what all the professionals would expect.</p><p> With regard to the process around referrals relating to sexual abuse and the different experiences people have had, I may ask the chief social worker, Mr. Ger Brophy, to comment briefly.  People do experience different types and levels of service because of the consistency factor about which we have talked.  The core process of responding to referrals is quite uniform, and increasingly so.  Perhaps Mr. Brophy will comment on that issue.</p></speech>

This is called the Barnahus model.  Under the EU-funded PROMISE 3 project, we are involved in training with our colleagues right across Europe in respect of specialist interviewing, therapy and follow-up.  We aim to have a consistent service throughout the country.  At the moment we only have one pilot site, which is in Galway.</p> <p>  With regard to what people experience at the moment, we aim to provide, through a patchwork of different counselling services, support and therapy for children who have been sexually abused.  The Deputy may be familiar with some of the bigger services in Dublin.  We also fund services provided by the CARI Foundation and a variety of other public and private services.  We certainly would not claim that this is consistent.  Our aim is to develop a consistent network of three Barnahus centres over the next three to five years and to link therapy and counselling with these centres.</p></speech>

There is no problem with that.  People can come back to us and talk to duty social workers or to the managers of the service in each of the local areas.  That addresses the complaints element.  As to where the process is written down, all of these referrals go through the same process.  A referral comes through the front door and then passes through duty intake, where the team deals with it.  Generally speaking, if the children concerned are in their own homes, the matter is dealt with through child protection and welfare.  We also work very closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing services to the family, but again, if they are dissatisfied or if the services they need are not available, they may complain to the local social work department.  Those complaints will be dealt with.</p></speech>

I know Deputy Cathal Crowe would like to come back in as well.  With regard to the new money allocated in this year's budget, about which some people have spoken, is it possible for us to get a breakdown of the &euro;61 million?  I appreciate the witnesses may not have that with them today but what is the plan as to how to spend that additional money?</p><p>I also want to touch on some of the matters raised in Mr. Gloster's opening statement with regard to consistency.  I appreciate that he has made these points and that he has acknowledged there are issues within the organisation.  I know he has said there are plans in place and that Tusla is working on it but will he give us a little bit more information?  It seems to work very well in certain parts of the country but not so well in other parts.  Is there a way to identify where there is best practice and to mirror that in other areas?  Perhaps that is something Tusla is doing but this may increase public confidence.  Those are the only points I wished to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#V00200"><p>Plans for the budget allocation for 2021 will be published in the 2021 business plan, which has not yet been finalised.  We have only just heard the budget announcement.  The board of the agency will consider the outline approach to allocating the funds we have for next year this Friday.  To be clear, a significant portion of that &euro;61 million has already been spent.  The board of the agency will outline those plans after Friday.  I will certainly have no difficulty in providing information on that approach to committee members, even ahead of the publication of the actual plan.  We had particular costs this year and last year associated with disability cases in which there was also a child protection interest.  That represented a significant part of our deficit.</p> <p>  With regard to consistency, the Chairman is correct.  Approaching consistency across practice models has already been mentioned with regard to things like the child protection and welfare strategy, the Signs of Safety, and consistent approaches to family support.  The real issue to pursue, which I mentioned in the opening statement and which I have mentioned to Tusla as many times as I could and to the Chair  the first time I appeared before the committee in November 2019, is that Tusla is overcentralised, highly siloed and has an out-of-date structure for doing what the agency is charged with doing and tries to do.  </p> <p>  We have designed a fully changed structure, which the board of the agency approved earlier this year, at the end of January.  Since this involves changes to the structure of the agency and to some of the grading and positions involved in how the agency does its business, as opposed to money necessarily, it will require the approval of both the line Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is between the two Departments at the moment.  As I said, I am hoping that an engagement with the Minister very shortly will lead to a conclusion because implementing that type of change takes time and we really need to get on with it.  We are, however, continuing will all other aspects of change in the meantime to try to improve consistency.  </p> <p>  At the moment, we are operating in 17 areas where we have historically operated, divided into 32 smaller areas.  These are supervised through four regional offices and co-ordinated through a national centre.  The nature and type of response to cases will continue to be over-centralised.  The system is heavily burdened.  This adds to the impression of crisis given whenever there is an issue.  Child protection systems in most jurisdictions do not operate in this way.  There is no doubt but that there are many benefits to having a national agency, but we need to change the structure to achieve what we are attempting to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#V00300"><p>I thank the Chairperson for facilitating me.  I will take up some of my earlier questions and extend them a bit further.  The witnesses may recall that I raised the whole issue of consistency in reporting and in how thresholds are adhered to.  It is confusing and incredible that while Tusla has been around since 2014, the Children First Act was enacted in 2015 and training across all tiers of child protection services has been fully rolled out, the very agency that co-ordinates child protection in this country has not achieved consistency.  I find that hard to fathom.  I speak as someone who received training and who was on the front line in this area just a few months ago.  Many of my colleagues in the teaching sector are still very frustrated.</p><p>I would like to hear how Tusla will address that lack of consistency in thresholds.  It is one thing to train people and to know how to handle sensitive information and relay it up that chain of command but it is an entirely different thing to have confidence that the mechanisms of Tusla are working to protect that child at the end of that supply chain.</p><p> Tusla deals with many serious and genuine cases but as with all reporting mechanisms of State, there are those reports that turn out to be false or even vexatious.  I received an email in this regard some weeks ago and sometimes in an acrimonious break-up, everything gets thrown across the table in terms of accusations.  How does Tusla deal with an accusation that has clearly been established to be vexatious without a shred of truth to it?  Does it ever refer cases on to the Director of Public Prosecutions when its time as a State body has been wasted, when court time has been wasted and when real cases are being backlogged and kept out of those courts?  I would like to hear from the witnesses on that.  It would offer some assurance to people, so I hope for a response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#W00200"><p>I want to make one or two follow-up points on workforce planning and pick up on some of the other things that were said.  If it is easier to provide a written answer to my questions, that will suffice.</p> <p>  The point was made that Tusla's target was based on the affordable workforce, not necessarily a needs assessment.  Has a needs assessment been done?  What sort of modelling is Tusla looking at?  There was talk of multidisciplinary teams.  Do the multidisciplinary teams and the nature of that make it into the needs assessment?  For example, if there are no access workers, it is possible that social workers could be looking at transport to and from access and supervising access eating a huge proportion of their time, which impacts on their ability to run other cases and all sorts of other things.  I am asking about that balance of the multidisciplinary teams, access workers, social care workers and therapeutic staff as part of that needs assessment.  The witnesses can give me a written answer on the workforce planning.</p> <p>  I refer to the family court Bill and the new family court building.  The Child and Family Agency will be a significant user of both and I trust that there has been adequate consultation with the Child and Family Agency from the Courts Service and the Department of Justice on both.  If there has not been, Tusla can put that in writing to us and we can follow it up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020112400002#W00300"><p>On Deputy Cathal Crowe's point on consistency, he has made all the points I have made.  On what might be seen as vexatious reporting and the Deputy's reference to family law, in particular, there is a view abroad that Tusla is involved in every family law case, separation and divorce and in every issue in which there is a dispute around children.  That is not the case.  There are many thousands of those cases in the family courts that Tusla does not come into contact with.  There are facilities available to the court under the Act where, if in the course of those proceedings, a concern is expressed about the well-being of a child, the court can direct assessment under the provisions of the Act and Tusla carries out that assessment to the best of its ability.  In those cases, because Tusla's primary role is in relation to the safety and support of the children, we tend to look at what the safety and context is for the child, as distinct to looking at whether a particular incident or issue is substantiated or proven to be false or not.  I am not aware of any case in which Tusla would have made a complaint to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions about what might be called a vexatious case.  There are many avenues for people to do that.</p> <p>  On the schools, I accept the Deputy's bona fides about the difference.  I have said that I accept there is a difference.  That is why it is extremely important to continue family support as opposed to just child protection.</p><p>Where I am anxious to get to in responding to the type of children teachers are concerned about is that we do not get to a stage where we are consistently talking about thresholds and that we are able to start talking about pathways for children.  If it is not at the threshold of child protection, that should not mean it is closed or stays standing.  It should get directed into a pathway in which the school and the family can still be supported in a meaningful way by the services and the State.  That is what the pathway of practice reforming in Tusla is targeted at and geared towards.  I accept that, for now, there are many situations in which that is a source of frustration for people and there is no point in me trying to deny that.  When a system is being changed, that takes a considerable period of time.  The Deputy's concern about the Child and Family Agency having that level of variation when it is, of itself, the protecting agency, is indicative of the history that the agency has come from through the health board and HSE eras to become Tusla, an agency operating across 17 areas of the country.</p><p> I will have to look more into the needs assessment issue that Deputy Costello raised.  I would not be prepared to commit to saying that a definitive needs assessment of what is needed will be done but there is comparative analysis with Northern Ireland, England and other jurisdictions as to the level of social work that is available in Ireland.  We are on the lower end of that.  I must confess that I have not heard of any particular activity involving Tusla and the family court building so I would need to check what might or might not be in that and to come back to the Deputy on that.</p><p> On the workforce plan, Deputy Costello asked me about recruitment earlier and I know he was talking about foster carers as well.  On staff recruitment, we have 22 dedicated staff working full-time in recruitment to try to manage and approve the recruitment process itself.  We are doing workforce planning for next year and we are looking at an evidence-based allocation of any new resources.  I do not see much point in trying to change the resource allocation of what has existed heretofore.  We would lose too much energy trying to move things around that way but workforce planning is critical.</p><p> On the needs assessment side, that is all tied into an interdepartmental group on social work education that is looking at that range of issues.  I entirely agree with the Deputy on the skill mix transfer of skills and on employing multidisciplinary teams, including social care workers and other staff, led by social workers providing responses.  That is as distinct from every child in every situation having to have a social worker assigned in the traditional model.</p></speech>

Can I ask that in maybe six months time we would have a special meeting with Tusla again to see where that is at?  It would be great work on behalf of this committee and the approach must be one of partnership.  I was not here today trying to beat Tusla.  I value an awful lot of what it does but it is our job as public representatives to probe and voice what people are saying on the ground.  I would love it if in six months time we could see and, more importantly, hear how Tusla is catching up on the issue of inconsistencies.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Bernard Nolan, assistant principal and, by video link, Mr. Tom Woolley, marine planning adviser, both of whom are also members of the unit.</p><p> In order to support a marine that Ireland can use, enjoy and benefit from socially, environmentally and economically, the Government is putting in place a comprehensive new approach which will result in the biggest reform of marine governance in a century.  Two key work programmes for which my unit has responsibility are the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which sets out overarching and sectoral planning policies to shape marine development and activities to 2040, and the proposed marine planning and management Bill, which underpins the new planning system.  As the Bill is a key enabler of Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation goals, the programme for Government has committed to prioritising the passage of this balanced and Aarhus-compliant Bill through the Oireachtas by April.</p><p> The maritime area comprises approximately 490,000 sq. km and extends eastward in excess of 200 nautical miles in parts.  This area is seven times our land area: Ireland is 85% water.  The current marine consent system only covers the foreshore area, which covers some 12 nautical miles offshore.  A planning system generally comprises three main elements: forward planning, development management and enforcement.  The existing system lacks coherence and consistency.  There is no forward planning framework, multiple development management systems are operating independently and enforcement is fragmented.  This Bill is the State&rsquo;s vanguard response to the pressing need for reform of marine governance.  The draft Bill gives legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system for a coherent, end-to-end forward planning, development management and enforcement regime.</p><p> Our marine planning system will move towards being plan-led through the NMPF.  The NMPF is a parallel document to the national planning framework, NPF.  Both of these spatial plans are concerned with the long-term future of our land and sea areas and with identifying opportunities for protection, growth and development so that our land and marine areas can be managed in the best interests of the public.  The NPF recognises the importance of integration and co-ordination with the land planning regime at national, regional and local levels.</p><p> In future, it will be equally important in turn that national, regional and local terrestrial plans are consistent with the NMPF, and they will be required to do so under the provisions of the proposed Bill.  Many activities and uses that take place on land or in the sea can have impacts on the land and the maritime area.  This Bill will require that these interactions be considered.  This Bill provides for strategic marine activity zones.  Any Minister can bring forward zone designation proposals, subject to public participation and collective Government decision.  Once approved, the zone becomes part of the NMPF.  This ensures there is a joined-up approach to marine forward planning, with binding considerations for decision makers.</p><p> The proposed Bill will replace the antiquated Foreshore Act 1933 with a new maritime area consent, MAC, to manage the occupation of the maritime area.  This means that a MAC will be issued by the relevant Minister.  On receipt of the MAC, a developer can then, and only then, proceed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la or a local authority for planning permission as appropriate.  This streamlines the application process into a two-stage procedure.  This sequential regime, with clearly delineated roles for Ministers and planning authorities, streamlines the existing disjointed system and ensures a single environmental assessment.  Following a recent decision by the Government, an independent enforcement body will be established to assume the marine planning enforcement role.  The Department is currently reviewing advice from the Office of the Attorney General concerning the establishment of this agency and will update the Bill accordingly. </p><p> The pillars of the Aarhus Convention are the foundation on which the marine planning and development management Bill regime stands.  Effective and meaningful public participation is a fundamental feature of the new regime at policy and project levels.  Participation at a policy level maximises the opportunities for the public to influence how decisions are made.  Pre-application requirements ensure visibility of projects and early consideration of issues by developers.</p><p>Established planning procedures provide the formal engagement opportunity in the context of comprehensive project information.</p><p> Marine planning and development management will deliver a better planned and better managed maritime area, with a co-ordinated, inclusive and coherent approach to decision-making and governance, including the long-term vision for proper management, enforcement and environmental protection of our seas.  I thank the committee members for their interest, and we are happy to answer their questions.</p></speech>

I am the principal officer in the offshore energy environment and consenting unit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am accompanied today by Anne-Marie Clancy, who is an assistant principal in the unit.</p> <p>  The Government has committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which was recently published, will commit Ireland in law to move to a climate resilient and climate-neutral economy by 2050.</p> <p>  The target of delivering 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity by 2030 from renewable sources will play a key role in delivering on our overall energy and climate targets.  Onshore wind, which supplied almost one third of electricity in 2019, has underpinned recent progress in greening our electricity supply, with renewables accounting for 38% of electricity generated in 2019.  The programme for Government has further increased the level of ambition, committing to 5 GW capacity in offshore wind by 2030 off Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coasts.  It also includes a commitment to explore the longer-term potential for at least 30 GW of floating wind in the Atlantic.</p> <p>  As our colleagues said, our sea area is seven times our land area, one of the largest sea-to-land ratios of any EU state.  Consequently, the offshore wind sector has very significant potential to substantially contribute to meeting our energy and climate needs.  Targets set out under EU Green Deal and recently published offshore energy strategy affirm this direction, with increased focus on the potential offered by technology developments in the areas of wind, wave, tidal energy and green hydrogen.</p> <p>  Investment required to meet the 5 GW target by 2030 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;10 billion.  This has the potential to deliver many high-quality jobs, while also contributing towards the sustainable growth of our economy.</p> <p>  Offshore renewable energy, ORE, projects typically take eight to ten years from inception through planning and development to become operational.  Certainty and stability are crucial for triggering the significant levels of upfront investment required for these large-scale projects.  The delivery of a streamlined, modern and up-to-date regulatory planning framework is one of the essential steps to enable this and is a priority for this Department.</p> <p>  We have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the development of the marine planning and development management Bill.  In tandem, we are building out the State consenting process that will be required for the ORE sector.</p> <p>  We believe the approach set out offers a robust regime for the effective management of our significant maritime resources, while ensuring appropriate protections for the marine environment, with public consultation a fundamental feature.  The provisions specific to ORE will enable the transition to a plan-led regime in the long term, while also enabling projects that have been initiated under the current foreshore regime to progress under the marine planning and development management Bill.</p> <p>  It is important to note that these relevant projects will be required to apply separately for both marine area consent and planning permission under the proposed new regime.  These applications will require full assessment against all financial, technical and environmental standards, with public consultation and environmental assessment key components at the planning permission stage.</p> <p>  We view the proposals within this Bill, taken together with the marine spatial planning work being progressed by Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as offering significant advantages in moving to a planned, holistic approach to the sustainable development of our marine resources.  In this context, it is important to note that strategic marine activity zones can allow for shared use by different sectors.  In the case of ORE, we can learn from the many successful examples in Europe of a range of marine activities coexisting alongside wind farm developments.</p><p>The sharing of information and constructive engagement by all marine users will be critical to achieving this coexistence and this Department is fully committed to initiatives in this area, including those proposed to engage with fishing communities in the first instance.</p><p> In summary, the offshore renewable energy, ORE, sector offers significant potential for greening our energy supply and meeting our climate goals while also enabling the sustainable growth of our economy.  The timely establishment of a robust, transparent and effective planning regime for our maritime resource is essential to enable the ORE sector to become established while also improving the management and protection of our valuable offshore resources.  That concludes my statement and we are happy to respond to any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

It is important to say, on behalf of the Government, that this is a key commitment in the programme for Government and how we tackle climate action.  Much human activity has an impact on our environment and there is a balance of compromises in many ways.  If we are to continue our current level of human activity on the planet, we will have to look for ways for it to be sustainable.  Offshore renewable energy is one of the key ways we can do this.  Inevitably, there will be compromise but any such compromise would be far better than many of the fossil-led ways in which we have provided energy to our society.</p> <p>  This legislation will also provide major opportunity for Ireland.  The operations in the UK have approximately 15% or 16% of all ORE activity on the planet, so we can see the potential for a small island nation like Ireland to be able to tap into a renewable resource.  Not only do I welcome it, I encourage the Departments to do everything in their power to ensure the programme for Government commitment to legislate for this within the first year is realised.  We must do our bit as well.</p> <p>  There are areas of some concern.  How will the projects picked for the transitional period be dealt with?  The second question relates to community benefit.  It is a concept that is well understood by many public representatives and often there is an immediate impact.  For an offshore project like this, it is harder to define what is a community.  Does a visual detraction necessarily mean there must be a community benefit for the area?  Should it be a community benefit for the State in how it uses energy?  There are no hard and fast guidelines but I know in Scotland there is a figure of 20% that is used.</p> <p>  My last question relates to the 18-week period.  Is there some discussion that this could perhaps be pushed to 26 weeks or is the Department opposed to that?</p></speech>

The transition protocol was simply put in place to provide certainty for how they now progress to the Bill's regime.  They will still have to go through a full assessment, both under marine area consent and as part of the planning permission application made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, assuming this Bill is enacted.</p> <p>  The fact that they have been designated as these transitionary relevant projects just provides some certainty that the work they have already undergone as part of the foreshore regime will count towards them entering into the process that will be put in place for this Bill.  That will involve full financial and technical assessment as part of the marine area consent.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will assess all the environmental aspects, which covers the questions raised by the Deputy.</p><p>The designation as a transition project does not confer any particular advantage on these applications other than that they can go through the planning system and that we recognise the work the applicants have already done under the foreshore regime.</p><p> I will ask my colleague, Ms Clancy, to take the Deputy's second question on community benefit.</p></speech>

It also states that we will do this to ensure that community energy can play a role in reaching at least 70% of our renewable electricity, including ensuring there is a community benefit fund in respect of onshore and offshore renewable energy.  All offshore wind developments will be supported via the offshore renewable electricity scheme.  These developments will all be required to establish community benefit funds prior to the project operation.  Owing to the larger scale of offshore wind developments, their contributions are similarly expected to be significantly larger than those of onshore projects.  To ensure good governance and effective disbursement of these funds to the local marine and coastal communities, a good practice principles handbook will be published by the Minister.  This handbook will add to the renewable electricity support scheme terms and conditions and firmly establish local community participation in all fund decision-making.</p></speech>

The 18-week timeframe is what is currently in place for strategic infrastructure on land.  Some consideration was given to whether a 26-week period would be more realistic, but we have not identified or firmed up a timeframe on that.</p></speech>

Having an 18-week target is only one element of ensuring that developments are considered properly and fully.  A number of key enablers in respect of the national marine planning framework - the framework itself, the plan, the guidelines and the spatial platform - will help make stronger applications, and the stronger an application is the better and quicker it can go through the system.  In addition, there will be early engagement of developers before they even come to the MAC stage with impacted stakeholders to make sure that issues arise early and can be identified and dealt with early rather than later in the process.  Likewise, there will be a formal pre-application process with the board, where the developer engages with the board to determine precisely what should go into an application.  There are responsibilities on the State and on developers in ensuring that a development is properly assessed in a timely manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#F00800"><p>I thank both Departments for their presentations.  I will start with just a comment and then ask five specific questions.  I might have some additional questions in the next round if we get to it.</p> <p>  This is once-in-a-generation legislation.  It seeks to put in place a comprehensive planning regime for foreshore and deepshore.  It is the single longest piece of legislation I have ever dealt with, which means we have a particularly onerous responsibility to make sure we scrutinise it fully and get it right.  It is important to emphasise that this is not just about wind but about how we treat our entire marine area.  Therefore, it is not just about windfarms but also about aquaculture, fisheries, biodiversity - all those activities.  It is probably unfortunate - and it is no criticism of anyone here - that we are dealing with the planning Bill before we have considered the planning framework in terms of the process because the planning framework, if I understand it right, is the overarching context within which any planning legislation and planning decision would have to take place.  It is important Members understand that we have a legal obligation to produce that planning framework by March of this year.  Part of that includes having both a spatial and a temporal plan for the marine within which decisions such as decisions on planning applications can then be made.  In that context, my questions are as follows.</p> <p>  There is some concern that the marine planning framework in its draft form is not fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive, particularly Article 8.1 of the directive, to have a spatial and temporal plan for the marine.</p><p>How satisfied are both Departments that when the final marine plan is in place, it will fully comply with the directive, particularly Article 8.1?</p><p> I have raised a concern before with respect to the marine protected areas.  We were meant to have 10% by this year but we have chronically failed to do that and we have a very ambitious target of 30% by 2030.  Can the witnesses update us on progress? </p><p> In the absence of having properly designed marine planning areas, in parallel with the planning legislation, what is the potential for conflicts of interest between applications for wind farms, for example, and concern over marine biodiversity in what could be marine protected areas?  Could these conflicts end up in judicial review thus delaying, for example, some of the seven transitional projects or other projects after that?</p><p> I am very concerned about the consent process and the absence of an environmental impact assessment, EIA, and public consultation.  Have the witnesses been given advice by the Attorney General to say that the non-inclusion of environmental impact assessments and public consultations in the consent decision complies with both the Aarhus Convention and the EIA directive?  Can they explain why fishing and aquaculture have not been covered in the general scheme?  Is there an intention to include deep-sea mining and liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals?</p><p> Finally, when will the report of Dr. Tasman Crowe will be published?  The Department and the Minister have seen it but we, the public and other organisation with a vested interest have not.  The report is materially relevant to a lot of these discussions. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#G00200"><p>There were a lot of questions there and we will try to work through them.  I will take the questions on marine protected areas and on fishing and aquaculture.  My colleague, Mr. Tom Woolley, will take the question on Article 8.1 and compliance, and Mr. Bernard Nolan will take the question on the consent process.</p> <p>  In terms of progress made with marine protected areas, it is not an area of my responsibility but my Department has responsibility for it.  As the Deputy has rightly said, a report has been submitted to my Minister by an expert group chaired by Dr. Tasman Crowe.  He is considering the report with a view to publishing it for public consultation in the short term, that is, within the next couple of months, I gather.  On the back of that public consultation, the expectation is that legislation will follow in 2021.  </p> <p>  In terms of fishing and aquaculture, fishing is a European competence so it would not be appropriate to put it into this regime.  There is potential for aquaculture to come into this regime at a later date but that is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The regime, as we have tried to construct it, is not just geared towards offshore wind, telecommunication cables, etc.  It is geared so that any marine activity could come under this regime, which was very much at the forefront of our minds when we constructed it so aquaculture could well come in, in the foreseeable future.   </p></speech>

We have worked hard to include as much of that information as possible.  One of the questions we asked during the consultation on the baseline report was exactly how spatial people wanted the plan to be.  The overriding response we received was that people would prefer a strategic focused plan at this stage.  While it is true that the plan does not include many varied spatial policies which state that in the next 20 years we want this activity in this exact space and that is how it is going to work, what we have done is respond to stakeholder direction and outline clearly, for the first time in Ireland, the distribution of the multiple activities that happen in Ireland's maritime area.</p><p> We worked very closely with the Marine Institute on a series of quite detailed and, in some cases, minute maps that appear in the MNPF.  The aim of that and communicating the spatial distribution of those activities is to ensure that all users of the maritime area are aware of what is happening where.  To support that effort further, we are working again with geographic information system, GIS, colleagues in our Department and the Marine Institute to develop a digital tool that will communicate those maps, which we hope to have in place to accompany the launch of the NMPF.  Not only will we have the static maps that show distribution of activities in the maritime area in the PDF and paper version of the plan at the launch, we are also committing to ensuring that data is kept up to date in line with the plan.  While the plan policies stay in place and they are relevant for the 20-year period of the plan, the best available data and spatial information that people could use in applying the plan in their decisions are updated regularly.</p><p> We hope that approach will address Article 8.1 thoroughly.  We have been working closely with, and looking at the work of, other jurisdictions on this to inform how we approach spatial representation and support tools for marine spatial planning.  We hope we are pursuing routes to ensure that we are meeting that Article.  For the time being, at least, we are satisfied that we are meeting that requirement.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and giving their presentation.  As has been described, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set the framework that will ultimately guide our policy over the coming decades in this critical area.  It will be responsible for delivering our renewable energy into the future and meeting our very ambitious targets in this area.  I welcome the comment on the Bill that more items can be added into the future.  It is not just for wind, even though that is the way it is being understood.  With regard to the five relevant projects that have been picked, could the witnesses give me an idea of how they were arrived at?  I am more interested in future projects and the pipeline of projects that exist that will ultimately be able to use this legislation in the future.  I am from Waterford and there is an extensive plan for offshore wind energy between Helvick and Dunmmore East.</p><p>That plan is in process but where does it fit in with the next stage of this process and the timelines around that, which will be reflected in how long it takes us to get this legislation through the Houses?  I would appreciate an outline of those projects and future projects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Hennessy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#J00200"><p>I am happy to take that question.  The five relevant projects the Senator referenced are very much the initial number of projects we see being necessary as part of a pipeline.  If we are to reach the 5 GW target by 2030, more projects will be required because the current projects that have been identified will only deliver half of that target if they get through the full planning system but there are no guarantees of that.  It is important we view that 2030 target as a milestone.  It is not a ceiling or an endpoint.  The ambition is that whenever this Bill is enacted we would see a range of projects progress through the planning system whereby there would be a staggered delivery of projects over a period up to 2030 and beyond.  We would expect the current relevant projects if they begin to go through the planning process, if this Bill is enacted, start to come on line from around 2026 onwards.</p> <p>  There are a number of reasons the initial focus is on the east coast.  The current technology that offers the best commercial opportunities is based on fixed turbines.  The east coast has shallow water that is best suited to fixed turbine devices being installed.  There is a necessity to be able to connect to the grid.  While EirGrid is building out its roadmap to support the extension of offshore renewable energy projects it will primarily be focused on the east coast and then move on to the south coast over the next decade or so to enable connection to the grid.  </p> <p>  The greatest demand is on the east coast.  There are a number of reasons the developments are concentrated initially on the east coast.  The south and west coasts, because they have deeper water, are more suited to different types of technology that are at the earlier stages of development such as floating wind power and there are also opportunities for tidal and wave energy.  Those developments on those coasts will offer future development opportunity beyond 2030 to get into the export market.</p> <p>  We envisage the initial project would start to progress through the marine planning and development management, MPDM, regime, once the legislation is enacted.  We are working on identifying the next batch of viable projects.  That is an important consideration.  We have to examine what has the potential to be delivered and become operational.  We are still working through the criteria to identify what those projects in the next batch need to look like to progress through the planning system so that we would start to build this pipeline to enable delivery to 2030 and beyond.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

In the next six to 12 months it will start to become clearer which projects fall into that group.  Progress is still being made under the foreshore regime with the application for site investigation licences for projects.  Work is still progressing on a number of fronts.  I expect we will have more clarity in the next year on those.</p></speech>

Anything that would help our environment should be encouraged and assisted.  It was stated in one of the presentations that work is taking place with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and an energy review has been carried out of Ireland's energy requirements.  Local Government and councils played their part in the planning framework to make houses more efficient, putting in air to water heat pumps, geothermal systems and solar panels.</p><p>When it comes to a lot of these systems such as air to water, it goes back to the energy reviews.  The current air to water system within a housing system only covers a house up to roughly 2,000 sq. ft and after it is being said that three-phase electricity is needed.  If one does not have that then one is backing up the heating system through the immersions and through the ESB.  Energy ratings are fine on paper but when the temperatures drop below -2&deg;C or -3&deg;C, a lot of these air systems do not work as efficiently as they say they will on paper.  The energy ratings seem to be based on a platform on which everything is nice and calm.</p><p> I welcome the investment in offshore and onshore wind generation.  The witnesses are saying it is starting on the east coast and we see from the point of view of ratings that a lot of energy comes from fossil fuels.  The hospitals and schools are on fossil fuels because there is no other alternative.  We have worked out throughout the years that anything that is being upgraded is in a highly populated area, such as Dublin and the large cities.  They seem to be getting the first run at this, even though the wind farms and so on are going up in the countryside, where we live and where they are visual to us.  To me, it is in the rural areas that this should be provided because they are doing their bit by supplying the land and having to look at these wind farms.  They should get the first bite at the cherry and get some rewards for what they are doing to help the likes of Dublin and the other areas.  I would like to see the rural areas, where we are working with the Government to create energy, to get the good energy ratings.  If I drive an electric vehicle, I have to travel 20 miles to get to the nearest plug-in point from where I am living so it is not viable for me.  The wind farms are in the countryside and the rural areas.</p><p> From an energy point of view, it was said that our targets for this year are 10% and for 2030, they are 30%.  Ambitiously, the target for 2050 is 70%.  I believe that is ambitious, especially when I consider that we do not have the proper energy ratings that are wanted for this country.  As ambitious as these targets are, I welcome them and I will do whatever I can that is within my power to help.  I would like to see it spread throughout the countryside.  Electricity is expensive at present and it is outweighing a lot of the costs for people to run on fossil fuels.  If we are encouraging people to work with energy, we need to make it efficient.  We do not want to have a one-stop-shop that can dictate prices to people who are making the changes towards electricity and are going a greener way.</p></speech>

What we have spoken about to date is just one aspect of work that is under way within the Department.  We are looking primarily at the generation of renewable electricity, which is one component of the larger energy picture.  The Deputy is correct that there are a lot of other aspects we have not referenced here.</p> <p>  On coastal communities and those in rural areas, we see huge potential with renewable energy projects to bring benefits through generating new jobs.  For example, we know that one of the projects that is planning to go through the planning system on the east coast has designated Arklow as where it will base its operation and maintenance activities.  That would generate 70 to 80 jobs, which would be high quality jobs.  We see the industry offering that potential around coastal communities more broadly.  Then there is the community benefit my colleague has already spoken about, where that fund will be set up and will look at benefiting the broader community.  The details on that are still being developed.  There are other initiatives within the Department that may be relevant here.  A big one would be the retrofit programme, which is seeking to aid households in upgrading their homes in order that they can become more energy efficient.</p><p>The generation of renewable energy from clean and efficient sources is just one part of the story.  There is also a lot of work going on in the Department in terms of grants to support households to become more energy efficient and to gain the benefits from reducing their energy costs over time.  Those are some elements, but we can certainly get more information for the Deputy on any of those other programmes if he is interested in them.</p></speech>

From what I have seen to date, the Bill will be transformative in the context of transitioning the way from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  It is an exciting prospect for the country.  Going forward, this Bill will play a large role in making Ireland energy self-sufficient.  Further ahead, we could become an energy exporter.  Currently, my understanding is that we import approximately &euro;6 billion worth of energy, but it might be higher now.  Therefore, if we reverse importation, we can be in a position to create thousands of jobs that are sustainable.  My question is a simple one: apart from the construction and maintenance of this energy supply, how much of the manufacturing side and the procurement of the turbines can be supplied here in Ireland?  A lot of stuff will be imported, so how much can we provide?</p></speech>

We do not see it being realistic that we would get into the actual building of wind turbines in this country.  We do not have that type of heavy industry.  Neither do we have the expertise or knowledge that is available in certain countries that are world leaders in this area, but we do see huge potential work in deploying wind turbines.  I refer to centres where the components are brought to be assembled and then taken offshore.  There would be ongoing work in operations and maintenance where there would be ongoing job requirements.  There is also the supply chain.  Enterprise Ireland has been doing a lot of work in recent years to build up the SME sector where there are particular technical jobs and expertise in different areas to support the overall industry.  Enterprise Ireland has been doing work to get those companies more involved in work in the UK, in advance of the industry taking off in this country, so that they build up some of the expertise and knowledge.  There are opportunities on a range of fronts that would benefit regions and coastal communities in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#L00400"><p>A development plan is being devised at the moment.  Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth 2 is the second iteration of it, the first dating to 2013.  It seeks to capture opportunities and interventions that the State could perhaps make in developing activities around the coast, including offshore renewable energy among others.  The Department is working closely with the Marine Institute on this.  We hope to find a point of interaction between the spatial and investment in the same way that Project Ireland 2040 has worked so cohesively in that regard.  The next iteration of this will be regional plans where we can look at aspects of that.  We have a relatively new industry being brought to the country in offshore renewable energy and we must look at how we can capitalise on it in the areas it is operating from to achieve maximum societal benefit.  We must also look at areas such as research and development, not just the hardware building.  That is the next phase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#L00500"><p>I might add to that as well.  I believe there was a publication by the offshore renewable energy industry as well on the potential value to the Irish economy of the entire industry.  Arklow was mentioned.  I know that 80 jobs are to be created in Arklow.  I see an opportunity for a lot of coastal towns like Arklow to benefit in some way through the entire process of manufacture, from construction to design and maintenance.  Every one in these plants at some stage will have a decommissioning stage as well.</p><p>There is ongoing opportunity for employment and value uptake in those coastal communities.  I wish to add another point on community gain, a point raised by Deputy McAuliffe.  I think the community gain for the coastal community was referenced.  We have to consider that the marine environment is seven times larger that the terrestrial environment, and that the marine space is all of Ireland's space, so I would not like to see community gain just being directed at coastal towns or villages.  The entire country should benefit from any community gain in that, especially as the transition to renewables will also see the reduction in the more traditional fossil fuel reliant industries, which tend to be concentrated in midland areas, so there are opportunities for that community gain to supplement just transition funds also.  I wanted to make that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#M00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today; it is appreciated.  There are two areas on which I wish to ask questions.  First, this is a very significant Bill in terms of what it is doing to facilitate wind turbines and actions being taken around climate.  That is very welcome and significant.  In addition to having a climate change crisis, we also have a biodiversity crisis, and it is that side on which I want to focus.</p> <p>  On the issue of marine protected areas only being at the 2.4% designation currently when the commitment in the programme for Government is 30%, is there a concern that not having that in place in advance or in tandem with this legislation could lead to judicial reviews, and therefore delays in the planning process in respect of wind turbines, in particular?  Is that a concern and has it been looked into?  Is there advice on that?</p> <p>  Second, the Bill does not cover commercial fishing and aquaculture, which is a concern particularly in respect of the damage done to the marine environment and biodiversity by bottom trawling or dragging, and that can lead to pollutants entering the food chain as well as causing damage to biodiversity.  The witnesses were asked about that, and they said that it cannot be covered in this Bill because fisheries is a competence of the EU.  The EU Common Fisheries Policy specifically states that member states have the opportunity to design fishing conservation measures.  Therefore, would that not allow this Bill to cover the area of fishing conservation measures and commercial fishing in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#M00300"><p>I will start with the Deputy's final questions and I thank him for his comments.  Fisheries is outside my area of responsibility, so I am not going to answer any questions on it, because it is a matter of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department.  As I said previously, we are building a regime, and it is not a stand-alone regime that will be used only once.  We will want to use it many times, so there is always the option for other activities that are not included at this point in time to become part of that regime at a later date, however the two activities that the Deputy mentioned are under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, so it is for him and his Department to make that call.</p> <p>  The second point I would make, which is almost a subpoint, is that regardless of whether an activity is included in this marine planning and development management Bill, all marine activities are subject to the national marine planning framework.  Fisheries, aquaculture, wastewater treatment and things that are not obviously named in the marine planning and development management Bill are all covered.  Some 16 sectoral activities are covered, so regardless of whether aquaculture is included in the Bill, any decisions taken, policies created, programmes or developments must take into account and meet the objectives of the national marine planning framework.  It is already legislated for under Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2018, and we are restating that in the marine planning and development management Bill, so decision-makers are legally bound to take the national marine planning framework into account.</p> <p>  In terms of the marine protected areas and the potential for judicial reviews, I do not wish to comment on that, simply because the Minister is currently considering a report of the expert group led by Dr. Tasman Crowe, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned earlier.  I understand that the report will be published in the next couple of months, and a full public consultation will be held on it.  I presume that is the appropriate arena in which to focus on those issues.</p><p>I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for raising the issue of marine protected areas because it is important to reach that target of 30%.  That is an objective for us.  It is a considerable increase from the previous 10% target.</p></speech>

I was speaking on the Order of Business in the Seanad so it was unavoidable.  I want to check if I am reading this right.  Am I correct in saying there is no obligation to do an environmental impact assessment, EIA, as part of the public consultation?  Reference was made to developer engagement with impacted stakeholders.  What is envisaged by that?  Who would the impacted stakeholders be and what statutory basis do the witnesses consider that to have?  Going back to the question the Chairman raised about community benefit, is there potential to include something like a local employment clause or an obligation to take a percentage of workers from the live register within the Bill and give it a legal and statutory basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-24a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020112400002#N00400"><p>I will take the questions on the public consultation, the EIA and the pre-application engagement.  To be clear on how the new regime is intended to operate, it is a two-stage procedure.  The first stage, the maritime area consent, MAC, looks very closely at the property, the person and whether that person can actually do what he or she is proposing, and then agrees the financial terms.  That MAC is then subject to a development consent which would be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority, depending on the development type.  The larger scale offshore stuff would definitely be considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The formal environmental impact assessment is within that development consent procedure, and that also includes the formal opportunity for public participation in the development consent decision-making.  Related to that, and this might relate to some earlier questions as well so hopefully this will give some clarity, before a developer applies for a MAC obligations are set out that it will have to engage with impacted stakeholders.  It is not possible to set out who those stakeholders will be in primary legislation because we are building a regime for a variety of scales, from slipways all the way up to wind farms.  The level of engagement required in any particular case might be quite different but the principles are the same.  The purpose of this is to identify issues of importance for the public and identify the potentially impacted marine users.  The national marine planning framework will help do that and when the guidelines are developed, they will provide even more detail regarding who might potentially be impacted.</p> <p>  At the moment, public consultation in the context of development consent is quite often adversarial and we have found that under the Foreshore Act, there is an established application and there is opposition to it.  This Act seeks to mitigate that by placing the obligation on developers to engage with impacted stakeholders before a MAC application is made.  This has a number of purposes.  It ensures early and widespread awareness of proposals, it ensures developers engage with the stakeholders, and there is clarity among the public on what the proposal actually is.  Issues of concern are identified very early in the process by the developer at the project concept stage and necessary considerations, accommodations and synergies can be built into the project design rather than bolted on later.  We will be setting this out in the statutory obligation within the guidelines themselves.  However, we are also examining the possibility of putting it in as a set criteria in the MAC that if the Minister was not satisfied with the level of public or stakeholder engagement relevant to the project, the application would be deemed incomplete and would not even pass the first gate. </p></speech>

Before I hand over to my environment colleagues on the community gain aspect, I will ask Mr. Tom Woolley to come in to give a brief overview of the planning guidelines.</p> <p>  I will give a specific example of some of the stakeholder engagement we see as important.  We will have the primary law and the NMPF, and then supplementary issues will go down into a more granular level.  We are establishing an offshore renewable energy and fisheries working group, the first meeting of which will be held this December.  From that we hope to develop a communications protocol between both sides - I hate to use that word - which we hope they will all sign up to.  That will serve as a point of information and knowledge sharing between both sides.  That is just one example of how we envisage these kinds of stakeholder engagements happening, and how we are going to try to engineer it as much as possible.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Woolley to come in on the broader planning guidelines because he will be leading out on them.</p></speech>

At the moment we are committing in the NMPF to establishing initially two sets of statutory guidelines that we will work on in earnest following the publication of the NPF.  These will focus on development management.  As Mr. Nolan pointed out, the marine planning and development management Bill and the NMPF will have an effect on a huge range of decision-making.  They will have an impact on lots of different scales and types of development and activity, and on planned development and policy development upon which the NMPF also has an effect.</p> <p>  Given that complex picture, one role for the development management guidelines is, first and foremost, to see who is affected and what are the processes that are needed to consider the plan.  Beyond that, the guidelines would look at the individual policy areas and pick out areas, and new areas in particular, that these development decision-making processes will need to account for.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about stakeholders.  It is important to note, for example, that the Bill changes the people who will make decisions in the maritime area from the foreshore team to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities.  Traditionally, those two organisations have been very land focused.  Now they will be working with marine stakeholders.  Therefore, there is something for development management guidelines to say about who typical marine stakeholders might be, where they might be found and how they might be contacted.  For example, standing groups might be used for engagement.  In principle, it is about helping that transition and helping development management to move as envisaged by the marine planning and development management Bill.  That is the development management side of things.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the offshore renewable energy aspect.  Offshore renewable energy is a relatively new and emerging sector in Ireland.  Again, there is a lot to be said for supporting transition.  There are new assessments that need to be thought about, such as visualisation assessments.  We need to reflect on how to establish the best available evidence to accompany decisions and identify how people can get involved with the processes related to offshore renewable energy.  Both sets of guidelines will be subject to consultation and assessment as required under the nature directives, the strategic environmental assessment directive and others as necessary.  We will seek to include all relevant people to inform the development of those guidelines to make sure everyone is involved in setting a course for making the changes and making the progress required in Ireland's maritime area.</p></speech>

I was in the Seanad.  There was no disrespect intended but I could not be in two places at the one time.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for the briefings that were provided.

It is an important commitment from the Government's perspective because the Government committed to enact the marine planning and development management Bill within its first nine months.  I am happy to support the Department's work in this regard.</p><p>It is very important for the country.  We have big targets for renewable electricity, specifically to try to achieve 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  As it is an enormous item of legislation for a lay person to work his or her way around, I thank the witnesses and everyone who has contributed to help us with our task.  The explanation provided earlier about commencing on the east coast was very helpful.  There does seem to be a very logical progression there.  It is welcome and I am happy to support that.  </p><p> Earlier, an energy security assessment or review was mentioned specifically on a question about future uses for this legislation or the legislation permitting future maritime activity such as that associated with LNG or other activities.  When is that assessment or report due to be delivered?  </p><p> I take the point about fisheries being a matter that is both under European competence and for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Should the committee request a statement from the aforementioned Minister on the proposed legislation?  I appreciate the officials' saying that it is another Department and it is welcome that they have described the stakeholder forums which they are looking to establish.  However, for the purpose of this committee progressing this work, it would be useful to receive guidance from the Minister.    </p><p> The idea of community gain is really important.  There will be broad community gain for all of us if we can achieve our renewable energy targets and if we can move away from our reliance on fossil fuels.  With each application that will be made under this legislation there will be both environmental and economic benefits.  It may be a case of how long is a piece of string but has any assessment been attempted to quantify the potential in this regard?  What mechanism can be employed to try to secure a firm commitment that each commercially profitable application approved will deliver specific community gain in a localised manner?  That should not be the dominant issue but it would be an important precedent for us to try and achieve if it is possible.  </p></speech>

Members will appreciate that while we are looking at investing significantly in offshore renewable energy, and we have a lot of onshore wind too, wind is not 100% reliable so there must be other sources of energy to provide backup when we do not have enough wind blowing to enable us to meet our energy requirements.  That review process has begun.  I understand the outcomes are expected towards the middle or end of next year.  The policy position around what other energy sources we may need to have and what policies we need to enable that to happen, will become clear.  At that point, should there be a requirement for additional areas to be brought under the remit of the marine planning and development management Bill, that is something that can be looked at then.  Until then, no decisions will be made to move towards other sources such as LNG to provide backup.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Clancy, to respond on community gain.</p></speech>

The contribution for each of those projects is set at &euro;2 per MW hour.  These funds will then be aligned to incentivise investment in local renewable energy, energy efficiency measures and climate action initiatives.  For context, under the recent offshore renewable electricity support scheme, the community benefit fund will deliver in or around &euro;4.5 million per annum to sustainable initiatives targeted at those communities living in proximity to the projects.  This will be amended and scaled up for future offshore projects.</p></speech>

With respect to Mr. Woolley's answer in regard to Article 8.1 of the directive that in response to consultation feedback there was less a focus in the revised draft on the spatial and temporal aspects of it, surely, Article 8.1 is legally binding and, therefore, whatever about people's views of the detail there is a requirement under the directive to have that detail in it.  I ask Mr. Woolley to respond on that issue.  It is important we do not have a planning regime and framework that falls foul of a legal obligation under the relevant EU law.</p> <p>  With regard to the marine planning framework, when will the environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment and public consultation around that be undertaken?  My understanding is that this is also a legal requirement in the process.  I am confused as to the relationship between the strategic maritime activity zones - I am finding the acronyms tricky to deal with - and the marine planning framework in terms of how we ensure consistency and public consultation in regard to the zones.  I ask one of the witnesses to talk me through that process.</p> <p>  I asked the following very specific question in the first round but it was not answered.  Has the Attorney General provided advice that the consent regime is compliant with the EIA directive and the Aarhus Convention in terms of not having an EIA requirement and public consultation?  I want to return to the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, which I also raised, in regard to the marine areas of protection.  I am genuinely concerned that the lag here is going to cause a difficulty.  While we are rightly pushing ahead on the need to have a planning regime for renewable energies, we are potentially doing it to the detriment of biodiversity and, again, the requirement under Article 1 of the directive for sustainability.  How can the witnesses reassure us that notwithstanding there is a different timeframe for the publication of the Crowe report and the necessary legislation for the marine protected areas, we are not going to end up with that lag and we will not be in a situation where planning applications, for example, for wind farms are being carried out in the absence of having the marine areas of protection fully in place?</p> <p> I ask the witnesses to also explain the differences between the two general schemes.  I am still unsure as to whether the general scheme that is on the website of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is identical to the one that was published last year or whether there have been amendments to it.  If there have been amendments, can the witnesses tell us what they are?  If not, can they tell us what went to Cabinet in the memo that was agreed?  </p> <p>  I support Senator Fitzpatrick's suggestion that a statement be sought from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I appreciate this is not within Mr. McCabe's area of responsibility but it would be remiss of us not to fully interrogate that issue as part of the planning regime.</p><p>I would certainly like to see that.</p><p> Finally, Mr. McCabe may not want to answer this but I presume it is the view of the Department that it would be better if aquaculture was included so that there would be a comprehensive regime and that is why it has included the option of bringing it in at a later stage.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether there is specific advice relating to public consultation at the strategic maritime area zones, SMAZ, stage but I must clarify an issue.

The plan does have policies that refer to and have a spatial element.  For example, the offshore renewable energy section talks about the need to ensure that those seeking to conduct activities in Ireland's maritime area are precluded from the development of offshore renewable energy in areas that are subject to ongoing application.  There is a map accompanying that policy which sets out the lines and the polygons so people understand exactly where applications are being considered.  Similarly, there is a map accompanying aquaculture which provides people with insights into where permissions are in place for people to conduct aquaculture activity relating to fin fish, shellfish or seaweeds, and there is a policy stating that if people are going to do things in these areas, even if it appears no-one is engaged in aquaculture there, they need to be aware that there is a permit in place for those activities and they need to speak to the relevant people to make sure there is compatibility.  Some of the work we have been doing in ports and shipping, for example, involved working very closely with the Marine Institute which contacted and worked with the ports across Ireland to ensure that the jurisdictions that port authorities control are brought together in a national map for the first time.  We are incorporating that into the plan and we have policies tied to those spatial areas to make sure that conflicts are managed appropriately and that consultation happens as early as possible, with the right people and at the right time.  I hope that provides some assurance that the plan is spatial where it can be.  In taking that approach, we have responded appropriately to Article 8.1.</p> <p>  For every single matter that the plan engages with and for every activity that the plan has policy for, the level of information available, be it spatial or otherwise, varies wildly.  We had a discussion earlier about hydrogen and there are certain industries that do not have a strong policy background yet but we make reference to them in the plan because we know they are coming but there is not really something that can be said spatially with certainty at the moment.  Where we can, we have been spatial and have set things out.  They are on best available knowledge on the activities as they happen.  Over time, that spatial specificity in relation to the plan and policies will be built upon through guidelines and the SMAZ process which the Deputy identified and on which Mr.  Nolan can elaborate.  </p> <p>  In terms of environmental assessments, we consulted on those with the draft plan beginning last November and closing in April.  We had substantial comment on those which we are factoring into the plan revisions.</p></speech>

I have two questions and a quick comment.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the terms of enforcement.  I welcome the decision by the Government to put together an independent enforcement body which will assume responsibility for marine planning enforcement.  I am hoping to get a little more information about how that body will be established, the timelines for putting it together, its terms of reference and its potential make-up, to ensure it is representative of all the stakeholders in that area.  I appreciate that the Attorney General is providing legal advice on that but I would welcome the Department's view on how to set this new body up for success because that is imperative.</p> <p>  With regard to the relevant projects which will have to apply separately for MACs and planning permission under the new proposed regime, can the witnesses confirm whether a twin-track approach is involved or whether these applications must be made in a particular sequence?  If the latter is the case, is it envisaged that this may slow down the process of getting permission to start construction or installation?</p> <p>  Public consultation and the consideration of environmental impact are paramount.  I agree with the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in that regard.</p></speech>

The decision by the Government to establish this enforcement agency is very recent.  We are at the stage of scoping it out.  We will obviously be including it in the primary legislation.  We are developing that legislation with the Attorney General at the moment.  The good news is that this is not the first time an enforcement agency has been established.  We have a couple of blueprints, such as that of the Environmental Protection Agency.  We will be talking to such bodies, on a very practical level, and to existing players in the industry.  Work is in progress at the moment with regard to the nitty-gritty.</p></speech>

There is a deadline for the establishment of the body on a practical basis because it must be in place before the first MACs are issued under this new Bill.  I expect these to issue in 2022.  I do not want to tie myself to that deadline but that is what we are aiming for.  I hope that gives the Deputy a sense of the timeline for the establishment of the enforcement agency.</p></speech>

The MAC comes first and deals with the property terms and the issue of the fit and proper person, which relates to the question of whether a person has the financial and technical capabilities to do what they propose to do.  This consent is essentially a gateway to planning.  It is rather different from the consent process under the Foreshore Act 1933, which is much broader and more technically complex.  This is meant to be a very tight and defined procedure which will deal with a number of limited areas with a target timeframe of 90 days, although I envisage that most applications will not take 90 days to process.</p></speech>

I put on record my thanks for the document on frequently asked questions, which was very helpful.  It is a very complex Bill in many ways.  I would love to see a dumbed-down simpleton's guide to the Bill because we have to communicate with coastal communities.  I think that is really important.</p><p>I am not sure whether the witnesses are privy to the briefing paper prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  I suggest they contact their Minister and get a copy of it.  It is an excellent piece of work and I want to acknowledge the enormous effort the service put into it, as it does with everything.  I will start by referencing a few points from that paper.  Some of these comments do not really require an answer, but I will share them with the committee. </p><p> One issue concerns the functions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and those of the coastal planning authorities.  We need greater clarity on that relationship.  Many of the witnesses will be aware of the controversy surrounding the strategic housing development, SHD.  The common complaint concerns the right of citizens to appeal.  We are talking about An Bord Plean&aacute;la having a function in major infrastructural projects.  That will always be an issue of contention and concern.  I am concerned about it.  I was a director of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company for ten years so I know the challenges and difficulties of foreshore and coastal development.  I am also aware of the great potential there.  I think this Bill needs to be tweaked in places but on the whole I welcome it.  It is a very positive contribution.  This is something that should happen.  I would like to touch on the issue of shareholder engagement.  We know from the general scheme that the Bill has not been subject to public consultation at this stage.  I am concerned about that.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on it.  I apologise if they have already covered this.  </p><p> I refer also to the community benefit scheme for offshore renewables.  One of the previous speakers spoke about developing a communications protocol for it.  That is important.  This is a really important aspect of the Bill.  Perhaps we could hear more about it.  </p><p> I share the witnesses' concerns about aquaculture.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, which is due to meet this afternoon.  I can commit to raising this issue with that committee.  We need to be aware of what is going here.  I will suggest an examination of this by the other committee.  It is very important that we provide bits and pieces of consultation on that. </p><p> Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin spoke about the general scheme of the marine planning and development management Bill, which is featured on the website of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Has it been amended since it was originally posted on the Department's website on 9 December 2019?  If so, perhaps the witnesses could comment on the changes.  What is the status of the general scheme featured on the website? </p><p> I also wish to raise the issue of consultation.  The Irish Environmental Network and other environmental NGOs have a huge role to play in this.  This committee is interested in engaging with them.  It is important that the Department also taps into that rich source of information and commitment.  I have some questions in this regard.  Why do we need strategic marine activity zones if we have proper spatial plans?  Can the witnesses give me the rationale?  Moreover, why has there been no public consultation on the designation of strategic marine activity zones and maritime area consent?  Finally, is there any role for the Office of the Planning Regulator in the development of this legislation?</p></speech>

I ask the Senator to alert me if I do.  I am not 100% sure, but I believe a further version of the general scheme of the Bill was published.  That included changes to formatting and corrections of errata, but no substantial changes.  We have not drafted a fresh version to reflect the major changes in policy development that have happened in the course of drafting.  We have identified the major changes in the answers to frequently asked questions.</p> <p>  Several members of the committee referred to the scale of the Bill.  Thanks to sterling work by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the eventual legal text will be a far shorter and more concise document than the general scheme.  It will be able to do many things which we thought would require specific provisions.  Our hope and intention is for the eventual legal text to be much shorter, more concise and more legible.  I think everyone will be happy to hear that.</p><p>On consultation, I reiterate that there is consultation on strategic marine activity zones, in respect of their designation and in the strategic environmental assessment.  There will, therefore, probably be consultation on the double within that process for different purposes.  Regarding the maritime area consent, there are good reasons for there not being consultation within that process, mainly concerning what is under consideration at that stage in the process.  There simply will not be that much meaningful information.</p><p> The questions people will ask will be specific, such as about the visual impact of a development, the impact on a certain species and the pollution impact.  That level of information will not be available until the environmental assessments are done, until there is a detailed project design and until the complete application is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is at that point that the most meaningful consultation can happen, as well as the appropriate environmental assessment.  As I mentioned, however, we have a pre-application process, which happens before the MAC, to try to draw out at the earliest possible stage what those potential issues will be.</p></speech>

Precisely how that will interact with its terrestrial role is something on which we are trying to nail down the fine detail.  However, there will be an oversight role for that organisation regarding certain aspects of all of this process.</p></speech>

By default, that will become part of their corporate development plans.  The OPR will also have an expanded role in the oversight of marine planning as part of those corporate development plans.  There is also a role in that regard in respect of research and training.  It is not just the new breed of marine planners who will be needed to facilitate this system but also local authority elected members, which is something that is being worked on continuously.</p></speech>

On the role of the OPR, I think that is great because training is an important part of the remit of that organisation.  Regarding the general scheme of the Bill on the website, and I accept it has been acknowledged that there have been changes which have not yet been updated, I ask that the relevant updating, if it is at all possible, be done this week.  It is important that if people are looking at the Department's website that it should have the most up-to-date information.  If that can be done and if it is practical and possible, I ask the Department to take it on board.</p></speech>

I also thank Senator Boyhan for committing to raise the issue regarding the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It has been mentioned by several Deputies and Senators, and the committee will write to the Department to ask it to make a submission on this matter as well.</p></speech>

In 2018, we established an advisory group for the national marine planning framework made up of the pillars of society, if one likes, from the public sector, economic, social and environmental areas.  We have met at least 11 times in the last two years and that group has advised us on issues concerning marine planning etc.  The Irish Environment Network, Coastwatch Ireland, Birdwatch Ireland,  An Taisce, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group and Sustainable Water Networks Ireland, SWAN, are part of that group and have been an ongoing part of this process.</p></speech>

Several members referred to how large this Bill is and that what it seeks to do is significant in the management of our marine area for future development.  That concerns not just commercial development, but also how we manage the precious environmental resource aspect.  It is an indicator of its importance that the sea area is seven times greater than the land.  The impact a healthy marine environment has on us on land cannot be stressed enough.</p> <p>  I am constantly trying to compare terrestrial planning to marine planning, just to have some place to start off and judge this matter on.  One of the most important and core principles of our planning system is how democratic it is.</p><p>Anybody can make a submission on a planning application and appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If people seek to go further they can avail of judicial reviews.  People also get input into county development and local area plans, so there is a good democratic process available.</p><p> Will the witnesses confirm that there will be a number of opportunities for public consultation on how we are managing our marine system?  The national marine planning framework had a public consultation stage and it is now at a draft publication stage.  Will there be a second round of public consultation on that, as there might be with a county development or regional spatial plan?</p><p> The marine spatial plans are like regional plans within that so will there be a public consultation aspect to them?  We are dealing with the marine Bill today and there is a public consultation aspect to the development permission aspect.  Is there also a public consultation aspect to the strategic marine activity zones?  It is really important that there be such consultation, although I cannot see where there is a deficit currently in public consultation.  I want to be sure I have those aspects correct.</p></speech>

I can focus on the national marine planning framework as an example, as it is being finalised ahead of the March deadline.  In effect, it has been out for two public consultations.  The baseline study was released at the end of 2017, went through full public consultation and it led to the draft national marine planning framework, which was launched last November.  My colleague, Mr. Wooley, mentioned earlier that there was also a strategic environmental assessment published at the same time, along with a Natura impact statement and an appropriate assessment.  They were published on the same day.</p> <p>  That public consultation was elongated to mid-April this year.  We did a series of roadshows around the country to inform people and get feedback.  There was also the statutory consultation, when members of the public could offer submissions.  We have done an extensive amount of work to analyse those submissions in order to bring together a final document.  We are currently doing that.  We will reach our deadline of the first quarter of 2021.  The final national marine planning framework will be launched at that point.  We have done two public consultations on it and we will not be doing another at this point.  That framework is a living and iterative process.</p></speech>

There is so much activity.  This might address Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point on marine protected areas and we will interact with those in future.  We are conscious that this is all one maritime area and we cannot bring all plans in together and at the same time.  We do not have that luxury.  We cannot wait for other plans to come along as this is too important and we must get it right in order to create a decision-making framework.  However, any marine policy or plan that comes after this will be informed by the national marine planning framework and the framework itself will take this into account in future iterations as it goes along.  I plan to review the national marine planning framework in the first couple of years of its lifetime because of the amount of activity happening all at one time, whether it relates to marine protected areas, ports or an offshore renewable energy development plan.</p> <p>  There is much happening over the next 18 to 24 months and we will have to capture that again in the next couple of years.  We are committed to a six-year cycle but it will be shorter in the first iteration.  It is an ongoing process, which is an important point to make.</p></speech>

Is there a similar ORE and environmental NGO working group or fisheries group being established?  How are the environmental NGOs involved in this process?  By the way, we have invited them to attend on Thursday.  We will have witnesses from An Taisce, the Irish Wildlife Trust and Coastwatch.</p></speech>

We have not worked out the formal consultation process.  The first out of the traps was the fisheries and ORE group.  It is probably the most important as regards the industry that is already there and consulting with the industry that is being introduced into the maritime area.  It is certainly something we can look at as an ongoing template to bring other groups in or to structure them as one group interacting with another.</p></speech>

One of the significant pieces of work we are undertaking, which will kick off shortly, is an update to the offshore renewable energy development plan.  As part of that, we will have extensive stakeholder input and involvement.  It will look at the future strategy on ORE development, particularly as there have been technological advances since the last one was completed.  When the last one was undertaken, there was extensive input from all stakeholders, including the environmental NGOs.  We see them having a significant role to play in the new plan and we will initiate work on that very shortly.</p></speech>

A lot of my questions, particularly those about public consultation, have been answered.  We all believe public consultation is important.  In what way has Covid affected the Departments?  We have seen for nearly a year now that in local authorities all the planning meetings have been cancelled and things have been going online, so there has been a huge delay in the past few months.  Do the witnesses feel this might have had an effect?</p> <p>  We need clarity on the timelines needed in the Bill in order that projects can plan with certainty.  It is all about timescales now.  This legislation is so important and so needed.  Are greater resources being provided to put the administrative functions in place?  Is there any update on that?</p> <p>  Enforcement is another matter I have been asking about and was going to ask the witnesses about.  I see that the challenges are forward planning, development, management and enforcement.  Those are huge challenges.  One of our witnesses spoke about community and community funding.  That will be welcome because it is so important that our communities are involved in this.</p> <p>  I also welcome the fact that there are targets for 2020 and 2030 and more projects, particularly on the east coast.  All of us have to play our part in our environment.  This is creating jobs.  Timescale is important.  All of us are doing what we can to support this legislation.  I thank the witnesses.  A lot of my questions, as I said, have been asked.</p></speech>

I will take the ones on the consultation, the impact of Covid and the resources required into the future.</p> <p>  On a very practical basis, we were in the middle of a public consultation when Covid kicked in.  We had already visited 11 coastal locations around the country, from Killybegs right down to Tralee, and we were working our way up the east coast when Covid kicked in.  We had to suspend our public engagement part, but at that point we ran the first ever Civil Service public consultation online, so we reacted quite well.  We also changed the end date for final submissions to April.  I think the original date was at the end of February.  We took into account the public's reaction to that.  I am confident enough that the team reacted really well.  There were very practical considerations in that the Department had to move resources to more urgent areas.</p><p>That certainly created a time lag but thanks to the good work of the team we will come in on time in terms of both the Bill and the national marine planning framework or NMPF.</p><p> In terms of the resources required, we have two reference points.  One is a recent air wind report that pointed to the fact that 30 human people are needed into the future to run the marine planning system.  We are undergoing our own review that will look at the resources required in our Department, post the Bill, in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, again post Bill, in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and in the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, most likely.  The report and review should be carried out over the next couple of months so we will be in a better position to answer that question.  The air wind report is a good report.   .     </p></speech>

I greatly appreciate the briefing documents, opening statements, presentations and I have also read documentation from law firms that have put out a view on this matter.  I find myself very excited about the employment potential and seismic shift in our nation to develop so that a whole new industry opens up, and one that was never envisaged before.</p> <p>  I have had to move between meetings but I watched this debate on the monitor in my office.  Most of my questions have been answered and I apologise in advance if my next question on competencies in professional pathways has already been addressed.  Is there a pipeline of professionals available so we have a successful marine industry?  Have the Departments engaged with universities and colleges?  Is there a sufficient number of courses?  Are courses wide enough?  Should we have a chat with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about this industry?  What courses do we need to develop?  It is only in the last two years that I have noticed that the children of my peers are studying marine biology with a view to a very definite future in Ireland and not having to travel to Fiji or somewhere like that to develop this work.  Therefore, I am curious about education and professions.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan addressed my concern about competencies and whether we need additional personnel in local authorities.  The witnesses have addressed the matter but perhaps they have something further to say.  My query is about education.         </p></speech>

She asked a very good question and we take education very seriously.  We want to make sure that when the system is launched that it can stand on its own two feet and there are people who can really make it work properly.  With that in mind, we plan on working very closely with the Irish Planning Institute and the Office of Planning Regulation.  Earlier I mentioned to Senator Boyhan that the planning regulator will play a lead role in the training that is needed, particularly in the local authorities system.  I am very keen to work with universities or third level institutes.  My colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication might want to comment on this but part of the supply chain will consider that aspect in terms of the future knowledge that is needed in this society.  I agree that the next few years will be a very exciting time for us.  It is not often that a brand new industry is brought into an economy or society so we want to prepare and make sure that we have the right foundations to support the industry.</p></speech>

At a senior level we have discussed opportunities with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p>We have been discussing opportunities with officials from the Department of Transport with a view to potential ports development, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a role to play in terms of the supply chain.  We are also seeking to engage with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science because, as the Senator pointed out, there are opportunities for skills development and to align the courses that may be available to maximise the opportunities for employment in the sector into the future.  That work is at an early stage, but we will seeking to progress it in the next number of months.</p></speech>

The ORE representatives will appear before the committee on Thursday and it will be a good opportunity to discuss their requirements with them.</p> <p>  There are four minutes left.  I have a question and Deputy Gould also has a question.  Regarding timeframes, I realise the MAC is time limited when consent is given.  Is the development permission also time limited?  Again, I am comparing it to land development, whereby permission can be given and somebody can sit on a site for a long time knowing that the demand is there and that it increases the value.  I know the person does not own it, but is development consent time limited as well?</p></speech>

The developer will get the MAC and then try to get the planning permission.  If permission is refused, the MAC will terminate or if a period of time elapses, the MAC will also terminate automatically, unless there is a good reason to extend.  That possibility exists.  There will be a time-bound period in which to secure development consent, after which the MAC terminates.  Again, somebody else can come in and use it.  Likewise, there will probably be an appropriate period - we have to nail down precisely how this works - in which to begin construction.  That will likely be tied closely to the lifetime of the development consent.  I believe the standard in planning is five years.  It would be tied closely to that.  However, there will be limits and there will be strong levers on behalf of the State to prevent any type of land hoarding, squatting or-----</p></speech>

For me as a new Deputy, this is quite a robust Bill.  There is a great deal of detail in it and much to take on board.  Can the witnesses outline what were the changes between the first general scheme and the second general scheme?  One of the witnesses mentioned the frequently asked questions.</p></speech>

We set out broadly what the changes are in the frequently asked questions document.  We have not developed a fresh general scheme since December because the structural changes were so significant.  We have not done a separate new general scheme since December.</p></speech>

We will have additional explanatory material detailing exactly what the legal text and each section will do, which, we hope, will be in a much more concise and digestible format than the massive scheme, but it will still provide sufficient information to be able to consider it properly.</p></speech>

The three key areas that have changed between the publication of general scheme which the Deputy is referring to and now are very recent changes.  That was set out in a memo in October, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned.  It relates to the amalgamation of the planning interest stage with the maritime area consent stage.  There is now a single maritime area consent.  That brings it down to a two-stage process.  The maritime area consent will be from the appropriate Minister and the planning permission will be from the appropriate planning authority, be it An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authority.</p></speech>

I advise Deputy Gould we are over the two hours allocated therefore I cannot permit further discussion.  I am sure the Departments are open to our writing to them if we wish to get clarity on any aspect of the legislation.  I thank Mr. Bernard Nolan, Mr. Conor McCabe, Ms Martina Hennessy, Mr. Tom Woolley and Ms Anne-Marie Clancy for giving of their time today and for giving of their time to give us a briefing last week.  It is a large Bill and there is a desire to progress it and we need to do that.  The committee will address and apply itself to doing that in the timeframe.</p></speech>
