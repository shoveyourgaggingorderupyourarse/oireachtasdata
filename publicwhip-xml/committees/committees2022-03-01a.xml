She sends her apologies.</p> <p>  We are here to discuss accelerating offshore wind energy development, including: floating and fixed offshore wind energy; the east coast potential, which is very clear to us; and the potential of the west coast.  We will also discuss supply chains, logistics and the development of the green hydrogen economy.  There is much talk about that at the moment.</p> <p>  I welcome: Dr. Stefan Kaufmann, innovation commissioner for green hydrogen at the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Mr. Frank Daly and Ms Kate Dempsey of the German-Irish Hydrogen Council; Dr. James Carton, assistant professor in energy sustainability and hydrogen at the Dublin City University school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering and Science Foundation Ireland MaREI Research Centre-funded investigator; Mr. Noel Cunniffe, CEO, Mr. Justin Moran, director of external affairs, and Mr. Niall Goodwin, head of policy, from Wind Energy Ireland; Mr. Peter Lefroy, chairperson of the offshore committee of RWE Renewables; and Mr. Jim Dollard, executive director, ESB generation and trading; Mr. Paul Lennon, asset development manager, ESB generation and trading; and Ms &Aacute;ine O&rsquo;Grady, strategy and portfolio planning, ESB generation and trading.  I thank the witnesses for coming to engage with us today and to answer whatever questions we might have on this very important topic.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege.  I remind the witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I give.  For witnesses attending from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present on the Leinster House campus.</p><p> Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I remind Members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In that regard I ask all Members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I turn now to Dr. Kaufmann, who joins us from South Africa.  Dr. Kaufmann, would you like to give us your opening statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stefan Kaufmann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for its friendly invitation.  Many greetings from Cape Town.  Here it is 30&deg;C and, as Members may see, there is a black-and-white photograph behind me, so the committee has an impression of the weather here but without the sun.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this statement to it.  It is a pleasure to connect with my associates in Ireland again on the very important topic of hydrogen.</p> <p>  As part of my role as innovation commissioner for green hydrogen at the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, I meet with prospective partner countries to discuss potential co-operation in the field of green hydrogen.  This is because my country, as the committee will know, remains an energy importer and will be dependent on the import of renewable energies in the future.</p> <p>  In October 2021 my team and I visited Ireland.  The German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce organised an intensive meeting schedule over the course of two days in order that we could better understand Ireland's potential for hydrogen production and export to Germany.  On that occasion we had the opportunity to meet with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his team; leading academics on the topic of hydrogen, including Dr. James Carton, who I believe is with the committee today; utility companies Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB; and a number of other companies with interest in the field such as Dublin Bus, BOC-Linde, Wind Energy Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority Of Ireland, SEAI, the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Ireland's energy regulator.  Seeing first-hand the experience Ireland has gained from the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel was of great interest to us.  While visiting BOC-Linde's offices, we got to see the refuelling of one of Dublin Bus's three hydrogen fuel cell electric double-decker buses now running in the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>  What was clear during our visit is that Ireland has the potential to be a significant player in the world of hydrogen.  We learned about the wind resources off the Atlantic coast in particular, potentially reaching up to 70 GW of wind power.  We also met with hydrogen project developers such as Valentia Island Energy and EIH2, which presented their proposed plans for hydrogen production off the south coast.</p> <p>  German-Irish co-operation on energy dates back almost 100 years.  While in Limerick for a meeting with the ESB, we visited the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric power plant, on the River Shannon, Ireland's first power plant.  A great example of German-Irish co-operation in this field, it was built in partnership with German engineers, and the Siemens turbines installed there are still in operation today.  It is my belief that hydrogen could herald a new era of German-Irish partnership in the energy sector.  We were delighted that, following our visit to Ireland, the German-Irish Hydrogen Council was formed because it gives us a focal point to continue discussions with Ireland about hydrogen.  We discussed with the council areas of research that would be of mutual interest to Germany and Ireland and welcomed the response we got.</p> <p>  As an island nation, one of Ireland's greatest challenges is delivering the excess hydrogen it will produce to markets in mainland Europe.  My department is preparing a proposal to conceptualise a pilot project in partnership with Ireland to show the feasibility of delivering Irish green hydrogen from Ireland's producers to German ports or the European mainland.  We feel that this proposal could become the initial step in forming a deeper and ongoing relationship with Ireland in the field of green hydrogen.</p> <p>  I once again thank the committee for the opportunity to participate today.  I wish the committee a very successful and productive meeting.  Please excuse me, Chairman, if I leave a little early.  I wish the committee all success and hope for a really good partnership between Germany and Ireland in green hydrogen and other topics.</p></speech>

It is very encouraging to us to hear the level of enthusiasm you have expressed for co-operation between our two countries.  I know you may not be able to stay with us for much longer, so we thank you for taking time out of your stay in South Africa to join us.</p> <p>  I turn now to Mr. Daly.  Mr. Daly, will you make your opening statement, please, on behalf of the German-Irish Hydrogen Council?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#B00400"><p>In July 2020 the German Government published its hydrogen strategy.  This is a very detailed document that provides a step-by-step action plan for the implementation of green hydrogen in the country.  A few numbers jump out from the pages of the document - for example, 90 TWh to 110 TWh.  That is Germany's projected demand for hydrogen in 2030 to feed industries such as chemical and steel production.  Of that amount, 14 TWh, or approximately 15% of demand, is the amount of green hydrogen Germany estimates it will be able to produce domestically by 2030.  This means that, in order to decarbonise these hard-to-decarbonise industrial sectors, Germany needs to import the vast majority of its green hydrogen.  That is why Germany is reaching out to European colleagues and countries beyond to partner with it in the field of green hydrogen.  Germany sees its industrial demand as a catalyst for speeding up the market roll-out of green hydrogen.</p> <p>  Ireland's energy profile is complementary to Germany's.  We do not have the large heavy industry that Germany has but we do have vast renewable energy potential, particularly off our coasts.  We firmly believe Ireland has the potential to position itself as an exporter of hydrogen to Germany if those resources are fully utilised.</p> <p>  It is for that reason the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce established the German-Irish Hydrogen Council this year.  Our membership includes Irish and German companies, including the ESB, that are involved in offshore wind, electrolysis and hydrogen storage.  Our goal is to foster better co-operation between the two countries through engagement at departmental and ministerial level in both jurisdictions, and we strive to lay the groundwork to get business done between Irish and German companies involved in the field of green hydrogen.</p></speech>

Ms Dempsey, you are to give us an opening statement also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#B00600"><p>Only last week, conflict raised the cost of oil to more than $105 a barrel.  The energy crisis is worsening not just environmentally but economically and socially.  The ever-present challenges of the climate emergency and the transition towards decarbonisation have resulted in the industry responding with innovation to support net zero.  The Irish Government's clear and commendable policy response to these challenges has been to encourage the development of renewable energy to the extent that Ireland can become a net exporter of energy.</p> <p>  In that context, the work being led by the Department to put in place a "plan-led" approach to offshore renewable development through a revised offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, is welcome.  Post 2030, this will provide clear signals to developers.  Between now and 2030, we need to ensure we do as much as possible to support some of the country's most promising and viable offshore projects by providing equitable and prompt access to the licensing process.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, it is crucial that Ireland continues to learn from other jurisdictions, focusing on developing supply chain confidence for offshore energy development, increasing the capacity of the national transmission system, encouraging and incentivising off-grid solutions, promoting the delivery of floating offshore in advance of 2030 and incentivising the production of green hydrogen to serve domestic and international energy needs.  It is only through the culmination of all types of offshore energy generation that Ireland can truly capture the potential of our offshore natural energy resources.</p> <p>  This is not a time to wait or to be complacent.  It is the time to act.  It is the time to realise the aim of this committee and to ensure stakeholders are supported in urgently progressing all viable renewable energy projects, promoting confidence of investment to keep Ireland at the international forefront of clean energy.</p><p>We would ask the committee to consider the opportunity that our renewable energy resources presents for potential trade with Germany and with other European partners.  The German-Irish Hydrogen Council wishes to co-operate with the members of the committee in order to deliver high-level engagement between the Governments of Germany and Ireland in the field of green hydrogen.  </p></speech>

I now move to Dr. Carton for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Carton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#C00300"><p>I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to address members on accelerating and achieving the full potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind resource and green hydrogen, with the view to contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s, Europe&rsquo;s and the global energy demand.</p> <p>  Energy consumption and use is a major contributor to carbon emissions.  We must transition with haste to more sustainable energy, food and waste systems.  My contribution will focus on decarbonisation and on the necessary role of the energy carrier of green hydrogen in Ireland.</p> <p>  The first key message is that our energy system and its decarbonisation must be viewed as the complex integrated system that it is.  As a country, we have introduced incremental change that has not been effective and that will not achieve our necessary cumulative carbon reductions towards 2030 or 2050.  </p> <p>  The second key message is that we know how to decarbonise and we know what do.  We must manage energy consumption.  We must electrify as much as is possible, through heat-pumps, battery electric vehicles, BEVs, etc.  We must increase energy efficiency and deploy renewable energy fast and at a large scale.  However, electricity can only bring us so far.  Variable wind is not useful on its own all of the time.  Only so many cables of a limited capacity will be acceptable or placed underground, overhead or subsea.</p> <p>  What will happen to heavy duty vehicles, intercity trains, intercontinental airplanes, ships, agricultural fertilizer, cement, aluminium, etc?  At the same time that we deploy renewables, we must deploy and scale up the energy carriers that are necessary to decarbonise.  We also need to power our electricity grid when there is no wind.  Therefore, we need energy storage many orders of magnitude greater than what batteries alone can provide.  </p> <p>   I ask the committee to think about hydrogen: green hydrogen from renewable energy.  In a recent report from International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, hydrogen could meet 12% of world energy use by 2050.  Others suggest a figure of 24%.  My colleague mentioned a figure of 15% in Germany alone by 2030.  To enable this transformational energy storage change, what should we do?</p> <p>  First, we need a hydrogen strategy that would enable policy development and guide investment now.   We need to stimulate suitable demand for hydrogen.  Production is not necessarily a bottleneck, but it just needs to be stimulated.  We need to focus on hydrogen valleys, through a cluster of producers, distributors and users.  This reduces risk, reduces cost and enables scale.  We need to implement supporting mechanisms for green hydrogen infrastructure.  We need to implement the biofuels obligation that supports green hydrogen.  We need to deploy guarantees of origin as necessary, models of which are found across Europe.  We need to deploy large-scale hydrogen storage in Ireland for consistent energy supply, which is directly connected to the geopolitical energy security challenges that we face today.   We need to create and support export opportunities for green hydrogen, as we heard from our German colleague earlier.  We need to further study of the role of green hydrogen to decarbonise heat.  We need to investigate further work from the SEAI.  We need to launch a national hydrogen research centre to enable high-value jobs and skills.  This would involve a similar approach to what we have done in this country with tech companies, medical device companies and the pharmaceuticals industry.  </p> <p>  The final message is that decarbonisation can support rural and coastal development and jobs.  It can enhance our energy security, keep our homes warm and keep our cities clean.  To accelerate and achieve the full potential of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind resources, we need green hydrogen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity to speak and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#C00400"><p>I thank Dr. Carton for his statement.  I will now go to Mr. Cunliffe for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#C00500"><p>On behalf of Wind Energy Ireland, I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to join it today.  Wind Energy Ireland is the country&rsquo;s largest representative body for renewable energy, with more than 160 members throughout the wind energy supply chain.  Wind energy has transformed Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system, cutting millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions every year, 4.5 million tonnes in 2020 alone, more than all other renewables combined.  This is steadily reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.</p> <p>  I would like to begin by stating clearly that our Climate Action Plan targets are at serious risk.  We must cut our carbon emissions by 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030.  We cannot achieve this without 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy connected to the system.  The problem is not a lack of projects.  As the committee can see from the presentation shared with its members, we have more than 20,000 MW of capacity under development off the east, south and west coasts.  We have the projects.  We have the investment.  We have the teams who can deliver.  It is time to focus on delivery.</p> <p>  Last September, at our annual offshore wind energy conference, we published our report, Twelve Months to Deliver Offshore Wind.  It showed that none of the targets and deadlines contained in the prior building offshore wind report have been, or will be, met.  We must acknowledge that over the previous two years, we have had to deal with an unprecedented healthcare crisis.  It is true that despite this there has been progress.  I would like to give credit to the Government, and policymakers from all sides, who worked on the legislation for the passing of the Maritime Area Planning Act before Christmas.</p> <p>  The model for our offshore electricity grid has now been identified.  Consultations are also now under way or have been recently completed on the first offshore auction for phase one projects, for the maritime area consent process and to identify phase two offshore projects, which will deliver at the end of the decade.  However, this does not change the fact that we are losing time.  We can and will develop offshore wind farms.  Yet, whether we will develop enough to meet our 5,000 MW target by 2030, and to cut carbon emissions in the power sector to under 2 million tonnes, depends on what our political leaders, both those in government and in opposition, do next. </p> <p>  The Twelve Months to Deliver Offshore Wind report identified several key actions.  In the interests of time, however, I will briefly focus on four of these, which are: planning, grid, green hydrogen and the supply-chain.  I would like to cover how we can improve the planning system.  Each individual offshore wind farm will be among the largest infrastructure projects delivered in Ireland in a generation.  They are large, complex and highly technical pieces of infrastructure.  The planning applications for permission to build them must be thoroughly and robustly scrutinised.  For this to happen, we need far more resources in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as in other bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  There must be increased funding for the environmental stakeholders who are working to protect our marine biodiversity.  If a project takes 18 to 24 months to get planning consent, and another 18 to 24 months to survive a judicial review, the chances of that project being connected by 2030 are extremely slim.</p> <p>  As well as resourcing the planning system, we need the establishment of the environmental and planning court, along with the funds to make it effective, which is set out in the programme for Government to ensure a swift, effective judicial review system that adheres to our obligations under the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>  We are confident in our members and in the work they are doing to ensure their projects are delivered sustainably, with the support of local communities and with respect to our marine biodiversity.  We welcome the proper scrutiny of their planning applications, but we cannot see projects needlessly delayed.</p> <p>  The Irish electricity grid is simply not strong enough to accommodate 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy.  EirGrid&rsquo;s grid development strategy, shaping our electricity future, must have strong political and public support right across Irish society.  Support for its delivery is a true litmus test that will identify those who are committed to tackling climate change and those who are only prepared to talk about it.  Yet, even if everything in this strategy was delivered, it would not be enough to meet Ireland&rsquo;s carbon budget targets.  We will need to go beyond it.  We currently have a team of grid development experts from Ireland and internationally who are working on a piece of research showing how we can meet our electricity sector carbon budget target for 2021 to 2030.</p><p>We hope this will be useful to EirGrid in updating its grid strategy later this year.  I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss this report with committee members when it is finalised.  While this work is under way, I would appreciate the support of the committee for the establishment of an offshore grid steering committee to co-ordinate the technical and engineering challenges of connecting offshore wind energy.<br/><br/>As we already heard this morning, other speakers will focus on the topic of green hydrogen so I will simply make two points.  First, as committee members will know, we recently published Hydrogen and Wind Energy: The Role of Green Hydrogen in Ireland&rsquo;s Energy Transition, which shows how it can play a vital role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a net-zero society, boost our economy and make our energy supply more secure.  We need a green hydrogen strategy as soon as possible.  However, I would like to be clear that producing green hydrogen in Ireland is only realistic if we can cut the price of renewable electricity.  The single biggest factor in the price of a unit of green hydrogen is the cost of the electricity used to produce it.<br/><br/>In 2020, in the first onshore renewable electricity auction, Ireland had the highest price of any EU country.  We will not succeed until we co-ordinate industry, Government and other stakeholders to find ways to drive down the cost of electricity for today&rsquo;s families and businesses and for tomorrow&rsquo;s thriving green hydrogen economy.<br/><br/>Finally, we want to see a successful renewable energy industry in Ireland with offshore wind energy at the heart of it alongside green hydrogen and our onshore renewables.  If Irish ports and businesses are not able to take advantage of this opportunity, however, there is no doubt others will step in and the money invested will flow out of Ireland.  The chance to develop a skills base and an industry that can compete internationally in a rapidly growing global renewable energy market will be lost.  This is the time for Ireland to seize the opportunity to bring together industry, policymakers and communities to ensure the benefits are maximised from multibillion euro investments in zero-carbon generation that can create thousands of skilled jobs at home and regenerate coastal communities right around the island.<br/><br/>We would like the support of the committee in our efforts to see the Government bring together key Departments and Government agencies, like the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland, to work alongside our members to ensure that Irish workers and Irish businesses benefit from Irish wind farms.<br/><br/>We want to make it clear that we believe that achieving Ireland&rsquo;s goal of 5,000 MW of offshore wind energy by 2030 is possible.  We can do this but we can only do it if there is accelerated delivery right across the critical sectors about which I have spoken this morning.  This is the challenge we need to overcome and we have no time to waste.  As was stated at yesterday's release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report:</p><blockquote>	The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet.  Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future. </blockquote></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerard Dollard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#D00300"><p>I wish members a good morning and thank the Chairman for this opportunity to address the committee.  In line with my regulatory licence as executive director of ESB generation and trading, I do not speak for either ESB Networks or as a retail supplier of electricity to either domestic or commercial consumers.  I speak as a generator of electricity that is ultimately sold on the integrated single electricity market, ISEM.</p> <p>  ESB believes that Ireland has a tremendous opportunity now for offshore wind and green hydrogen.  We believe there are four key items that, if acted upon quickly, can position Ireland to deliver 5 GW of offshore wind by 2030, thereby reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security, while also creating an industry to deliver long-term enduring economic and social benefits to the State.</p> <p>  The first item is that we must enable floating offshore wind projects now.  The 2020 programme for Government identifies a potential of at least 30 GW of floating offshore wind by 2050.  ESB and other industry players are currently developing floating offshore projects off the Irish coast.  These projects can be delivered before 2030.  While fixed bed wind farms on the east coast will make up the bulk of capacity delivered in Ireland by 2030, ESB believes floating offshore wind farms will be required in delivering the national target of 5 GW by 2030.  Specifically, we believe Ireland needs a ring-fenced auction for 1 GW of floating offshore wind now to enable it to reach the 5 GW target for renewables by 2030.</p> <p>  The second item is to utilise the existing grid network as efficiently as possible.  We believe an essential step to delivering wind of scale is to utilise the existing grid infrastructure as efficiently as possible.  One of the most effective ways of doing this is through hybrid grid connection projects.  In simple terms, a hybrid grid connection allows two or more forms of generation, say, an offshore wind farm of 500 MW and a conventional power station of 500 MW to share the same grid connection.  The key advantages associated with hybrid connections are the cost to the consumer - it drives down costs because it increases competition - and speed of delivery.  These are existing pieces of infrastructure that do not require new infrastructure to be built and avoid the challenges in building new transmission infrastructure in Ireland.  ESB will be strongly advocating for the use of hybrid grid connection projects now as part of the current consultation process on offshore wind.</p> <p>  The third item is to build early supply chain confidence.  ESB welcomes the maritime area planning, MAP, legislation and the decision to have the first offshore wind renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction in 2022.  These are clear signals to the supply chain industry that Ireland is focused on the delivery of offshore wind in the short term but this momentum needs to be maintained and accelerated if Ireland is to create a supply chain industry in Ireland.  Strong consideration should be given to the State procuring greater than 5 GW from the first two offshore RESS auctions to allow for almost inevitable project attrition.  We need to commission more than 5 GW to ensure that we actually achieve 5 GW.  In addition, a key issue here is building market confidence that a flow of offshore wind projects is envisaged.  We believe that Ireland needs a ring-fenced auction for 1 GW of floating offshore wind now.  For these reason, we recommend that at least 7 GW in total be procured through the first two offshore RESS auctions, of which at least 1 GW should be floating offshore wind.  This approach and timeframe would position Ireland strongly to develop local supply chain job capabilities as opposed to those jobs being created elsewhere.</p> <p>  The fourth item is to set up Ireland for hydrogen production and storage.  As part of ESB&rsquo;s strategy, we will achieve net zero by 2040.  Green hydrogen production will be a critical part of this strategy, requiring large-scale offshore wind capacity and ultimately, a major investment in floating offshore wind.  It will also require the development of a hydrogen economy.  ESB is initiating a number of hydrogen lighthouse projects to develop its hydrogen capability.  In particular, Green Atlantic at Moneypoint will be a major step in growing the hydrogen economy but broader industry and State support will be required to develop an industry of scale in Ireland.</p> <p>  In conclusion, to create a secure, resilient, affordable, decarbonised energy system, we will need considerable build-out of floating wind technology, hydrogen production and large-scale energy storage.  ESB intends to play its role in this vision across a range of wind farm projects.  As part of the Green Atlantic at Moneypoint project, we intend to transform Moneypoint into a renewables hub encompassing a 1.4 GW floating offshore wind farm, hydrogen production and storage facilities, a hub for offshore wind construction and other renewable technologies.  The potential economic impact of the project and others like it are significant.</p> <p>  Crucial to Ireland realising its offshore potential will be developing supply chain confidence, utilising the existing grid as efficiently as possible through the inclusion of hybrids, procuring at least 7 GW from two offshore RESS auctions, promoting the delivery of floating offshore wind by 2030 and incentivising the production of green hydrogen to serve domestic and international energy needs.  These steps, if implemented in the short term, can be transformational for Ireland. </p></speech>

I have been advocating for this session for a while.</p><p>While we talk a lot about what we have to do and decarbonisation, up to now much of that discussion - this is not in any way a negative towards the academics online with us - has been academic in nature and it comes from a desire to do what is right.  As politicians, when we think there is a solution to what is a manifest problem, we often tend to leave it at that, to think we do not need to get back into the decarbonisation debate.  We need to recognise a few fundamentals.</p><p> Onshore wind energy capture is a major problem for many of us in rural constituencies.  In my view, we have reached saturation in most areas.  The easy winds are already built out.  There may be one or two more, but I struggle to understand where they are.  This tells me we need to move much more quickly if we are to achieve our environmental goals.  We have to be more ambitious and look to offshore.  I am very interested in the floating offshore.  I am thankful to Mr. Dollard for having identified that that now needs to form part of the auction process.  I will be specific initially on the issues with regard to the ESB.  Will Mr. Dollard comment on what he is hearing within the powers that be and what the resistance might be to making floating offshore part of an auction process?  We need to understand that.</p><p> Mr. Dollard might also elaborate on where the resistance lies to the hybrid grid connection.  It seems to be a no-brainer.  Mr. Cunniffe might also comment on that.  I recognise that the ESB, from a generation point of view, is one specific entity.  Mr. Cunniffe and Mr. Moran represent other possibilities.  What is their view of the notion of a hybrid grid connection?</p><p> My next question is to Ms Dempsey and Mr. Daly on the very important work the council is doing.  It is not just talking in the abstract because it has identified a real live opportunity.  I am reminded about the hydrogen debate and a joke that was told by a colleague on that occasion, which was, "It looks good, but we're not sure what to do with it."  For some time now, hydrogen has been talked about as a real energy opportunity.  It is of less value when it comes to the practical usage of it.  Wind Energy Ireland has identified, from a strategic point of view, a demand that could be met.  There will be other opportunities for the usage of hydrogen but people are not quite there yet.</p><p> That brings us all the way back to understanding who within the political sphere should be taking charge of designing and devising that strategy.  I refer in that regard to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  At a recent meeting I had with Enterprise Ireland, I challenged the officials about the development of a strategy in the short term for offshore wind, hydrogen and the potential not just from the perspective of electricity generation but also the nascent technologies that can be developed around in order that jobs will be available when we move on from the construction phase.  I would welcome a comment from any of the witnesses on what Department should be the parent Department and who should be driving that.</p><p> Following on from what we have heard today, the committee should prepare a detailed report with a set of clear recommendations which will go to, in the first instance, the line Department and then Government.  We can discuss that further in private session.</p></speech>

The first question was to Mr. Dollard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#E00300"><p>As I understand it, the Senator's question was in regard to any potential resistance to the floating offshore wind auctions.  Before I get to that,  it is important to make the key point that Ireland has been incredibly successful in developing a renewables industry over the past 15 years.  The penetration of wind in this country is world leading.  That is because of the ambition taken ten to 15 years ago.  In terms of the auction process for floating, I would not say there is resistance.  The Government has set out a target of 5 GW.  That is an ambitious target from a standing start.  That is to be welcomed.  What we are highlighting now is that the technology is moving very quickly in terms of floating.  The cost of floating technology versus fixed will fall rapidly over the next decade.  It will be the end of this decade or early in the next decade before we reach parity but it will fall rapidly.  Along with others in the industry, we are highlighting that the progress needs to be reflected and updated in our ambition.  The Department has commenced a consultation process.  It is seeking inputs in terms of offshore wind in the next two auctions.  We will be strongly proposing that floating offshore wind should be now segregated in that proposal.  It is about an iteration.  The ambition is there.  It is now about how we iterate and continue to accelerate our ambition as we go forward.  We think it is very important that there is a separate auction for that 1 GW of floating.  That consultation process will be very important.</p> <p>  In terms of resistance to hybrids, again the State has shown significant ambition around hybrids.  Hybrid technology is in place in Ireland for many years.  The climate action plan calls for hybrids.  It is a matter of policy for the State to embrace hybrids.  What we are saying uniquely now is that the utilisation of hybrids for offshore wind is a much bigger issue.  The ability to access transmission infrastructure in the timeline we are looking for will be extremely difficult.  That is not a criticism.  It is just a fact it will be extremely difficult.  We have infrastructure in place.  We need to open up that infrastructure and to make it competitive in terms of the utilisation of it in the coming auctions.  We will be proposing in the upcoming consultation that hybrids would be accelerated in their utilisation and that the infrastructure and the regulatory structures that are required would be developed.  Dr. O'Grady might want to add to that in terms of what those regulatory structures might look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. &Aacute;ine O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#E00400"><p>I agree with Senator Dooley that it is a no-brainer and that it is supported in the climate action plan.  There are a few regulatory and market hurdles that need to be overcome there on which work is under way, but it needs to be accelerated to enable the 2030 targets.  The hurdles include the 120% cap on the insulation in the connection, allowing multiple legal entities behind a connection and the dynamic use of that connection so that two generations can come in and use that happily between the two of them to utilise that connection fully and get the full value out of the grid connection.</p></speech>

That we are at 6 GW and regularly achieving 4.6 GW of wind energy in this country is something Ireland can be proud of.  The policymakers and the regulatory infrastructure allowed that to happen and to happen very efficiently.  We are talking about a transformation in infrastructure over the next ten years.  This will be a huge ask.  What we are prompting is that the regulatory work needs to happen.  We need that clarity.  It needs to happen.  The investment in that time needs to happen.  We are encouraging an accelerated focus on the type of proposals mentioned by Dr. O'Grady to enable what could be a rapid growth in this industry.  It is about creating the conversation and accelerating it now to enable 2030.</p></speech>

Time permitting, we will do a second round.  Would any of the other witnesses like to comment on this particular set of questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#E00800"><p>There was a follow-on question on the general feedback on the hybrids.  There is an ongoing consultation dealing with hybrid grid connections for offshore wind energy, which is due to close next week.  Generally speaking, as outlined by Dr. O'Grady, there are a lot of regulatory and market barriers to hybrids, be it wind and solar, wind and battery or solar and battery, which need to be overcome.  There is another issue that I am likely to refer to a lot this morning, that is, the need for more resources in our regulator, grid operators and planning system to enable this.  For example, currently, a typical offshore wind farm that is progressing towards entering into an auction will have in the region of 40 to 50 full-time staff.  Across the entire range of critical Government bodies and State agencies, such as the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid and ESB Networks, the number of staff dedicated full time to offshore is in the region of 50 people.</p><p>We are dealing with jurisdictions with much more established markets.  Just yesterday I was speaking with a developer in the Netherlands with a staff of 200 people in their centrally co-ordinated grid and planning authority.</p></speech>

On the question of hybrid specifically, we absolutely need to overcome the regulatory barriers.  The key element that hybrid seeks to deliver is more grid capacity.  I mentioned that the EirGrid Shaping Our Electricity Future document looks to increase the amount of capacity we have in our electricity grid.  There are 48 projects called out in that and we do not yet have delivery dates.  We need resources to get those delivered from EirGrid and ESB Networks as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#F00400"><p>Senator Dooley mentioned the role of onshore wind energy.  It is important to be conscious that the existing onshore wind energy fleet provided approximately 53% of Ireland's electricity in February, and that is the highest share of demand we have ever provided in a single month.  To give insight into how that affects costs, on the windiest days in February, the cost of electricity in Ireland is approximately &euro;130 or &euro;135, whereas on the least windy days, the wholesale price of electricity was approximately &euro;229 or &euro;230.  We speak about costs for the electricity consumer, which is obviously suffering increased costs now, and delivering power at a cost that enables us to deliver green hydrogen competitively, and onshore wind has a really critical role to play in that.  The target is for 4,000 MW in the climate action plan, some of which is already under construction and some is already going through planning.</p> <p>  Senator Dooley's point is really important in highlighting the need to give confidence to communities who hear that onshore wind farms are coming into their areas and that they will be dealt with fairly, robustly and transparently in the planning system.  This goes back to Mr. Cunniffe's point about the need to ensure a properly funded and effective planning system.  If there is one message we really want to drive home today, it is that we are not going to deliver the onshore or offshore projects or the green hydrogen projects unless we have a planning system that enables us to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#F00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for the very worthwhile presentations.  I was an economist by trade originally, and the infant industry argument is probably as old as economics itself.  The question for Ministers and so on is how much State support is needed and for how long, as well as how to best structure that State support so the ultimate benefit for Ireland can be brought home.  There have been many useful suggestions but I want to sort them out in my head.</p> <p>  If we do as the witnesses say and go ahead with a 1 GW auction for floating wind projects, how much more will consumers and the State have to pay in the interim compared with other competing sources?  If we ring-fence an auction and guarantee offshore wind an outcome, I presume that sector would be paid much more by the consumer than the others.  I want to get a feel for the penalty that users will have to pay to get some of the offshore energy into the grid quickly compared with the alternatives.</p> <p>  The other matter that strikes me is that we have an ambition to hit 80% on the Irish grid.  If we go above the 5 GW target, it seems we are really pitching for the export market.  What additional infrastructure needs to be put in to create that?  How advanced is electrolysis for converting wind that we not be using here into hydrogen and creating an infrastructure to export it to Germany or elsewhere?  Do we need to start planning interconnectors?  What additional State infrastructure is required?  What I am trying to get back to is asking what sort of upfront capital is expected from the State.  I fully recognise we need to sort out our planning difficulties but what is the scale of the upfront exposure that the State must shoulder and we must defend to taxpayers in order to make this a reality?</p> <p>  I am very conscious the Attorney General is looking at our planning laws and considering how to make them fit for purpose in the face of these massive infrastructural investments for climate and other adaptation.  What advice would the witnesses give to an Attorney General seeking to draft a new approach to planning?  On one side, planning leads to speedier implementation of infrastructure while, on the other, people might ask what rights are being lost.  We must be careful on that front.  What is the view of the witnesses in that regard?  In the round this has been very useful but we probably need a little more on the economic side so we can defend this major bet by Ireland on our offshore capability.</p></speech>

Does anybody wish to come in?</p></speech>

In creating that competition, we would be doing two things.  We would deliver essential infrastructure and effectively be building a pathway to the future and investing in that future.  If we are going to capture the benefits of supply chain in floating offshore wind, that investment must be made now.  We can look at what is happening across the water in Scotland, where it has consented more than 10 GW - it is possibly 13 GW - of floating offshore wind.  That country will be competing with us for that supply chain.  Those projects can be delivered by 2030 and maybe early in the following decade.  There is a significant opportunity, if Ireland invests in it.  We have resources off the west and south coast to build a big supply chain that will give economic benefits to the State beyond the energy industry.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific point, we call for an auction.  If it is 1 GW, it will have competition because a number of projects will compete.  We see probably two projects coming out of a competition and that competition is needed to protect the consumer.  The auction should be shaped in that regard.</p> <p>  I spoke earlier about the price of floating offshore wind and, like that of all renewable technologies, it is falling rapidly and will converge towards the end of the decade or thereabouts in its comparison with the price of fixed installations.  By the time those projects are delivered for the 1 GW auction, we could be talking about a gap of approximately 30% in costs.  That will depend on how quickly technology might converge in the meantime.  It is between 30% and 50% but falling as we go through the decade.  We should remember that if we consent these projects in the next year or two, they will be built in 2027, 2028 and 2029.</p></speech>

What springs to mind is that Scotland has a very established oil and gas industry and it is perhaps somewhat ironic that it is the tradition it has in the sector that helps the country in the development of the offshore wind and hydrogen.  It seems to be a very significant challenge to try to compete with or get ahead of them because we simply do not have anything of that scale over here.  Is it realistic that we can develop those supply chains such that Ireland could compete with Scotland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dollard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#F00900"><p>It is a really interesting question.  If we delay, we certainly will not compete.  That is the reality.  Scotland has advantages over Ireland in that it has already started and it has the industrial heritage, if you like, that the Chairman mentioned.  We have a vast resource off the west and south coast and that is a major competitive position for us.  The dynamic of what is required to delivered floating offshore infrastructure will favour proximity, so the closer one is to the wind farms, the better.  Proximity will be an advantage.  There is definitely an opportunity in that respect.  I will ask my colleague to speak a bit more about that.</p></speech>

Moneypoint is one of the deepest port structures in Europe outside Rotterdam.</p><p>With the propagation of the foundation structures and the floating infrastructure out to the west coast, the key point is to have them located as close as possible to the wind farms.  This is where the west coast has the strategic advantage over Scotland.</p><p> I echo Mr. Dollard's point that no country has an absolute lead in floating offshore wind energy.  The key ask is to ensure that Ireland does not lag behind the early pace setters in floating offshore wind energy generation.  Scotland is ahead of us in delivering up to 15 GW by 2030 with seabed options.  With the 1 GW being ring-fenced, there is an absolutely an opportunity for Ireland to catch up, and to do so quickly.</p></speech>

On price, the committee will be aware that with the design of the renewable electricity support scheme, it acts like a two-way contract for difference.  Whenever the energy price is higher than the price of the auction, the projects actually pay back to the consumer.  This year, we are already seeing a dramatic reduction in the public service obligation, PSO, levy as a result of this.  The latter is expected to continue in future years, primarily due to the high price of gas right now which is in the region of &euro;150 per megawatt hour in a day-ahead market.  This compares with renewables, which are delivering in our first auction in the mid &euro;70s.  In the recent offshore auction in the UK, we saw we saw prices coming in at around &euro;50 per megawatt hour.  on the points made by Mr. Dollard and Mr. Lennon regarding the drop off of floating energy production, this will be seen and will again deliver good value to the consumer towards the end of this decade, and certainly into the early 2030s, as the PSO levy tends to pay back more and more to the consumer.</p> <p>  By 2030, 80% of Ireland's electricity will come from renewable energy sources.  Earlier, I referred to the fact that Ireland had the highest auction price in all of Europe in 2020.  This is something we fundamentally want to change.  We have asked several times for a Government task force to be set up to really focus on the cost of renewables and how we can really minimise that as much as possible to get that payback to the consumer.  This will be hugely important for the development of green hydrogen.  We need cheap renewables to make green hydrogen work.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton referred to our 5 GW target and what happens if we exceed it.  With 5 GW of offshore wind, we would meet around 30% to 40% of our overall electricity demand by 2030.  The key issue will be to try to find a home for it whenever all of that is blowing at once.  Grid capacity is hugely important, as is the development of interconnectors.  Projects such as the Celtic interconnector, the Greenlink interconnector and the North-South interconnector are under way at the moment.  It is very important that they deliver.  It is also very important that we kick off the green hydrogen economy, which is another home for that wind energy whenever it is available.</p> <p>  Reference is also made to how we reform the planning system.  I will hand over to my colleague Mr. Moran to cover that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#G00300"><p>The Deputy referred to the rights of people with regard to the planning system.  I want to be very clear  that people have the right to comment, to object, and to take judicial reviews of projects.  I do not believe that anybody should challenge that right, either from an Irish domestic legal perspective or from an EU law perspective.  That is certainly not what we are looking for.  It is more about resourcing the system in order that it works rapidly and effectively.  I will give a concrete example of this.  If I want to develop an offshore wind farm, one of the first things I must get is a foreshore licence to carry out environmental surveys.  This takes about 18 to 24 months just to get a survey licence to carry out surveys for environmental data and research so that I can use these to put together a planning permission application.  The equivalent process in Britain is about 18 to 24 weeks.  If I get the foreshore licence, we have already seen situations where those licences have been challenged in judicial reviews.  Because of this, there is still a question mark over the validity of the licences that have been issued.  From our perspective, as people who are trying to attract others into the Irish wind energy market, when we are trying to say to them that the planning system would be able to respond to the development of 5,000 MW, or perhaps more, of offshore wind energy by 2030, we have people coming back to us and asking if the foreshore licence situation is as challenging and difficult as that, will An Bord Plean&aacute;la have the resources necessary to deal with these planning applications?  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is talking about setting up a specialist unit to look at marine planning.  It would have an assistant director of planning and five inspectors.  We expect more than five phase 1 projects to launch for planning in a single year.  Are those five inspectors sufficient to deal with that level of demand?  Before those phase 1 projects are decided, the phase 2 projects will start to launch their planning applications.  Are those five inspectors sufficient to deal with all of that?  Unless we have that in place to give confidence, not just to developers but also to communities, to the fisheries and to the people who have an interest in wind farm development, then I believe that we will struggle in that regard.</p> <p>  On the supply chain issue, which was raised by Senator Dooley and Deputy Bruton, there was a very good report from the Government - I believe it was in November last year - on skills for a zero carbon economy.  One of the report's recommendations was to bring together a high-level implementation group to deliver those recommendations.  This cannot be moved forward quickly enough.  It is a good report with a lot of solid ideas about technical and engineering jobs, but also jobs for apprentices and people working in coastal communities.  That is a real strength we can build on.  There was a suggestion to as to which Department could take the lead on this.  Maybe it could be discussed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It would be interesting to see what the Department's response would be on it.</p> <p>  On supply chain, the focus of our conversation is, rightly, on what we do to develop a domestic supply chain in Ireland.  This is very important.  It must not be forgotten, however, that there is also an international supply chain.  If I want to build a wind farm in 2025, right now I cannot.  I would not be able to find the turbines, the installation vessels or the substation installation vessel.  They were all booked out.  Many of them are booked out to 2026.  We need to give confidence to the international supply chain that Irish offshore wind farms are coming.  We need to tell them when these are coming so they can go to the turbine manufacturers, the substations and the engineers to say "This is when I need to book you in", and go to the ports to say "This is when I need to book you in for construction services."  Giving this confidence to the international supply chain is very important.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy would like to come in again shortly, but I have a quick question.  Will Mr. Moran elaborate on that last point about the signals that might be required to the international system so they do have confidence in Ireland?  What are those signals?</p></speech>

Getting auction dates clarified and knowing there will be an auction at the end of this year is very important.  They will also want to see what kinds of positions will be put in place for the planning system to enable that to happen, and they will need to see the grid development moving forward.  It is about giving them a sense that momentum in Ireland is going from policy to delivery, so they can see implementation and changes.  It is also important to see what kinds of support and focus will be on ports, both the operations and maintenance ports.  Mr. Lennon spoke about this earlier.  Some of our members identified that if they are developing a wind farm, then this is the port they would be using.  This is a very positive indicator also.  If we are looking to see ports in the Republic of Ireland being used for construction of offshore wind farms we would need to see this moved forward very quickly.  Right now on the island of Ireland there is one really excellent harbour facility in Belfast that can build offshore wind farms.  Ireland is looking to develop 5,000 MW of offshore wind farms between now and 2030.  As good a port as Belfast is, it cannot simultaneously build 5,000 MW of offshore wind farms.  There are ports on the west coast of Britain but a lot of us would like to see the focus on investment in Ireland rather than in those ports.  It must be borne in mind also that British wind farms will be looking to use either their own ports on their own west coast, or possibly even for further capacity in the Belfast port.  It is very important for Ireland to see what we can do to move forward with our port infrastructure.</p></speech>

What is the optimal mix of private sector and State sector investment in the core infrastructures here?  There has been some discussion about some countries building out the platform and then would get a cheaper price because they are supplying into a State platform versus letting the market to do the whole lot.  Is there a particular view on this among the panellists?</p></speech>

Some are very state led with planning and grid, others are almost entirely developer led, which is what the UK system is.  A decision was made last year by the Government that there would be a developer-led approach for the first phase of projects and then an optional developer-led or State-led approach for the second phase projects.</p><p>Phase 3, which is post-2030, will be a full State and plan-led approach.</p><p> Just to refer back to Mr. Moran's earlier point on supply chain development, it is absolutely critical that we do not have stop-start development of projects because that will really undermine investment in the sector.  We need to see a continuous flow of projects from our phase 1 projects, which will go into auction this year, to the phase 2 projects.  The latter are currently out for consultation but we have yet to see what the phase 3 structure will look like.  We are only about four years away from that phase 3 development process kicking off in terms of planning and an auction system so this doubles back to resources.  We need to see resources in the Departments that will be defining what this State-led approach will be like.  There is a huge pipeline of projects trying to become phase 2 projects and many of these projects will necessarily become phase 3 projects once that State-led approach is determined in the 2030s, but we really need to see work begin on that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This discussion is incredibly timely.  The need to accelerate the development of renewables has been brought into sharp focus by the IPCC report and obviously more recently by the geopolitical situation and the cost of energy.  Co-operation between Germany and Ireland comes into sharp focus as well, with Germany's reliance on gas from Russia which has been reported on a lot recently.  Obviously, there are huge opportunities there and more generally in terms of Ireland's enormous potential, which we have talked about for a long time.  All of this should probably be happening faster and the whole process should have commenced a lot earlier but having said that, the rate of acceleration of things like the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill and the Maritime Area Planning Bill shows that a lot has been achieved in the last 12 months.  I do not think there is any doubt about the Government's commitment to the project but unfortunately it cannot be done with the click of a finger.  We certainly need to try to accelerate, where possible, in a sensitive way.  I do not think we should get too distracted by what Scotland is doing or how far ahead it is.  We have enormous potential here, particularly off the west and south west coast.  We need to get that right and not be distracted by what Scotland is doing.  Let the Scots do what they will, although I am sure we can learn from them, which is also important.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Dempsey, Mr. Daly and Dr. Carton and follows on from Deputy Bruton's question relating to the practicalities of exporting hydrogen to Germany.  Deputy Bruton asked if this would require an interconnector.  What are the mechanics of this and how will it work in terms of generating energy, turning it into hydrogen and exporting it to the German market?  How far advanced do we need to be in order to make that happen and how far off are we right now?  Deputy Bruton probably put the question better than me.</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Carton and relates to what we need to be doing.  It should be acknowledged that Deputy O'Rourke introduced a Green Hydrogen Strategy Bill which really brought this issue into focus.  We need to develop a hydrogen strategy and I am sure we will do so.  Dr. Carton mentioned a few things that we need to be doing in order to develop hydrogen.  I ask him to give us some international examples of strategies that are more advanced and to outline what we can learn from them.</p> <p>  Mr. Cunniffe mentioned that we need to develop a situation where Irish renewables are not as expensive as they are now.  I ask him to explain why they are so expensive and to outline what we need to do to reduce or minimise the cost of Irish renewables.  He also mentioned that we need to strengthen and increase the resources within the NPWS, for very good reason.  As much as everybody here would love to see an acceleration of the development of fixed offshore and floating offshore energy generation, it cannot be done without taking into account the impact on marine wildlife and habitats.  I have looked into this and understand that there has been some work done on some of the Scottish wind farms in terms of the impact on wildlife, including ecological surveys.  NGOs and the public in general probably need to hear that this work is being done, that we are not going into this completely blind and that we are studying those potential impacts.</p> <p>  Mr. Cunniffe referred to the 1 GW auction that is being proposed by Mr. Dollard.  Is that something that Wind Energy Ireland and its members are in favour of?  Is an additional 1 GW of floating offshore wind something the organisation would be pushing for?  Finally, on the hybrid grid connection, do current guidelines and legislation allow for that?  If not, how do they need to be changed to allow for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#H00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  Actually, I meant to jump in on Deputy Bruton's question about the maturity of electrolysis technology.  It is very immature.  There are some manufacturers of electrolysers around Europe, in Germany in particular.  Siemens and ThyssenKrupp are two that I can think of but I am sure Dr. Carton has many other examples.  In terms of maturity, the efficiencies are in excess of 70% so they are well bedded in, in terms of the technology.</p> <p>  Regarding getting hydrogen from here to Germany, the latter is opening up discussions with countries all over the world.  When the hydrogen strategy was released in 2020, countries around the world stumbled over each other to try to position themselves to supply hydrogen into Germany, including places as far afield as Chile and Australia.  We believe that if Chile and Australia can deliver it at the right price, surely we can better that.  They way they are doing it is by shipping it as ammonia.  It is a very simple way of shipping and is being done already.  Green hydrogen is converted to green ammonia but I am sure Dr. Carton has some other ideas as well.  There are cases where hydrogen has been liquified.  A shipment between Australia and Japan of liquified hydrogen was made quite recently.  The easiest way of handling hydrogen is in the form of ammonia.  It is not a challenge to shipping to companies and is something they are well used to.  They deliver LNG and oil around the world so this is just a different product.  Converting a tanker from LNG to ammonia is minimal in terms of refurbishment or retrofit.  </p> <p>  The other issue to bear in mind is the announcement at the weekend in Germany about energy security, alongside the announcement of &euro;100 billion for defence.  Germany is going to fast-track two LNG plants which will be hydrogen-friendly and hydrogen-ready.  If Germany is looking for deliveries of hydrogen into its system, we can deliver them straight to its LNG plants.  In essence, getting it from here to there is not much of a challenge.  It can be done.  I am sure Dr. Carton will be able to add more on that question.</p></speech>

Ultimately, this comes down to the economics of providing green hydrogen in a cost-effective way and I would ask Dr. Cunniffe to include that issue in his response.</p></speech>

Most European countries have developed a hydrogen strategy.</p><p>We thank Deputy O'Rourke for adding the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland to a motion.  In my opening statement, I went through some of what was needed.  As to which countries are doing this and whether we can copy and paste from them, the ones to look at are Germany and the Netherlands.  Other countries have regional industries that affect their hydrogen strategies.  Some countries are heavily industrialised and some may develop hydrogen power from solar power.  Fortunately or unfortunately, Ireland will have its own hydrogen strategy and it will be quite different from many other countries' strategies.  We will focus on building out large-scale renewables to supply it, which one presumes will make it a green hydrogen strategy.  We have the capability of developing that.</p><p> To answer Deputy Bruton, hydrogen should go into our internal market first and foremost.  We need to think of exporting as something that we can do and build up to and we can develop our strategy to enable that, but we need to decarbonise our economy and our industry first.  That is, unless there is a good economic reason to export hydrogen instead of keeping it.</p><p> Senator Dooley asked who would pull the strategy together.  That will probably fall on the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, engaging with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and academic and industrial stakeholders on the island.</p><p> This covers some of the points on the strategy.  I can cover some other questions.</p><p> Regarding the hydrogen export market, Deputy Bruton asked about the scale of the technology involved.  Hydrogen electrolysis has been deployed at multi-ten megawatt scale.  Now, projects are being built at 100 MW scale and there is the capability to scale electrolysers upwards to gigawatt levels.  The proposed offshore renewable site's 1 GW could be fully produced via hydrogen.  However, the first thing to remember about thermodynamics and energy efficiency is that we should bring our energy into Ireland via electricity where we can.  The key issue with hydrogen is to use it where we can or where it is necessary.  The first offshore sites would be facilitated via electricity and, as they are built out, we would develop them to produce energy carriers.</p><p> As Mr. Daly mentioned, if hydrogen is being moved tens of kilometres to 100 km, doing it by truck is fine.  If it is being moved 100 km or more, it should be done via pipes.  If it is being moved 3,000 km or more, energy carriers such as ammonia are suitable.  Liquid hydrogen depends on the process.  There are processes that are cheap and useful.  Japan is examining liquified hydrogen but ammonia is an interesting one for today.  Most of our agricultural fertiliser comes from Ukraine or Russia.  We do not have any security in that respect.  Ammonia is a key component in producing agricultural fertiliser.  If we are considering ammonia as a potential export, we will be engaging with the island's energy security as well.  The solutions need to be considered together.  It is not just a binary solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#J00200"><p>The Deputy's first question was on why renewables were more expensive in Ireland compared with other jurisdictions.  There are a number of reasons but they can generally be summarised by saying that we carry a substantial amount of risk into auctions compared with many other countries, which provide more certainty in their planning timelines, grid connection costs and availability of grid for exporting power.  In June 2020, we published a report, entitled "Saving Money", that proposed ten ideas for cutting the cost of developing renewables by 50%.  We would be happy to share that report with committee members after the meeting.</p> <p>  Last November, Spain had an onshore wind auction that cleared at approximately &euro;30 per megawatt hour compared with our auction of &euro;74 per megawatt hour.  I will give some of the reasons for this, many of which are also applicable to offshore wind.  We have seen an increase in commercial rates for renewable generation in Ireland in the region of 250% to 300% while fossil fuel generators have largely remained untouched.  Currently, the commercial rates for a 50 MW onshore wind farm are approximately two and a half times more expensive than a 50 MW fossil fuel generator.</p> <p>  In terms of timelines, our projects are in the planning system for a much longer duration than is seen in other countries.  We pulled together some figures yesterday to give the committee an indication.  Since 2020, it has taken An Bord Plean&aacute;la 51 weeks on average to determine a decision on an onshore wind farm.  Strategic infrastructure development, SID, projects have come in at 69 weeks on average since 2020 whereas the obligatory time under statute is 18 weeks.  No project has met that.  This does not just apply to onshore wind but also grid infrastructure, in which regard the average time was 44 weeks compared with an 18-week obligatory time.  Solar is seeing projects in the region of one year.  We are carrying the risk of planning throughout the planning development life cycle for much longer in Ireland than in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Some projects, in particular onshore wind, become political hot potatoes, in that there is sometimes an element of NIMBYism.  Politicians then find it difficult to get behind an energy source that will help to decarbonise our energy system.  Is that a significant barrier to expediting planning permissions for onshore projects?</p></speech>

We all need to get behind delivering EirGrid's strategy for grid infrastructure.  It is essential for our country that we see it delivered.  I am sure the issue the Deputy raised has some impact, but we are still missing our statutory timelines by a factor of two or three.</p> <p>  We estimate that the lack of availability of grid infrastructure in Ireland is adding approximately 27% to the price of our renewables compared with jurisdictions that have seen a significant investment in grid infrastructure over the past ten to 20 years.</p> <p>  The decision not to index link our renewable auctions has led to a 15% increase in our prices.  Industry effectively has to guess the inflation rate over the next 15 to 20 years of a project's life cycle instead of it being index linked, which is the norm in many other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  We were asked for our opinion on the 1 GW auction for floating offshore wind.  A consultation on phase 2 projects is under way and this is one of the main questions that is being debated among our members.  The consultation is closing next week.  Our position now is that floating wind energy can play a part in delivering our 5 GW target for 2030.  We see it being a major opportunity for Ireland as we move into the 2030s.</p> <p>  There were questions on marine planning and the environmental impacts.  I might hand over to Mr. Moran.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that the thinking is changing now?  If Deputy O'Sullivan or I were to ask about it a year ago, would the witnesses have given a different answer?  It was said that floating wind power was to be post 2030, but Mr. Cunniffe is now saying that it can contribute to the 5 GW target.</p></speech>

We definitely believe that the majority of the 5 GW target will be achieved via fixed-bottom offshore wind farms, but floating wind energy has a part to play.  It is equally, if not more, exposed to all of the challenges of getting the right legislation and planning system in place so that it can deliver for 2030.  Our points about the resourcing of systems are even more pertinent to floating offshore wind energy than they are to fixed-bottom wind energy.</p></speech>

When we were discussing this matter two years ago, there was nothing like the level of excitement or ambition that we are hearing now.</p><p>Is there a message that needs to be made clear to the Government and State agencies about how the technology and the economics are converging and advancing, so we need to get on this more quickly than we would otherwise have thought?</p></speech>

In the past two years, many other jurisdictions have taken up that flag.  There are auctions happening in France for floating wind farms, there is a 1 GW pot for floating in the UK out of its 40 GW target for 2030, and other jurisdictions such as Spain and Portugal are taking a similar approach.  The cost conversion will reduce naturally as the market picks up and the supply chain progresses and matures, and that is definitely a factor that needs to be taken into account.</p></speech>

The research, which we are carrying out with Trinity College Dublin and the ESB, is called the Nature+ programme.  The idea is to identify ways to develop onshore wind farms in a way that not only minimises the impact on biodiversity but where it can enhance biodiversity in the location where the wind farm is developed.  As part of that broad work, we have developed a pollinator plan for onshore wind farms, which we are keen to push forward with our members.</p> <p>  Specifically in regard to offshore, any project looking to develop an offshore wind farm will need to put together an environmental impact assessment report, which will require years of surveys to have been carried out in advance.  We often think it would have been great to have been developing offshore wind farms in Ireland in the 2000s or the early 2010s, but one of the advantages of developing them in the 2020s is that we have 20 to 30 years of experience internationally of carrying out environmental surveys and environmental work on offshore wind farms in markets throughout the world, and we can bring that expertise to Ireland.  The surveys would include, for example, fish and marine life surveys, marine mammal surveys and years of bird surveys to try to identify the bird movements that will be taking place.  The projects will also engage seriously with key stakeholders in that area, including organisations such as the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, BirdWatch Ireland and the fishing community whose members are out there daily informing themselves about the marine life and taking all that information together in order that, when we get to a point where we can put together a planning application that can be shown to be robust, we will have as much environmental information as possible.  We will have identified where there would be an impact, where we can or cannot avoid that and where we will mitigate it, and we will deliver these projects in the most sustainable way possible, conscious of the need to protect our marine biodiversity.</p></speech>

We have hybrids in place.  The ESB has small hybrids, not at the scale of offshore wind but they are in place.  We need the acceleration of existing policies and regulations to implement that in practice.  Dr. O&rsquo;Grady might outline them.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, these relate to the cap in respect of the installation of the connection, the multiple legal entities behind a connection and the ability to use that connection dynamically and get the best use out of it.  These are issues that need to be addressed in the next 12 months.  We need to accelerate progress in this area to enable them in order that we can use hybrid connections to facilitate the delivery of the 2030 targets.</p></speech>

As for onshore wind, there are hundreds of sites from varying technologies, but in the case of offshore wind, there are at least ten or 15 large-scale sites, with gigawatts of capacity.</p></speech>

A total of 80% of our enormous offshore wind resource lies outside the footprint of fixed foundations, at a depth profile of about 60 m.  If we are to truly harness our offshore capabilities in Ireland, it has to be through the turbine technology of floating.  To be clear, it is not just about floating to grid; there is also floating to hydrogen.  They are separate concepts.  Currently, our licensing regime does not give clear guidance to those projects that are establishing themselves to address floating to hydrogen, to the effect that we are unsure about it.</p> <p>  The reason I say this is I own one of them with business partners of mine.  We are developing projects we believe are more environmentally acceptable and responsible and, unfortunately, our current framework does not give us clear guidance on whether ours will become a phase 2 project.  We do not know whether it comes under the category of innovation.  Perhaps we are innovative.  An example of that is that on our wind farms, we have planned for biodiversity restoration and decommissioning to include an increase of biodiversity beyond what it would have been before we had ever developed in those areas.  Many of the projects that belong to some of the participants at this meeting will reflect the fact offshore wind is taking into hand the national planning framework and ensuring we are addressing integration with fisheries and aquaculture insofar as is possible.</p> <p>  I am an aquaculture operator and I own a farm on the east coast, which actively works with offshore renewable energy because it is a robust farm with offshore technology at its core.  We are looking to integrate as much as we can. When we talk about the opportunity in respect of offshore floating, I do not think it is a conversation for the future but rather for now, particularly if we would like the public to come onside with renewable energy in the offshore space.  That should be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

I do not envisage there will be the same number of objections to floating offshore, although there could be.</p></speech>

The questions I had intended to ask have broadly been covered but there are some more I wish to ask.  On the figures that have been given both at this meeting and in other forums regarding the cost of options and the comparative analysis Mr. Cunniffe mentioned, the examples of the cost being more than double that in Spain were quite troubling to hear.  What are the drivers of those disparities, in terms of the delivery both of a reasonable option and of grid infrastructure?</p> <p>  It is clear from what our guests have said that investment requirements for the sector are very significant.  One of the greater constraints they identified relates to the supply chain.  Is there a manner in which the Irish market can develop its own supply chain?  Would there be demand for it?  Is the technology cheap enough to replicate such that it could be done at a competitive rate?  Can we deliver indigenous development of the necessary components for the sector and then export it?</p> <p>  I am pleased to hear that floating is now being considered as part of the near-term targets, although whether it can be achieved, I do not know.  Clearly, we have significant gaps in the make-up of our infrastructure in terms of the policies in and around this sector, particularly in respect of offshore.  The maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, is in development, but there are other constraints.  For instance, I understand that in other jurisdictions, there are point-to-point connections between renewable energy sources and energy users, such as large-scale industry.  Would that be possible or must it go into the grid?  I understand this relates to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Is that something we should review, not least in the context of discussions we have had about large-scale energy consumers such as data centres and large-scale industry, factories and so on?</p><p>Is there an opportunity for us to consider permitting the development of renewable energy sources to supply those facilities so that the grid is not affected and, therefore, does residents are not imperilled with blackouts and brownouts?</p><p> Points have been made about the absence of a hydrogen strategy.  There is one coming but it cannot come soon enough.  What is floating to hydrogen?  I am not familiar with the concept.  Ms Dempsey might expand on that remark.</p><p> Those questions cover the ground I wish to cover for now.  A few of our guests could come back in on those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#L00200"><p>I have probably covered off the majority of the points on the cost of our auctions compared with other jurisdictions.  I will say that renewables are significantly cheaper than our fossil fuel alternatives now and we should not lost sight of that.  I am trying to highlight the fact that they can be even cheaper again.  Electricity prices are dominated by international events right now.  If 80% of our electricity is generated domestically from renewable sources, we have much greater control over our future electricity price.  That should be the price on which we are focused.  I will share with the committee the saving money report to which I referred earlier, which includes ten points outlining how we can half the cost of developing renewables.</p> <p>  I will cover the question about point-to-point connections.  The Deputy was referring to a concept called "private wires", which is in the climate action plan as a piece of legislation and regulation to be enabled in the first half of this year, as I understand it.  There is work ongoing in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, EirGrid and the ESB Networks to try to enable that policy.  It is absolutely something we can take advantage of for both onshore and offshore renewables.  It will, in particular, be key to unlocking a lot of our green hydrogen potential in the future when there is no space available on our electricity grid, at least in the short term, for those projects to be realised.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about investment.  I might hand over to Mr. Moran to cover the issue in more detail.  I will say there has already been significant investment in many Irish businesses and in ports around the country to try to support the offshore sector in its efforts to get off the ground.  In recent months, we have seen announcements in Arklow, Wicklow and Rossaveal Port.  There has been strong investment in port facilities to try to capture some of the value chain that offshore wind energy offers.  Two years ago, we published a report called Harnessing Our Potential, which looked at the entire value chain for offshore wind in Ireland.  It showed that right now we can capture approximately 15% to 20% of the value chain but that can be almost doubled if we invest in the right skill sets and port facilities during this decade.  Perhaps Mr. Moran has something to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#L00300"><p>I do not have a huge amount to add to that.  There are three key questions that are flagged in Harnessing Our Potential.  The first asks what are we good at in Ireland and what we can do now.  The second asks what things we could do if we had adequate investment and resources to develop our skills.  I touched earlier on the report that was published by the Government last year on future skills.  To be frank, we must also ask what are the things we are unlikely to do in this Ireland.  For example, it is unlikely we will manufacture turbine blades in Ireland.  There is eagerness on the part of those involved in our ports infrastructure to be involved in this area.  There is a possibility that we can increase the amount of investment that comes into this country and is retained by small and medium enterprises.  We can assist in getting those enterprises up and running.  They could be based in clusters around those ports, which will mean jobs for coastal communities.  We want those companies to get to a point in the future to be able to compete internationally.  If a company is coming here to develop an offshore wind farm, I would love to see Irish people learning and training, getting the skills and then taking those skills and building businesses that can compete in other markets.  We are absolutely capable of doing that.</p> <p>  We cannot do everything.  We must be realistic and admit there are parts of the supply chain for which we do not have the manufacturing base or skill set.  However, there are places we can go into.  As well as the pieces of work that Mr. Cunniffe has outlined, Enterprise Ireland is taking a good initiative at the moment.  It is putting together an offshore wind energy network, including the kind of supply chain companies that could compete internationally and domestically.  I think there are plans for an event some time over the summer which will try to bring together the developers and contractors, on the one hand, and the Irish companies that could be a part of our just transition and the development of offshore wind energy in Ireland, on the other hand.</p></speech>

We have already established we have a base in Arklow, which is encouraging offshore renewables.  We have already started a company, Ondine, and employed 40 people across various skill sectors, all relating to survey works for offshore renewable energy.  We have brought in the various assets to support that.  As a company in the survey world, which forms a substantial part of that supply chain, the capabilities Ireland can use to play its part in it and to drive value for Ireland, one of the key challenges we face is that for phase 1 and phase 2 projects, access to their maximum has suspended survey activity.  As a result, when one wants to build a comprehensive supply chain, all of these things that may have been put on the long finger or delayed for any reason really impact on the ground the types of companies that are trying to establish themselves.  I encourage the Government to be cognisant of the wider remit of people who are trying to access this industry in order to build businesses now.</p></speech>

There will be supply chain opportunities in terms of ports, as the representatives Wind Energy Ireland set out.  There will be opportunities for electricians and that type of infrastructure on the ground.  We see a clear opportunity for floating offshore wind supply chain and building the foundation structures locally to the wind farms.  ESB is, for example, currently working on a planning application for a renewables hub on the Moneypoint site, as Mr. Dollard mentioned.  Part of that hub will be a fabrication facility for the floating structures.  Whether they are steel or concrete, we have proposed they will be built on the Moneypoint site and floated out to service not just ESB wind farms but third party wind farms as well.</p> <p>  We anticipate that will add an enormous gross value to the local economy in the mid-west region.  It will also have benefits nationally.  Our Green Atlantic at Moneypoint project has the ability to supply approximately a direct gross added value of &euro;1.1 billion in the mid-west region, with the bulk of that on the back of the fabrication of the foundation structures.  We have just kicked off the planning application process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We hope to make that planning application in the next 18 months or so.  That is the clear, tangible benefit of floating offshore wind.  We must get those signals that will allow for continued development of the supply chain to enable projects to be delivered by 2030 as part of the key that unlocks the west coast.</p></speech>

It is not just ESB that are involved.  We are working closely with Shannon Foynes Port Company.  There are other locations up and down that coast, and leading around to the south coast, where there is potential.  While we have one particular project, it is fair to say that many others will also be trying to develop that supply chain.</p></speech>

The ESB might have a strategic advantage.  Is there a question around who has access to those connections?</p></speech>

Some of our biggest competitors in the country have built infrastructure all around the coast because that was how to strategically access fuels, historically.  We are not alone.  On the whole island, I reckon there are ten or 12 hybrid sites which could provide 4 GW or 5 GW, which would create significant competition.  There is competition for access to the sites themselves.  There is also the issue of those sites being able to accelerate the development of the whole industry.  Because that infrastructure is in place, there is a real issue as to how quickly we can roll out an industry if we are not using hybrids.</p><p>The development of this type of infrastructure around the coast is extremely difficult.  Hybrids will deepen the competition in the auctions that will come in phases 2 and 3 and in phase 1 if they are involved.</p></speech>

This is where a wind farm is connected directly to an electrolyser on a floating platform at sea.  There is an example of this being developed at present in the Netherlands.  I believe another project is being developed in Scotland and there are others in Japan and South Korea.  There are all at relatively large scale.  The Moneypoint site might not be a good area to develop it because it can connect to very big cables coming into Ireland.  Hydrogen could be developed on-site in other places off the coast of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and south Kerry that do not have cable infrastructure and may never have it.  The hydrogen could then be moved around.  Whether for export or internal is up to the economics.</p></speech>

It is a logical flow as to what was meant when he said floating to hydrogen.  It is good to get an explanation.  If there is supporting documentation or views he would like to share with the committee in writing it would be very helpful for our ongoing discussions.  If he has anything, sending it to the secretariat would be very much appreciated.</p> <p>  I have a follow-up question on the grid infrastructure of the ESB, which is before the committee.  Keeping grid development up to speed and up to scratch with the types of innovation that will occur in the coming decade in particular will be challenging to say the least.  Various strategies have been released by the ESB.  In terms of the costly infrastructure that has to be built into renewable energy sites, whether they be onshore or offshore and whether they be solar or wind, is something of slight concern to me.  I ask the witnesses to spend a minute or two alleviating some of the concerns relating to the ability of the ESB to meet the demands on the grid site.</p></speech>

To give an indication, in EirGrid's grid development strategy, Shaping our Electricity Future, we are speaking about an investment in grid infrastructure purely for the transmission system in the region of &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion to try to bring forward our ambition for 2030.  There will also need to be investment in the distribution system from ESB Networks.  This compares to an investment of tens of billions of euro from private investors to develop the needed onshore and offshore wind resources, solar wind farms, battery energy storage and hydrogen projects.  In the grand scheme of things, investment in the grid infrastructure, and it is an investment, is an investment in our future, which is clean power.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting discussion.  I will pick up on some of the issues that have been raised.  One is the issue with resourcing of planning.  I welcome how it was framed.  It is very useful to think about what it would look like if we make sure there are sufficient resources for planning.  In his opening statement, Mr. Moran mentioned not only greater resourcing for An Bord Plean&aacute;la but greater resourcing for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Environmental impact assessments are crucial and we are obliged to do them under EU law.  It strikes me there could be far more resources for this than the five inspectorates that are there.  More public resources in respect of environmental impact assessments could be useful.  Mr. Moran mentioned detailed surveys.  Something that came up when we looked at marine biodiversity was that surveys in themselves have an environmental impact.  Rather than having multiple companies doing multiple surveys it could be useful if we had more use of shared or public surveys.  They could be sources of important data for planning applications by different actors.  Do the witnesses have thoughts on this?</p> <p>  We are in limbo with the marine protected areas not yet designated even as we need to move ahead with marine planning.  Will the witnesses comment on sensitivity mapping?  It could be a very important tool in the marine area so we have all of the information going into the planning process.  Judicial reviews are only taken when something was missing from the original process or when it was not done properly.  This is an opportunity to have this addressed.</p> <p>  In terms of green hydrogen, Dr. Carton mentioned Ireland is behind in having a hydrogen strategy.  Do we have an opportunity to be ahead by having a very clearly green hydrogen strategy?  Something we have often seen is that green hydrogen tends to be added in as the poor relation within hydrogen.  The German Government now has a specific commissioner for green hydrogen.  Is there potential for us to push for our strategy to lead on this?  Dr. Carton mentioned the idea of a certification system on green hydrogen specifically.  Will he elaborate on this idea?  It is quite interesting.  It will be crucial that green hydrogen gets named and invested in this regard.</p> <p>  I have seen the original consultation strategy.  I was a little bit surprised by the idea of the State-led component of the energy strategy coming in after 2030 and the idea of it being developer-led for now.  This seems to be a huge gamble.  Dr. Carton mentioned the importance of ensuring our national energy security and local energy supply.  He mentioned hydrogen valleys and ensuring hydrogen use and distribution are as close as possible to each other and that we prioritise this.  It strikes me that in the context of energy insecurity we may need to put a lot more of a bet on State support for renewable energy and hydrogen.</p> <p>  The problem with solely having it developer-led and if the State does not partner in energy is that developers and industry will partner.  We may have scenarios where a high industrial customer sets the market in terms of where renewable energy and wind energy comes in.  Towns and communities might be on the periphery of a relationship between an energy provider and a major industrial customer.  I am concerned that the State, our energy security needs and our sustainable energy needs should drive the process more.  Do the witnesses have comments on this and on the hydrogen valleys idea and how we ensure local communities are properly empowered in the dynamic?</p></speech>

I agree with a lot of what the Senator has said on the importance of resourcing the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p><p>It is also important we resource the other environmental stakeholders.  For example, if we have a large number of projects applying for foreshore licences - and just to be clear a licence is needed to carry out surveys because the Senator is absolutely right that the surveys themselves have an impact - and trying to engage with an organisation such as BirdWatch Ireland, the issue is trying to deal with all those applications and comment on them, inform them and contribute to them.  Senator Higgins and I share a background in that we both worked in the NGO sector and, therefore, are both quite familiar with how under-resourced it is.  Ensuring environmental NGOs can be resourced to play the full and detailed part in the planning system they should be able to is an important issue as well.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Mr. Goodwin, to talk a little about the importance of the phase 1 projects and the State-led approach the Senator touched on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Goodwin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#N00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and I thank the Senator for the questions.  I will briefly expand on what Mr. Moran said.  By the time we get to that enduring model post-2030, there will be that State-led element, both on the grid side and on the planning side.  That is important for the reasons the Senator outlined.  It will allow for those efficiencies to be found.  In the period up to now the choice we have is that it is a matter of speed and a matter of doing this quickly.  Ultimately, we want to try to get to the 5,000 MW target as quickly as we can.  If we want to give ourselves the best chance of getting there by 2030, the developer-led approach is probably the way that enables us to get there.</p> <p>  I might mention some of the work happening on the phase 1 projects.  We have spoken a lot this morning about the target, and rightly so.  Getting to that 30 GW, or beyond, that is called for in the programme for Government requires due attention, as does the potential of floating wind to deliver this decade and then even more so into the next.  It is probably important to note this will not happen if we do not successfully get, or keep, the phase 1 projects on track and ensure we deliver.  That is happening at the moment in the work EirGrid is doing by trying to devise the ways these six projects, and the one that come through the auction successfully, will connect to the grid and deliver power.  The first ORESS auction must be designed appropriately so they can bid in at a price that is competitive and is good value for the consumer and deliver electricity at a level that is good value for the consumer.  We also need timely delivery of the maritime area consents later this year to ensure projects are able to undertake that survey work and then take that first step into the planning system.  It is really crucial, if we are going to see our longer-term ambition delivered and are going to see the phase 2 projects and floating wind projects by the end of the decade, that the first step be taken to get the phase 1 projects on track and ensure the needed steps are put in place to get there.</p> <p>  Ultimately, and I am aware we are saying this a lot this morning, it comes back to resourcing.  We need increases in resourcing in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure planning applications can be dealt with.  As the Senator pointed out, it is really important NPWS has adequate resources to deal with this new industry.  It is a new industry for the country and we need to have the relevant expertise there.  At the moment there are some great people working in EirGrid to try to get some of the grid connection policy progressed but they are stretched for resources.  As Mr. Cunniffe and Mr. Moran mentioned at the start, in the Department we have only a limited number of officials working full time on offshore energy.  Resourcing is the key that is going to get us to that 5 GW target by 2030.  I will leave it there.  I emphasise the importance of those phase 1 projects as a first step to give that market certainty so everything else can follow afterwards.</p></speech>

There were questions on the green hydrogen strategy and certification as well.  I call Dr. Carton.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Carton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#N00400"><p>For the hydrogen strategy we need to think generally around our carbon budgets.  Ireland, at some point in the future, will have to start sucking carbon out of the atmosphere because we are most likely going to go over our carbon budgets.  That is one thing to mention.  If we are going down a hydrogen route, we can really easily, given all the comments in this room, go with a green hydrogen strategy.  Frequently, as we go into 2030 and beyond, we will produce way more energy than batteries can store and that we can move in our cables, so we can produce lots of hydrogen.  It can be green.  That is a thing to think about.  Whoever is pulling together the hydrogen strategy needs to think about that</p> <p>.  The certification process is really important.  The fact I can prove I have an electrolyser in the middle of an ocean beside a wind farm means it is obvious it is green hydrogen.  It is not so obvious though once the hydrogen goes into a pipe, ship, vehicle or industry.  The certification process of hydrogen full stop, namely, whatever colour it is, needs to exist.  This is developed through the EU and through a number of projects through Europe and it exists so effectively we will apply similar processes.  What this does, more than us being able to sell it as a green product that is guaranteed Irish and green to export, maybe, is it engages with public and with people.  This is not a greenwashing exercise.  There is certification here.  We are producing it.  Our strategy says it is going to be green and that needs to be embedded in whatever strategy is produced.</p> <p>  The other point was hydrogen valleys.  If we are producing hydrogen over the next number of years, from an early deployment point of view we are probably going to be on the scale of tens to maybe hundreds of megawatts.  We see Ireland could produce probably 500 MW of hydrogen by 2030 if we really wanted to.  That would be used to decarbonise heavy industry and some heavy transport, for example.  We think that is possible and achievable by 2030 if the push is there from the renewable deployment to match that.  The key with those early deployment projects is production, use and decarbonisation probably fairly close to each other so the need for complex energy carriers like ammonia, certainly in the early years, is eliminated and the cost of moving hydrogen around or even storing it for long durations is also eliminated.  Again, it gives us experience.  It gives our workforce experience, knowledge and skills.  It gives the education people routes to upskill people through SOLAS, universities or technical courses.  It gives us time to learn and be prepared to scale up past 2030 for hydrogen.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

That is going to require very large-scale renewables deployment.  Renewables are intermittent.  Most or all forms of renewable energy are intermittent so large-scale storage is going to be required.  If we are to deliver the ambition large-scale storage is going to be required.  We believe green hydrogen is the form for that.  To the point that was raised, we fully support a green hydrogen strategy.  We would not support anything other than a green hydrogen strategy.  There is huge benefit to Ireland in terms of security of supply.  What that means for what we need to do is we need more offshore wind capacity beyond our daily use.  We are going to be creating and generating renewables on the island that are effectively designed to provide storage capability.</p><p>Green hydrogen is probably the leading proposition in the market.  We believe it is the way forward.  Moneypoint has been a cornerstone of the energy system for the last 40 years.  It uses coal, which must and will exit the system by 2025.  We believe that site will provide effectively the same capacity in storage using hydrogen, which is a green fuel.  The transition is important.  The capacity and renewables required will be well beyond the daily peak on this island to create that storage capability.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses' comments.  I think there is a risk with green hydrogen that we couple it with gas.  The witnesses made a good point, that coal is a huge challenge here.  I can see the temptation to inject green hydrogen into our national gas network.  Maybe the witnesses are thinking about doing that with a conventional gas power plant.  The risk of that is that one might lock in gas and have a slower decarbonisation pathway than we could otherwise achieve.</p></speech>

Gas will be really important for this country in the next 20 years or so, but ultimately it needs to be replaced if we are to get to net zero.  Net zero means zero.  We cannot have such a scarce and valuable resource being burned and creating emissions.  We believe that green hydrogen is the way forward.  As my colleague said, electrolysers are a significant part of this and we use fuel cells.  There is the possibility of using hydrogen hubs to burn green hydrogen in combined cycle gas turbines on-site, which we will explore in the coming years in Britain and hopefully on this island too.</p></speech>

Hydrogen needs to be created and used for a reason.  We understand it quite well at a small scale.  Once it is scaled up, a lot of storage is needed.  It will probably be geological storage.  Ultimately, it has to be moved around.  It will not be moved around by trucks but in pipes, whether the gas grid is segmented into hydrogen sections or new pipes are installed to move hydrogen from offshore to an onshore industry facility or such.  It will depend on how we scale our renewables and how we then see hydrogen scaling.  We will see what infrastructure will be necessary, hopefully at the lowest cost and lowest possible carbon intensity when it is being moved around.  When we talk about energy, we talk about electricity, all transport and all heating together.  This is about much more than the ambition of decarbonising electricity.  It is also about decarbonising our energy system.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief with my questions.  I have a question for the ESB and IWEA.  The constraint that seems to permeate every level in this system is capacity.  The witnesses mentioned some figures.  Has there been an assessment at a State or departmental level of workforce planning?  What additional resources would be needed?  Do the witnesses know what type of forum might be needed to drive the transformational change required?  Is it a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, agencies or the Department of the Taoiseach?  What do those forums look like?  Who is at the table?</p> <p>  The supply chain has been mentioned.  Mr. Moran mentioned the report stating we should do what we can do well.  Where are the immediate opportunities in Ireland for jobs in renewables and offshore wind?</p> <p>  I have another question for IWEA.  Senator Dooley mentioned onshore wind being controversial and offshore wind being less controversial, and that we had potentially reached the maximum amount of onshore wind generation.  That is not my understanding of the climate action plan.  Will the witnesses give us a sense of the future of onshore wind?  Will they speak about what is done well with planning and the lessons from that, as well as the stated timeline for wind energy guidelines?</p> <p>  My next questions are for the ESB and IWEA.  Are they saying we will potentially miss our targets if we do not get this right?  If we get it right, based on everything the witnesses outlined, what is the upper level of ambition?  Are the Government's targets about right?  Is there potential to go beyond them?</p> <p>  I have a question about hydrogen for Dr. Carton, Ms Dempsey and Mr. Daly.  We have talked about a green hydrogen strategy.  Will they outline the benefit of a strategy?  In fairness, the Government is doing a lot in this area.  What is the benefit of a strategy on paper?  What might it contain?  What potential is there for the decarbonisation of the heavy goods sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#O00900"><p>The Deputy's first question was about whether there has been an assessment of State resources.  There has not been such an assessment, to our knowledge, but we would strongly recommend that one be carried out.  I have a comment on the previous question, which is relevant, about the resources of Eirgrid and ESB Networks.  Ireland currently has less than 5 GW of renewable capacity in its electricity grid.  Over the next eight years, we will try to build and connect 12 GW of renewable capacity.  All the while, we are also trying to enable the electrification of transport, through 500,000 electric vehicles, and to have 600,000 heat pumps in homes.  This drain on resources will be significant compared with what is currently in place if we are to deliver that.  We need more people in ESB Networks and Eirgrid to deliver that.  Their budgets are covered through the price review process with energy regulators.  They have been given a budget, which runs to 2025, to deliver on this.  The staffing levels of the regulator have not yet been decided.  Correct staffing levels are needed if the regulator is to duly assess the changes and policies we need to deliver our targets.  As I mentioned, that is also an issue for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  There are great examples of offshore wind from the British and Polish systems.  They have introduced a sector deal, where industries sit at the table with the right departments and enterprise agencies to try to deliver this.  There are regular stakeholder meetings where everybody is briefed on the plan.  We have called for that for some time now.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we would also like to see the same type of committee formed specifically for the offshore grid.  The critical path now is to understand the technical challenges of connecting these projects to the system.  Getting that up and running as soon as possible would be welcome.</p> <p>  Regarding the future of onshore wind energy, we need to keep delivering it.  There is no question about that.  Right now, with the best will in the world, we will not have offshore wind connected to our grid and exporting until 2027 or 2028.  Between now and then, we need onshore renewable energy to continue to develop and progress, including onshore wind and solar energy.  We have a pipeline of onshore wind in development with approximately 10 GW of capacity.</p><p>We need that pipeline coming along because there will be attrition at the planning system, which we have talked about this morning, and there needs to be attrition at the renewable auction level as well.  Some projects will be successful but some will not be.  There is a very strong future for onshore wind, and that will be very important, in particular in hitting our carbon budget targets over the next six years or so.</p><p> One of Deputy O'Rourke's questions was whether we will miss our target if we do not get this right.  We will, definitely.  Right now we probably have, at best, a 50-50 chance of hitting our target of 5,000 MW of offshore wind by 2030.  For all the reasons we have discussed, we need more resourcing in the right areas to be able to deliver on that.</p><p> Finally, in response to the question of what is the upper limit, our vision is that, as a country, we should have a goal of having a zero-carbon electricity sector by 2035.  Just yesterday Germany announced that goal.  We have seen the UK and other countries announce it too.  Last year we produced a report called Endgame, which was shared with the members of the committee, showing that this is technically and economically feasible in the early 2030s.</p></speech>

The immediate and almost guaranteed piece of work we will get is that when these offshore wind farms are built, they will have an operations maintenance base in a nearby port.  We have seen Codling Wind Park identify that as Wicklow.  We have seen Arklow Bank identify it as Arklow.  The example in Britain would involve approximately 60, 80 or 100 jobs, depending on the size of the wind farm there.  Those would be long-term, stable jobs.  Right now I think a lot of the jobs would be in the area of survey work.  Ms Dempsey touched on an example of that a little earlier.  There are companies such as Ms Dempsey's and Green Rebel Marine, in Cork, which is carrying out aerial and marine surveys and would like to do more.  We have companies working with a special focus on community engagement and engagement with the fishing community, where there are many people whose day-to-day job is literally to go down to piers and harbours and talk to people in the fishing sector.</p> <p>  I will make one last point.  Mr. Cunniffe is absolutely right.  I do not think that workplace assessment or that kind of workforce assessment of resources has been carried out.  There was an air wind report a couple of years ago by MaREI.  That was kind of a blueprint for offshore wind.  It did not just look at staffing resources but at a lot of other things as well.  Unfortunately, I am struggling to drag the exact number to my mind, but I think it went to the point of identifying specific State agencies and giving at least some indicative figures.  To be clear, that was not the State piece of work Deputy O'Rourke and Mr. Cunniffe were talking about, but it could be a useful starting point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#P00400"><p>We would like to see the wind energy guidelines come out as quickly as possible.  I think there is a recognition within the industry and communities that we need guidelines that are fit for purpose and enable us to develop the onshore wind energy projects we need to deliver over the coming years.  As for identifying sources of best practice, I could start singling out particular wind farms and companies.  One I will point to is the Mountlucas wind farm, a Bord na M&oacute;na project in Offaly.  I cannot speak for Bord na M&oacute;na, but if the committee wanted to visit an onshore wind farm that shows not just a really good project but really good examples of biodiversity and how it has been supported in the community, that would be a good project to consider.  The ESB has some fantastic projects under way.  I think Grousemount, in Kerry, was due to become operational last year or is being connected.  Galway Wind Park, which is an SSE project, is award-winning for its level of community engagement.  With many of these projects, we see that they are not just building wind farms; they are building local amenities around them, including walking and hiking trails and interpretive centres.  Those are really good examples.</p> <p>  The last point I will make is that it is rare to the point of unfathomable that an onshore wind farm would go through a project process now and not change in response to community engagement.  The turbines might move.  The size of the turbines might change.  The substations might be moved.  Every effort is made to try to accommodate people and to meet them halfway in order that a balance is achieved, and that balance is critical.  We need to develop onshore wind energy but we also need to ensure that the rights and the interests of the local community are protected.  One of the advantages of the new renewable electricity support scheme is that it puts in place a very large community benefit fund, which I think will be under the control of the community, and it will decide what the fund is spent on.  That is really important.  We need to get the community engagement right before we start talking about the benefit.  Once we get the engagement right, I think people will see real, appreciable benefits in their community.  That is important.</p></speech>

We support onshore wind.  We think there will be a requirement for onshore wind growth over the coming years of the order of 3 GW.  As the committee will know, we are working with Coillte on the joint venture, FutureEnergy Ireland, which will develop about 1 GW of wind.  We believe that will be required and is very important.  Can we miss our targets?  If we do not get the issues we called out right, I think we can.  It is a very large target, so unless we make a huge concerted effort and tackle the issues, it could be missed.  Is the target correct?  Yes, it is, but there will be a target beyond that and we need to think about the current target in that context.  There will be attrition between now and then but we must have the confidence in ourselves about 2040 and 2050.  There will be other targets.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Lennon wish to say something about the supply chain?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the real game-changer for a supply chain and Ireland being able to tap into a resource base is floating offshore wind and the foundation structures.  The question about the upper limit of the ambition is a very good one.  By way of comparison, in January of this year Scotland awarded about 26 GW of fixed and floating offshore wind in seabed option agreements.  That puts into perspective how we see Scotland.  I absolutely agree that, in the short term, in Ireland, as Mr. Dollard mentioned, it is a matter of getting to 5 GW.  We should go beyond that, however, because the world will not end in 2030 and we have a huge opportunity that we can realise off the west coast and the south coast.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. James Carton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#P01100"><p>The Deputy's question was what the aim of a hydrogen strategy is.  The aim is that it comes out sooner rather than later, gives clarity to industry and investors and kicks off the idea of planning projects.  The offshore wind industry is having potential supply chain issues.  The demand for hydrogen electrolysers has increased across Europe and the rest of the world so much that lead times have gone from nine months up to 18 and 24 months for large-scale electrolysers.  The whole idea of a strategy is to have clarity and that it directs investment, policy and the resources from that and from the industry.  It creates the market to grow and evolve.</p> <p>  In response to the question about heavy-duty vehicles, there are 40,000 HDVs that add about 16% of our transport emissions and they will have difficulty going to something else that is not zero-emission.  A lot of them will go to hydrogen, some of them will go to compressed natural gas and some of them will go to battery.  I can share with the committee a report we have done - it is going to publication - in which we surveyed the haulage industry to see what it wanted.  Not knowing anything about hydrogen, it wanted hydrogen because it involved fast refill and was similar to what it was used to logistically.  It is really interesting to see the solutions, and hydrogen could have an early market in that sector.  Again, it depends on the market, etc.</p></speech>

It is currently building a vessel that uses hydrogen to operate the aquaculture farm.  We are also building a vessel but, because we do not have the access to hydrogen, unfortunately we cannot consider that at this time.  We would have preferred to do so.  Those examples are across Ireland.</p></speech>

When we engage in a most progressive way with communities, I think communities see not just that they are being listened to but that the project changes in response to the points and queries they make.  That is really important.  It is not enough to go into a community hall, listen, take notes and go home.</p><p>We need to come back and say my product is different because I have tried to meet them halfway.  That has led to a change in attitude towards wind energy.  If we look at the polling attitudes on support for wind energy, it is very high right across the board, including in rural Ireland, and in response to questions on when local infrastructure goes near to them.  That is partly because we have great community engagement.  We still need to do better.  It is also partly that more and more people understand the role of onshore and offshore wind energy, decarbonising our system and tackling climate change.</p></speech>

It was very clear about wanting to accelerate the planning process generally for projects like wind farms.  We spoke today about the need to have serious finance put into this country to try to get us to where we need to be, to have the infrastructure in place for production and to hit the targets.  The EU has launched a &euro;5 billion pot called the trans-European network, TEN-E.  The criteria for offshore wind have been updated.  The EU has started the legislative process now and it is appealing to member states to apply for funding from this pot of money to try to supercharge its wind energy efforts.  Given that the EU legislative process has just started, should Ireland be using the time to try to apply for funding?  Could the pot of money be useful to Ireland so that we are not relying on Government resources to try to put the significant level of financial resources into this that we need?</p></speech>

He is our head of policy, and he leads a lot of our EU work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Goodwin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#Q00400"><p>Senator McGahon's point is a very good one.  I do not disagree.  It is a big opportunity for Ireland.  The agreement on TEN-E was reached in December, just before the end of the year.  It was a very ambitious agreement that was reached between the co-legislators and there is a clear ambition at EU level to capitalise on the resources we have offshore, especially in north-western Europe.  Ireland is called out as an area of massive potential.  That feeds in as well to the ongoing discussion as part of the Fit for 55 package on the revision of the renewable energy directive which also looks at increasing co-operation at sea basin level to make sure that we can capitalise on the renewables we have offshore as a follow up to the offshore renewable energy, ORE, strategy that we saw in late 2020.  Ireland is called out as a key part of the process across all those types of policy initiatives at EU level.</p> <p>  It is also worth noting that this is a particularly opportune time for Ireland given that we currently hold the presidency of the North Seas Energy Cooperation or NSEC group.  This is something the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is prioritising and doing a lot of positive work on, but ultimately Ireland can only be a beneficiary of this sort of regional co-operation to start with and then move towards co-operation at a pan-European level.  That is because we have the resource and we have talked about the potential offshore for 30 GW off the west coast and the south coast in particular for floating offshore wind.  If we were to use the TEN-E regulation and start to make these infrastructural investments now to connect up European grids, and allow renewable electricity flow from where the resource is best - that is Ireland to where the demand centres are - for example, the Irish-German Hydrogen Council is present here, and the demand centres in central Europe where we have a lot of heavy industry.  We have spoken a lot about hydrogen, and it will be a carrier to get renewables from the Irish coast over to demand centres, but there will also be interconnection.  The idea of a pan-European super grid is something we should be looking at and seeing where there is funding available.</p> <p>  To go back to the specifics of Senator McGahon's question, there is money to avail of in TEN-E and we should be seeking to identify projects that could unlock potential.  Interconnection is a great example of that, to enable us to sell electricity to the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

My next two questions are for Mr. Moran again on the excellent document Wind Energy Ireland provided, Twelve Months to Deliver Offshore Wind Energy.  It put together eight recommendations that need to be enacted.  Are we in serious trouble if they are not enacted in the next 12 months and will we not hit targets as a result?</p></speech>

The longer it takes to deliver some of those targets, the more challenging it will be to deliver that to a point where just on a practical level we might not be able to achieve it all.  One of the asks in the document was the delivery of the Maritime Area Planning Bill, and that has been delivered and on time, so there is progress and there is momentum building up.</p></speech>

We have seen how we have passed some significant legislation in recent months.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, that momentum will continue.  While it may look unnerving at the moment, we are taking it very seriously.</p> <p>  There are eight very good recommendations.  Does Mr. Moran want to pick another issue that the Government needs to act on in the next 12 months or do the eight cover the major issues?</p></speech>

We notice it in industry at the moment with the number of projects that we are trying to progress.  There are simply not enough skill sets right across all aspects of planning, economics, grid engineers and electrical engineers.  They do not exist in Ireland right now.  We are going to have to learn from our international partners who have developed these projects successfully in the past ten years and take best practice.  What we really need to focus on, as was called out by Mr. Moran earlier, in the Skills for Zero Carbon report, is investing in third level institutions in order that we can grow and build our own domestic resources in terms of future engineers, economists and planners so that we can deliver by 2030.</p></speech>

There have been examples in other jurisdictions where they have faced initial teething problems in getting the sectors up and running and there have been secondments from industry of experienced people into departments or state agencies to try to progress projects as quickly as possible.  The UK and the Netherlands rolled out such a scheme very successfully in the past decade.</p></speech>

A comment was made earlier about the need to give confidence to the international supply chain to be able to show that Ireland is very serious about this.  We need to move from position papers and policy to delivery.  A couple of points were outlined on what we need to do in that respect, but is the time so short that we need to need to move from policy to delivery to provide the confidence within the next 12 months?  The timeframe is short.  It is between now and this time next year.  What needs to be done is momentous, but if we do not do all of these things within such a short window, we are in serious trouble of not hitting the targets that we set for ourselves.</p></speech>

We look at our phase one projects which are mostly on the east coast and there is one on the west coast and we would be very pleased if we were able to connect them in the first half of 2028.  That will get us, at best, half way to the 5,000 MW target.  It may not get us half way, and we have phase two to come in behind that.  We will be trying to build them, plan them and get consent for them all more or less simultaneously and much of it is something that we have not done before in Ireland because we have not developed it.  It is as stark as saying we could be in a difficult situation if we do not deliver in the next 12 months.  It is not that we will not build wind farms or that we will not decarbonise this country, but it is that we will not do it quickly enough to deliver the kind of carbon budget savings that the committee has been working on.</p></speech>

I echo what Senator Higgins said regarding our concerns about the designated protected marine areas and how we will square that circle in terms of those of us who want to deliver on the carbon budgets but also want to protect our biodiversity, and getting that balance right so biodiversity is not the sacrificial lamb of climate action.  I welcome what Mr. Cunniffe said earlier about the resourcing and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and environmental NGOs.  I also welcome the comments regarding the right of the public to object and to make submissions to the planning process, and that the real problem is not stopping people engaging with the planning process but resourcing the planning process so that engagement can happen much faster.  I welcome that from most of the commentators today.  I hope the Government is listening.</p> <p>  In terms of the public consultation, would the witnesses agree that public participation in the maritime area consent is vital?  Do they have a view on whether the public should be allowed to make submissions on that or to participate?</p> <p>  The other issue relates to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  There is much talk about how State agencies are not resourced to enable the witnesses to deliver what they want to deliver, which is clearly very ambitious.  Representatives of the CRU were before the committee last week and my understanding is that 25% of the CRU's budget is spent on hiring outsourced consultants.  Do the witnesses think it has the resources that are needed, particularly regarding bringing down the costs of energy for both consumers and those who are producing the renewable energy?</p></speech>

I definitely believe the CRU needs more resources.  In our daily interactions with people in the CRU they are highly skilled people who are very good at what they do, but they simply do not have enough people trying to work across such an enormous quantum shift in the energy sector in the next ten years, ranging from security of supply and trying to run renewable options for the first time in Ireland to trying to set up grid connection systems for both onshore and offshore renewables.  In our experience the CRU does not have enough people to cover the sheer quantity of work that is being thrown at it in order for us to deliver on the target.  I highly recommend that any budget that could be given to it in any way possible to increase its staffing levels would be given.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. Moran respond to the question on the MPAs.</p></speech>

We would like to see the Government initiatives, not placed in the legislation, to identify them to move forward as quickly as possible.  Our industry will do anything it can to support that.</p> <p>  On the secondary point regarding maritime area consents, for the phase 1 projects that will be going in for maritime area consent applications quite soon they will have already done at least one and, in many cases, multiple rounds of community engagement and public consultation in advance of that.  It is also important to highlight that the terms of the maritime area consent are themselves the subject of public consultation.  I believe that public consultation ended in the last couple of weeks.  I have vivid memories of reading the consultation submission.  That is really the focus.  Once we have that process in place, they will be able to apply for maritime area consent, but it is critical to highlight that it does not give them an advantage in the planning system.  They will still need to go through the planning system and there will and must be opportunities for people to engage fully and thoroughly there and to be listened to as part of that process.  That is really where people can help shape those projects.</p></speech>

We must get on with ending our dependency on fossil fuels from countries with shocking human rights records, particularly given the shameful financial dealings between shell companies in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and dictatorships, the bombings in Ukraine and the bombings in Yemen by the Saudis.  With that in mind, will Dr. Carton elaborate on the jobs and research opportunities that will need to happen in our third level institutions so we are ready for this and we can get on with providing the courses and places that are needed?</p> <p>  I have just one question for Mr. Moran.  Deputy O'Rourke and Senator Boylan have already covered most of the questions I had.  Regarding the hurricanes and storms that are creeping up due to warming in the Atlantic, are the structures of the offshore wind farms built to withstand these hurricanes?</p></speech>

It is a timely one.  Last Friday, we had the first physical meeting in two years in DCU on hydrogen.  We invited Mr. Bart Biebuyck, the clean hydrogen partnership programme manager of the EU.  We also had Mr. Philip Cheasty from Enterprise Ireland, Ms Sarah Dovern from INTERREG Europe, Ms Siobhan Kelly from the Department of Transport and Mr. Gerry Clabby from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  All of them did presentations on European funding for hydrogen-specific projects.  The opportunity there is to use co-funding between European and Irish development funds to kick off these large-scale deployment projects and move away from the laboratory and even from pilot projects to large-scale deployment projects.  Those funds exist.  Ireland has been rapped on the knuckles for not applying for these large-scale projects, which we have not done successfully over the last couple of years.  We are a laggard with regard to getting large-scale hydrogen funding from Europe.</p> <p>  With regard to academics, jobs and skills, all universities are putting programmes in their departments to upskill employees and to create the future roles we are discussing here today.  DCU has created an undergraduate sustainability degree programme.  We have also created graduate diplomas and graduate certificates in energy system decarbonisations.  All these are oversubscribed and they are only two years in place.  We are developing further as we move forward.  In this room here, there is a number of projects supported by MaREI and Science Foundation Ireland relating to developing the data.  One of the projects, EirWind, was mentioned earlier.  H-Wind and HyLIGHT are other ones.  These basically aim to produce data that we need to engage with industry and policy-makers, to really just get the numbers to understand what we do if we do A or B or we do A, B and C together at the same time, to develop energy system models and so forth.  It is to understand our decarbonisation pathway and, hopefully, feed into Government strategies and then develop roadmaps and plans for industry and investment.</p> <p>  I hope that covers some of the points the Deputy made.</p></speech>

I remember sitting across the table from Senator Dooley in Buswells about three and a half years ago and telling him floating wind energy was a post-2030 thing.  The reason I do not believe or say that anymore is that I have seen how much the technology has improved and, in particular, how much has been invested in turbine design and turbine manufacture to ensure they work.  We have not built a floating wind farm in Ireland, obviously, but we have built them as an industry.  We have built them off the coast of Portugal and off the coast of Scotland.  They are working effectively.  The Scottish test project, and I am open to correction on this, has been the most productive offshore wind farm off the coast of Scotland over the last couple of years, year on year.  It has survived the North Sea.  We will continue to improve the technology and continue to make it robust and strong enough to survive the Atlantic.  As a Galway man, I know what the wind is like off the coast of Galway and in the Atlantic ocean, so I appreciate that they need to be tough.  We will build them tough, and we have the science and the engineers who can do it.</p></speech>

Like Senator Boylan, I think many of the questions have been asked at this point.  I wish to focus on the issue of European funding.  I know that in Rossaveal and other ports, there has been a shift in relation to European funding.  I have noticed a difference in the kinds of applications that have been made over the last few years.  They all mention the possibilities of offshore renewables.  Are there other things that we could and should be looking at in respect of European funding?  I welcome all of the comments that were made on marine protected areas and increased funding for the NPWS.  It is good to hear such comments on the record in the debate today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cunniffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#S00200"><p>On EU funding, I am aware of a number of areas that certain supply chain elements are investigating at the moment, such as the Connecting Europe facility.  Hopefully, that will do something in terms of providing resources and investment in our port infrastructure.  Getting our port infrastructure in place as early as possible this decade is going to be absolutely critical to hitting that 5 GW target by 2030 for the reasons outlined by Mr. Moran earlier, in that we only have one current port facility on the island.  We cannot deliver all of these projects simultaneously from one port facility.  I strongly recommend that anything that can be done to try to get investment into port facilities should be done.  Another area of European funding to highlight, and one that I think will be very important, is further interconnection for the island thorough the east-west interconnector and the Celtic interconnector.  These were designated as projects of common interest by the EU Commission, which assists in providing funding in order to get them developed.  We are going to need more interconnection over the next ten to 20 years if we are to become the renewable superpower that we absolutely can be in providing energy, whether that is through electricity or hydrogen, to try to decarbonise the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

I was going to ask what other kinds of jobs might be provided.  I think it is a key thing in getting communities on board.  It is also key for the Irish economy.  We have spoken at length about jobs in the industry, but are there associated jobs outside of the skilled jobs in areas we have discussed?  For instance, in actually using the energy produced locally, is that of benefit to us, quite apart from the knock-on effects for people's families and the local spend and all of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030100002#S00400"><p>To briefly go back to the Deputy's question around EU funding and the availability of funding for projects, it is actually much wider than we have discussed so far.  One of the EU funds we have applied to recently relates to empowering communities to be able to engage effectively with offshore renewables as they develop out.  There is a significant amount of funding available for that.  However, the problem is that we have a handful of projects that are in phase 1 and we have not yet announced what the phase 2 projects will be.  In order to be able to apply for funding successfully, we must first know what those projects will be so that we can work together with the projects and the communities to be able to apply for the funding.  That leads me into some of the work that is being done in the offshore renewables sector, certainly in some of the projects I have been working on.  It is about trying to empower communities to increase the amount of seafood production, in the first instance, that they can produce as a result of their engagement with offshore renewable energy.  It is about how offshore renewables can support those industries in applications for new licences for aquaculture and fisheries, and also how we might integrate aquaculture activities, such as the restorative aquaculture of oyster and mussel farming or seaweed farming, within the offshore renewable development space.  There is a huge amount of work under way on that front.  Certainly, my experience of the offshore renewable energy industry, and also being part of the aquaculture industry, is that both sides are quite happy to engage with each other on it.  They both see the benefits of that.  It is actually something that has been very helpful in ensuring we are engaging successfully with what would otherwise be impacted communities.</p></speech>

We fully support that.  In terms of jobs, we are seeing a huge number of indirect jobs created locally through large infrastructure projects.  Indeed, just focusing on the Moneypoint project, we have seen the creation of many thousands of direct jobs, but significantly more indirect jobs, in terms of retail and so forth, over the course of that project.  There is an opportunity for developing those skills as well.  From a third level institution perspective, we have engaged with most of the third level institutions, trying to map out where we see the offshore wind industry going over the next number of years to ensure third level graduates have the necessary skills.  It is not that third level students are learning anything different now.  It is about tailoring it specifically to either offshore wind or hydrogen.  The main basic principles around the education system are sound.  It is just about complementing it with offshore wind and hydrogen or other storage activities.  There is a suite of items there.  ESB and many other developers take an active interest in that space because it is the only way that Ireland is ultimately going to deliver its long-term objectives.</p></speech>

Interestingly, for something like hydrogen, when you are using electrolysers, it produces oxygen and hydrogen.  There are many complementary applications for that oxygen, such as in sea farming or wastewater treatment facilities.  There is a facility being built in Belfast on that proposal.  The main focus is oxygen, not necessarily hydrogen, interestingly.  Also, because hydrogen is an add-on to renewable energy, a lot more jobs are created per megawatt or money invested because there are a lot of supply chain requirements there, including everything beyond the wind farm, the hydrogen production facility maintenance, security, safety and the supply chain of that fuel energy carrier to the industry.  There is a multiplication of jobs there.  We are trying to understand exactly what that means for Ireland and how that could be fed into communities.</p></speech>

The committee agreed that we would have this session.  It is the first of a series of sessions that will lead to the publication of a report.  We are very much thinking of the urgency of climate action and the need to create a clean energy system as quickly as possible.  That is the focus of this committee.  Everybody is very hard-working and diligent in terms of the remit we have.  However, events of the last few days at the other side of the Continent have given us another reason to accelerate the ambition we have.  I am not necessarily referring to Ireland, but in many countries, energy and defence are very related in terms of policy.  We have seen major shifts in defence policy in Europe in the last few days.  As Mr. Daly alluded to earlier, Germany made a twin announcement of its ambition to move away from coal and build an LNG infrastructure, which many members of this committee would take serious issue with.  However, Germany has its own challenges.  I suppose it is not entirely improbable that Europe will decide, at a political level, that it really needs to look to the west for its energy, and to friendly countries, as opposed to less friendly countries, for clean energy.  I imagine that in Europe questions are being asked about whether we can do that at scale and more quickly.  I am hearing from the witnesses that they are dealing with the system and timeframes that we have.  Is there a scenario where we can accelerate this if we change our systems around planning?</p><p>Obviously, we need to be very careful that we do that.  We also need to recognise the emergency that we have or is it simply not technically realistic to do that?  </p></speech>

ESB has said net zero by 2040.  Net zero is net zero - zero carbon emissions.  That can be delivered.  Within our strategy, we are setting out a roadmap that takes us from today all the way to 2040.  The closure of the coal plant at Moneypoint in 2025 is a key step, but there are other steps in how we reduce our dependence on gas in the ecosystem.  Ultimately, large-scale renewables, vast quantities of renewables paired with green hydrogen will deliver the solution.  Ireland has the resources; it is about accelerating the policies and structures.  We have to accelerate the timetable.  It can be done.  It is really about knowing that there is a need for many projects.  Not all projects will make it.  The number of projects that fail through various steps is significant.  The volume of projects we need to push through the system is significant.  The Chairman asked if it could be done.  The answer is "Yes".  From an energy-security point of view, it should be done.</p></speech>

We are trying deliver 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.  That is a challenge, as we have discussed this morning.  More than 20 GW worth of offshore projects are in development around the coast of Ireland right now, all of which could deliver if they were given the right infrastructure, policy and legislative regime to do so.  We carried out research with UCC MaREI last year looking at how to completely decarbonise Ireland.  It showed that we needed 25 GW of renewable energy by 2050 purely for our own domestic use.  If we were to accelerate that and try to export that to Europe in the short term, that would absolutely pay off in the long term as we look to electrify our heating and transport to get those sectors away from fossil fuel imports.</p></speech>

The resounding answer from the room is to go to renewables.  In a country like Ireland with significant ocean resources and engaging with the protection of biodiversity, it is an ultimate no-regrets scenario.  As Mr. Cunniffe said, we need to think about moving to having that energy for our own domestic use.  As we are part of Europe, let us engage with and supply that energy to Europe.  What the Chairman is talking about is the no-regrets scenario.  Ireland would have no regrets with offshore wind.</p></speech>

I am thinking out loud but we are in a wartime situation and effectively in these kinds of situations things that ordinarily happen slowly and methodically actually happen quite quickly and they have to.  We in the political system across Europe need to think carefully about that.</p> <p>  That is the end of our session.  I thank all the members who asked very interesting questions and provoked very thorough and interesting answers from our witnesses.  I thank our witnesses for coming today in great numbers.  It is great to see people back in the committee room where we can have a better engagement.  This is the first of a series of sessions on the big potential that is there and the challenges in delivering it.  Hopefully it will be a worthwhile report when it is finished and it will inform Government and wider society.</p></speech>

The witnesses are here today to discuss the further funding of higher education.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Dr. Murphy to make a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. Conlon, Mr. Brownlee and Dr. Trant.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee and there will be an eight-minute slot for each member's questions and the witnesses' replies.</p><p>I ask our guests to watch the timers under the television screens in the room.  As participants are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements to the Oireachtas website following the meeting.</p><p> Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him her or it identifiable.</p><p> I also remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person.  Therefore, if their statements are defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> I now ask the witnesses to make their opening statements.  They have five minutes each.  Dr. Murphy is first.  She will be followed by Mr. Conlon, Mr. Brownlee and Dr. Trant.  </p></speech>

I will focus on the key points made in our submission and I will finish by asking you to consider our recommendation that all higher education institutions be adequately funded for academic integrity.</p> <p>  The overall level of funding for higher education impacts quality and course provision.  This committee heard representatives of the higher education institutions call for increased, sustainable, funding for higher education.  This call is supported by evidence from our work on quality assurance.  </p> <p>  Going back to 2016, reports referred to in our written submission have shown that funding impacts the quality of teaching and learning, student supports and research.  They show a need for sustained investment in the research capacity of the technological sector.  They show that the design of the funding model must support the diverse missions of the technological universities, as set out in legislation.  The funding model also needs to support policy choices about pathways and progression for learners. </p> <p>  Dedicated funding drives development and change.  Springboard and the human capital initiative are effective ways to address specific needs and new developments, like new skills, the recognition of prior learning and microcredentials.  These funding schemes are also a means to implement Government policy.  </p> <p>  The quality assurance system maintains, enhances and evidences quality.  The system, operated by all higher education institutions and QQI, provides evidence of, and support to the quality of teaching and learning, assessment, research and support services.  It supports the new apprenticeships and the establishment of technological universities.  In 2020, it enabled the rapid shift to online and blended learning in the Covid pandemic.  It provided evidence of the impact of that shift on quality.  The first available reports for 2020 give us overall confidence that the reputation of higher education was protected in the pandemic.  We will know more when reports and evaluations for 2021 are completed. </p> <p>  We need to fund academic integrity.  I will finish by drawing your attention to the need, right now, to fund all higher education institutions to support and maintain academic integrity.  Academic integrity concerns a commitment to, and demonstration of, honest and moral behaviour in an academic setting.  It is under threat from a multi-billion-dollar, sophisticated, global industry of cheating.  A sustained, multi-pronged, collaborative effort is needed to support academic integrity, tackle cheating and the global cheating industry so that we maintain the quality, integrity and reputation of Irish higher education.  This concerns all of us and, in the first instance, all staff and learners in our higher education institutions.  Dedicated funding can underpin the significant steps we have all taken in Ireland in three main areas.  The first is legislation to enable QQI prosecute contract cheating or essay mills; second, collaboration between higher education staff, students and stakeholders in the National Academic Integrity Network which raises awareness, develops guidelines and resources and provides training; and third, engagement with international experts and agencies to inform, alert and detect cheating and to promote academic integrity.</p><p>Now, it is our higher education institutions that need funding to implement guidelines, support all staff and students, gather data and provide dedicated resources, training and research in areas such as detection and artificial intelligence.  QQI strongly recommends that this be provided through the recurrent grant model and targeted initiatives in order that all institutions are supported to embed academic integrity as a core part of their institutional culture.  By working together, we uphold the reputation of our higher education system.</p></speech>

On the matter of the future funding model for higher education, the HEA review of the allocation model for funding higher education institutions carried out in 2017 noted how higher education plays a critical role in the development of our people, providing a skilled workforce to meet economic and societal needs, including the need to support lifelong learning for all.</p> <p>  The importance of investing in higher education has been recognised by successive Governments, leading to higher levels of participation and broadening of access over recent decades.  This includes the provision of additional places in recent years to meet increasing demand.  The 2017 HEA report recognised that Ireland's higher education needs are met through a diverse range of regionally-dispersed institutions, of different scale and with different specialisations.</p> <p>  Since then, higher education has continued to change nationally and internationally and modes of delivery are being refreshed and renewed to offer greater and more flexible approaches to meet the needs of a broad cohort of learners.  As a result, the funding approach will also need to change.</p> <p>  The development of technological universities has seen the emergence of five new institutions of significant scale with regional, national and international relevance.  The objectives of technological sector reform are to raise standards, deliver better-quality outcomes for students and other stakeholders and enhance the performance of the sector.  The reform of the sector will increase the scale, critical mass and quality of the institutions, allowing them to respond regionally and compete on the world stage with other comparable higher education institutions internationally.</p> <p>  The Technological Universities Act 2018 has set out an ambitious agenda for these new institutions.  This is intended to improve research capacity resulting in a deepening of research-led teaching and learning excellence, including at apprenticeship and post-graduate levels.  Research fields will be extended and greater capacity will be developed within the technological universities to serve national and regional strategic objectives, including linkages with the European research area and European higher education area.</p> <p>  Apprenticeship provision is an integral component of the activities of the higher education sector, with more than 60% of the off-the-job training in craft apprenticeship and 65% of consortia-led apprenticeship programmes provided by the higher education sector.  The technological university legislation specifically references apprenticeship provision as a core element of the future development strategy of technological universities.</p> <p>  Meanwhile, within the traditional university sector, as one might call it, apprenticeship provision is also becoming a mainstream activity as universities such as the University of Limerick lead out as education partners in several consortia-led apprenticeships.  Apprenticeship programmes are available in the higher education sector from levels 6 to 10 on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ.</p> <p>  The sector has developed significant progress pathways for apprenticeship graduates within its traditional course offerings.  In terms of access initiatives, the national access to apprenticeship initiative developed by Technology University Dublin, which will also be rolled out by Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, supports the transition of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds into an apprenticeship scheme.  This programme has been hugely successful with many participants from the initiative progressing to full apprenticeships.</p> <p>  Since 2017, recurrent funding provided for apprenticeship provision in the higher education sector has totalled &euro;216 million and a total of &euro;35.5 million has been provided in capital investment to cater for the expansion of apprenticeship capacity in the higher education sector.  The the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is also deeply committed to the national priority to achieve equity of access to higher education.</p> <p>  The establishment of the programme for access to higher education, PATH, is an investment of more than &euro;40 million over six to seven years and funds projects across three PATH strands.  The enhancement of equity of access statistics through the collection of deprivation index scores for the student population, now into its third year of data collection, provides a more detailed and accurate insight into the socioeconomic profile of our student population than was ever previously possible.</p><p>The strengthening of universal design for learning, UDL, in higher education that supports more inclusive learning environments and practices for all students has been achieved through measures including strategic funding for projects in UDL.  A range of Covid-19 interventions designed to support vulnerable and disadvantaged students impacted by the pandemic have been put in place.</p><p> Through the lifetime of the national access plan, there has been progress on participation rates of students from cohorts that have experienced low participation rates, most notably students with disabilities. However, for students who are members of the Irish Traveller community, socio-economically disadvantaged or mature students, the data show that a significant challenge remains in increasing participation rates.</p><p> I know I am tight on time so I will finish up there.  Mental health and well-being supports have been a priority for the HEA and the Department in recent years, particularly as a response to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p> I look forward to the questions of members and the discussion on these matters.</p></speech>

SOLAS has responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating further education and training, FET.  Through the education and training boards and other providers, the FET system offers access to a wide range of learning opportunities and supports in every corner of the country, regardless of learners' background or formal education level, and a learning pathway to take them as far as they want to go.  It currently serves a base of approximately 200,000 unique learners every year.  SOLAS also has statutory responsibility for oversight of the national apprenticeship system and serves as the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeship in Ireland.  We are currently working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the HEA to establish a jointly managed national apprenticeship office.</p> <p>  The issue of future funding for higher education cannot be separated from that of support for FET and apprenticeship.  The current situation is that more than 70% of school leavers choose to enter higher education directly as their future pathway.  Although the high levels of higher education participation serve as an attribute that enhances Ireland&rsquo;s global reputation, there is now a case for a more balanced tertiary system with an enhanced role for further education and apprenticeships, in line with most other international systems.</p> <p>  Transforming Learning, the future FET strategy, sets out a clear roadmap for development of the system and centres on the three core pillars of building skills, fostering inclusion and creating pathways.  In addition, the strategy includes a core group of enabling themes to support and underpin the vision and strategic targets for the future FET agenda.  The strategy has the capacity to enhance and transform what is already an exciting system, supporting 200,000 learners on an annual basis, primarily through the network of 16 education and training boards, ETBs.  Within the pathways pillar, it seeks to increase the contribution of FET by building greater links between school and FET, within FET, and from FET to higher education.</p> <p>  One of the big early priorities was to make school leavers more aware of further education and apprenticeship options alongside higher education choices at CAO decision time.  This year, for the first time, a link on the CAO website allowed school leavers to explore all the potential pathways.  To date, approximately 35,000 people linked to either apprenticeship or further education and training information as a result of visiting the CAO website and we hope that will lead to increased demand for these options.</p> <p>  It should not be seen as an either-or scenario when it comes to FET and higher education as there is potential to build on strong links between the two systems to establish more consistent pathways and explore co-development and co-delivery of programmes by FET and higher education providers.  Indeed, there is evidence that, for a cohort of school leavers, having the foundation of a FET experience prior to entering higher education significantly increases their chances of completing their degree.</p> <p>  In apprenticeship, there have been encouraging signs in 2021 of increased interest in the 25 craft and 37 newer apprenticeship opportunities.  There were more than 8,600 new registrations during the year, with an overall apprenticeship population of 24,212 in December, far outstripping pre-pandemic levels in 2019.  That is an encouraging sign in the context of seeking to meet the national apprenticeship action plan target of 10,000 per annum in 2022.</p> <p>  Of course, the pandemic had a significant impact on craft apprenticeship provision, with higher education and FET facilities closed for nine of the first 15 months and the system only able to return to full capacity from September 2021.</p><p>This created a significant waiting list at the end of the summer but an emergency action plan has been put in place, with 7,000 apprentices already back in off-the-job training and the vast majority scheduled to be back by the end of this year.  The emergency plan included a blended delivery model which allowed us to move to three intakes per year rather than two for phase 2 apprentices, capital investment and more instructors to expand capacity across phases 2, 4 and 6 and a fast-tracking of the phase 7 qualification period.  Continuing to expand capacity remains a critical priority for SOLAS, not only to ensure that new registrants are able to access off-the-job training in a timely manner, but also to ensure that capacity exists to meet the significant national challenges around Housing for All and climate action. </p><p> It is also important that funding remains available across both FET and higher education, HE, to develop new ideas for apprenticeships.  While the apprenticeship system has developed significantly since the first action plan was launched, there is scope for more higher education institutions, HEIs, to become involved in development of programmes.  There also still exists major untapped potential in developing further apprenticeship programmes across FET.  </p><p> I hope this provides a brief overview of the issues with regard to the higher education funding model that are relevant to further education and training and apprenticeships.  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to further discussion on this matter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary-Liz Trant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030100002#G00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to contribute to the round-table discussion on the future funding of higher education and the key areas for consideration in this regard.  Committee members will be aware of the decision by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation, and Science, Deputy Harris, to establish a new national apprenticeship office to drive implementation of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.  It is my privilege to have been appointed interim director of the new office.</p> <p>  Higher education plays an extremely important role in our national apprenticeship system.  The majority of our 62 national programmes include training that is provided by technological universities, institutes of technology, the University of Limerick and privately-run or not-for-profit higher education colleges, including the National College of Ireland and Griffith College.  This training is provided in close partnership with education and training boards and other further education providers.  Funding of &euro;200 million has been allocated by Government this year to support apprenticeship provision, with a substantial portion of this coming from the National Training Fund.  The fund, made up of a levy of PRSI contributions by employers, supports ongoing investment in and expansion of the apprenticeship system.  This funding is extremely important as we work to clear the backlog of apprentices delayed in their training during 2020 and 2021 by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <p>  Apprenticeship is a dual model that combines learning in the workplace, at least 50% on-the-job, and learning delivered by an education and training provider.  Over 8,300 employers who currently use apprenticeship as a talent pipeline place a high value on the learning their apprentices complete in the education environment.  It is intended that the number of employers using apprenticeship will grow significantly over the next four years, with 10,000 apprentice registrations per annum by 2025, requiring a significant expansion of the system. </p> <p>  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Harris, provided an additional &euro;10 million of investment in apprenticeship facilities across higher education, with a matching additional &euro;10 million for further education.  To fulfil the ambition and the targets that are set out in the action plan, investment will need to continue this year and in subsequent years as Ireland works to deliver on major targets, including the building of 300,000 new homes by 2030 and the massive programme to retrofit our current housing stock.  Technological universities and other higher education institutions have a vital role to play in supporting apprenticeship expansion and in ensuring that apprentices receive high-quality training that equips them for their careers and their contribution to the prosperity and growth of our country. </p> <p>  In addition to construction, electrical and engineering-related apprenticeships, we now have a vibrant suite of apprenticeship programmes in areas that include tech, biopharma, financial services, healthcare, hospitality and manufacturing.  Apprentices can achieve qualifications at degree level, masters level and to date, we have one PhD apprenticeship for principal engineers.</p><p>The national apprenticeship system provides multiple lifelong learning opportunities where people can complete advanced apprenticeships as part of their career progression or as a means of changing career.  <br/><br/>We expect to have up to 70 national programmes available by the end of this year.  There is a strong pipeline of industry engagement and of new apprenticeships coming down the line.  Higher education institutions are actively responding to this demand and are planning how a much larger and more mainstream apprenticeship offering forms part of their overall activities, alongside academic provision, research and service to the community.<br/><br/>Just like all other learning opportunities, access, diversity and inclusion are extremely important within the national apprenticeship system.  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship includes a significant number of actions that will accelerate the number of women apprentices, those with disabilities and other under-represented groups.  A dedicated access committee is being established to advise the apprenticeship office in this work.  A first step is already under way with introduction of a gender-based bursary for eligible apprenticeship employers.<br/><br/>Progress has also been made in promoting positive mental health within the apprenticeship community.  The R U OK? campaign encourages apprentices, teachers and employers to have healthy conversations about mental health.  Resources are available on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>, including great short videos made by apprentices talking about their own experiences and encouraging each other to ask on a regular basis, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;  A second phase of the campaign is getting under way shortly, with great support from the higher education community.<br/><br/>I look forward to the discussion at today&rsquo;s round-table session.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to talk about apprenticeship within a progressive and vibrant tertiary education system that we are working on for now and into the future.

It is great to see a lot of positive work in the areas that they represent.</p> <p>  Listening to Dr. Murphy, I was interested in, and it was probably the first time that I looked at it in detail, the whole area of academic integrity, which, obviously, is crucially important to our reputation both nationally and internationally.  It was very interesting to hear that. </p> <p>  In terms of Mr. Conlon&rsquo;s presentation, it is absolutely great to see our five technological universities up and running.  We are looking forward, as a committee, to having the opportunity to engage further around the opportunities and challenges that are there.  I note that the University of Limerick, UL, is leading the way in terms of several consortia-led apprenticeships, which is top class, as well as the fact that there are significant progression pathways developed.  I am particularly interested in the next national access plan, which will be starting this year.  Perhaps he could enlighten us in terms of what will differentiate the previous plan with this.  In terms of equity of access to those from marginalised backgrounds and those with disabilities, we have discussed here before the lack of progression, sometimes, for people with disabilities into further education.  He might also address the digital divide, which became very obvious during Covid and the proposals he would make around that.  </p> <p>  It is good to see Mr. Brownlee again at this committee.  He mentioned how 35,000 people had visited the CAO link for apprenticeships.  This could be really changing things because many previous concerns were just about that parity of esteem and this is addressing it.  It is great.  When will he be in a position to quantify how that has turned into practical measures?  It would be really good for the committee to get an update at that point in time.  I completely agree with him that funding for further education and apprenticeships cannot be separated from higher education funding.  They all absolutely have to be the same. </p> <p>  Dr. Trant talked about the strong pipeline available and the earn-as-you-learn model.</p><p>I really do believe that the message is getting out.  Even in the past 12 months, there has been a lot more about that.  We are talking about 8,300 employers and how that must grow to a minimum of 10,000.  I acknowledge and accept that there is good engagement with the business community.  What are the challenges from the business community for making this participation greater?  What do we need to put in place, not just from the education committee but also at a broader level?</p><p> Student loans were mentioned in the Cassells report.  What are the witnesses' views on the different models that were presented at that?  The witnesses might also mention the need to develop accommodation on campus.  This is very important for all.</p></speech>

That process is in train with the Minister and his Department, and the Higher Education Authority has consulted on that.</p> <p>  On the emerging issues, some of these are cross-cutting.  The Senator mentioned the technological universities, for example, and the role they will play and so on.  Of the cross-cutting issues that are emerging, financial supports for students is one of the key areas for us.  Priority groups are also an issue for us, including the Traveller and the Roma communities, and the additional supports that could be put in place to assist people into and through higher education and all through their lives.  Another emerging issue is that of specific pathways for special cohorts, for example for children in care, the kinds of supports that would be put in place for an all-of-life approach into further education and higher education, and how those joined-up pathways would exist through us for those cohorts.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the part-time and flexible learning experience through the pandemic.  Much of the system had to pivot to online provision.  We are trying to leverage the learning from that by seeing how we teach and engage with students in a different way in an online environment, what we learned from that, and how can we use that knowledge to develop new programmes or parts of programmes.  Not all kinds of provision are ideal for online provision but we can do more to reach out to students in disadvantaged communities, for example.  There is also the digital divide, which the Senator has also mentioned and which we are looking at.  We are trying to see how we can use the digital experience of a pandemic to reach out to students in communities, to reach out to students in disadvantaged cohorts, and to create pathways and opportunities.  It is a very opportune time to have this conversation.</p> <p>  We have not been excellent in Ireland at part-time and flexible learning and we do not have a strong tradition in that.  The 9 a.m to 5 p.m, three to four-year degree programme is more common and we need to do more in developing flexible pathways.  Now it is a very good opportunity to do that and to look at that.  We are currently developing a programme to invest in the technological universities in particular and to have them look at what they can do now in a new way and what will mark them out as different to the traditional institutions. The flexible learning and universal design for living principles are the sort of things that those institutions can take on as a particular mission.  I hope this is helpful and I thank the Senator for her very helpful questions.</p></speech>

We were constantly hearing up to now that the further education options and apprenticeship options are really only an afterthought if the student does not get the points to get into higher education.  This is the first step in trying to make sure that everyone has all of the choices on the table.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we know if it works, at the moment we know it has created a level of interest in those different options.  The CAO change of mind process has only just closed and we will not know the full impact until August or September when the leaving certificate results are out and people finalise their choices. We should have a good gauge in April or May.  We are already hearing anecdotally from the FET colleges that more and more people are coming to them.  People are entitled to apply for our courses at the moment but there is no incentive to do so because the higher education process is still working through.  We will be able to give the committee an update in April or May on the sense of demand for FET courses, and then a full review of the impact when choices are confirmed in September and October.  A big part of this is changing the culture around and helping people to make smarter choices.</p><p>It should not be about capping numbers in higher education or fixing numbers in further education and training. There is real potential just to get people better information.  There is also real potential to look at further education and training pathways into higher education in order that a person could start off in further education and progress into higher education degree programmes.  We are working on this with QQI and with the HEA.</p></speech>

We have this matching challenge all the time.  We have a portal where employers can advertise vacancies but the numbers that use this are relatively small.  We are looking at how on a county or regional basis we can actually start to put out better information in order that young people in school can genuinely see and find an apprenticeship opportunity.  This is being actively worked on at the moment.</p> <p>  With regard to what is in place for the business community and the 8,300 employers already using apprenticeships, a lot of those employers are really positive and talk about their experiences in a very positive way.  This has been a big plank of Generation Apprenticeship and in the promotion of apprenticeship opportunities.  The employer grant was introduced this year for the newer apprenticeships with &euro;2,000 per apprentice per year.  This will be a big help for all of those apprenticeships where there is not a training allowance.</p> <p>  Another big thing we have started to work on is to make the whole system more accessible for employers.  There is a portal, a technology solution for employers, where they can go on and see how many apprentices they have and how they are getting on.  We really need to build on that and make it much more streamlined and more technology-based in how employers engage with the system.</p> <p>  There is a lot of work to be done and there is a big agenda of work now through the new office.  The plan is that over the next 12 to 18 months we will see big steps forward to support that much greater number of employers who are choosing apprenticeships for recruitment of their talent.</p></speech>

We really need collaboration and working together to get some movement on that.</p> <p>  On the apprenticeships, QQI is undertaking an important review of the 37 consortia-led apprenticeships.  This will show some learning and we can use that to inform the next stage and to improve and work more efficiently in designing and rolling out apprenticeships and, importantly, in making sure that they are sustainable over the period.</p> <p>  We are also working on improving Qualifax, which is an important information platform on options for students, and particularly now in the further education space, apprenticeships and higher education.</p> <p>  We continue to work with SOLAS and others on improving the pathways and on leveraging the qualification system that provides transparency, information and support to everybody who wants to progress into and onwards in higher education and further education.</p></speech>

There has been a big drive to work on that and to increase that.  There is a target of 750 public service apprenticeships over the period of the plan, which would include the local authorities.</p></speech>

Every time I ask this question of a local authority, I do not get an answer.  We need to examine the baseline in this regard because local authorities have a responsibility to not just talk the talk, but also walk the walk.  Having skilled staff in their own areas is in their interests.  It would be good if the National Apprenticeship Planning Office gave us those figures.  It does not matter if they are zero &ndash; well, it does &ndash; but at least we would know what we were working towards and we could set proper targets.  I am interested in local authorities specifically, but the others are important as well.</p> <p>  It was good to see Mr. Brownlee on Achill Island yesterday.  It was a great launch of the strategic framework for outdoor education and training centres.  There are significant opportunities in this regard.  The strategy needs funding to go with it, but Mr. Brownlee could sense the energy and dedication that will make it a success.  As I told him yesterday, it has the potential to be an all-island approach that would attract students from the North to outdoor education.  The benefits of that would not just be academic, in that there would also be an exchange of experiences and understanding as part of the peace and reconciliation process that we are trying to achieve across the island.  I congratulate everyone involved in the strategy.</p> <p>  Mr. Conlon stated that reform of the technological sector would allow technological universities "to respond regionally and compete on the world stage" and that the 2018 Act set out an ambitious agenda for the new institutions to improve their research capacity, resulting in a deepening of research-led teaching and learning excellence.  During the seven years of Horizon 2020, the higher education sector in this State won &euro;679 million in research funding.  The technological sector got approximately 8% of that, or &euro;54 million.  The three institutions that make up the soon-to-be-formed Atlantic technological university managed to get &euro;3 million of that, or less than 0.5% of the total.  By comparison, Teagasc, as a research body, drew down approximately six times as much.  How do we design a funding model that positively discriminates towards the regions that are not at the same level of research and development?  The overall available funding is split 60-40 between the traditional universities and the technological sector.  How do we create a unitary system whereby the technological sector, and the higher education sector more widely, receive a greater share?  Are there other approaches that we need to consider?</p> <p>  Regarding the regional disparity, last week's Central Statistics Office figures tell us that the gap is now three times wider than it was ten years ago.  We are all failing in addressing that disparity.  According to the economist, Mr. John Daly, capital funding for higher education in the north west amounted to &euro;316 per undergraduate enrolled between 2010 and 2020 while &euro;372 was the national figure.  We can see from this why the gap is increasing.  We have a responsibility in this regard.  What are Mr. Conlon's thoughts on it?</p></speech>

The Deputy has identified part of the issue that we are trying to address through technological universities; it is an issue of capacity and scale.  Let us take capital investment as an example.  It is difficult for a small institution to manage a broad capital portfolio, in that it is difficult to put the applications together and compete for funding.  The same goes for research.  Horizon Europe is a competitive programme.  The institutions that comprise technological universities were formerly teaching and learning institutions.  They came out of a post-secondary approach to creating opportunities in regions.  We are trying to supersize them in terms of the contribution they can make to regions.  This is highlighted in the national development plan where there are ambitious targets for the western seaboard.  The new Atlantic technological university will play an important part in that.</p> <p>  We are looking at investing in building capacity in research supports.</p><p>If there is an excellent academic who is capable of running a research project but is not able to get through the red tape of Horizon Europe, he or she will need support within the institution.  We are building capacity around grant writing, application processes and engagement with enterprise.  We support people in those endeavours.  We have excellent people in those institutions, are bringing them together in larger institutions and will support them in their endeavours.</p></speech>

Mr. Brownlee stated that further education offers people learning pathways to take them as far as they want to go.  We need to place greater emphasis and attention on the work being done in this regard and on the potential of further education.  I am not convinced that the pathways are adequately in place, though.  I always refer to how fewer than 5% of the approximately 4,000 students who study pre-nursing go on to study degree-level nursing.  The Minister often refers to the pre-law situation.  I have asked for figures on the progression of pre-law students to degree level but I have been told that the data are not collected.  Many pre-law and pre-nursing students pursue further education just for the education they receive there and not as pathways to a university or an institute of technology.  I imagine that they do not have that desire.  However, I am concerned about the pathways.  Nursing is the stark example.  Why do so few pre-nursing students progress?</p></speech>

It is equivalent to a fifth of the intake of the technological higher education sector.  It is all <i>ad hoc</i>, though, which answers the Deputy's question in part.</p></speech>

How important is it that we make the pathways a key component of an agreed future funding model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Brownlee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030100002#M00700"><p>From the perspective of SOLAS and pathways, it is critical.  We need to incentivise the links and build on the 5,000 people.  It depends on institution-to-institution arrangements.  We need to mainstream those and have universal agreements in areas like nursing, technology and even teacher education.  We will then see the numbers increasing and pathways forming.</p> <p>  There is also an opportunity for co-development and co-delivery of degree programmes.  There is a great example of this in Cavan and Monaghan with the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, which was Athlone IT, and IT Sligo, which is itself changing into a technological university.  There is also the great example of the Ballyfermot College of Further Education working with DCU, where the former starts the delivery of the degree programme locally and students then progress into the university setting.  There is the potential to develop this area.  In Scotland, it is a tried and tested route.  We are not talking about an either-or situation, but about a pathway through the system.</p></speech>

We visited the technological universities in Limerick and Cork.</p><p>It was fantastic to have the opportunity to visit and see exactly what happens.  We learned a huge amount from that visit.  We can have as many witnesses in here as possible but it is important to actually visit these places and see what happens on the ground, as well as the challenges that those involved face.</p></speech>

They will be on the front line against climate change in the context of the retrofitting programme and in combating biodiversity loss.  They will clearly and obviously be needed to tackle the housing crisis in a meaningful way.  There is a huge dearth of skilled people in that area.  The care economy is also expanding due to the clear demographic trends towards older people.  Valuing them and providing for them as part of the caring economy will be a huge part of our future economy.  The appearance of further education courses on the CAO course list is extremely important for a number of reasons.  It is about ease of access but it also goes some way towards dispelling what a previous contributor called a cultural handbrake against apprenticeships and exploding any remaining prejudices about this pathway into education.</p> <p>  I visited the Waterford training centre two weeks in order to look at its retrofitting courses.  We need to raise awareness about micro-credentials.  Someone who is a plasterer already can be in and out of Waterford training centre and accredited for retrofitting in three days.  It is similar for window fitters.  Two of the days can be done online with only one day in the centre.  People can then be fully accredited to move into this new and rapidly expanding area of the economy.  We have to scale that as quickly as we possibly can.  It is critically important.</p> <p>  Professor Vincent Cunnane has said that technological universities are a long ladder of opportunity.  I welcome that.  Someone could begin at apprenticeship level but the sky is the limit.  People do not have to stop once they come out of their apprenticeship.  There is a pathway that will lead them all the way to level 10 if they wish to get there.</p> <p>  We are here to discuss future funding and I am not sure I have come away with a clear picture of the challenges that face the sector from a future funding point of view.  I ask the witnesses to dig down into that in a more detailed and granular way.  What an apprenticeship is has changed and been blended so much that the answers will be different for a sparks, a brickie or a plasterer, and there will be a different range of answers for someone in the caring economy or the tech industry.  What cost are we talking about for the student or apprentice walking in the door?  Is it a set level of costs over the couple of years that they are training?  What is the cost to employers?  If an employer decides to take an apprentice on, what will it cost them?  What is the resulting cost to the State?  Do we need to expand that?  That is what we are here to discuss.  Are there other funding sources?</p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to European funding.  Are there other funding sources that we need to put into the mix?  If we are discussing funding coming in, are we discussing the funding coming out?  Is it properly spread between the likes of SOLAS and the technological universities?  Universities are now moving into this area.  ETBs will also want a slice of that money.  I ask the witnesses to identify the problems that are there.  Do we have enough money coming in?  What are the costs?  Is there a cost barrier for somebody from a lower socioeconomic background to stepping onto the first rung of this long ladder of education or opportunity?  Are we getting enough money in the door?  Are there issues around distributing and dispersing that money across the range of ETBs, technological universities, SOLAS, etc.?  These are very broad questions but they are aimed at helping me better understand funding in this area.</p></speech>

My colleagues' responses will probably be more specialised.  We can always do more with more.  We have significant resources coming into higher education and further education.  The system is being asked to do more for non-traditional entrants.  These could be students with specific learning needs, for example, who need supports.  That has to be resourced in some way.  When the resource coming in is finite, it needs to be stretched and you have to stop doing one thing to do something else.  As both a State and a nation, we have to decide what we want.  Do we want a highly skilled population?  Do we want to provide that to people in all regions?  There is a cost to providing it in geographically dispersed locations and it is very complex.</p> <p>  We do very well and we get excellent outcomes from the investment we make in our education system.  We can see that in the statistics.  The higher a person's level of educational attainment, the more likely they are to be in a job and stay in a job through an economic cycle and so on.  We have all the evidence for that.  We can see that the more people are educated, the better their life outcomes are with regard to income and employment, but also health outcomes and all those other things.  If people are locked out of that and cannot get into further and higher education, they will not have that opportunity in their lives.  They will not have those better health outcomes.  There is a deep issue we have to think about there regarding equality.</p> <p>  Providing that access will require resourcing for the individual because people could have caring responsibilities or part-time jobs, and they need to keep the car on the road for driving to college.  Hopefully, we can do more about distance learning and it will save them money in that regard.  All of those complex things need to be considered and those pieces do not necessarily work well together.  Our system serves us very well.  It serves a very broad range of students from all kinds of backgrounds, but we are going to have to do more from an equality perspective because the nature of our economy is more high skills based.  The Deputy mentioned retrofitting and the green agenda.  There are challenges with regard to the sustainable development goals.  There is a lot of work to be done and we need to empower the system to respond to that.  I used the word "empower" not "fund", but it probably does mean funding.  That is what we have to think about.</p></speech>

We have agreed with QQI a fast-track approach to making sure courses with micro-credentials can be developed quickly.  One of the courses we are bringing to its panel next month is a level 4 course in sustainability.  The idea is that this can be rolled out across all out FET courses so every FET learner is equipped with environmental awareness, green skills and an understanding of sustainability.  We are telling them to be the kinds of agents of change we need for tomorrow.  That is the big ambition in our FET strategy and in the programme for Government.  It is difficult for me to comment on funding because I work for a State agency.  Part of the reason for this new Department is that we are trying to think about funding for a tertiary level.  The thinking behind the new national apprenticeship office is not just about funding FET over here and higher education over there but about making it much more aligned and joined up for apprenticeships.  Dedicated funding to support those pathways between further education and higher education is critical to moving things forward.</p></speech>

It came out at in and around &euro;7,000 per apprentice per year.  That was the average.  That kind of analysis must be done again because we have more programmes coming on stream.  There is a commitment in the action plan to look at that in detail.  The other big cost for apprenticeships is capital expansion.  We know we need to do a huge amount of that.  I stated earlier that &euro;20 million was allocated last year on top of the existing commitment to invest capital.  We are just getting detailed figures now on what is needed for Housing for All and the retrofitting scheme.  Given the scale of the challenge, it is our sense that we are going to need at least that much, if not more again, this year and for the next three to four years.  That would go towards building more workshops and training spaces, and doing it in a very innovative way to accommodate many more apprentices coming through.</p><p> In higher education, apprentices pay a contribution and that issue is raised in the context of costs for apprentices.  Apprenticeships are done on an earn-as-you-learn basis, so all apprentices get a salary or a training allowance on the craft apprenticeships.  We hear feedback about how it can be difficult, particularly for older apprentices, to survive and manage on an apprenticeship salary, especially in the early years.  This is something we will do work on, including through a wide survey of apprentices we will carry out later this year, to get that feedback in a much more systematic way.  We will then examine what is possible and what will be needed if we want to deliver on that commitment to additional numbers.</p><p> We have some information, but we need to gather much more.  The targets are there, as is the commitment by the Government to achieve them, and increased funding will be needed to match that.  Part of our job will be to identify what that is and to set it out, and then to go about securing it for the coming years.</p></speech>

It has been very educational for me to listen to their contributions.  Throughout the time we have been holding these meetings, I have spoken about the value of further education, which can be a lifeline for people on the fringes of society such as me, who was born and reared on a halting site.  When I was younger, university was not something I had the financial resources to consider, and furthermore, I did not qualify for it.  My lifeline was to attend Ballyfermot College of Further Education to study for a QQI qualification in pre-nursing and caring for people with special needs, which I loved.  It was not even about the qualifications I got at the end of it, but rather about learning, being in a college setting and wondering what attending university would be like.  I genuinely believe in the value of further education.  While universities are really important and it almost the norm nowadays to have a level 8 qualification, in the same way that years ago it was the norm to have the leaving certificate, further education can be a lifeline for many disadvantaged communities, people from ethnic-minority groups and people who feel third level education is not for them but who want to get a feel for it.</p> <p>  Our guests mentioned the pathway programmes.  Will they speak to those programmes and to how their success is expanding access to higher education?  They went on to mention funding to support participation among Travellers and Roma students.  Will they elaborate on that funding?  It is my understanding there have not been any separate targeted supports for people from minority groups, but it is important we support all ethnic-minority groups to have access to college.  Our guests spoke about the value of apprenticeships for workers and it was good to hear them address that issue.</p></speech>

It is good to have this conversation.  I mentioned the Irish Traveller community in my opening comments but did not go into detail because I was over time.  There have been marginal improvements in Irish Traveller numbers in higher education.  For example, there were 33 new entrants in the year 2020-21 versus 26 in 2012-13, but that was nonetheless very slight incremental growth.  Currently, approximately 119 students who are enrolled in higher education institutions identify their background as that of Irish Traveller, compared with 78 about ten years ago.</p><p> As for specific programmes, under PATH 1, teacher educators in Mary Immaculate College, MIC, are working to involve Irish Traveller students in teacher education.  One of the most important aspects will relate to role models, because they are the people who, for example, encourage students to Ballyfermot College of Further Education to take the first step and look at opportunities ahead, and that is not reflected in classrooms.  In the teacher education space, therefore, we are making significant inroads such that people in schools will be able to see themselves reflected in those who teach them and engage with them.</p><p> Thirteen Irish Traveller students are registered on the programme and, of those, quite a number are progressing, although not all, given it is challenging to get through education, but we are making some inroads.  We are trying to continue and extend the programme and to raise awareness among Traveller students, specifically the 15-to-18-year-old cohort, whom we are trying to engage in the programme.  We are seeking also to assist graduates coming out of the programme to progress in their education or into teaching careers.  Furthermore, under the third strand, we are examining the recruitment of some students onto PhD programmes to look at the impact of the programme and how we can do more with it.  We are using education to educate ourselves, as was said, and trying to learn from the experience.</p><p> Moreover, the national access plan is in development and there are a number of clusters nationally that have been identified, although we are trying to engage in regions because, again, it is about engaging with the community and the people who are best placed to influence and support students in their engagement, so those programmes are ongoing.  The Irish Traveller and Roma communities will be specific targets in the next access, because they need to be.  We are making progress and we need to continue it.</p></speech>

It is so important this lifeline be given to everyone in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have done broader work on race equality, for example, in higher education.  We have published a report on that and are developing an action plan to examine how intersectionality impacts on people.  They may have all kinds of issues that cause them problems in their progression, so we are examining how all those issues intersect and how we can do better in respect of an action plan on developing race equality.  In the context specifically of marginalised groups, a number of institutions are engaging with direct provision, for example, and looking at how they can help.</p> <p>  I am minded to mention one other issue, which relates to Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's point about carers. There is a very interesting programme in Institute of Technology, IT, Carlow that is examining people who are in caring arrangements for someone at home.  IT Carlow's programme can reach out to them and give them education in that environment.  It helps not only with their caring but also with their own personal development, keeping them relevant and engaged.  There are many programmes like that which individual institutions are operating and engaging in.  I could pull together some further briefing on that for the Senator, with reference to broader marginalised groups.</p></speech>

There are targeted initiatives through our community education programme and we funded a number of projects under the mitigating against educational disadvantage fund last year.  That reinforces the Senator's point that there is interest in that regard.  One of our main worries is that we have lost approximately 10% to 15% of learners in that target group and in some of the other marginalised target groups because of the pandemic, given we had to go online, which just does not suit people who have wider support needs and require that peer network.  It is something we are actively trying to address by getting numbers back up to pre-pandemic levels, and it is a priority.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anna Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030100002#R00200"><p>The measures will vary from institution to institution.  What will be important and useful is to have a contact person or unit within each higher education institution that can provide support to staff and learners, provide resources, can help detect cheating and start conversations where they may not have already started.  Because this cheating is not just about individuals seeking to buy essays or to have their assignments done for them by somebody else, but often students are targeted by these contract cheating providers.  They are following WhatsApp and messages in Facebook where somebody might say he or she is struggling or has a deadline he or she cannot meet, and he or she will get an unsolicited message saying we can help you, we are here, we provide these services.  Students who are under pressure, perhaps international students who do not have supports here and may not have sufficient preparedness to engage in assessment, or who come from a different culture of higher education may be more exposed and more vulnerable to this.  This is what the international evidence is suggesting to us.  The other thing we can do is provide funding for research to enable the development of programmes to detect academic cheating, to develop the artificial intelligence to combat it and to be aware of the way in which artificial intelligence is now being used to support plagiarism.  There is a whole range of things.</p></speech>

It is easy to see how people would try to get around the system and have access to ideas and thoughts.  By the same token, it is also possible to search and try to detect where words, phrases, sentences or whole paragraphs or even whole essays have been located that are not original but are plagiarised.  Is it Dr. Murphy's view that this is a much greater problem than ever before?  Is there a struggle to get to grips with it?</p></speech>

We do not have the data for the extent of it in Ireland.  That is an important issue we need to address.  Recent international evidence has shown, for example in Australia, that it is much more prevalent that had been thought.  Guy Curtis who has been an expert in this field for 20 years or more said in November that his estimate is that 8% to 10% of Australian students engage in contract cheating.  It is quite significant.  There is no reason to believe that things are any different here.  We need to know more.  There are encouraging signs.  We have legislation here to enable us to prosecute contract cheating.  We have a very good academic integrity network of people in higher education from across students, staff, professional bodies and so on in both public and private.  There is a good deal of global engagement and good research and co-operation between the relevant agencies and between experts to look at all the elements.  We need the multipronged approach of raising awareness, being on top of it as the Senator says, to know what is happening and to design solutions.  Artificial intelligence is part of the problem but it is also part of the solution.  We really just have to keep on top of it as best we can.</p></speech>

Not to make light of a serious subject but in my college debating days, I was fond of putting around the line that 70% of student debaters make up their own statistics on the spot.  It was not an original line of mine, it was going around at the time.</p></speech>

There is a whole infrastructure in place in institutions to support researchers and make sure that happens.  That is not as well developed in the academic integrity space at teaching and learning at undergraduate level.  As my colleague Dr. Murphy said the insidious nature of this is the chilling part of it.  I work a good deal in student well-being and student mental health.  You take the opportunity of using the thing that is said to you for your exam and then it is found out.  People should know better but they do not always know better.  Sometimes they are in very complicated situations.  A lack of academic integrity in an exam situation or around a submission of a paper situation has a devastating impact on students too.  They should not do it but when they do it is devastating in terms of the outcome.  I just wanted to make that point.  </p></speech>

I refer to the ground rules, various things around note-taking and research; is it mandatory or universal that students encounter the concept of plagiarism, the rules around plagiarism, obviously the ban on it, and various ways it can happen, the consequences both immediate and wider social and community consequences?  There are major potential knock-on consequences.  This is not just about getting a better mark or a mark you do not deserve in an exam.  It could be about a bridge falling, in the fullness of time.</p></speech>

However, what there may not be as much awareness of is the blackmail that is involved in it and as Mr. Conlon said the invidious nature of the contract cheating services, the way in which they trap, chase and encourage cheating.  That is the sort of thing we need to tackle.  There is scope to work with the digital platforms to remove the advertising, to take down the services that are provided where they are clearly causing offence.</p></speech>

They are educated in it but it does not stop the temptation, in particular where it is being driven home to people.

I have no question for Dr. Murphy.  My question was actually asked.  As far as I can discern we do not have statistics as to the scale of this in Ireland, except to say that it is very likely similar to other developed countries but it is fascinating.  It is something we need to return to and take action on.  It has certainly given me significant insight.  It has very serious consequences for the student and the system as a whole.  The integrity of the system is important and it is worth noting the work that QQI does.  Organisations are some of the unsung heroes of the system.  It has to stand up to rigours.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Conlon on deprivation index scores.  That allows us a more detailed and accurate insight into the socio-economic profile.  There has been some progress, albeit from a low base from 2015 in terms of access for students from the Travelling community.  Have we been meeting those targets?  No doubt there is also a target this year for students from a Traveller background of 60, up from 48 in 2019.  Are we likely to reach that target?  Some of the discussion is about the rebalancing of the tertiary sector.  I am conscious that in rebalancing it needs to stay proportionate.  Obviously we need to be careful in terms of how we continue to ensure that our high standards at higher education remain very high as well.</p><p>How do we strike that balance?  As has been already acknowledged, it is about the integration of apprenticeships and higher education and a flow-through in that regard.  </p><p> I have many questions with regard to apprenticeships, all of which I will not have time to pose today.  The cultural piece is enormous.  I am not sure if Mr. Brownlee or Dr. Trant have seen the video that was doing the rounds recently on social media, in particular around Cork.  It is a video of a man, Ken O'Connell, who is an electrician, pleading, as he does every year, with parents of leaving certificate students who are thinking of doing an apprenticeship to not discourage their children from doing an apprenticeship.  There is an enormous snobbery out there that we have to deal with.  That is one of the biggest pieces of work.  We need to transform the perception of apprenticeships.  They are diverse and they have the potential to be even more diverse.  It is perhaps an issue at home more so than at school.  It is an issue in some of the schools but others are very progressive in that regard.  To be fair to the Minister, he has the right attitude in regard to this area.  It is for all of us to continue to push apprenticeships.    </p><p> Aside from the cultural stuff, there are structural issues as well that we need to deal with.  I have previously raised with the witnesses that there are trades and apprenticeships in respect of which getting instructors is very challenging.  In the areas of plumbing, electrical and instrumentation it is very difficult for the training centres to recruit people from industry because they paid a lot better in industry.  There is a superstructure of public sector pay which one cannot go beyond so it is a complicated issue to address.  That feeds into the waiting lists and delays.  Currently, across large parts of the country one could be waiting two years to do a grade III electrical course.  That is holding people back a fair bit.</p><p> The issue of older people who might have a mortgage or are renting and their ability to change career and go down the apprenticeship route was mentioned.  The earn-as-you-learn model makes sense but that is challenging for those who have a mortgage, childcare costs and so on.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on grant structures and so on we could introduce in that regard.  </p><p> Senator O'Loughlin raised the point about listening to the business community.  Very often when one speaks about the business community in this context it is not IBEC but the man or woman with a van and two or three people working for them we are speaking about.  It is about Brownlee electrical or Trant plumbing.  That is challenging in its own way because it is diffuse and atomised.  It is not always easy to know exactly what the needs are.  A particular issue that is regularly raised with me - this may be more particular to the urban settings - is that an awful lot more employers would be attracted to apprenticeships if apprentices were on-the-job for four days and one day in the centre, as opposed to block release for six months or 12 weeks on two occasions both in terms of the businesses ability to continue their work but also in terms of the apprentice's income and his or her ability to go to Dublin, Waterford or wherever for the courses they need to attend, which is a challenge.  </p><p> There are some structural issues.  The cultural issue is the biggest issue but there are some structural issues that need to be addressed as well.  </p></speech>

On the data, I do not have the current position to hand but I will get back to him with a briefing of where we are on the travel, access and participation targets.  On the deprivation index data, we are seeing institutions start to use those data.  They go right down to almost street level such that we can see the communities students are coming from and the extent to which they access higher education and progress through.  Institutions can use those data to identify communities they might not have engaged with or were not aware of to find community leaders to engage with.  We are able to track students in terms of their life outcomes.  For students from a disadvantaged background, where they get into and through a higher education experience, at ten years post graduation, to use the Tory expression from the UK, things almost level up.</p><p>We can see that the impact on people's lives is really significant if we can get to them.  Use of the data to target students, communities and areas and to communicate to them, through the schools and elsewhere, the opportunities in further and higher education, as well as in apprenticeships, and to bring them into and through college is the real advantage.  The data are fairly new in that we only have them for three or four years but we are already seeing institutions starting to use them to identify what it means for them and how they can target progress more effectively.  My colleagues may want to comment on that as well.</p></speech>

We know the level of waiting lists are not acceptable.  We have made significant inroads in terms of addressing the waiting lists.  There were 8,300 waiting over six months at the end of last summer.  That is down to 5,608.  The 70% of people who were on the waiting lists at the end of the summer have now got back into training.  We are making inroads.  In a way, they are victims of the success in terms of more and more people wanting to be an apprentice.  Almost 7,000 joined the craft apprenticeship system last year.  They are joining that queue.  The Deputy is right that issues such as not being able to recruit instructors are limiting our ability to address that issue.</p> <p>  On the instructor question, we have got agreement not to automatically put them on the first point of the scale.  If they can prove they are on a higher level of income, we can bring them on at a salary closer to that level.  We all know it is not directly comparable but we can, at least, do that for them.  We are also working closely with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, to try to get people closer to retirement age who maybe do not want to be on site as much to think about the instructor route as a new career.  It is a big issue and it is inhibiting us but we are working on it.</p> <p>  On the cultural point, I mentioned the figure of 35,000.  Some 20,000 people who visited the CAO website went on to our bespoke apprenticeship options.  It is helping people to think about what their options are.  The proof will be in whether that leads to them actually taking up apprenticeships.</p></speech>

Our highest number in terms of registration is for electrical apprenticeships.  There is probably the greatest awareness of the opportunity that is there for careers in that area and the good quality of life and income that is possible.  The survey of apprentices and employers to be carried out later this year on issues such as what choices people are making and why will provide us with a lot of good information.  </p> <p>  On the cultural challenge, fundamentally parents just want what is best for their children.  I am from that generation where people were going to college for the first time in large numbers and there was a sense that this was the way to opportunity.  It is about moving that understanding and perception that there are many different ways to have a really good career and quality of life other than doing an academic level 8 degree.  It is about tackling that on many different levels.  Members of the committee have a really important role to play in terms of the messages they communicate.  Likewise, as organisations and agencies we have a similar role to play.  It is about having those conversations and using the platform of the CAO to get those conversations going around the table.  We are hearing anecdotally that young people want this choice, that they do not want to go the academic route.  There is an understanding that apprenticeship is just a way of learning.  It is just a different way of learning on the job and with college as well.  It is about getting that point across.  Our sense is - we have to get a much better handle on it - we are making progress.  Measuring and getting a better handle on that measurement is going to be an important job for us this year.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the feedback from employers about block release.  I was reminded recently by a large employer that back in the time-served phase, the 1980s and 1990s, most apprenticeships operated on a day-release basis.</p><p>In the 1990s, it moved to block release.  We hear that employers would much prefer this.  We have to be open to it.</p><p> Reviews of eight programmes, the big five and three of the wet trades, will happen this year.  We have done a wide-scale survey of employers who are involved in that to get their feedback.  From that feedback, we will get a good handle on what employers will want for the coming three to five years.  If we need to double the number of plumbers, carpenters or plasterers and we want employers to engage and take on people, we have to make sure the model will suit them.  It will, potentially, be a big transformation or disruption, but we are open to looking at that and making sure apprenticeships remain industry led and industry designed, which is a fundamental part of their continued success.</p></speech>

It is certainly better than if one is a student investing in one's education but having to fund it all oneself.  The salary for apprentices is in many cases a negotiation or an agreement between what an employer pays and, in the case of craft apprenticeships, matching it with a training allowance.  It is low.  It is approximately &euro;200 for year 1, but does go up.  Part of the consideration that has to go on is whether this is an investment in one's career and whether one can figure out a way of doing it.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that it is challenging for older apprentices and people who already have costs.  It is not an easy one.  There is reference in the action plan to look at some form of additional support for people who have financial requirements or need.  There are things such as the student assistance fund in academic further and higher education.  Could or should something be looked at for apprentices?  It is complex enough in terms of figuring out how one might manage it, means testing and how it would work.  As the apprentice population grows and as the profile of apprentices becomes more diverse, we will have to engage with it and look to see what could be done.</p></speech>

I welcome the submissions they have made to the committee.  The central function of the committee during these hearings is to try to come forward with a recommendation on the future funding model for third level.  I agree with Mr. Conlon.  We have done very well as a country in terms of the funding we have and how we use it to get such a high quality of third level.  I also suspect we are running out of road and we need to get a strategy and long-term policy in place for the future funding model.  That is especially so since we are trying to encourage so many people to get into third level.</p> <p>  I will start by asking Mr. Brownlee questions.  It appears to me there are three potential sources of funding for third level.  There is the State, student and employer, whether an immediate or future employer.  All of those three entities are beneficiaries of the third level education system.  In terms of the apprenticeship area, is there an opportunity for the State to look for a greater contribution from the employer part of that triumvirate for the purpose of funding third level?  Will that put too much pressure on the employer?</p></speech>

This has meant that the employers of the newer apprenticeship programmes are given equivalent levels of financial support to the ones who would have taken on craft apprentices.  Any disincentive, perceived or otherwise, on the part of employers that would discourage them from taking on apprentices would be a bad idea.</p><p>They already contribute through the national training fund, NTF, levy which then funds our apprenticeship provision and some higher and further education provision.  To ask them to go a step further than that would be a mistake. </p></speech>

The committee recently visited the Bishopstown campus of Munster Technological University.  Very impressive work is going on there in terms of training apprenticeships for the manufacture of medical devices such as hips and knees.  Obviously, there is a relationship with local pharmaceutical companies in the area.  Would Dr. Trant agree that we should not look for a greater financial contribution from employers?</p></speech>

It is a substantial amount.  We have not run out of it, as yet.  It was reviewed in 2019 and the amount went up a proportion.  The connection between what employers put in and what they get out is much clearer now and is getting stronger.  It needs to be kept under review but, for now, my sense is that we are getting a good contribution from employers and it is adequate.  Certainly, as the system grows and as employers and industry continue to benefit, it will probably need to be revisited on a fairly regular basis.</p></speech>

Everyone here recognises there is a high correlation between those who have high disposable income and the level of third level education they have attained.  I am not saying that everyone has a third level education has high disposable income but, certainly, there is a high correlation between those who do and the level of educational achievement they have reached.  What does Mr. Brownlee think of the recommendation in the Cassells report that if a student who goes into the workplace, does extremely well and earns a certain level of salary in their 40s, it would then be a requirement for them to pay back some of the fees?</p></speech>

Does one scare people away if one messes with the rates?  The Deputy mentioned State, student and employer.  All three benefit from the value of higher education.  The State and population benefits from the quality of life we have from having an educated population and all that goes with that, but also the taxes it pays.  We see a higher level of education and better life earnings and therefore, most likely, more tax paid.  People make a contribution relative to their capacity to contribute.  I would look at it from the other end.  The challenging piece is for those students who cannot afford to access higher education and that imbalance in the system.  We need to look more carefully at the supports in place for those who cannot access.  If they cannot access, they cannot make a contribution.</p></speech>

There is something there of the balance.  Those who can make a contribution should.  Whether that is the State, student or employer is a tricky seat on which to put me, but all benefit from it.  We have the evidence of that.  However, we need to look at how we target the supports and whether we could target them better to broaden the net.</p></speech>

The issue is the difficult question of where that funding should come from.  Does Dr. Murphy agree that it should just come from the Exchequer or should we look at other options, such as the third option in the Cassells report or seeking a greater contribution from employers?</p></speech>

I apologise.  We do not have the remit in that area and it would not be correct for me to comment on it.  However, I will come back to the employer contribution piece.  The employers contribute in significant ways to the development of new apprenticeships by identifying the needs and occupational profiles and working with the education providers to work up the curricula.  On the job, they do not just employ somebody for that period of time.  They provide mentoring, on-the-job training, support and, possibly, assessment.</p><p>There is quite a lot, therefore, for the employer to do beyond the financial side.  I am not implying that is all the Deputy is thinking of, but it is worth bringing that to his attention because it is part of the mix.</p></speech>

We have not seen evidence of a decline in quality but, when the core business is teaching and learning, other matters have to be squeezed.  I wonder about issues such as international engagement and some of the other good functions we provide in higher education.  Higher education is about research, teaching and learning, but it is also about Ireland's place in the world, our relationships with other nations, our involvement in research programmes and so on.  The capacity for some of those issues is being squeezed.  Institutions will always protect the student first and foremost - that is what they are there for - but it is the additional functions they would like to provide that they may not have the capacity for.</p></speech>

What are our guests' views on the idea of student loans?  There is an argument for an enhanced SUSI grant, maintaining some type of current funding model or something similar to what exists at the moment.  Will they tease out those two issues?</p></speech>

The grant system is difficult for those on the margins, given they either qualify or do not.  We need to examine the overall balance of that.  Student loans have not necessarily been successful in the UK, for example.  The increase in student fees there has had a fairly major impact on certain cohorts of students we might want to attract.  The number of mature students in the UK has fallen significantly because of the introduction of higher fees and the growth of student loans.  Certain cohorts of students are risk averse and will not want to take on a loan, so it can act as a barrier.  It needs to be thought about carefully.  I would prefer a system of fees and grants that is more equitably balanced towards supporting the students most in need.  I think that is the issue to examine.</p></speech>

If an institution develops student accommodation, there will be costs and it will have to maintain the loans and pay for them.  When students are not in the accommodation, that can be challenging.  We do not have any significant concerns.  The institutions are reasonably well funded and well prepared, although we have just been through a global pandemic and the impacts of that have yet to be felt.  The Government has been very supportive in one of the areas in which I am involved, namely, research.  It has made an investment to support research students in order that their careers will not have been impacted, to support research projects and to keep the endeavours in institutions going.  Supports have been put in place to keep institutions operational and providing services to students, but I do not know whether we have yet seen the overall impact of a global pandemic on the system.  That is something we will have to watch carefully.</p></speech>

They were formed only in 2013, the same year our organisation was, so they were still getting to grips with their role in the regions, what they needed to provide and the structures of their organisation.  When the two new apprenticeship calls came along, they were probably not at a sufficient stage of maturity to get the full potential value out of them, and that is why we need constantly to look at what they have to offer.  There are many opportunities in the green skills space and in construction.  One ETB has developed a scaffolding apprenticeship and there is talk in another ETB about creating a construction technician one.  There is a significant opportunity to support the ETBs to come forward with new proposals regarding apprenticeships.</p></speech>

There is also a follow-on level 8 cybersecurity apprenticeship in development, which will be a really good progression path.  It is being developed in the mid-west.  It very much emerged from the crisis that happened at the HSE earlier in the pandemic and in light of the awareness that Ireland would need to gear up significantly in the area of cybersecurity, both public and private.  It is due to come on stream later this year.  The ETB is working hard on it and there will be a really good pathway into it for people who have come through the level 6 course, if that is something they wish to do.

Work is being done - it is close to being finalised - to examine what we have, what the demand and the gap will be and what we will need to do to fill it.  There were more than 8,600 registrations last year, the majority of which, or almost 7,000, were in construction.  The pipeline is strong and growing and is at its highest level since 2009.

I am grateful for their contributions and the submissions as well.  I might go through a couple of questions, which I will direct to each of the groups for a response.</p> <p>  The first question is for Mr. Conlon and the HEA.  We are seeing a significant increase in the number of students at third level, which is placing a big demand on services.  I hope it has increased access as well.  Reference was made in the submission to lifelong learning.  We are below the EU average when it comes to lifelong learning.  I know that is not just due to the HEA, as there are many players within this space.  How can the future model of increased funding support lifelong learning?  How does the HEA foresee working with HEIs to improve that?</p> <p>  Could Mr. Conlon tell me how many students have come through PATH?  I was very interested to hear about those two programmes and the deprivation index scores.  Is that recent funding?  Do we have any statistics on students who have come through the programmes?</p> <p>  We have met Mr. Brownlee from SOLAS several times.  It is fantastic to hear about the number of people coming through to the CAO website.  It is phenomenal that we are seeing the addition to the CAO form this year.  Every chance I get to speak to students, I talk to about how the CAO is not solely about the traditional routes into college but that when they look at the CAO form now there is a choice for further and higher education.  At the weekend, I was speaking to a young student who is looking at a pre-nursing course perhaps, instead of going straight into nursing, which shows there are choices in that regard.  Such an approach drives choice.</p> <p>  How do we encourage employers?  Mr. Brownlee spoke a bit on this too.  I am talking especially about micro enterprises and sole traders.  How do we engage with that group in particular?  I am not talking about the likes of ESB Networks or Electric Ireland, for example.  Dr. Trant referred to the significant interest in electrical apprenticeships.  How do we engage with micro enterprises, for example, in the region I am from, Roscommon and east Galway, where we are dealing with a lot more supply companies?  In addition, they do not have time.  They are up the walls.  How do we make it easier for them?  How do we make better use of the national training fund?  Do the witnesses have any suggestions in that regard?</p> <p>  It was very nice to meet Dr. Trant.  Her contributions were very informative.  She referred to the 62 training programmes we have at the moment.  I understand that in the past year, 18 more training programmes were to come on stream.  It was mentioned that it is planned to have 70 by the end of this year.  Could she give me a timeline for the remainder?  Some very interesting programmes were mentioned, such as farm management and equestrian studies.  That is of particular interest for me with Mountbellew Agricultural College and linking in with the technological universities.  It would be of interest to farmers.  Farm relief schemes could help older farmers to bring in some of the students coming through such apprenticeship programmes.  I would be interested in looking at the possibility that they could also support a number of farmers in a particular region.</p> <p>  Dr. Trant also mentioned 8,300 employers.  That is fantastic altogether.  I do not know if she has anything to add to what Mr. Brownlee has said, but this question might be more for her.  It relates to the registration of 10,000 apprenticeships per year.  Are we roughly at around 8,000 at the moment?  I know registrations were ramped up this year and last year.  Perhaps I do not understand it, but how are the planned 10,000 apprenticeships broken down between employers that want to take on apprentices, colleges that bring people in and placements?</p> <p>  I apologise as I do not have much to ask of Dr. Murphy from QQI, but if she would like to add anything to those points, she is very welcome to do so.  I will start with Mr. Conlon, then Mr. Brownlee and Dr. Trant.</p></speech>

In 2019-2020, there were five students from disadvantaged areas to every ten students from more affluent areas.  These are perhaps the challenges first and then I might talk about progress.  Some 10% of the student population came from disadvantaged areas compared to 19% from more affluent areas.  Only 51 students in the country come from extremely disadvantaged backgrounds.  In courses with high points, such as medicine, 5% of new entrants come from disadvantaged areas.  We can see from the deprivation index scores, DIS, data where students are coming from.</p></speech>

We have a green skills initiative for the hospitality industry, 50 Shades Greener.  Retrofitting has been rolled out at Mount Lucas and in Waterford and Wexford.  We have courses on remote working and leadership management supervision digital skills.  They are the type of skills that every micro enterprise is going to need to take the next step.</p></speech>

The grant for &euro;2,000 has been in place for two years and &euro;1,000 comes in after six months.  Have we seen a difference in the take-up by micro employers?  The issue for me is that they are coming into a company where the micro employer does not have the time to skill the person up and he or she cannot afford them to be gone for two days for training.  I know we are looking at measures and ways to manage that.  Have we seen a difference in the past two years since the incentive was introduced?  I do not know if the incentive alone is enough.</p></speech>

Private colleges that provide apprenticeship training is a recent development.  Where does Dr. Trant see that in the context of the future decentralisation of the craft model for apprenticeships?  Will she speak to the role of private colleges in that?</p> <p>  I will also ask Mr. Conlon about accommodation.  Probably the biggest barrier to third-level education for students outside the large towns is affording accommodation.  I was in Mayo yesterday and met members of the county council.  There are 24 places for rent in Mayo.  I am very concerned that we have these technological universities we have waited so long for, which have enormous potential, but we will not have accommodation.  We speak about the need for a framework for independent borrowing for the technological sector absolutely without question.  However, when we look at the challenges facing the universities, which have the borrowing power, we clearly see that it is not a silver bullet for delivering affordable accommodation.  What do we need to do in order for that to be able to work?  We need to address in advance the panacea of technological universities having the ability to borrow.</p></speech>

There has been significant investment in the infrastructure, including workshops in the public system, in education and training boards and in technological universities.  The intention for now is to maintain investment in that infrastructure.  That is not to say that over time there may not be other partnerships that develop on the education and training side, but our big challenge is to develop a process to migrate the craft apprenticeships into the system in a way that builds on what has already been invested and increases that provision within the public system for now.</p></speech>

I would not like to see the money following the private institutions when public institutions are starved of funding, especially capital funding.  Thanks for that.  On the accommodation question-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.317" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Conlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030100002#BB01400"><p>I was asking if Dr. Trant might take that one too.  It is a tricky one.  Higher education institutions are in the business of the provision of education and research.  To some extent, they expand their enterprise into things such as student accommodation or sports provision and so on.  They are a very tricky balancing act and very risky investments because they are long term.  Students are also very hard on student accommodation.  To provide and maintain it and so on comes at a cost.</p> <p>  We talked earlier about the scale and capacity of the technological universities.  They have a lot to deliver in respect of their requirements under the legislation in the short to near term.  The way in which they take on other endeavours, beyond the core of getting the business right, will need careful consideration.  We are in the process of merging two or three institutions at various locations nationally into technological universities.  Should we take on large-scale capital projects on top of that?  If I was to think about how we would assist or work with institutions in that space, they will need external advice and assistance in taking on major capital projects that include going to market tenders.  We know that building costs, for example, are 30% higher at present across the economy.  Institutions need advice and assistance.  They might not necessarily have the capacity.  Even if the ability to borrow was made available, would they take it on?</p></speech>

We talk about access but what if there is no affordable accommodation for students to be able to live?  If we look at a county such as Mayo, for somebody living in Belmullet or Blacksod it is more than an hour to travel to the university each day and it is not feasible.  Someone would need student accommodation beside or near the Mayo campus.  We do not want people travelling all the time when there is climate change and all that.  We need to look at it now and we need to make sure that it is part of the future funding model.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

It is also about the assist to some institutions because, as I said, they need to very carefully consider the market and the economic viability of accommodation.  Of course, we want to provide it at the lowest possible cost to students, which is also part the challenge, but if the project does not wash its own face, for want of a better expression, then it creates a problem further down the line for institutions.  The investments need to be considered very carefully.  External expertise and advice will be very important to institutions in that regard.  That is perhaps where we can step up and assist by providing them with the advice.</p></speech>

One of the issues that has arisen in recent years is third-level institutions will very often set up a company at arm's length to deliver accommodation but that means they cannot cross-finance it when the company runs into financial difficulties.  What ends up happening is rents go up, sometimes very significantly.</p> <p>  I have three fairly brief questions on the apprenticeship side of things.  It was raised with me recently whether there was a course on Irish Sign Language.  Is that something that is offered through apprenticeships?  I am not sure where that operates.</p> <p>  It was suggested to me by one employer that an element of running a business-type training would be useful to those in third- and fourth-year courses, including a basic overview of pricing, overheads, tax, VAT registration and insurance.</p> <p>  I will touch on one of the cost issues.  I take the point about the training fee, and I am not quite sure of the solution to this, but some of the exam fees are significant.  It costs &euro;1,750 for a phase 4 electrical instrumentation exam and &euro;1,000 for phase 6.  That is ultimately a fairly lucrative career, but if apprentices do not have it they do not have it.  It also adds a fair bit of value for the employer.  I do not know whether there are certain circumstances where a very profitable employer could pay that and, where that is not the case, perhaps SOLAS could.  It is a big cost up front.  There are credit union loans and so on but almost &euro;2,000 for an exam is a big fee.</p></speech>

However, further education courses are available.  It might be more suitable for a traineeship where there is a work-based element but it is supported and hosted by an education institution of some sort.  We can get a little more detail on what is available.</p></speech>

We were looking at the idea of adding on a module or a top-up on running their own businesses that apprentices could access just before the pandemic hit, and then surviving and keeping the system going took over.  It is something we would very much like to come back to.  The benefit of the pandemic and looking at online provision is to consider drawing on something such as e-college and the online system to build and develop a module that apprentices could decide to take on and would get student support for online.  It could be something they build on and add to their apprenticeship qualification.</p><p>It is definitely something we want, because many apprentices go into running their own business and to get that more formal assistance would be very helpful to them.</p><p> On the various apprenticeships and the cost for phase 4 and phase 6, it is not official, but there are employers who help out apprentices where there is a financial challenge but, obviously, that is not possible.  We spoke about micro-enterprises earlier and that is not something an employer can always do.  It can be a real challenge.  There is reference in the action plan for apprenticeship to look at some form of bursary for apprentices in particular situations.  We could potentially look at challenges such as that, where there is some form of financial support available for apprentices who are genuinely struggling, due to whatever their life circumstances are, to continue and complete their apprenticeship.  However, it is something that we do not have at the moment, but certainly something that we will want to look at. </p></speech>

In terms of higher education, there is both formal and informal provision.  There is a particular course nationally.  It goes to some of conversations we were having earlier and I will get to the point in a second.  Indeed, Senator Dolan raised a point about lifelong learning as well.  To provide a high-quality provision, it is by nature specialised and provided in one location, because all of the expertise is in the right place.  However, that of course does not serve a student population around the country very well.  How do they engage in a programme that is provided in one institution and one place?  It goes to the point about lifelong learning and the micro-credentials that we started to discuss and how the funding model might follow that.</p> <p>  The Deputy made the point earlier with the example of an older learner who wants to re-engage.  They cannot re-engage full time or formally because they have work, life and a mortgage and all kinds of responsibilities.  One of the areas we started to discuss was around micro-credentials and the way in which the funding model would follow that.  At the moment, the funding model very much follows a student who enters further or higher education for a period of time in their lives and it funds them, the grant follows that and that all works.  What if one wants to dip in and out and does a bit here and there?  What if one wants to do some ISL in Tralee or Wexford or wherever?  How can one engage with an institution flexibly?  We are at a very interesting time with the use of digital and online tools and the digital divide is starting to be overcome.  We are delivering education in new and inventive ways.  However, the student-supported funding model does not necessary follow that.  That will be very complex to work through and to work out.  That is the big opportunity in terms of the funding model.  On micro-credentials, and Dr. Murray kicked me under the table over it, that will be very complicated in terms of qualification recognition and how to knit it all together and how it all comes to form a degree in time.  That is the opportunity, both in terms of ISL provision and doing it in a more flexible, open way to engage with more students in their communities in different ways.  Sorry, I did not want to ramble on that, but my broadcast is there is an opportunity to look at how the funding model can follow the student in a more flexible way than has been the case.</p></speech>

I will be sharing the time allocated to VBI with Mr. O'Boyle.  First, we would like to acknowledge and commend the members of the committee on the work undertaken on this important legislation at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  We very much welcome the opportunity to represent the interests of the 200,000 people around the country who use vaping products and the 300 plus retailers and newsagents, who each day are responsible for guiding, supporting and advising adult smokers in their communities on this less harmful alternative to help achieve a tobacco-free Ireland.</p> <p>  In 2013, the Department of Health set an ambitious goal of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025, aiming to achieve a smoking prevalence rate of 5% or lower.  Despite the efforts of many, the HSE acknowledged in its report of 2018, The State of Tobacco Control in Ireland, that this goal will not be achieved until 2052.  As members know, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Healthy Ireland survey of 2021 found that the smoking rate has actually increased for the first time in many years, and with a current smoking rate of 18%, we are nowhere near reaching the goal.</p> <p>  Clearly, to get us back on the path towards achieving this goal, we need a new approach, and vaping should be a central component within that.  Vaping has a vital place in this equation.  Indeed, the Healthy Ireland survey of 2019 showed that compared to nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, almost four times as many successful quit attempts were attributed to vaping.  While 10% of those who successfully quit used NRT, 38% used vaping.</p> <p>  In our written submission to this committee, Vape Business Ireland provided samples of the expert-led evidence which shows that vaping is significantly less risky than smoking.  The most important of those was the Public Health England evidence review of 2015, which was carried out by experts from King's College London and Queen Mary University of London, showed that vaping products are around 95% less harmful than smoking.  Public Health England has consistently maintained this position in its annual evidence updates, and its findings have been backed by key health experts and groups, including the Royal College of Physicians and leading anti-tobacco NGOs such as Action on Smoking and Health, ASH, and Cancer Research UK to name but a few.</p> <p>  Driven by our responsible approach to vape usage and tobacco harm reduction, Vape Business Ireland particularly welcomes what we view as the most critical part of the Bill, that being the proposed ban on the sale of vaping products to persons under the age of 18 years.  This is something we have urged the Government to introduce since 2015, to protect young people and to create a controlled environment where vaping products are available for adult Irish smokers looking to switch to a less harmful alternative.  In fact, we have stringent rules in place for membership of the association and we also have a code of conduct that is fully focused on prohibiting the sale of vape products to under-18s.  Mr. O'Boyle will elaborate on this shortly as someone who has first-hand experience of applying for membership and the standards VBI has set for the retail sector.</p> <p>  It should be noted that we use the exact same technology as supermarkets to prevent the underage sale of alcohol, despite no official under-18s ban in place in the State.  We take our self-imposed obligations seriously and do not want young people using these products, which is why we urge the committee to make this law as soon as possible.  It should also be recognised that the licensing system in the Bill will be hugely beneficial in creating a database of responsible licensed sellers and we support appropriate sanctions for those who do not meet its requirements.</p> <p>  On youth access research in Ireland, the most recent study which perhaps has not yet been raised with the committee is the WHO-supported Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children, HBSC, report released in 2021.  It showed that smoking among school-aged children had plummeted from 22.6% in 1998 to just 5.3% in 2018.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department of Health Healthy Ireland Survey 2021 showed that less than 1% of "never smokers" use vaping.  This is a survey of 7,500 people aged 15 years or above.  In a recent response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health confirmed this, saying the number of vapers remains low and "primarily consists of current and former smokers".  While the evidence does not point to a huge vaping problem in Ireland, we need to urgently ban underage sales while ensuring adult smokers have an alternative that works.</p><p> The fact is that the data indicate that youth uptake of vaping remains low.  Although any youth uptake of these and other products is of concern, the Healthy Ireland Survey 2021 found that regular use among young people remains in line with the national average of 4%.  It also showed that virtually no "never smokers" currently vape.  This is not a gateway into smoking; it is the most effective tool for helping smokers to quit for good.</p><p> Part of a responsible approach to regulation and business practice alike is that it is proportionate and strikes a balance between different but sometimes compatible interests that are focused on achieving similar objectives.  For this reason, VBI opposes an overly limiting ban on flavourings in vaping products.  It is important we recognise that flavours in NRT and vaping products play a vital role in helping adult smokers to quit.  We fully agree with the views expressed by Department of Health officials who appeared before the committee in November 2021 and who said we have to "strike that balance" when it comes to flavours.  VBI argues that we must get the balance right for the 200,000 people who depend on vaping products to prevent them from lapsing back into smoking and the 700,000 smokers who might be considering vaping as a tool to help them move away from smoking.  Those who have quit smoking do not always want to taste tobacco flavours.  Adults like flavours, and flavourings make up things adults consume such as caffeine drinks, alcohol, foods, etc.  That is why NRT products also have flavourings.</p><p> This brings us back to the beginning of my remarks.  We are here to face the reality of the specifics of Irish smokers and the Irish vaping market.  The facts are clear: vapers in Ireland are overwhelmingly current and ex-smokers, and the majority of them began vaping in order to quit and to stay off smoking.  Furthermore, backing up the Department of Health's Healthy Ireland survey year on year, the Health Research Board's 2019-20 Irish National Drug and Alcohol Survey found that more than 95% of Ireland's vapers are former or current smokers.  Clearly, vaping is being used by those for whom it is intended, namely smokers who want to quit and ex-smokers who never want to go back.  Vaping works, and that is why it is vital we support adult smokers in making the switch while also taking the necessary steps to ensure that young people never access a product that is not intended for them.</p><p> VBI wishes to highlight that vaping has been strongly regulated by the second EU tobacco products directive since 2016.  It is important to compare like with like and focus on the experience of vapers in the UK and the EU.  Vaping is largely unregulated in the United States, so comparing the United States with the UK or the EU is not a like-for-like comparison.  In the United States these products contain three times more nicotine and are unlimited in volume, and ingredients are not regulated.  Drawing conclusions from studies conducted outside the European Union and seeking to apply them to the Irish scenario fails to reflect the stringent EU and Irish regulatory framework controlling the manufacture and marketing of vaping products.</p><p> Under existing regulations, health warnings that advise consumers that vaping products contain nicotine are mandatory.  The regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for vaping products and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers.  The regulations require vaping product manufacturers and importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products they place on the Irish market.  If a manufacturer, importer or distributor has reason to believe a product is not safe, it is required by law to notify the Health Service Executive.</p><p> A crucial part of helping smokers to give up smoking is advertising and awareness raising.  Vaping product advertisements are subject heavily to EU regulation under the aforementioned directive.</p><p>In Ireland the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland's code of standards for advertising and marketing communications includes strict rules on the marketing of vaping products to consumers, including those who are under the age of 18.  Furthermore, no medium can be used to advertise vaping products if more than 25% of its audience is under the age of 18.</p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to outline the experience of Estonia as a case study of a country that got it wrong when it implemented a ban on vaping flavours.  By limiting choice, the country adversely impacted smoking cessation rates and a black market of unregulated and unsafe products prospered.  In response to this dramatic shift, Estonia has actually softened its regulations now to allow more flavours for adults looking for a less harmful alternative to smoking.  Continuing to looking at this issue through an EU-wide lens, I would also like to highlight current and future developments.  Just last month, the European Parliament supported a Beating Cancer report which calls for harm reduction and the explicit recognition of electronic cigarettes as a product that allows users to progressively quit smoking and that should be regulated differently from cigarettes.  Separately, work on amending the EU tobacco products directive is expected to advance soon.  VPI would argue that Irish legislators should not pre-empt this process but should wait for the outcome of this work before making decisions that could potentially limit the options of smokers looking for an alternative.</p><p> As the EU moves towards recognising the value of vaping products in tobacco harm reduction, we have already seen support for vaping as a less harmful alternative to smoking from major public health authorities and health bodies across the UK and worldwide.  Looking at the UK, ASH UK, Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation have looked at the evidence and taken a clear position identifying and advocating vaping as a harm reduction tool.  Indeed, in June 2021, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, which advises healthcare professionals in the UK, updated its guidance to general practitioners on smoking cessation.  NICE finds that combined with behavioural support, the options of either a combination of short and long-acting nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, or nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are more likely to result in people successfully stopping smoking, and recommends that general practitioners should provide patients with guidance about e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. </p><p> Cochrane is held as the gold standard among academics, and its review of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation found that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are 70% more effective in supporting smokers to successfully quit than NRT products.  This backs up the aforementioned evidence from successive Healthy Ireland reports which showed that vaping has been far more effective than NRT in helping smokers to quit.  Smoking rates fall as the rate of vaping increases.  One example of this is seen in the European Commission&rsquo;s Eurobarometer findings which showed that Ireland&rsquo;s smoking rate was 5% below the European average, while Ireland&rsquo;s vaping rate was 5% above the European average.  Already, vaping is making a difference in the State and with the right approach it could help far more smokers to quit.  </p><p> We have a real-life example of how this can be achieved by looking at the UK.  The British health authorities have parsed the evidence and they have been both ambitious and decisive on how vaping can help smokers quit.  The NHS is working on proposals that could see England be the first country in the world to prescribe medicinally licensed vaping products to help reduce smoking rates.  The UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Mr. Sajid Javid, M.P., was recently quoted as saying that they would unveil a White Paper this spring that is to include a "vaping revolution".  The continuous downward trajectory of smoking rates in the UK is in no small part testament to the pragmatic approach taken towards vaping and understanding the integral role vaping products can play in delivering on their tobacco reduction strategy.  We are seeing a similarly progressive approach being adopted by other countries such as New Zealand, where vaping is a critical part of the country&rsquo;s plans to dramatically decrease their smoking rates.  We firmly contend that the adoption of a similar approach and treatment of vaping as a harm reduction solution would have a significant impact in helping Ireland reach its Tobacco Free Ireland objectives.  </p><p> In the context of this Bill, we must not continue to ignore the growing and credible body of evidence supporting vaping as a less harmful alternative to smoking.</p><p>While it is essential that we do everything we can to prevent youth access to vaping products, we must also ensure that we find the right balance in protecting the 200,000 vapers right across Ireland from relapsing.  We must also ensure that all options remain open and accessible to those adult smokers who are currently trying to move away from smoking.</p><p> I will hand over to Eoin O'Boyle, who will give the committee his front-line perspective on how businesses like his have helped adult smokers with less harmful alternatives across the country.  I thank committee members for their time and I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin O'Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#F00200"><p>I run a small, independent vape shop, OB Vape, in Southgate Shopping Centre, Drogheda, County Meath.  I set up my business three years ago after working for another vape shop, where I was inspired by the transformative power of vaping in the lives of smokers who had failed to quit by other means.  I am enormously grateful for the opportunity to outline to the committee my experience in providing vaping as a smoking cessation tool and to make the case for why Ireland needs to take a supportive and proportionate regulatory stance on vaping, so that all the advances in smoking cessation are not undone.</p> <p>  As a retailer, I am committed to providing a bespoke "quit smoking" service for adult smokers who have failed to do so while utilising the methods currently recommended by Irish health authorities.  When a new customer walks into my retail shop, I conduct an initial consultation of between 30 and 40 minutes, during which I find out about their smoking habits and, accordingly, I tailor my advice and recommendations to them.  The choice and selection of starter kits for those making the switch from smoking to vaping are important.  The addiction to smoking is different for every smoker and my on-the-ground experience means I can match the product to the smoker seeking to quit.</p> <p>  I find that when smokers initially switch to vaping, they will typically use tobacco flavour.  However, as their taste buds recover and as they move away from smoking completely, they often do not want to continue using tobacco flavour and tend to seek alternative options, such as fruit or mint.  In the context of any debate around flavours, it is important to acknowledge and understand that adult former smokers need flavours and that their preferences change over time.  This need for flavoured options also helps to explain why flavoured Nicorette lozenges are so popular for those who go down the NRT route, just as it explains why our health authorities provide information about flavoured NRT products.  For those looking to get off tobacco, flavours matter enormously.  One example of this importance was shown in a major Europe-wide study recently conducted by the European Tobacco Harm Reduction Advocates group, which found that 94.6% of current vapers use non-tobacco flavours.  Members will have noticed during a previous committee session that the Department of Health official acknowledged that &ldquo;flavours may be useful&rdquo; in helping smokers to quit.  We welcome that acknowledgement but, with the greatest of respect, those like me who work in this sector and speak to vapers every day know there is no doubt that flavours are a crucial part of what helps smokers to quit.</p> <p>  In that same spirit, let me briefly acquaint the committee with a customer of mine who is in her 30s and smoked cigarettes for 17 years.  She found that, despite multiple attempts, she could not quit smoking until she engaged with my service.  She told me that the experience my business offered made her feel cared for, and that we understood her addiction and worked continuously with her to help her quit.  She has not smoked for three years at this point and is much healthier and more active.  She goes to cross-fit classes, where she has the same heart rate as those who had never smoked.  She is now more energised and invests more in her overall health and well-being.  This story and thousands more underline the importance of having vaping available as a flexible smoking cessation tool, including the role of flavours.</p> <p>  I stress that nobody under the age of 18 should ever vape.  I am, as are all my fellow members of VBI, fully committed to ensuring that vaping remains a smoking cessation and harm reduction tool for adults only.  This means that, collectively, we adopt a blanket opposition to the sale and marketing of vaping products to those under 18.  In that context, VBI members and I personally subscribe to our code of conduct and agree that advertisement of vaping products should not involve flavour names or descriptions that are associated with youth culture.  Flavours are an important incentive for adult smokers seeking to quit but any attempt to exclusively target children through enticing advertisements is something to which VBI members are strongly opposed.</p> <p>  We also, even in the absence of such legislation, are committed to verifying the ages of our customers and selling only to those over 18.  VBI members commit to proper age verification training for all their staff.  In my shop, we check ID for everyone who crosses the threshold of the premises and appears to be under the age of 25, and we ask anyone under the age of 18 to leave.  I do not want any minors browsing my products, let alone buying any of them.  In my case, approximately 20% of my sales are conducted online, and these sales are overwhelmingly to existing local customers.</p><p>In my case, approximately 20% of my sales are conducted online.  These sales are overwhelmingly to existing local customers.  Even so, I am exploring with my VBI colleagues the adoption of age verification mechanisms for online sales that our counterparts in the UK have recently rolled out. </p><p> We are committed to driving the best standards in our business practices and the right regulatory framework will support us in our efforts.  We want to work with all stakeholders to make the underage sales ban a success, and to ensure that nobody under the age of 18 ever accesses these products. </p><p> In conclusion, I would like to stress that there is a balance of risks for me as a trader, just as there is for the committee in deciding on this legislation.  I am not always in a position, as a small retailer, to get exactly what I want in a global and digital marketplace.  Proportionate regulation will be a valuable tool in my negotiations with suppliers in seeking to make sure that my products not only meet the needs of my adult customers, but are also branded as such.  VBI members are keen to work with legislators to inform them of the sector&rsquo;s experience and to help them get the balance of response right.  Regulation and supportive Government policy can help responsible Irish vape shops in aiding smokers to quit, while also helping to ensure that young people do not access a product that is not meant for them.  Regulation also must not be excessive.  This would keep smokers smoking, facing proven health risks and unfortunately facing premature death.</p><p> Our organisation is proud of the role that small vaping retailers, such as mine, play every day in helping smokers to transition to far less harmful products.  With the right approach from the Government, we can play an even larger role in helping to make a tobacco-free Ireland a reality. </p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity to contribute.  I look forward to answering any questions the members may have.  </p></speech>

However, forgive me for suggesting that approximately 95% of the vape shops in the country clearly either do not want to or fail to meet VBI&rsquo;s criteria because they are not members of the organisation.  I do not doubt the Mr. Dunne's integrity and the way he goes about his business, but he is representing a small minority of the vape shops in this country.  How would he respond to that?</p></speech>

There is obviously an opportunity for VBI to do a better job of recruiting members.  However, one of the issues we face in this State is that there is a reasonably pessimistic view from both retailers and the public around vaping as whole.  If we were to see that change, and if we were to see public health getting behind vaping, as is done in the UK, we would see a very different picture here.  There is an opportunity to encourage retailers to do the right thing and to join a retail group but that is always a challenge.  It is especially a challenge at the moment, when retailers are struggling to keep their heads above water, having gone through a two-year adverse trading period.  People are looking at how they spend their money.  Obviously, there is a cost to being involved in an association.</p></speech>

Just like caffeine and other addictive substances it is about what comes with nicotine.  With cigarettes it is not nicotine that kills.  It is nicotine that addicts.  It is the tar and carcinogenics that kill.  We have shown that vaping is up to 95% safer than smoking.  This is where the balance of risk comes in.  My mother was a smoker.  She was addicted for 30 years.  She could not quit no matter what she did.  She loved the nicotine.  She did not want to give up.  She gave up for health reasons.  When I opened the shop I gave my mother a vape and she successfully quit.  Now she vapes but not that much.  She knows it is there in case she has a craving for a cigarette.  This is what I have seen every day over the past three years.</p></speech>

With regard to the figures for teenagers and e-cigarettes, my understanding is that a 2015 study showed that 23% of teenagers used e-cigarettes whereas a study in 2019 showed it was 37%.  Teenagers who use e-cigarettes are five times more likely to move on to smoking cigarettes.</p><p>How do the witnesses view the challenge in dealing with that?  How can the legislation help to deal with that trend?  There is a huge increase in the number of teenagers who are moving to electronic cigarettes.  </p></speech>

Therefore, technically, a 12-year-old can legally buy vaping products in a shop.  That is the first thing we need to look at.</p> <p>  Second, if you look closely at those data, you will find that only approximately 4.6% of young people use the product on a regular basis.  The majority of those smoked previously.  The national average is approximately 4%.  That figure is therefore in line with the national average.

We are also moving in that the number of young people smoking has gone up again.  There is a connection between the two.  While Mr. Dunne is talking about legislation, something is still driving it in terms of making it attractive for young people to move to electronic cigarettes.  As well as not being able to sell to under-18s, what other restrictions does Mr. Dunne believe need to be put in place in relation to advertising?</p></speech>

One of the one of the issues is that the vast majority of people who use vaping products, not only here in the State, but around the world, are between the ages of 30 and 55.  Unfortunately, in the EU, under the tobacco products directive, advertising is extremely restricted in respect of the messaging we can use.  I believe that is confusing for smokers.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening statement, there is an opportunity for the Government to look at something similar to what the New Zealand Government has done.  It has come out with specific, scientific-based switching messages.  If all of the vaping industry in Ireland was allowed to use only that specific messaging, that would go a long way towards encouraging smokers to make that choice.  It would give them the confidence to know that vaping is a better thing to do than smoking.  When it comes down to it, we are all looking for the same thing.  We are all looking to encourage smokers to either quit, which is optimal, or to do something that is less harmful.</p> <p>  When we look closely at those smoking rates, we find that the majority of the increase was between the ages of 25 and 34, at 21%.  Regular use was the highest amongst 35- to 49-year-olds, at 6.7%.  It is important that we restrict products to young people.  We are currently not doing that.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the US market is very different than the market here in Ireland or the EU.  It is a currently unregulated market.</p> <p>  I have looked at a study that just came up in November by five British universities.  They looked at 58 studies of 500,000 young people aged under 18 in the UK, Canada and the US.  Professor Caitlin Notley, from the University of East Anglia's Norwich medical school, stated there is a lot of concern that young people might start vaping because they are attracted to e-liquid flavours, which could potentially lead to them smoking and that they wanted to find out more.  Now what they found-----</p></speech>

That is now showing up in studies.  There is also a study on eye conditions, which looks at people who suffer from eye problems.  There are a higher number of people with difficulties with their eyesight, as a result of using electronic cigarettes.  A whole range of studies show that electronic cigarettes can be harmful, not to everyone, but to a certain group of people, in a number of different areas.  Is it not therefore appropriate that there should be health warnings in relation to the use of electronic cigarettes?</p></speech>

If one actually reads those studies, and read down to the final conclusions, the studies do not actually prove that electronic cigarettes cause those.

Many areas have been covered.</p> <p>  In relation to the flavourings, is it the witnesses&rsquo; contention that basically the flavouring is required, or is certainly advantageous, to weaning people off cigarettes?  For active smokers who now wish to give up smoking, flavours will allow that process to be more likely to happen, or they would encourage to people giving up smoking; is that their contention?</p></speech>

It is important to understand the journey that smokers make from the time they make the decision to no longer smoke and to do something different.  Over the first couple of weeks, they will probably start with a tobacco flavour, because that is what they are used to tasting.  However, it is important to note, and vapers tell me this all this time, that they want to differentiate themselves from being a smoker.  By vaping a tobacco flavour, all they are doing is reminding themselves every single time they use the device that they are a smoker.  When they use flavours - and they use many different flavours at different times of the day - they are not constantly being reminded of that.  It takes them away from being a smoker to being a vaper.  It is a very different mindset.</p></speech>

Immediately, they saw an increase in smoking rates.  We need to be very careful about how we do these things.</p></speech>

I polled many of my different customers.  I asked them what impact they thought it would have if they were no longer able to get flavours.  Some of them had been vaping for some time.  They said that they would have eventually just weaned themselves off.  Some who are just starting their vaping journey said that they would not be able to do this, if they were vaping a tobacco flavour.  They would therefore more than likely end up back on cigarettes.  It is important to be aware that a huge number of adult vapers in Ireland use flavours and rely on flavours to ensure that they stay off tobacco, or that their journey from smoking to vaping is a successful one.</p></speech>

We did not get to the conclusions, but what they found is that flavours are an important aspect of why vapers use the products.  They found no evidence that flavours attract young people to go on to smoking.  They found that no adverse effects or harm were caused by using e-liquid vaping products.  The study was in collaboration with researchers at University College London, the University of Bristol and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust.  That was published in November 2021 and it looked at 500,000 young people.</p></speech>

I get to know nearly every single one of my customers on a name basis.  That is why the success rate of people quitting smoking with vaping in my shop is so high.  In the past six months, I cannot think of anyone I spoke to who never smoked in the first place.  I cannot understand why a person would start vaping if he or she had never smoked.  Even the Healthy Ireland study this year showed that only 1% of those who vape were never smokers, which is a tiny proportion of the amount of vapers.</p></speech>

The important point for me is to establish evidence to show that, first, e-cigarettes are not a step away from smoking in the ordinary way and, second, that they are safe products which do not cause harm.  It has been stated that no product is guaranteed to be harmless, but insofar as we can establish, we need to be able to find out whether we are moving in the right direction.  We must do anything we can to encourage people to stop smoking cigarettes.  Such an approach should and could be used.  That is positive.  It is a good thing.  The evidence would appear to be in favour of e-cigarettes.  Are we absolutely certain, insofar as we can, that e-cigarettes discourage people from smoking tobacco and that they cause less damage to health than cigarettes?</p></speech>

Vaping rates are not increasing in any jurisdiction, even in the US where they claim there is a youth vaping epidemic.  If youth vaping was a thing, then the smoking rate would be ticking back up, and it is not.  The only reason it ticked back up in that specific time period was that vape shops in the Republic, and also in the UK where they saw the same thing happening, were closed and that education piece was taken away from smokers.  As soon as the vape shops opened back up, the number of people smoking went back down again.</p></speech>

Once people get their tastebuds back and they get to know the health benefits of vaping, they do not want to smoke.  The lady I mentioned in my opening statement suffered from tonsillitis three to four times a year as a result of smoking, and as soon as she started vaping, that went away.  She has not had tonsillitis since.  She said she would never smoke a cigarette again, that she could not do that.  It is overwhelming, especially when you are on the ground and you see it every single day.  There is a true difference, health-wise and financially.  Not only does it improve your health, but it improves other aspects of your life too.  Smokers might not start in a gym or eat as healthily as they could because they think they are already unhealthy due to smoking, but once they start vaping, feel their lung capacity improving and no longer wake up coughing every morning, they start to acknowledge that they could become healthier in other aspects of their life.  Every day, I see customers come in with almost a renewed spirit and a new way of looking at life, which is amazing to see.</p></speech>

That rarely happens, but it does happen sometimes.  We also find that vapers use different products at different times.  In the morning, they may use a tobacco flavour.  At midday they may use mint and they may use a fruit or combination flavour in the evening.  Vaping is a very different product that they do not have when they smoke.  There is no evidence that the fruit flavours would entice them to go back to smoking.  In fact, Nicorette gum, for instance, comes in fruit flavours.</p><p>They also contain nicotine.</p></speech>

Obviously, I would come at this by supporting measures that would encourage people and enable them to come off their addiction in respect of a range of areas, not just vaping.  It has to be said for the purposes of the meeting that. given we are talking about addiction to a product Mr. O&rsquo;Boyle sells, there is a vested interest here.  If there was no addiction, there would be no sales for him.</p></speech>

That is why I opened my shop.  I did so because I saw daily the difference it was making to adult smokers who could not quit with nicotine patches or gum, which also contain nicotine and keep that addiction going.  It is not like nicotine is a new substance------</p></speech>

I encourage every customer who comes into my shop and quits smoking to get on a plan to gradually come off nicotine completely or his or her nicotine intake.  A person could start on 18 mg, let us say, and wean himself or herself down to 3 mg.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on a point that was raised earlier.  We have the opening statement of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI.  It refers to the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from temporary or moveable premises, counter or point of sale, events where children are present and vending machines.  Does Mr. O'Boyle support a prohibition on the sale of vaping products and e-cigarettes in those circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin O'Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#P01300"><p>I agree to the majority of them apart from point of sale, purely because it is the area in which, especially in my shop, one gets a level of education.  The retailer gets to explain to the customer what the product is.  It is not like a person walks into a vape shop and there is one vape there.  I have more than 30 different starter kits because, as the official from the Department of Health stated, every single smoker or vaper is neurologically different and no one-size-fits-all approach works when it comes to quitting smoking.</p></speech>

As I see it, those organisations are coming at this purely from a public health perspective.  There seems to be a sharp difference between how they see it and how Vape Business Ireland sees it.</p><p>I have a question on flavouring in the minute and a half I have left.  Obviously, there are numerous studies on flavouring and one can take an <i>&agrave; la carte</i>approach in terms of sources and citing some of them but not all of them, as is the case in the context of any issue.  Is it not the case, however, that the EU Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks found &quot;strong evidence that flavours have a relevant contribution for attractiveness of use of electronic cigarette and initiation&quot; and specifically so when it comes to children?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#P01500"><p>That statement is absolutely correct but it is also correct for adults.  That is why people stay on vaping.  It is why people make the transition.  The taste of tobacco is probably one of the worst tastes in the world.  When one moves from smoking to vaping, one quickly realises how nasty it tastes.</p></speech>

The RCPI, however, cites a 2018 study that seems to be fairly comprehensive.  It is a systemic review of consumer preference for e-cigarette attributes. The written submission provided by RCPI states, "Adolescents are more likely to initiate nicotine inhaled products use through flavoured products relative to other age groups."</p></speech>

That was a study of 19 young people, if I remember right.  The study to which I referred looked at 500,000 young people.  There is a significant difference between those samples.</p><p>I do not think Oireachtas Members would pay attention to any study or political poll that is carried out unless it samples at least 1,000 people.</p></speech>

I put a lot of faith in what the Irish Cancer Society and Irish Heart Foundation say as well.  Obviously, we had to take big steps, which my party and I supported, in respect of cigarettes through the years, such as the ban on indoor use, the restriction on advertising and the requirement for plain packaging.  All of those measures were resisted.  People from the industry sat where Mr. Dunne and Mr. O'Boyle are sitting now and made exactly the same arguments, but we made those decisions and they worked.  I certainly lean more heavily towards people who are obviously advocating for public health when it comes to informing my approach on this issue, notwithstanding the genuine arguments that have been made by Mr. Dunne and Mr. O'Boyle.  What they are saying is in good faith, but they have to accept that, from my perspective, public health has to come first.</p></speech>

However, there is a lack of consensus on this issue in terms of the viewpoints of sister organisations. For example, there is a significant difference between the viewpoints on vaping of Cancer Research UK and the Irish Cancer Society.  Those organisations are in the same business of public health.  It confuses me that there is such a difference between NGOs in this country and the same type of NGOs in the UK, for instance.  Irish people are not genetically different from people in those countries.</p></speech>

That is not just a British study; it is a study from across the European Union.  The Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the RCPI all have a very strong track record in advocating for good public health and reducing people's dependency on products that are addictive and damaging to their health.  As was accepted, these are not products that are 100% safe.  One can argue that is also true in the case of certain other products.  I get that as well.  I hear the argument that it is not just vaping.  One could make the same argument in respect of many other products that are for sale, including alcohol, but we are dealing today with e-cigarettes and we have strong representations from medical and clinical experts as well as health advocates who are saying we need to do more in respect of advertising, the sale of flavoured products and sale to those under 18, which is where we are in agreement.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.</p></speech>

There is general consensus among most of the groups which come before us that there should not be access for young people aged under 18.  One of the difficulties is that many of the products are bought online.  Mr. Dunne or Mr. O'Boyle said they are looking at other jurisdictions.  Do they have any recommendations in that regard?  At the moment, it is basically a box-ticking exercise that asks whether one is over 18.  Do our guests have any recommendations in respect of how we can stop young people getting these products?  Another group appeared before the committee previously and its representatives were asked how they know people are over 18 and so on.  One of the representatives said he or she might know the house.  What we are discussing here, however, is legislation for the whole State.  What recommendations do our guests have in respect of that area?  Do they consider it an important element of the proposed Bill?</p></speech>

It should be part of the eventual Bill that there be a process to electronically check the age of the purchaser.  We referred to the UK.  Such a process is in place there.  Online retailers have to be able to verify, either electronically or manually, that the person is over the age of 18.  After watching the meeting last week, I spoke to a company that is actually in a position to offer that service in Ireland.  A challenge it identified is that there are certain ways it checks the age electronically in the UK that may not be available in Ireland.  It is confident, however, that it could have that service up and running in Ireland within a week.  I am happy to share its information with the committee if it would like to contact it.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Dunne have any other recommendations?  I am not aware of how retailers would do that.  Mr. Dunne might advise on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#R00200"><p>In England, they can check bank records, driving licence records or council tax records.  Those are all databases where users are over the age of 18.  If they do not appear on those databases, that flags that the sale to that purchaser needs further attention.  Most retailers I know would not sell a product if a sale to a purchaser was flagged but some of them would follow up on that manually with the purchaser and request further information such as a driver&rsquo;s licence.  Another important aspect is that retailers in England will not and cannot legally sell their products to anybody who they have not age-verified.  For instance, if somebody is age-verified under the name Joe Bloggs but the order comes in under a different name or with an instruction to please ship to a different address, that is called proxy purchasing, which is not allowed.  The name must match the person who has been verified.</p></speech>

How does Mr. Dunne envisage that this will develop?  Are there ways to tighten up on products being imported from outside the EU that might be harmful?  Has the industry any recommendations on that?</p></speech>

For instance, in UK retailers can check the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MRHA, website and insert an European Community identification, EC-ID, number, which is the specific code for each product or they can check a product by manufacturer, brand name etc. and it will indicate if the product is approved.  Unfortunately, retailers in this State do not have such a database but generally they will check that database because most manufacturers will put their products on all the databases for Ireland in the EU as well in the UK.  If it is listed on that database, it should be okay in six months' time to be put on the market in Ireland.  I would recommend that the Government consider establishing a database here where retailers and consumers could check if the products they are buying are registered.</p></speech>

We do not want to make smokers think vaping is just as bad for them as smoking.  By introducing plain packaging and overly restricting vaping products, all we are doing is reinforcing a negative message about vaping to the effect that vaping is just as bad as smoking and, therefore, one might as well just keep smoking.  We must encourage smokers to move away from doing something which we know potentially could kill them.  They are ingesting 4,500 chemicals a year.  Smoking kills 6,000 people in Ireland every year.  We are saying there are better alternatives, whether it be quitting by the cold turkey method, using nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, products, or using vaping products, and then we should let the consumer make that choice.  We are not saying everybody should vape but it is another tool in the public health war chest for people to use.</p></speech>

That is attributed to the pandemic.  With an increase in stress levels and the fact that vape shops were closed, we saw a 1% increase in smoking rates and a 1% decrease in vaping rates.  There is a strong correlation that when vaping rates increase, smoking rates decrease, which shows that vaping is an effective smoking cessation tool.</p></speech>

The UK found a similar blip in its smoking rates but following the pandemic and the reopening of the vape shops that has now corrected itself.</p></speech>

As we would all do now, we would have a different viewpoint on how we engage in public.  It would behove those who vape to be cognisant of what is going on around them and who is around them.  As a courtesy to others, it probably would not be advisable to be vaping around others in the same way as people would not be coughing and sneezing around others.</p></speech>

I am a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, Crumlin.  I represent the policy group on tobacco of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  The RCPI is a postgraduate medical training college with a membership of over 12,000 doctors across 29 different specialties in more than 90 countries.</p><p>In addition to leading in training and postgraduate education of specialist doctors, RCPI&rsquo;s members and fellows offer a clinical perspective and expert knowledge to inform and influence national policy on public health.  The RCPI policy group on tobacco was established in 2014.  Since 2020, we and the IPH have collaborated to increase the impact of research and advocacy in the area of tobacco use.</p><p> Tobacco smoking remains the biggest long-term public health issue in Ireland.  Smoking causes over 6,000 deaths and 1,000 hospitalisations each year.  Every day doctors and other healthcare professionals have to pick up the pieces &ndash; breaking bad news to patients and their families about cancer caused by smoking, arranging care for preventable illnesses caused by smoking, such as heart attacks and stroke, and supporting people living with ongoing disability, such as chronic lung disease.  Everyone has seen and supported healthcare professionals on the front line tackling the Covid-19 epidemic.  We must remember that healthcare professionals in Ireland are still on the front line tackling a continuing epidemic of harm caused by smoking.  We have a target of 5% smoking prevalence by 2025, as set in the 2013 Tobacco Free Ireland action plan.  Despite declines in prevalence &ndash; from 23% in 2015 to 18% in 2021 - there are concerns that progress is now stalling.  Worryingly, there has been a slight increase in children tobacco smoking since 2015.</p><p> Nicotine inhaled products are commonly used today in Ireland, often promoted as a safer alternative to tobacco smoking.  When doctors recommend or provide healthcare, we need to have confidence that the care is safe and effective.  Patients expect nothing less.  This is the standard against which nicotine inhaled products need to be assessed.  What we know about these products from independent scientific studies, including randomised controlled trials, and in Ireland from a review by the Health Research Board, is that they are no more effective than approved, regulated, safe and clinically sound nicotine replacement therapies.  Studies also show that nicotine inhaled products are a gateway to tobacco smoking.  Adolescents who ever used nicotine inhaled products are between three and five times more likely to start smoking compared with adolescents who have never used nicotine inhaled products.</p><p> Numerous scientific studies demonstrate that nicotine inhaled products have harmful effects.  Although they contain fewer harmful substances when compared with tobacco smoking, research on their long-term health effects, particularly from animal studies, suggests that substances contained in these products can cause brain, heart and lung damage.  To enhance the health gains of this Bill, we would like the committee to consider our recommendations for modification to the existing heads of Bill, recommendation 1, and for future amendments or legislation, recommendations 2 to 4.</p><p> Our first recommendation is inclusion of nicotine inhaled products under selected existing heads of Bill.  In respect of the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products from temporary or moveable premises, head 16, counter or point of sale, head 17, events where children are present, head 21, and vending machines, head 35, we recommend extending these measures to include nicotine inhaling products.  As we do not wish to delay the passing of the Bill, we recommend that measures be added as amendments to the Bill in the near future.</p><p> Our second recommendation is to increase the prohibition of the sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaled products from 18 to 21 years of age.  Countries such as the US and Singapore have implemented a Tobacco 21 policy and recent evidence suggests that tobacco smoking reduced among 18- to 20-year-olds as a result.</p><p> Recommendation 3 is to prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaled products flavourings apart from tobacco flavoured products.  Adolescents are more likely to initiate nicotine inhaled products use through flavoured products relative to other age groups.  While adults may also enjoy flavours, the risks of nicotine inhaled products initiation in adolescents and young adults outweigh the benefits of ex-smokers using flavoured products.  Finland&rsquo;s 2016 ban on flavours did not result in fewer smokers using nicotine inhaled products as a quitting tool.</p><p> Recommendation 4 is that the same restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products should be applied to nicotine inhaled products.  Currently, point of sale and billboard advertisements have the potential to attract non-smokers to try nicotine inhaled products.  Marketing across social media platforms for nicotine inhaled products remains unregulated.  It often appears that these products are being sold as an alternative to tobacco smoking rather than solely as a stop smoking aid.</p><p> We wholeheartedly support this proposed Bill as an important milestone in tobacco control legislation in Ireland.  Enacting this proposed legislation into law would align Ireland with many of our counterparts across the EU and with the UK.  It will lead to a reduced prevalence of tobacco smoking and deliver a significant child protection measure against nicotine addiction.  We encourage the committee to pass the proposed Bill without delay and also to consider our additional recommendations.</p><p> I declare no conflict of interest personally, or on behalf of RCPI, in respect of any direct or indirect financial assistance or funding or any professional relationship with the tobacco industry or any entity working to further its interests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen McAvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#V00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our views today.  The Institute of Public Health, IPH, and the RCPI tobacco policy group submitted joint written positions on this proposed legislation in January 2020 and in June 2021.  Our statement today incorporates content from those and some updates.  Like the RCPI, as a signatory to the framework convention on tobacco control we declare no conflict of interest personally, or on behalf of IPH, in terms of involvement with the tobacco industry.</p> <p>  The measures outlined in the general scheme make both tobacco and e-cigarettes less accessible to children and enhance Government oversight of the supply of these addictive products.  The proposed Bill aligns with the Tobacco Free Ireland policy which seeks to denormalise tobacco use, protect children and work towards a tobacco endgame.  It is proportionate and based on sound principles and evidence.  Tobacco causes enormous harm to both children and adults; it harms them physically, psychologically and financially.  Tobacco also causes significant harm to the environment and to the Exchequer.  The costs of loss of productivity and premature death due to tobacco in Ireland were estimated at &euro;711 million in 2016.</p> <p>  With regard to Part 2 of the general scheme, which allows for the development of a licence system for the retail sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products, these align with what the framework convention on tobacco control tells us to do, which is to act on supply side reduction provisions for sales to and by minors.  More than 60% of 15- to 16-year-olds in Ireland reported that they think it would be either fairly easy or very easy to obtain cigarettes. Clearly, better systems are needed to address the supply channels for children and young people, and a simple register of retailers, which was set up in legislation in 2009, is no longer sufficient to support the approaches that are needed.  Under a new licensing system, compliance and enforcement efforts will be better supported.  We will better understand the retail environments for tobacco and e-cigarettes and that will make for better policy and practice in the longer term.  The proposed annual licence fee will benefit the Exchequer and provide a revenue stream to support the crucial work of the environmental health service in supporting compliance.  We know from test purchasing conducted by the HSE that approximately one in ten sales are non-compliant in terms of verification of age, so there is still a lot to do in terms of the supply side to minors.</p> <p>  Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the proposed Bill relate to restrictions on the sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products, including compliance, penalties and proceedings.  The measures build on existing legislation that has prohibited tobacco marketing, got rid of point-of-sale advertising of tobacco products and mandated health warnings and standardised packaging.  Tobacco is not an ordinary product &ndash; it is very addictive and toxic.  It should not be sold from vending machines or mobile containers or at events or places intended for children.  We strongly support the prohibition of sales of e-cigarettes to under 18-year-olds.  All reasonable measures must be applied to ensure children are not exposed to nicotine, which is highly addictive and predisposes them to become either regular vapers, smokers or dual users.  Given the conclusions of the evidence reviews published by the Health Research Board, we recommend extending heads 16, 17 and 21 to include nicotine inhaling products.  These are the heads relating to the sale of products from temporary or moveable premises, ensuring sales happen at a counter or point of sale only, and prohibition of sales at places or events primarily intended for children.  We believe these will provide additional safeguards to minors, alongside the establishment of a minimum legal age of sale for e-cigarettes.</p> <p>  In our written submission, we raised the possibility of raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products to 21 years.  There is convincing evidence that this would reduce the numbers of children and young people trying tobacco and subsequently becoming regular smokers.</p><p>We urge members consider options to progress this, if not within this Bill, then through other legislative instruments such as a separate amendment to the Public Health (Tobacco) Act of 2002.</p><p> With regard to Part 6 of the current Bill, we endorse the complete prohibition of self-service vending machines for tobacco and nicotine-inhaling products.  We encourage members to follow the lead of many other European countries that have already banned those machines.  Northern Ireland banned this practice a decade ago with no difficulty.  An evaluation was published on it which noted that prior to the introduction of their ban, 14% of 11- to 16-year-old children in Northern Ireland who obtained cigarettes reported getting them from vending machines.</p><p> Irish legislation introduced in 2009 prohibited self-service vending machines except in licensed premises and registered clubs.  It is regrettable that the exception made for licensed premises is still in place over a decade later.  It is perhaps a cautionary tale on including exceptions within legislation, as they tend to hang around much longer than we think.  Locating self-service vending machines for tobacco is a business model that is way past its time and a black spot on our good track record for tobacco control.  The machine itself is a de facto form of advertising and promotion of tobacco products.  Positioning them in places where alcohol is consumed facilitates ease of access to tobacco, including for smokers who are trying to quit.  We strongly caution against accepting any alternatives to a complete ban on the machines that may be presented to members. </p><p> In conclusion and for final observations, we welcome the Bill and recognise its contribution to the existing set of tobacco control legislation and the Tobacco-Free Ireland policy.  There have been significant delays in progressing this Bill along with other legislation, partly due to the pandemic and also, when it initially came out, due to some changes in government.  There is a need to now to apply priority and pace to the rest of the legislative process.  We need to catch up with much of the rest of Europe in bans on vending machines and the minimum legal age of sale for e-cigarettes.  I caution that parties with a commercial interest in the sale of tobacco and nicotine-containing products routinely employ tactics to subvert, delay and block regulation, including sowing conflicts within governments between departments of health, business, trade, and environment.</p><p> The volume and variety of nicotine inhaling devices on the market has increased.  This has been accompanied by commercial innovations on packaging, flavouring, marketing, retail strategy and the use of health claims.  There is a need to decide on further regulations on nicotine-inhaling devices, if not within this Bill, then following it.  There is a tension between just getting this Bill over the line and done because we have been waiting for it for a very long time versus introducing all of the regulatory measures that need to keep up with the commercial market.</p><p> The industry is diversifying its product range all the time to skirt around regulatory measures and to seek to reassure customers with unproven claims of lower risks to health.  For example, we now see chewable nicotine pouches marketed in Ireland and a new range of heat-not-burn tobacco products.  Therefore, there is further need for regulatory options relating in particular to the oral nicotine products that are now on sale in supermarkets.</p><p> The Department of Health and the HSE are facing challenges in directing people who smoke to the very best supports to stop smoking.  We know what those are through the clinical guidelines but we cannot lose sight of the goals of Tobacco-Free Ireland and the tobacco endgame.  A more ambitious and more targeted approach to tobacco- and nicotine-containing products is possible.  This Bill is a very good start, but we also need commitment to a long-term programme of legislative reforms building on, but going beyond, the provisions in this specific Bill.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that both of them would encourage people to give up smoking and do not want young people to start smoking.  On that basis, have nicotine-inhaled products any role in getting people to give up smoking?  Would Dr. McAvoy recommend them in her professional capacity to some or any smokers?</p></speech>

It has gone through a very detailed process involving the national clinical effectiveness committee, which has reviewed all of the evidence and concluded that the most robust, complete and stable evidence relates to a combination of approaches, which are behavioural and psychological support and the use of approved medicinal pharmaceutical aids, including nicotine replacement therapy.</p><p>The evidence around e-cigarettes is much lower and it compares unfavourably with that other information.  The best evidence is to engage with the State-funded statutory support services offered through <i>quit.ie</i>, which are free and funded by the Government and backed up by the strongest amount of evidence.  People who vape are absolutely welcome at the door of <i>quit.ie</i>.  Whether someone vapes, uses tobacco, uses cannabis or dual uses, everyone is welcome at the door of the HSE to engage in the statutory stop smoking services that are most strongly supported by evidence.  When somebody goes into a vaping store, I cannot guarantee that he or she gets the correct behavioural counselling support that we know is also needed to help people quit.  It is the combination of those two things.  There is a very strong training programme within the HSE that ensures that all stop smoking advisers know how to support people in terms of behavioural approaches and the psychology and counselling that is needed as well.  We know that works and that is what we are sticking with.</p></speech>

The Health Research Board, HRB, completed a review in 2020, which was a systematic analysis of a number of large studies.  It concluded that there was no evidence that e-cigarettes were successful at helping people get off tobacco smoking compared to the standard nicotine replacement therapies.  Therefore, we would completely agree that the evidence for e-cigarettes as a quitting tool is lacking.</p></speech>

Vape Business Ireland stated in its opening contribution that experts from King&rsquo;s College London and Queen Mary University of London show that vaping products are around 95% less harmful than smoking and Public Health England has consistently maintained this position in its annual evidence updates.  In addition, the findings have been backed by the Royal College of Physicians and leading anti-tobacco NGOs.  Would Professor Cox and Dr. McAvoy concur with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.599" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Des Cox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#X00400"><p>I will answer that.  In regard to the public health statement that nicotine-inhaled products are 95% safer than tobacco, it is incorrect.  It is based on a study that was published in 2013 and was done by a panel of experts and there was no scientific basis to that figure.  There is no science to back it up.  The truth of the matter is that nobody knows how harmful these products are.  Again, to refer back to the HRB review from 2020, it published a very large literature map which demonstrated that there are numerous harmful effects of e-cigarettes.  In regard to the UK, the Senator referred to Public Health England.  That statement is no longer on its website.  It is a statement that is commonly used and brought out, but it is actually incorrect.  As I mentioned, there are other reviews of e-cigarettes which demonstrate that they have short-term and potential long-term harms.</p></speech>

The main concern I have about the Bill is in relation to flavours.  Obviously, intuitively, one would think that flavours would induce people to start vaping and it presumably makes it easier.  Also, one could argue that it would be an inducement to those who are smoking to give up.  That is the crux that I see in relation to decisions that we have to make on flavours.  How would Professor Cox respond to that?  Perhaps he already did in his opening comments, citing the HSE or Healthy Ireland.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is a gateway.  It has been demonstrated in some studies that there is strong evidence that the flavours are implicated in the development of the attractiveness of e-cigarettes as devices.  A number of countries across the EU have already sought to introduce a ban on flavouring and we would support that as well.  For us as a group and for me, particularly, as a paediatrician, I would have grave concerns about adolescents using nicotine-inhaled products and becoming addicted to nicotine because of the harmful effects.</p><p>The idea behind a tobacco-free Ireland is that we should be protecting children from the dangers of tobacco and nicotine-inhaled products.  Our group feels that the best way of doing this is a ban on any flavouring other than tobacco flavour.  It is better to protect children.  Ex-smokers will still have access to e-cigarettes that are tobacco-flavoured.</p></speech>

She stated there is obviously an urgency regarding bringing in the Bill as it is and we could look at other issues thereafter.  She talks about packaging, flavouring, marketing, retail strategy and other areas.  Why take this approach when this is pre-legislative scrutiny?  We have an opportunity, if the Oireachtas sees fit, to make changes now so we do not have to wait.  We know how difficult it is to get legislation passed.  It can take an awfully long time.  We have been waiting for this Bill for a long time.  While Dr. McAvoy says that she sees an urgency in getting this Bill passed, would it not be preferable for us to deal with some of the issues around packaging, flavouring, marketing and retail strategy in this Bill by way of amendments, as supported by her colleague but also by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society?</p></speech>

For those of us who want to strengthen it, there is an opportunity to strengthen it because following this process, we will have to publish a report where we deliberate as members of the committee.  We can make recommendations.  If it was possible to amend the Bill to go further in some areas, particularly regarding a ban on flavouring, would Dr. McAvoy support doing so if it would not delay implementation for too long?</p></speech>

I put it to them that they obviously have a vested interest in selling their products and that the sale of their products depends on people being addicted to them.  If, therefore, we introduce measures that will lessen people's dependence and help them to come off their addiction, the industry will make less money.  There is an obvious vested interest there.</p><p>From a medical perspective, does Professor Cox believe that the measures as proposed by the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation regarding plain packaging and a ban on flavouring and marketing are good public health measures?  </p></speech>

That is really important.  The object of all this is to help people get off smoking tobacco.  We believe we should be looking to the proven, safe and effective measures rather than something like e-cigarettes, where the evidence is not there.  As I mentioned earlier, there is a review that shows that these are harmful.  The degree of this harm and whether it is short or long-term are still unknown.  We must remember that it took about 30 years for us to really realise the true impact of what happened with tobacco products.</p></speech>

A recent article in a large peer-reviewed journal concluded that adult ex-smokers who were using e-cigarettes as a quit tool did not decrease their use of it.  I am just quoting evidence here.

There has been a lot of discussion around our rates of smoking and the levelling of the decline in smoking, which would have happened after the smoking ban.  The position of the industry representatives in the previous session was that Covid meant that vaping was less accessible.  Someone could not walk into a shop and get vaping products and, therefore, one of the reasons smoking had started to either stop declining or increase was because there was not enough access to vaping.  Some of the research that was being quoted to us dates from 2015 onwards, which does not align with the Covid period.  I put it to Dr. McAvoy that this is what is being told to Members of the Oireachtas - that there is an interaction between Covid and access to vaping and those numbers declining.  The position of the industry representatives is that we need more vaping, not less, to reduce the numbers of people smoking.  What is Dr. McAvoy's reaction to that position?</p></speech>

I think there were lots of different changes relating to smoking during the pandemic.  The Social Impact of COVID-19 Survey released by the CSO, which looked at people smoking, showed that smokers were also very frightened during the pandemic because they knew the damage done by smoking was putting them into a group of people who were at higher risk of having a negative outcome from an infection.  I think that did drive some quite attempts as well.  The access people had to the State's stop smoking services and their local pharmacy and social support networks decreased as well.  The HSE worked very hard to move to remote consultations with smokers seeking to quit and invested a lot of time and energy to try to improve access but not everyone is able to access a remote stop smoking adviser or was confident enough-----</p></speech>

During these conversations and the pre-legislative scrutiny process, we have talked a lot about the move away from tobacco and tobacco addiction, but we have talked less about addiction to nicotine in and of itself.  In the last session, the use of the word "transition" came up in the sense of smokers transitioning from a tobacco product to an inhaling product.  However, inhaling products are not necessarily identified as products that transition the smoker away from addiction to nicotine.  I raise this in the context of how the use of cartoon characters, bright, colourful packaging, and flavouring affect young people.  I am making the comparison because we have talked about other aids.  I do not want to say "Nicorette" because I know I am not allowed to use brand names.</p></speech>

Is there good evidence to suggest people use other aids that provide nicotine for a long time after they quit smoking or other tobacco products?  Are the aids for life?</p></speech>

The challenge is that in the studies that compared the use of e-cigarettes with other forms of nicotine replacement therapy, NRT, many people were still vaping at the end by comparison with those who used oral NRT and moved off it.  If you are still addicted to nicotine, you are still vulnerable to returning to tobacco.  That is really the concern we have.  People who use e-cigarettes may even be dual-using at the end, so they are not even effectively reducing the risk of all the tobacco-related diseases because-----</p></speech>

Even at two or three cigarettes per week, you will still have quite bit of risk for tobacco-related disease.  It can take up to ten or 15 years to return to the risk level of a non-smoker.  Therefore, the dual-use picture is of genuine concern to us.  More cynical people than I might say that is part of the business model.  There is genuine concern that we will not achieve the harm-reduction effect if so many people are dual-using the products.</p></speech>

We do not feel there is a sufficient body of evidence to show people can successfully transition from e-cigarettes to nothing, whereas there is evidence for NRT and other safe, effective products that have been shown to help people to quit tobacco.  I wholeheartedly agree with Dr. McAvoy's point about dual use.  It is a big concern of ours.  Tobacco smoking at any level is unacceptable for people's health.  There is a public health risk.  People who dual-use are at risk of developing more problems in the form of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease down the track.</p></speech>

I am not a vaper and have never looked at the websites to see cartoon characters and the likes of blueberry, strawberry and watermelon flavours.  Somehow these had passed me by.  The packages often look like little lollipop packages.  I can absolutely see why these would be attractive to younger people.</p><p>If we accept that somehow there is a reason to have cartoon characters and strawberry watermelon flavours but also the position of some industry representatives to the effect that they do not want to sell to children despite the existence of cartoon characters and strawberry watermelon flavours, it implies there should be some kind of negotiation as to what is acceptable.  When do we have the cute little vampire and when do we not?  Who decides that?  Consider the circumstances that arise if we accept that these marketing practices should be allowed or say that the likes of Tweety Bird should not be allowed while a vampire may be okay.  Is there any example of where these kinds of decisions are being made by medical professionals or people in the public health sphere, whereby they are trying to work out whether a certain vampire product is for over-18s and another vampire product is not?</p></speech>

There are some measures in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act that try to pin down what we mean when we talk about advertising that targets children.  The data we see show that one in ten children under the age of 13 has tried an e-cigarette and that around 16% to 18% of those between 15 and 16 are current users.  We may say we need the minimum legal age of sale to be 18 but we must ask whether that will be enough to reduce the appeal and accessibility of the products to children.  The minimum legal age is a really good start.  It is important to have a legal rule stipulating that products should not be sold to people under 18, but clearly children under 18 are getting them and finding them very appealing and interesting.  According to a study, when children are asked why they have tried them, two thirds say they were just curious.  The adolescent brain is a challenge at times.  Sensation seeking, risk-taking, peer pressure and marketing are all in the mix.  These are all the things we need to think about when regulating these products if we want to reduce use.  The minimum legal age of sale is useful but I do not believe it is enough.  The other aspects, concerning branding, the use of imagery and so on, must also be considered.</p> <p>  A brand of tobacco whose name I will refrain from using used a cartoon character for many years in its marketing, television advertising, billboards and so on.  It continues to do so through other means.  We need to learn from this because we are starting to see many similarities.  We also had flavoured tobacco.  We introduced legislation to remove menthol tobacco only two years ago.  It is the same thing.  Menthol in tobacco disguised its flavour.  Having an easier starter product was part of the model.  It was found later that it made it harder to quit.  Flavoured products were used to target certain subgroups of the population.  For example, the African-American community in the United States was very strongly targeted with menthol tobacco and so on.  Therefore, there are lots of lessons to be learned from what went before in respect of tobacco and flavouring.</p></speech>

Ninety percent of adult smokers took their first smoke below the age of 18.  The tactics in the past were to hook teenagers.  That is the playbook of the tobacco industry.  The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, ESPAD, surveyed just under 2,000 teenagers aged between 15 and 16.  It was found that between 2015 and 2019, there was a 50% increase in e-cigarette use.  This is a problem.  People who quote the Healthy Ireland survey should note it is not designed to rule out e-cigarette use.  A number of other surveys show that teenagers are experimenting and that we need to protect children in that regard.</p></speech>

Let me start with the figure they have given for the number of deaths as a direct result of smoking.</p><p>Obviously, this is spread over a period of time.  Is there any indication the level of smoking has reduced in this country and that the number of deaths will come down likewise?  I ask this because most recent studies show the greater the number of young people smoking e-cigarettes, the more likely they are to go on to ordinary cigarettes.  From that point of view, although we are considering legislation, do we need to be more proactive with young people about the dangers of e-cigarettes?</p></speech>

Our rates are declining, but again, there has been a stalling of the numbers in recent years.  To quote the ESPAD study from 2019, the decline in smoking in children had halted for the first time in 25 years at 14% and it actually increased in boys to 16%, while it was 13% for girls.  There is a concern.  This is probably multifactorial due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our group believes tobacco control is probably not as sexy and people look to other public health measures, but it is still the most devastating and problematic chronic public health issue in this country and many other countries.  From our perspective, we would certainly strongly encourage any measures that can increase tobacco control legislation and help people to get away from the dangers of tobacco.</p></speech>

Is the number of people smoking far higher than what the figures are showing in real terms?</p></speech>

We only have one year of data from the Healthy Ireland survey in terms of smoking patterns in adults, so it is going to take us a little time to understand the ways in which the pandemic period may have influenced people's smoking patterns.  There have also been challenges in doing the surveys during the pandemic in terms of face-to-face interviews and so on.  It is going to take us a bit of time to understand fully the implications.</p> <p>  To circle back to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in regard to tobacco-related deaths, I do not believe we are past the peak of the number or rate of tobacco-related deaths.  We are still seeing very frightening increases in the number of women with lung cancer relating to women who took up smoking in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, when they were actively targeted by the tobacco industry, marketed to and provided with products that were suggested as being lighter, lower tar or less harmful.  This is the long-term legacy effect of it.  We can see this from some of the marketing and the patterns of uptake that happened, particularly with women in the 1960s and 1970s, where women were far less likely to smoke and then started to catch up with the male figures.  I do not believe we are past the peak of deaths.</p></speech>

Is there now a need to tighten up the regulations on the number of cigarettes people can bring in when travelling from abroad?  For example, one country &ndash; perhaps Sweden - has insisted that products can only be brought in provided the warning is in the language of the country and not any other language.  That is the restriction it brought in but it also reduced the number of cigarettes that can be brought in by people from abroad.  Do we need to do a lot more on that issue as well?</p></speech>

I point out that a number of other regulations came into place as well.  As I also mentioned earlier, it is important that we depend on the evidence and I would imagine we do not know the true impact as there have not yet been many other studies on that issue.

As I said, our group&rsquo;s position is that we would be supportive of a ban on flavouring and we would suggest the committee takes that recommendation on board.</p></speech>

In practice, this is sometimes very difficult.  There is certainly very strong lobbying activity at European level and also in national governments.  To remain firm and objective and to stick with the evidence is the main road to travel in regard to deciding on the legislation.</p></speech>

We have a longitudinal study but, unfortunately, it does not include data on e-cigarette to tobacco use.  Longitudinal studies are where the same group of children is followed over a period of time.  Those types of studies provide a higher level of evidence than taking a different sample of children every few years and are more supportive of a relationship between e-cigarette use and subsequently using tobacco.  I do not have any figures on that but we can come certainly back to the Deputy with the findings from some those of longitudinal studies, which would give him an estimate of the strength of that association.</p></speech>

It is probably a reminder that if people are joining the meeting from their offices, they are probably better off using their headsets.  It is much clearer, especially for guests in the room, in hearing what people are saying.</p> <p>  I have just a couple of questions.  One of the suggestions made was to change the age of access from 18 to 21, which is from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Will the representatives expand on some of the thinking behind that? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.681" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen McAvoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030100002#FF00100"><p>Broadly speaking, we know that most people who try tobacco products do so before they are aged 25.  We also know that the average age at which children try their first cigarette is going up, which is good.  That is what we were trying to do, but we are also aware that many countries have now introduced a minimum legal age of 21 for the sale of tobacco.  This is in recognition of the addictive and toxic nature of the product and the fact that one in two smokers will die of a tobacco-related disease.  It is that serious and that is why an age of approximately 21 is appropriate.</p> <p>  Legislation was introduced to change the legal age of sale in the United States.  It started at state localities and moved into national legislation in 2019.  Singapore has introduced phased implementation of this starting with 19- to 20-year-olds in 2020 and increasing the age to 20- to 21-year-olds in 2021.  A comprehensive review of this was conducted in 2016.  Some modelling was done that demonstrated the legislation can result in fewer tobacco attributable deaths.  It also demonstrated a reduction in adverse maternal and child health outcomes, including pre-term births, low birth weight and sudden infant death.  The implementation of the Tobacco 21 law in California was evaluated.  It was found that after the implementation there was very high awareness and support of the legislation among the community and retailers.  Some 60% of young people in the area agreed that raising the minimum age for tobacco sales to 21 reduced tobacco use.</p> <p>  There is a concern that this is paternalistic medicine or nanny statism but it is, in fact, a very proportionate measure in the context of the harmfulness of this product.  Other countries are now looking at what is called the sinking lid, where they state they will prohibit the sale of tobacco to anyone born after a certain date, whether it is 2008 or 2020, because they are very committed to an endgame that after a certain point they do not want to see any child or young person having access to these products and becoming addicted.</p> <p>  The argument against this was always that it would increase illicit sales.  The evaluation from the California programme was that did not happen.  The all-party parliamentary group on smoking and health in the UK recommended raising the age for the sale of tobacco to 21.  It has also been raised for discussion at European level so it is certainly in the ether.  The estimates are that it would result in a reduction of approximately 7% or 8% in smoking prevalence by 2030, if it was introduced.  We could get quite a quick return from that policy in a short period.  We do not yet have modelling for that in Ireland.</p> <p>  I talked a little about the adolescent brain.  It is an interesting space in terms of decision-making, impulse control, peer pressure and sensation seeking.  If we can protect children and adolescents through that period, we will have done a lot to crack this problem of tobacco use and tobacco-related harm.  The adolescent brain is also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction so there is a neuroscience argument to this as well.</p></speech>

Someone aged 18 will say he or she is an adult and should be able to make that decision himself or herself.  How would she respond to that?</p></speech>

I would not refute that but if tobacco came before this committee now as a new product, there is no way any government would allow it to be put on the market for sale.  It is because we are in that space and have an historic legacy that this product has been around.</p><p>If tobacco came to the regulatory bodies now and somebody said he or she wanted to market this product which will seriously harm one in two users, is highly addictive and is very difficult to quit without significant support, would the Government allow it to go on sale?  I do not believe it would.</p></speech>

That is down to technological advances with the products.  We are on third or fourth generation devices now.  That is one of the reasons there is confusion around the effects or impacts of e-cigarettes.  Technology is evolving and medical science is constantly trying to catch up with it.  That is why it is important not to look at one isolated study.  We have to look at the bigger picture, involving large-scale population-based studies or collections where they have looked at a number of studies together.  That is why people sometimes hear different messages about e-cigarettes.<br/><br/>There is enough evidence.  I keep coming back to the HRB review but it is probably the best source of evidence we have.  It was published in 2020 and the three main conclusions were that there is no evidence it is better than the standard treatments out there, that there is a three to five times increased chance of ending up using tobacco for those using e-cigarettes and that they are harmful rather than harmless.  That is why the HSE in its new stop smoking guidelines has decided there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as quitting tools.<br/><br/>We may not learn the long-term effects for a while but there is evidence to suggest we should not hang our hat on such devices.  If we are to get to a tobacco-free Ireland, we should push standard treatments and well-researched and evidence-based treatments, and support <i>quit.ie</i>and the people on the ground who help people quit tobacco.  We should increase funding for them rather than looking to other devices.</p></speech>

For example, if the legislation was changed to ban sales to those under 21 years, how would that be enacted?  At the moment, it is a box-ticking exercise.  Anyone who ticks "Yes, I'm an adult" can get the product.  Can that be tightened up?</p></speech>

An element of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is under consultation at the moment.  The first part of that Bill was about setting up regulatory structures around online media and safety, with an immediate focus, quite rightly, on child protection and child exploitation.</p> <p>  There is also scope in the Bill to think about regulating the marketing and advertising of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products to children and young people.  Under EU legislation there is a stipulation that there should be no e-cigarette marketing on channels where more than 25% of the audience is under 18.  I have not seen any independent evaluation to indicate that is happening but in small qualitative studies done on children and young people accessing cigarettes, they talked about Snapchat, Instagram and those sorts of channels, which I view as primarily youth channels.  There is work to be done on online marketing and age verification for the online supply of e-cigarettes to children and young people, irrespective of whether we go to Tobacco 21.</p></speech>

In that context, the online alternative seems to be wide open.  I asked the previous group about the ban on smoking in public buildings, restaurants and pubs.  We hear of passive smoking.  Are there harmful effects for people in the company of vapers?  Is there an impact on children when the adult or parent is vaping beside the child?  Should there be similar legislation on that?  The previous groups suggested that was not the way forward.  Do the witnesses have a view on that?</p></speech>

I do not have a firm view at this stage on extending the workplace smoking ban to vaping.  However, we do not want to normalise vaping in places where a smoking ban exists and present it as an alternative activity.  We want places, particularly where children are and where people are seeking medical treatment, which are free from that.</p></speech>

We do not know a lot about it but we know the by-products of e-cigarettes - that is, what is expelled into the air - contain some compounds which have potential to be harmful.  That is all we can say at the moment.  I do not think there is firm evidence on that.  We would be the first ones to be jumping up and down if that was the case.  We do not have full oversight of what the impact is but I agree with Dr. McAvoy's point that just like we try to denormalise the behaviour of smoking, we should not expose children to parents who vape.  They should try to do that outside of the environment of the child, as a child protection measure.  That would be a sensible approach.</p></speech>

That is certainly an irritant for me, regardless of the side effects.</p> <p>  In the past, producers of tobacco products promoted the idea that they were cool, sexy or whatever.  Is there any evidence that the products we are discussing are being pushed in that way?  There was much emphasis on cartoon figures.  We use all sorts of things for marketing, such as particular colours or images.  Adults look at cartoons, and there is all sorts of other stuff as well.  Is there evidence that the market is being pushed in that direction or is it just an alternative that is more acceptable and it is easier to come off tobacco products by trying this?</p></speech>

We see a large amount of product placement and so on.  The strategy is now also about diversifying and promoting products with the direct or indirect suggestion that they are less harmful to health.  For example, there was much promotional activity on heat not burn products in the UK.  There is a challenge about whether they should be classed as tobacco products because they are not combustible but are heated; therefore, they may be outside the exact regulatory definitions, etc.</p><p> All of the marketing techniques relating to celebrity endorsements and very strong gender-based messages around sex appeal that we have seen before are being used for e-cigarettes.  It is a different world now with celebrity influencers on social media, which was not around when the tobacco industry marketing was in its heyday.  The challenge is the access that this form of marketing has to everyone who has a phone, including children and young people.  That would be my observation.  The marketing strategies are very clearly along gender lines and they are speaking to messages of freedom and personal empowerment.  When the tobacco industry co-opted the feminist movement, it presented tobacco as providing more opportunities and more freedoms in life.  We need to be very careful about the messaging that comes from there when they are targeting particular market segments.</p></speech>

Could anything else be tightened up in that regard?  How reliable are the statistics relating to the time of the Covid pandemic?  Are they a blip?  The witnesses spoke about the pressure people were under and so on.  Everything was abnormal.  Alcohol sales were probably also up during that period.  There is anecdotal evidence about illegal drug sales.  How were they getting drugs into the country during lockdown?  We were doing many things that we would not do normally.  Hopefully, as we move out of this madness that will not happen again.</p></speech>

As Dr. McAvoy mentioned earlier, much of the evidence we have based on surveys from that period is coloured because of the different pressures of actually getting the information in the first place and the different state of mind of people.  We need to look at the bigger picture of the overall trend.  It seems that tobacco control in Ireland has stalled somewhat.  As a group of doctors, our concern is that whatever about what happened during the Covid pandemic, we are supposed to be aiming for a tobacco-free Ireland of 5%; we are currently at 18%.  We are supposed to be tobacco-free by 2025.  We are way off that figure.</p> <p>  To get the trend in the right direction, we strongly believe that tobacco control needs to be prioritised through legislative measures.  This is the first time in many years that legislation relating to tobacco control has come up.  We strongly support the additional recommendations being made today.  It is all about the bigger picture of trying to protect people from the harms of tobacco smoking.  That needs to be the focus of any legislative measures.  This particular legislation is a child protection issue, regarding the ban of nicotine inhaled products under the age of 18 and protecting children from the dangers of both tobacco and nicotine inhaled products.</p></speech>

Even those selling the product believe the ban should be introduced.  It is up to us to determine the most effective way to do that.</p></speech>

One of its other tactics is that it has now invested heavily in vaping companies.  A number of tobacco companies have large shareholdings in these companies.  Different vested interests may present a different picture.</p><p>We encourage the committee to always come back to the evidence and that is where the answers will lie.</p></speech>

They are the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations which were transposed into Irish law in 2016 with subsequent amendments in later years.  They require notification of the product contents, safety and quality requirements and labelling indicating the product contains nicotine which is highly addictive.  There are also some provisions on marketing and advertising, including the stipulation that no medium should be used to advertise e-cigarettes if more than 25% of the audience is under 18.  Many countries have not only transposed that directive but have gone beyond it in their own domestic legislation relating to these products.</p> <p>  While, of course, we need to be aligned with Europe and transpose the directives, there is always scope to go further in our own domestic legislation.  Given the extent of the difficulties in getting consensus between European countries' governments, the extent of lobbying and all the things that happen at European level, marking to the European level is probably the minimum that any country can do.  There is certainly scope for Ireland to go beyond that.</p> <p>  This legislation came in just before the pandemic.  The health system and many other Government systems have been overwhelmed and engaged in responding to that.  We have not really had any independent report on Ireland's compliance with the European tobacco directive.  We need to think about whether Ireland is fully compliant with that European regulation as stated.  We also need to ask whether the European directive is enough for what we want to do in Ireland where we have a target for a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. D&oacute;nal McCormack and Ms Maeve Foreman of Community Gardens Ireland.  Members have been circulated with the briefing and the opening statements.  I will first ask our guests to make their opening statements and then members will be invited to address questions to them.  Members might keep their questions to five or six minutes.  For the information of our guests, the time slots can probably extend to seven minutes but that includes the question and the answer.  If members could keep their questions short, it would give our guests more time to provide their expert answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  The advice to witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex does not apply today.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. McCormack and Ms Foreman.  They had written to us previously seeking to appear before the committee.  It just so happened that we had a meeting that could not take place and we were happy that they were available at short notice to come in to us.  Will Mr. McCormack make the opening statement?</p></speech>

Last year we helped with over 66 direct queries supporting new and existing gardens and advised on the setting up of school gardens.</p> <p>  In my case, I live in Blessington, County Wicklow.  My role here today is as chairperson of Community Gardens Ireland, and I am joined by Maeve Foreman.</p></speech>

Then I will hand back to Mr. McCormack, who will talk more about the "how".</p> <p>  I am from Mud Island community garden in Dublin's north inner city.  This is our tenth anniversary.  We are on land that was zoned for social housing and it is currently in the development plan to be rezoned as zone 9 for social amenity and green networking.  Its use during Covid was indispensable because it provided a safe outdoor space for use by local schools and groups.  One good example was our seed-to-pizza project with a couple of the local schools where the children came in, grew wheat from seed, watched it grow, tended it, learnt how to harvest it to mill flour, and then Mr. Tino Fusciardi from our local pizzeria came and showed them how to make pizza in our pizza oven.  Since then, many of them have brought their parents back into the garden.</p> <p>  As well as the obvious contribution that community gardens and allotments make to the national biodiversity action plan and the all-Ireland pollinator plan, to which Community Gardens Ireland contributes, the evidence-based benefits include positive impacts on physical and mental health.  There is a lot of evidence.  Some of the references on that are in the report that we have given to the committee.  There are also clear educational, cultural and social gains.  Gardens and allotments encourage active citizenship and social connection, and are ideally placed to receive referrals from the increasing number of social prescribers around the country.  The new national network of social prescribers is an indication of how that is increasing.</p> <p>   Urban agriculture initiatives such as community gardening are highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as assisting with reducing greenhouse gases, improving urban food security, improving biodiversity and adapting to climate change impacts.</p> <p>  Community gardens and allotments also offer a cost-effective accessible solution to improve health, strengthen community ties and build a more resilient nation.  Despite all of this, as Mr. McCormack will elaborate on, there is no countrywide policy in place to increase the number of allotments and community gardens.</p></speech>

Seventy-one per cent do not have a section on community growing on their websites and almost 89% do not operate a waiting list.<br/><br/>Compared to other countries, Ireland lags behind in the management, support and protection of allotments and community gardens.  Our report includes details of this with Germany, the UK, Denmark and other countries offering far more plots <i>per capita</i>than Ireland.<br/><br/>Other countries have also improved legislation surrounding the provision of allotments and community gardens.  Scotland and Wales require a government minister to formally approve if one is removed by a local authority and they have a duty to keep a waiting list and take action to ensure that local residents do not stay on them for long periods.<br/><br/>Our current legislation is weak and confusing.  There are no requirements for waiting lists in each local authority, which makes it difficult for local authorities to forecast or plan ahead for future use of land.<br/><br/>There are three primary items of legislation historically covering allotments in Ireland.  The first is the Labourers Cottages and Allotments (Ireland) Act 1882.  This provided a path for labourers to be assigned an allotment when a cottage was provided, with &quot;an allotment not exceeding half an acre&quot;.  This law remains in effect.<br/><br/>The second is the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Acts 1926 to 1934.  In 1926, local authorities were given the option to perform compulsory purchase orders for the purchase of land for allotments.  In the 1934 Act, specific assistance was given to those who could not afford to rent an allotment, making them affordable by law.  In 1994, the 1926 and 1934 acts were repealed.  Despite this, the Acts have been referenced in answers given to three separate parliamentary questions in 2009, 2011 and 2013 by Departments.  Local authorities still refer to the 1926 Act, such as in the Cork City Development Plan 2015-2021, which has not yet been replaced.  Community groups often refer to these Acts when requesting public land for allotments or community gardens.<br/><br/>The third is the Local Government Act 2001 and the Planning and Development Act (Amendment) 2010.  According to these Acts, local authorities &quot;may&quot; provide allotments.  The law has not caught up with the provision of community gardens as these are not defined in current legislation, and there is no condition of affordability.  In reality, there is no community growing law in Ireland.  Community growing projects may believe they have protection by law but this is not the case.<br/><br/>There has been a well-documented resurgence of interest in gardening and growing your own produce recently.  In our 2021 survey, however, we found that only 20% of allotments and community gardens are permanent.  In the same week that Santry community garden in Dublin was included in the top ten Green Flag winners worldwide, other community groups were removed from their growing spaces.  Given the demand for space in urban areas, we can see this situation repeating itself more frequently in the coming years.<br/><br/>Our report proposes the following: reform community growing legislation and issue guidance documents; put a clear duty on local authorities to provide or facilitate the provision of community growing spaces within five years; a minimum number of requests after which community growing spaces must be provided; require all local authorities to keep a waiting list; make it compulsory that community growing spaces must be kept affordable; ensure all local authorities include a policy or objective in their county development plan; consider items such as a community land trust and an Irish national community growers' forum; and set a target for the doubling the number of community growing spaces in Ireland by 2025.</p><p> Our report has the support of GIY Ireland, the Irish Seed Savers Association, Dublin Community Growers, and Social Farms &amp;amp; Gardens Northern Ireland.  We hope we have demonstrated the immense benefits that come from the provision of allotments and community gardens, and ask members to consider and implement these proposals.   Let us grow the number of community growing spaces throughout Ireland.</p></speech>

Ms Foreman comes from Mud Island in the north inner city.  It is in my constituency of Dublin Central.  I learned gardening from my granny and she came from a generation who grew to sustain themselves.  A garden is a happy and peaceful place to be.  One works at a pace that is less frenetic than the rest of our lives in the big city.</p> <p>  In the north inner city, it is not surprising that there are Mud Island and the Stoneybatter serenity garden.  Hardwicke Street flats have a project.  In Cabra by the Royal Canal at Liffey Junction, Cabra For Youth, of which I am a founding director, has a garden where there is intergenerational work.  Young people work with senior citizens and there is the sharing and education that Ms Foreman referred to.  De Courcy Square in Glasnevin is an old railed plot of land that was closed to residents for a long time but is now a great and vibrant garden.  It is hugely important.</p> <p>  I am happy to support Community Gardens Ireland's recommendations.  As a committee, we should support them.  Mr. McCormack mentioned the model in Scotland.  Will the witnesses talk about that?  What benefits does that have that would deliver for us?  From a city perspective, we have to formalise and champion community gardening.</p></speech>

In Wales in 2009, a review was performed of community growing initiatives because it was known that they were not being promoted enough and that, at a government level, not enough was being done.  A report came out from the Welsh Government in 2016 and from that came a list of guidance documents and recommendations as well as a clearing up of the legislation to make it easier for community groups to follow the law.  As we have shown, it can be difficult and confusing.  It took a long time to even find out there is legislation that is no longer in place.  The clearing up of that to make it simple and digestible is important.  Wales went a step further in 2021 by issuing a second version of these guidance documents.  Having that in place and constantly revising it is useful for community groups because as communities and cities grow there is an overall change in guidance, which is important.</p> <p>  Scotland did similar and set up a national community growing forum.  Members of allotment groups, community growers and all manner of urban agricultural schemes contributed to that and help to guide policy at a Scottish Government level.  They have highlighted the climate change impacts from allotments and community gardens.  There is a 2 kg to 5 kg reduction in carbon when food is grown locally.  They have referenced that and it is important to call it out for this committee.  They have put a waiting list in place so people do not stay on it for a long time.  Five years is what they recommended.  They have details for a minimum number of people who make requests to a local authority, at which point that authority must take action.  All these initiatives help the local communities and make it easier for them.</p> <p>  I am part of a group in Blessington which has been seeking land from Wicklow County Council for four years.  We have found some private land but are still seeking public land.  Blessington is surrounded by green fields.  There needs to be more emphasis and a time constraint put on this.  That is something we can learn from countries such as Scotland and Wales.</p></speech>

I think they will find a receptive audience in the committee.  We have all experienced good community gardens and allotments, but also the challenges they face.  In my constituency, we had to threaten legal action against the diocese, which was attempting to relinquish land which actually belonged to South Dublin County Council and was in use as a valuable community garden in Balgaddy.  Thankfully, it is still there and vibrant.  It is run by community volunteers and does a huge amount of work with young children who, in a built-up urban area, would never otherwise get the opportunity to get their hands dirty on seeds and plants.  We have some small pocket community gardens like in St. Mark's in north Clondalkin, where the council has been proactive supporting the local community.  However, volunteering and resourcing it has always been a challenge.  It depends.  In fairness to South Dublin County Council, we have some good community gardens like Corkagh Park, which proved successful.</p> <p>  The challenge is that local authorities do not always have land in the areas where it is needed, acquiring land is expensive and in the absence of that legal framework and Government policy, it is easy for councils to do less rather than more.  The strongest arguments the witnesses are bringing is not why community gardens are a good thing, but why we need that national policy and legislative framework.  I fully support that.</p> <p>  We can consider in private session on Tuesday whether to write to the Minister on foot of Community Gardens Ireland's recommendations and ask him to actively consider them.  That would be positive.  If the Minister was here and receptive, as I am sure he would be, to developing a State-wide policy to act as an overarching framework to push our local authorities on a bit better, what would the witnesses ask to see in it?</p> <p>  The good social housing projects in the early era of the State, whether by Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna F&aacute;il, Clann na Poblachta or the Labour Party, were all deliberately designed as garden villages.  The reason so many of our grandparents have long, thin back gardens is they were all allotments.  They were designed for people who grew their own vegetables.  It is not like we are doing something new; we are trying to remind people that this is how our public housing was developed in the past.  Given that it is always easier for the State to lead with its own projects, are there examples of other jurisdictions, whether Scotland, Wales or elsewhere in Europe, where, as a matter of principle, they fully integrate into public housing design and delivery a required amount of space for allotments or for people to have individual green-growing spaces?  There are some wonderful social housing projects being developed in England where, instead of having entries and alleyways behind, they have open communal spaces with community gardens that people share for growing vegetables and flowers.  Is there any additional information about that which the witnesses can share with us?  We would be particularly interested in that.</p></speech>

There is a strong need for legislative changes.  That was one of the main things we wanted to communicate.  There should be a waiting list in each local authority.  It would make sense for it to be purely at a local authority level or even, perhaps, at a municipal district level.  Being from Blessington, I am in the Baltinglass Municipal District.  It is 72 km from the top to the bottom so if I was offered an allotment in Carnew or Baltinglass, there would not be the carbon benefit we mentioned.  It needs to be kept local.  We would look for a plan to be put in place for each urban area.  It may not be a case of the local authority providing land; we have proposed it provides or facilitates the use of land.  There are a number of State bodies with access to land.</p><p>What we feel would make it better for communities is if they went through a single party, which would be the local authority, and it can be the conduit for those requests to go through.  Again, we are just talking about simplifying the process.</p><p> In terms of other actions, we think it is important for guidance documents to be issued to landowners to make them more familiar with what allotments are and what the legal status is, and also to make them more assured that they will be able to access the land in the future.  We have called out examples in Scotland and Wales that relate to compulsory purchase orders but also to compulsory hiring orders, something we do not have in place in Ireland.  That would be in regard to hiring for a certain amount of time, after which the landowner would be able to retain ownership.  Again, that is something for the committee to review.</p><p> We said that having a waiting list is very important, but also having a set target.  We suggested doubling the number of allotments and community gardens by 2025.  If we do not have a target, it is a bit aimless and there is no plan in place.  We think having something like that would be essential.</p><p> With regard to Cork City Council, while the Deputy is talking about other jurisdictions, it included as part of its city development plan references to its apartment standards, where it is including a recommendation for allotments, roof gardens and son on.  We have not seen that in other local development plans and that was the main area where we have seen it.  The council stated that rooftop spaces should be put to productive use for either green roofs, blue roofs, solar energy, communal rooftop gardens, communal multi-use games areas, MUGAs, or communal allotments.  I have not seen anything specifically calling out a design standard but that is the closest to it.</p></speech>

It is essential that the planning insists that any large development includes a certain amount of green space.</p> <p>  Looking at the difficulties the Deputy has had, many of the most successful projects come from the ground up, where there are volunteers working with the council.  The need is there, and there is ample evidence of the need for these growing projects across the island of Ireland.  To have councils working with existing bodies of people who have expressed that need is the way to go.</p></speech>

The all-Ireland pollinator plan and the national biodiversity action plans are key strategies to help us protect and enhance biodiversity across Ireland.  I gather from the presentations that the witnesses&rsquo; concerns relate to nationwide plans not being necessarily supported by the roll-out of nationwide policies to underpin them.  That seems to be in respect of allotments and community gardens.  I would love to hear their views on what we could do to counteract that.</p> <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my own local authority, South Dublin County Council, where the director of services, Teresa Walsh, and her team have been bringing biodiversity to life for many years.  Pollinator friendly zone signs can be seen in all of my local parks at this stage, for example, Rathcoole Park, Corkagh Park, Griffeen Valley Park, Lucan Demesne and Waterstown Park.  Schools in Clondalkin have recently undertaken the development of gardens, with Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de and St. Mary's in Rowlagh partnering up with both Clondalkin Tidy Towns and the Dodder Valley Action Group to plant trees in their own school gardens.  The girls in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Community College in Lucan have embarked on a fundraising campaign to raise money to develop Rosie's garden there, which is in memory of Sr. Rosario.  We have great community gardens and allotments, as Ms Foreman said, in places like Corkagh Park, and the Clondalkin Men's Shed is also using an allotment in Fonthill.</p> <p>  This was a great way to keep people occupied at the time when Covid regulations loosened but people still could not be indoors.  Covid and lockdown gave all of us the opportunity to take stock, take a step back and really appreciate nature more.  We saw more people than ever using our parks and getting involved in gardening.  These are all positives because they are the kinds of things that can have a real and lasting effect when it comes to biodiversity and things like our bee population.</p> <p>  I was particularly interested in what Ms Foreman said around communal rooftop gardens.  As she said, like plants themselves, these strategies work best when they come from the ground up.  I would be very interested to hear what kinds of strategies and policies we could put in place nationally that would incorporate and allow for communal rooftop gardens to become naturally part of not just the design of buildings but of the community and the culture of all those living in buildings.</p></speech>

Even simple tasks like putting a section on their websites about community growing, allotments and community gardens would be positive.  We found that a large number do not have information on their websites, which is not beneficial to local communities.  That would be an easy task and it could be done at a local authority level.</p> <p>  For rooftop gardens, it is down to planning.  We think that having that included as an objective for local authorities would be very easily performed and could be done.  We made a submission recently to the Dublin City Council city development plan process which referenced the good work that is being done in Cork city.  We think that is something that could be mirrored across other local authorities.</p></speech>

It also has as an objective to increase by 100% the number of allotments in Dublin.  If more county councils could be encouraged to include objectives similar to that in their development plan, it would be one step forward.</p></speech>

Some allotments are literally that.  A certain number of people can apply for and get a plot of a certain size, or a half a plot, and grow produce for themselves and their family.  However, most allotment sites have a community element.  In St. Anne&rsquo;s Park, where there are individual allotments, two or three have been banded together, and that is a community garden element.  People who do not have an allotment or do not have the time or energy to give to it can take part in the community garden element, and they grow a mixture of vegetables and flowers and have a sitting area and a communal social area.  In community gardens like my own, we grow everything collectively.  We have a planting group which plans the year, and the produce is shared by everybody who comes and works in the garden.  We are purely communal and collective, although many plots have a little of both.  De Courcy Square, which was mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick, is individual allotments owned by people of the square but they also have a community garden element.</p></speech>

For example there is a new garden in Waterford called Top of the City, which has developed allotments that individuals have, but there is a huge communal element.  They have a stage for performances, a picnic area for people and they hold markets on a Saturday, so it is a hybrid.</p></speech>

Even in our own area on private land in Blessington we have a compost area but we do not have one compost area for each plot, rather we share it.

This is a great news story.  I studied horticulture and I have had an allotment.  I grow my own vegetables.  I have a great interest in this area.  As Ms Foreman said, Covid brought into sharp focus a desire for safe open spaces where people can meet in friendship, to engage in horticulture and grow items or to simply to be an observer.  The reasons are diverse.  She put her finger on it when she said all these community gardens have their own personalities and within that, there is a whole load of personalities as she will well know.  I have been to places where there are disputes over plots and bits of land in allotments, I have seen communal gardens where people share the produce and there also are individuals who like to work on their own.  I am not sure if the witnesses are familiar with Festina Lente, which was a substantial piece of ground in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, out in the Rathmichael direction, but it was never developed.  A wonderful organisation, Festina Lente, hasten slowly, which provided sheltered employment opportunities for people with disabilities, had so much ground that it put allotments around it but now those people have been forced out because developers want the land.  There is always that demand.  That loss is regrettable.  Having looked at the UK model, I am familiar with the one in Battersea where the people convinced the council to change the land zoning.  It was very positive in terms of mental health and many other issues.  People said this was positive news.  The council switched that piece of land for another piece of land because it knew it could not recreate what the people had there.  I am convinced this is a great idea.  There are different models for different places just as there are different horses for different courses.</p> <p>  A big issue I have learned from my knowledge of and involvement in community gardens is that we also need to talk about community gardeners, about people who lead where leadership and skills are required.  I visited a place in south County Dublin where there were approximately 40 allotments, half of which had gone seed and were abandoned.  When I asked why that had happened, I was told that other than growing cabbage and potatoes, the people did not know how to grow anything else.  They did not have the skill set.  There is a need for local authorities to employ a community gardener to assist people.  People bring different levels of skills to different places.  I would like to hear more about that proposal.  I have looked at the Scottish model, which Mr. McCormack referenced in his presentation.  It seems to have worked very well in Scotland and Wales.  I know they are great gardeners but I am now convinced we have become even greater gardeners, certainly in the past two years.  There is massive new interest in gardening and growing and the fact that people are out in the air and have their hands in the soil.  It is organic.  There is something to be had by putting one's hands directly into the soil and growing items.  That is a positive development.</p> <p>  We do not have agricultural committees in Dublin any more.  We used to have county agricultural committees.  That was a missed opportunity.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and as in the case of Fingal and south Dublin, there are agricultural lands right up to the county areas of the city but we do not have agricultural committees as such.  What are the witnesses' view on community gardeners, leaders or advocates who would assist people who want to gain knowledge?  One learns in gardening from making mistakes.  There is need for such assistance.  I am familiar with community land trusts in the UK.  They work really well.  What is the witnesses' experience, if any, of community land trusts and how can we develop them?  I do not want to move responsibility for such provision from central government to local government but I believe the bulk of this can all be driven at local government level.  It is about connectivity, subsidiarity and meeting the needs of the people in local communities.  I am 100% supportive of community gardens.  We needs loads more of them.  The witnesses might share with the committee their experience of community land trusts and how they work.</p></speech>

There are many good examples around Dublin city and around Ireland of different models.  Cherry Orchard is a community garden managed by the local partnership company and it has employed a horticulturist, Peadar Lynch, who used to be chair of Dublin Community Growers.  He runs an excellent garden and he is available there with his expertise.  That community garden has a market.  The growers sell local produce they grow in the local area.  That is one model.  There is another community garden in Finglas that has a full-time employee who is a horticulturist and has some T&uacute;s workers working with him and in that way people are learning horticultural skills.  There are both elements there.  Some people have their own allotments, there is a community garden element and a paid worker.  In my own case in Mud Island we are all volunteers and we have learned as we have gone on.  We brought in expertise.  We got a compost master to come in and show us about composting.  In the case of another garden near us, the north east inner city community garden which is called Farmers Hill, once that community garden had a certain number of people, the education and training board provided a horticulturist to go into it once a week and work with the people over a whole growing season and they learned a great deal from her.  That is something education and training boards will provide.  Dee Sewell, who was involved in setting up Community Gardens Ireland is another full-time horticulturist working in the Carlow area and she is employed by the local authority to work with and support local growing projects to get off the ground, some in schools and some attached to NGOs.  There are loads of models.  An area I want to visit, which I have just heard about, is Cloontuskert, County Roscommon, which is an old Bord na M&oacute;na village.  The local Tidy Towns committee led in developing a community orchard and garden and growing projects in schools.  There are some lovely models around Ireland, each with their own personality.  We should probably compile an overview of the different models.</p></speech>

That provision has been in place since 1908.  While we referenced Scotland and Wales because they have a similar climate, Denmark in 2001 made all its allotments and community gardens permanent overnight because it thought that they would be removed.</p> <p>  In terms of community land trusts, we know that in Scotland community land trusts are 90% funded.  That could be considered for Ireland.  Currently, we are not aware of any grants available for the purchase of land.  All the grants exclude major funding such as land purchase.  That is why we think a model such as community land trusts could put access to land back into the hands of communities.</p></speech>

The Green Party has the next time slot, which I will take.  I have a few questions.</p> <p>I will start with the legislation as that is how things work and how we can get things done.  To take up on what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, of course, we are very receptive to this initiative.  Everybody is very receptive to allotments and community gardeners and thinks they are a good idea but getting such projects implemented is the difficulty.  I know that from experience.  Three items of legislation were referenced.  The Labourers Cottages and Allotments (Ireland) Act 1882 was rarely if ever used I would say in the past 100 years.  Therefore, we should get rid of that one.  The Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Acts 1926 and 1934 were repealed.  Therefore, we get rid of that one.  That brings us on to the Local Government Act and the Planning and Development Act, under which local authorities may provide allotments.  In my experience when we insert the word "may" into legislation, we can be up against it but if we change the word "may" to "shall", we have more momentum behind us.  We might consider wording along the lines of "shall provide allotments provided there is demonstrable demand for them".  Mr. McCormack spoke about facilitating provision.  It is one of the organisation's recommendations.  Recommendation 1C of Community Gardens Ireland's report states a clear duty should "be placed on local authorities to provide or facilitate provision of community growing spaces within 5 years".  To facilitate that, are the witnesses talking about identifying land, either public or private, or zoning land and holding it?  When preparing a local area plan is the land zoned first to expect the demand or is the demand catalogued and a decision made to zone some land there?  How does one do it?  Those are the practicalities and that is what we want to assist with.</p></speech>

The site we are on is quite small.  It was zoned residential.</p><p>It was a residential block that was demolished on site and then left derelict.  It was an eyesore.  The council allocated, on an 11-month renewable licence with a compulsory vacate for a month, the land to Mud Island Community Garden on a third of the site, the Larkin Unemployed Centre has a horticultural course there on a third of the site and the rest the council keeps vacant.</p><p> The area we live in has the lowest tree canopy in the country, let alone the city.  Since it became a useful green space, it now has in its development plan suggested that it be rezoned from one to nine, reflecting the use of it over the past ten years and the success of the use of it over the past ten years.  The rezoning is happening.</p></speech>

That is the other thing, this meanwhile use of handing out a derelict piece of land to local community gardens is great for three, four or five years, until the landowner then says that they want to develop it now or the local authority says that it now has a need for the land to go back into housing.  Suddenly, one has ended up in this situation where one has to evict the community gardeners from a site they have put loads of work into for four or five years.</p></speech>

For example, there is the case of Weaver&rsquo;s Square in Dublin, where the council needed to take it back because it was zoned for housing.  It was an ideal site for housing.  However, it replaced it with a few smaller sites.  There were not as many allotments as there were in Weaver&rsquo;s Square, but at least the council worked with the gardeners and gave them something to replace it.</p></speech>

First off, increasing that number would be something that would be fantastic to come out of this committee.  A figure of 20% is incredibly low, and it shows the risk for many of the other gardens that are out there.</p> <p>  In terms of the question about having the word "shall" in there, this is not just about allotments, it is also about allotments and community gardens.  Therefore, it should have some type of definition around community growing spaces or something along those lines.  We were having this discussion beforehand, and when it comes to more built-up areas, allotments might not actually be feasible because there could be too many people who want to use a certain space.  Having something that could be provided which could be community gardens instead of allotments might be a bit more preferable.  However, some type of emphasis needs to be put on local authorities to achieve that.</p> <p>  I cannot remember if it is in the development plan or not, but Dublin City Council has committed to carry out an audit of all green space areas to see which lands could be used for allotments or community gardens.  Doing that on a five- or ten-year basis would be quite good because once the waiting list is set up, that is the data required and then the review can be done and the demand in the local area is known.  Doing that on a frequent basis would be a good action for local authorities to undertake.  It is not just looking at their own land; it is looking at all available land in the area as well and trying to see if there are other State-owned bodies that they would be able to use or use their land or have a partnership approach with them that they provide for a certain number of years.</p> <p> Looking at Denmark again, it has classified permanent gardens and non-permanent gardens.  That is something which could end up being the result of this, namely, that they are defined and there is a risk associated with some meanwhile uses.  What we want is those cases where evictions will happen is for a solution to be put place beforehand.  It is quite reasonable for allotments and community gardens to be provided with a solution well in advance and for consultation to be there.  Having some sort of right of local communities to be able to access land would be very useful.</p></speech>

It very impressive.  However, I have seen much smaller patches as well.  In general terms of allotments, it is not a huge space we are talking about much of the time.  Can Mr. McCormack put it in perspective for us?  What is the size of a plot?</p></speech>

The ones we have in Blessington are 20 sq. m each, which is small, but it is a nice place to start off with.  Fingal has between 50 to 250 sq. m and South Dublin County Council is the same.  It depends on the amount of land is available.  Some gardeners prefer to start off in a small plot and then once they have the knowledge built up over a certain number of years, they might expand to a larger plot for allotments.  It varies down to the site, down to the people and down to the knowledge and skill set as well.</p></speech>

In my local area, there are two very successful community gardens, in Baldoyle and Bayside.  Both of them have transformed the local communities way beyond the people who are involved.  It has actually had a transformative effect in terms of people feeling safer in the area, feeling happier, more people getting to know each other and other activities falling out of that.  When I think of Bayside as a community and how much it has transformed over the past ten years through that, it is incredible.  It has done it through existing green open spaces that were underutilised.  It has put in a winter garden and a community orchard.  It did not require getting new land or identifying extra land or anything like that, it was in a very settled community where there was not any new land available.  It was about using existing spaces in a better way.  Interestingly, when it started, there was a bit of reaction because people are used things always being the same way, so not everybody was happy.  However, I think at this point there would be massive support in the local community for the work it has done.  From that, other things have fallen out of it.  For example, the community next to it looks at all of the things Bayside is doing and thinks it would like to have a boules court in our area that gets the local community together.</p> <p>  In Baldoyle, for example, the communal spaces are very good.  It has a stage area for performances, a boules court and a barbecue area.  The communal areas are very important.  In Baldoyle, it was bringing the newer communities together with the existing community and integrating people.  It is very useful for people who are living without their own gardens and also just for people who want to form those kind of social bonds.  That part of it is very important.</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on the legislation on this?  I absolutely understand the value of individual plots as well and if they are integrated into some form of communal or shared space, that can work very well.  Is there a way, in terms of legislative reform, of putting in the value of the community space or communal parts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Foreman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030100002#F01500"><p>That is an interesting one to answer.  In our own case, a local group formed and we wanted a growing project; some wanted allotment and some wanted a community garden.  Dublin City Council at the time had a waiting list and said that if it is allotments, no one will get one because there were 400 people on the waiting list.  That decided on a community garden for us.  Initially, we were only about growing food.  The community element that the Deputy talked about evolved over time.  Just ten years on, we have changed our constitution to recognise that the social and recreational element is equally as important as the food growing element.  We now have two stages, a barbecue and a pizza oven and many social and arts events in the garden.  It evolved organically.  I do not know if one can dictate that element.  It comes out of the community working together.</p> <p>  There are loads of examples of that idea of using existing spaces.  There is a new garden getting off the ground in Killester called the Back Lane because it is a back lane that they are taking over.  There is another one in Donnycarney called Mucky Lane, which was just a bit of open space between two areas that was underutilised.  The council was happy for the local residents to farm that space and make a garden out of it.  It is getting the balance between the community and the local authority or whoever owns the land, such as the church or the HSE, working together and being open to that community element.  I do not think that it can be dictated.</p></speech>

From what I have seen as well, people can often get involved because they want a bit of a plot themselves and from that community builds over time.  It might be something that should be part of policy or something and should be encouraged or fostered.  I absolutely take Ms Foreman's point that that is not necessarily where things start.  Mucky Lane, which is in my constituency, was an area that people walked through.  It was an area that-----</p></speech>

That has totally transformed that area.  The knock-on effects of people feeling safe or having ownership over their area, and not feeling demoralised by litter or whatever but having the opposite reaction are huge.  There are massive benefits.</p> <p>  On the legislative side, is there anything else the witnesses want to say in terms of legislative reform?  What needs to be done there?  Where do we start in terms of legislative reform?</p></speech>

I had a look last night and saw there are references by Kildare County Council and Dublin City Council.  It is everywhere.  There does not seem to have been any communication as to why the previous laws have been repealed.  The fact that they are still being referred to implies strongly in my view that there needs to be a community growing law to replace that.  I suppose that is where I am coming from at the start.  Mentioning that in all manner of policies and things should not be happening, particularly when it was 1994.  It was not like it happened last year.</p> <p>  Regarding other parts of legislation, I think we covered most of it in terms of having a waiting list and a clear requirement for local authorities to provide some measure of a timeline.  We recommended five years.  Again, that is what Scotland has in its legislation so we are copying what it has.</p> <p>  We were discussing that there is a potential to amend the Local Government Act 2001 rather than having bespoke legislation on this.  Allotments are detailed in the 2001 Act.  That could, therefore, be something for the committee to look at as well rather than having its own legislation.  I think that pretty much covers it.  The whole point really is to make it easier for communities at the end of the day.  That is all we want.  We should not have to wait.  Some communities have been waiting ten years for lands, which is an obscene amount of time.  South Dublin County Council last year defined its waiting list as being ten years for someone who is on it.</p></speech>

In my area, Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council have been very good on this but it is individuals who are opposed to it necessarily happening.  There is something to be said as well, though, when there is a limited supply of land for the smaller plots or community gardens.  If there is more land, then, sure, have larger allotments but if it is confined, that is different.</p></speech>

One is to tell the witnesses how supportive we are of it and the other is to name all the community gardens in each of our constituencies.  I will try to live up to the challenge previous colleagues have set.</p> <p>  I think everyone in the room agrees with this because of how important it is and because of practical experience.  I do not think that is a new, woke or middle class thing.  This has been with us for a long time.  My grandfather had what we used to call a plot in Dunsink.  Many rural people who came up to live in the new suburbs in Dublin often had access to these types of plots.  In his case, it was something to help supplement the income of the family.  When it came to March each year, the whole house would be turned into a shamrock-bagging operation or there would be potatoes - whatever we happened to be doing.  It has been with us for a long time.</p> <p>  The second thing is that we have all seen the practical benefits of these often unused and underutilised pieces of land being turned into a community gain.  In some ways, the fight is part of the formation of the group; not that one would leave it there for that reason.  I have seen very strong groups emerge out of it, however.  Santry Demesne is probably one of the strongest groups in my area.  It is one of the most independent as a result but it is also supported by the local authority.  I was involved in the Ballymun farmers' market and also in setting up Greenview community garden, which the witnesses referenced, with the T&uacute;s scheme.  I can, therefore, see all the benefits.</p> <p>  Let me talk about some concerns I have because the idea of community markets is a similar area.  Increasingly, casual trading is not used for the provision of community markets but instead, it is done under an events licence.  The reason for that is the regulations and responsibilities around casual trading are quite onerous.  They can be restrictive and do not allow the market to express that personality Mr. McCormack talked about.  One fear I have is that we could over-regulate the space and interfere with the creativity of the gardens and allotments.  I wonder whether legislation is necessarily the answer for the operational side.  We should be fearful of that.</p> <p>  One example in Ballymun that is really useful is Muck and Magic community garden, which is brilliant.  Ballymun was unique because we had sites that we were retaining for owner-occupied homes to provide a better mix in the community.  Lands were set aside until that came on stream.  The "meanwhile" use has ended up being approximately a decade.  Now that those tools have come on board with both cost-rental and affordable purchase housing, we are going to move Muck and Magic community garden, with its full agreement and co-operation, over to the other side of Ballymun where we are building an affordable purchase site in order that we can build a cost-rental site on the Muck and Magic community garden site.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right; public housing policy is really key here.  What we want to do on the Balbutcher Lane site is to go much further and develop a city farm, which is a whole different kettle of fish.</p> <p>  Housing policy is an area in which we should be looking at legislation.  On the Balbutcher Lane site, we are looking at the 20% open green space as being one opportunity to protect land.  This comes back to the question of our definition of open green space and biodiversity.  I encourage the witnesses heavily to engage with the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss.  We have acres of parkland that is beautifully landscaped grass.  Much of it could easily be transferred for smaller-use plots.  Many of our public parks could easily accommodate more allotments.   They are already owned by the council and insurance and all those issues are covered.  If one is covered in potato plants rather than grass, does that detract from the public domain?  We need to have a conversation about that.</p> <p>  Dublin City Council did a very good persuasion exercise with our Tidy Towns group where it said that if we do not cut the grass, that is not a bad thing.  That is not the council letting the Tidy Towns down, it is about increasing biodiversity.  Now, there is a fine line there as well.  However, the people it persuaded first were those in the Tidy Towns groups because they would be the first people to telephone the council to say it did not cut the grass and, therefore, let the place go.  Instead, the council empowered them and gave them training as pollinators and so forth.</p> <p>  We need to have a huge debate around our public park space and how we could better use that.  That does pose a challenge for ownership.  Sometimes community gardens are about giving people ownership but the downside of that is that they can go from being inclusive to exclusive.  Councils are notoriously afraid of giving anything more than a licence to anybody because a committee can become defunct and a space can then be locked out from the public rather than locked in.</p> <p>  I would be supportive and we could do much good work in this space as a committee.  The problem is that we keep coming up with ideas on what to do thanks to witnesses coming in.  My fear is that we could over-regulate them.  If we even look at Mud Island community garden, would Dublin City Council ever have given that to Community Gardens Ireland if it thought it was getting it permanently?</p></speech>

As it is a first for Dublin, people might be aware of the Bridgefoot Street park.  Eventually, because of local campaigns, it was decided to make it into a park because that area of Dublin was really low on green spaces.  An element of the park is to have a community garden.  That will be a permanent community garden.  Likewise, moving Muck and Magic community garden over to Poppintree to be part of the city farm is giving that garden an element of permanency.  In both cases, strong local groups were involved in the running of it.  Farmers Hill community garden in my area of the north-east inner city is another example.  That was a garden on a temporary space, which the council took back.  There is development going on and it is giving half of the space back to Farmers Hill as a permanent garden.</p></speech>

She said there was already a waiting list for it and that if that had happened, her group would have been locked out of that space.  It would not, therefore, have had the same ownership of that space.  An idea or solution Ms Foreman suggested, for example, a standardised waiting list or some sort of waiting list, could in some ways limit the local ownership if it is an area-wide waiting list.</p><p>We need to be careful about interfering too much, although that is not to say we should not support it.</p></speech>

Where there is a will and a willingness on the part of the local authority areas, such as in Back Lane and Mucky Lane, we can make good use, as the Deputy noted, of these idle spaces that are no good to anybody.  As for pollinating and biodiversity, it is better that they are not just flat grass but rather that they be grown on.  We need more and more models such as that in Bridgefoot Street.  There are many areas throughout the country such as Cloontuskert, County Roscommon, where the community garden is in a corner of a public park, so it is open.  Serenity community garden, which is on a corner plot, is another garden that is open to the public.  The origins of it relate to a homeless man having been found dead in the bushes there, and there was a desire to do something in his memory and to make better use of the spot.  There are many good examples of sites where the best use of them is as a community garden.</p></speech>

It is an interesting point Deputy McAuliffe made about the legislation.  If the legislation is too confining in respect of the management and use of the land, I can see how that might stifle the creativity and communal aspect.  On the other hand, if the legislation is clear on the provision of those spaces, that will be a different matter.  One relates to legislating to provide, while the other relates to legislating to control.  The provision part is where we need to concentrate, in my opinion.</p></speech>

We need to put some rights in place for local communities and that is something that can be provided for.  I mentioned earlier the idea of community growing spaces and having some flexibility in the definition, rather than just saying there must be an allotment, as is the case in England and Wales.  Having flexibility to reflect the needs of the community is important.  There is a balance to be struck but having some additional rights for local communities can only help them.  I agree that being too prescriptive might stifle the potential in some ways.  There are good examples that could be used from some of the community gardens we mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  I am a chartered engineer, so I always look for design standards.  One issue I would think about relates to wheelchair-friendly raised beds, for example.  That is something on which it would be very easy to be given guidance, and it should not be done at just one local authority level.  It could be done for all local authorities because it would be very easy to do.  Something along those lines could be done on an all-Ireland level.</p> <p>  Having some sort of right for local communities will prompt a better response, whereby we will not have to wait ten years or possibly longer for some communities to deliver.</p></speech>

Our survey, which was carried out in 2021, was indicative, but we can apply its findings to allotments and community gardens.  They could be removed for other purposes, given there is no defined right in any legislation for local communities to be given a community growing space in the first instance.  By all means, given very few are defined as permanent, they could be removed.</p></speech>

My father's house, in Knocknaheeny, has a fine big backyard, and many houses that were built 70, 80 or 90 years ago have big front and back gardens.  Nowadays, however, especially in the case of city developments, apartments and even some of the regeneration projects in Knocknaheeny, where I come from, there are no front gardens, just a driveway for a car, in some cases only a couple of feet in front of the property.  In response, the planning system has favoured higher densities but that has a consequence for open green spaces.  Some great work is being done by volunteers and some areas are getting good funding but there is an awful lot of work to be done.</p> <p>  In many areas, especially working-class areas where there is much social housing, people might work shifts and weekends.  They do not have their Saturdays off to go and work in a community garden.  Moreover, some local authorities, which may be under severe pressure in regard to funding, do not have enough staff to work in parks and recreational areas, to maintain these green areas and community gardens and to get them up to spec.  That is a real concern.  The areas that have the volunteers and funding will have beautiful green spaces and community gardens, and the areas that do not, which probably need the funding most, will not.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, some gardens work really well where they are led by a horticulturist and where training is provided.  The garden beside Mud Island is run by the Larkin Unemployed Centre and there is a horticultural course for unemployed men.  Having finished that, they can go on to the National Botanic Gardens and undertake further education.  The hope is that, beyond that, they will find employment.  There are many different models out there.  Some are top-heavy with volunteers, while others are top-heavy with trained workers and supporters.</p> <p>  The Greystones-Kilcoole garden, which the Deputy mentioned, is on private land and has been in existence in for the guts of ten years.  I understand the people concerned were locked out of the garden with little or no notice.  If there had been a commitment on the part of the council to providing growing spaces, that could have been anticipated and, perhaps, they could have been moved to other land.  The other garden whose operators have been told their licence will not be renewed is the Growery in Birr.  I am not sure whether the committee will be aware of that but it has been in existence for a long time and the garden is very successful.  Its operators, too, have been told they will have to move on, in June.</p></speech>

He was asked about funding and support for men's sheds and he said money will always be available for community gardens and similar initiatives under Healthy Ireland.  If only 20% of these gardens are permanent, are we funding ones that may soon shut?  If we are putting funding into gardens that are not permanent, that does not make sense.  We want gardens to be permanent and, therefore, as more and more funding is put in, there will be a better community garden and a better green space and it will grow with the community.  The Minister of State is saying funding is available, but if 80% of the gardens are not permanent, is that financially prudent given that in one, two, three or ten years in some cases, the community garden will be gone?</p></speech>

When we carried out our survey, we examined whether gardens or allotments had a rolling licence, and many of them had an 11-month or two-year licence, or something along those lines.  The issue relates to the fact very few have longer leases, and one of the larger grants that can be applied for &ndash; I am not sure whether it is LEADER funding or the urban regeneration and development fund - requires a seven-year lease to be in place before it can be applied for.</p><p>There are larger funding models that gardens cannot apply for because they have not been around for long enough.</p></speech>

If a lease is longer than five years, the tenant has the option to renew it.  If it is for less than five years, the tenant has to leave if the landowner asks.  As such, what Mr. McCormack said makes sense.</p> <p>  Complimentary comments were made about Cork City Council.  I can be critical of local authorities.  This is especially true of Cork City Council, where I was a member for nearly 12 years, but it does great work.  It is good that meetings on the Cork city development plan are happening at the moment.  The witnesses mentioned apartment or rooftop gardens and open spaces.  Other countries are decades ahead of us in this respect.  It is good that Cork City Council is holding these meetings but it is a pity that not all local authorities are being so proactive.</p> <p>  The Cork food policy and working with the council have been mentioned.  Touching on Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point about green spaces, there are a large number of planning applications now.  I come from Knocknaheeny.  When it was built 50 years ago, there was nothing there &ndash; no green spaces, parks, playgrounds, schools, churches or shopping centres.  At the height of the Celtic tiger 15 or 20 years ago, houses were being built without sustainable planning for communities, including green spaces and community gardens.  I have serious concerns that the Government and developers are now trying to maximise density and that this will cause harm through not having enough green spaces.  We must be planning communities, not just houses or apartments.  We can see what Cork City Council is doing.</p> <p>  Targets were mentioned.  It is important that we set ourselves goals because they can be measured against.  The witnesses could then appear before us once per year and we could have a discussion on how we have done over the preceding 12 months.  We could invite local authorities to say how they had done.  We can work on this hand in hand.</p> <p>  I appreciate that the Chairman has given me latitude, but the planning issue here is the importance of community gardens and green spaces.  I wish to give a shout-out to people in Hollyhill in my constituency.  There is a lovely community garden there, but the same should be found in all communities.  Have the witnesses concerns about whether enough consideration is being given to green spaces and community gardens in new planning applications?</p></speech>

There are no design standards for how many allotments or community gardens should be provided for a certain number of requests, a certain population or a new development.  If 400 houses are being provided, there is not even a recommendation for a certain number of allotments or community gardens to be provided.  Having such a guideline would not stifle planning too much and would give an indication to developers to plan such areas accordingly.  Everyone knows that, if they are not planned for at the start, it is ridiculously hard to shoehorn them in afterwards.  That is common sense.</p> <p>  Regarding targets, something that we did not mention but that is probably important is that, in 2008, London set a target of increasing the number of community growing spaces it provided by 2012.  Working with different communities and all political parties, London achieved that.  If there is one point that is taken from today's meeting, it should be that having a target for all of the country &ndash; Ireland is small &ndash; would be beneficial.  We could learn from the London experience.</p></speech>

We are not talking about a great deal of money.  It costs thousands of euro, not tens of thousands.  This would buy soil if necessary, a bit of wood for raised beds and plants.  If volunteers want to work a space, they do not need much money to develop it.</p></speech>

I am the chairman of St. Vincent's Hurling and Football Club.  Our treasurer, Mr. Kenneth Collins, who is a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor in Cork, is working with Cork City Council to designate a part of our sporting complex as an area of biodiversity.  We are always looking to keep everything trim and tidy &ndash; the pitches, the land around them and the banks &ndash; and it looks beautiful, but as we learn more about biodiversity, perhaps GAA clubs, soccer clubs, rugby clubs and other sporting organisations should be looking at doing something else where they have land that they do not use for training.  It could be along the side or a corner that is rocky or soft for most of the year.  As part of a good initiative, we are working with Cork City Council and have pinpointed an area that we will now let grow wild.  We are also working with the council on planting trees.  This is another good initiative.  I would like to see it being rolled out to all sporting organisations with green spaces.  Consider how many sporting clubs Ireland has.  Sporting organisations should be encouraged to get on board with this.  For example, the GAA has Croke Park.  It would not cost much money.  We were always so keen to have everything tidy and prim, but now we know that biodiversity and working with nature are something we need to pursue for the health of the planet and our communities.</p></speech>

We have lost touch with biodiversity.  There is the Tidy Towns notion that towns need to be neat, trim and tidy but I believe it should be "Wild Biodiverse Towns".  We have a ways to go just yet, though.  We have become detached from food to a certain extent - we have lost that relationship.  Food is now something that is purchased in the supermarket.  As Deputy McAuliffe said, food growing fed families and might have supplemented their incomes many years ago.  We might see carrots on sale for 49 cent per kilo, but when we try to grow a kilo of carrots ourselves, we realise that there is a gap and someone is losing out badly if those carrots are on a shelf in the supermarket for 49 cent or whatever it might be.  There is a great deal of work involved.</p> <p>  Not only is there the important communal aspect of community gardens &ndash; five-year-olds or six-year-olds can be out there gardening alongside their great-grandmothers, grandmothers or whatever they might be and sharing that skill set &ndash; but recreating connectivity with food is also a part of it.  This is where our food comes from.  It grows an awareness around biodiversity and the food chain.  There is also the carbon aspect, in that anything that grows sucks in carbon.  That is the natural cycle.  There are a number of aspects through which this matter can be approached.</p> <p>  We are all behind this concept &ndash; the witnesses have heard many times that we all support it &ndash; but I want to discuss the practicalities of what we can do.  We have examined the legal issues and I have jotted down a number of recommendations from the witnesses' report and today's discussion.  If ten or 15 people approached a municipal district or local authority and said they wanted a community garden or allotments, what resistance would there usually be from the local authority?</p></speech>

The council tells people that they can do it if they find a suitable bit of land.  That is exactly what I have heard before.  People go searching but they cannot find any, or if they return with three or four options, they are told that those lands have been earmarked for something else or the council is not quite sure what it is doing with that road over the next 20 years, for example, so it cannot do anything there.  Is Ms Foreman saying that we should put the onus on the local authority to say where the land is?  It would be plan led rather than community garden developer led.</p></speech>

We had to get a petition signed by all the residents who were potentially going to be affected by having that site developed as a garden to show their support for it.  The council wanted to know we were an organised group.  We had to have a committee, a constitution, public liability insurance in place and a bank account.  We had to prove our worth as an organised group before the council was willing to work with us.</p> <p>  When people approach Community Gardens Ireland saying they want to start a garden and have identified a potential site, we have loads of information on our website to help them get organised so they are an acceptable entity for the local authority to deal with. </p></speech>

On the biodiversity side, the very last page of the document was designed on purpose.  It shows a sunflower I grew in my plot, which has three different types of pollinators on it.  I am calling that out as one of the things we included for that purpose.  We believe there is a massive biodiversity benefit.  It is not just us.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its report yesterday, called out community gardens as a beneficial action for climate change and everything else.</p> <p>  On planning, I am aware the Oxford urban farming workshop, held at the start of January, had speakers from France who came from a different level with a more top-down approach.  As social enterprises, they performed reviews of cities and then went to local authorities to say these were the lands they believed were available for community growing.  There are a number of different ways of going about it.  What Ms Foreman has described is local authorities generally saying, "Great, off you go".  We are aware that the Land Development Agency website has the State land database on it, which has been useful to send to some community groups, where people are able to see what State-owned land is in their local areas, whether it is CI&Eacute; land or anything else.</p> <p>  Ms Foreman has probably covered most of the major issues.  We are, however, aware of one thing that came from the group.  We had regular meetings with Social Farms and Gardens in Northern Ireland to consider different issues and to explore how we work together.  One of the issues that came up in the North and the South was the lack of availability in getting a bank account, which can be a challenge for some community groups.  It is worthwhile calling that out as a potential blocker that could be in place.    </p></speech>

It seems to me this is one of those issues where, with a relatively small amount of work at Government and local government level, we could make many big advances.  I know Deputy McAuliffe was not being negative in any way, but I do not think very complicated legislation is needed.  A legislative basis could be created with some simple amendments to the Local Government Act or the Planning and Development Acts.  We all know that local authorities like the comfort of a legislative provision to empower them to do something.  That seems to be a very simple proposition our committee could support.</p><p>Second, there is a requirement for this to be in the county development plans.  It should not just be discretionary.  If every county development plan was required to have a set of propositions and principles, and a strategy, for more community growing spaces, then they would have to be there.  Our difficulty is those plans are about to be concluded.  Our local authorities start their final meetings tonight so we have missed that boat, but there can be amendments.</p><p>The crucial things are how we empower communities in already settled areas to get access to the land and how we make sure that as new settlements are put in place this is taken into account.  I propose we consider two simple things.  It is increasingly the practice of local authorities that are doing social housing projects to have an additional fund for the wider community to, in essence, compensate either for the loss of an amenity or the disruption of the new-build period.  It is a very good idea that communities get some additional traffic calming or some goalposts or whatever but, in fact, what communities often want is more resources.  If some space is taken up by housing, they want some <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Community growing spaces would be such a sensible thing to include.  Every local authority housing project or approved housing body project should have to actively consider where this area needs, and could sustain, such a space and what it would be like.  Communities could then be involved in the consultation around where and what that would be and how it would enhance the area in order that existing communities would not feel all they were getting was more houses and more urban congestion.  They would be getting an additional resource.  Given we will have increasing - although nowhere near as much as I would like - volumes of social and affordable housing projects, making sure that at the minimum all such developments have to consider the community growing space option would be a very interesting idea.  We already require them to consider play spaces, sports spaces and open green spaces.  It is almost adding this into one of the things.  That would be eminently sensible.</p><p>Beyond that, there is a very strong argument that speaks to Deputy Gould's point.  Certainly, the three of us are very strong advocates of compact growth in our urban centres for all the reasons we know that it is required.  We are getting some public and private developments where rooftop gardens, rooftop pollinators and open green spaces are already being put in, but are not for others.  Again, one of the things we could usefully recommend at a discussion in private session is to set the horizon higher for those inner urban areas.  We know from Dublin city that there is very little vacant public land but there will be lots of development land, which will shake up the fabric of the urban environment.  If we placed a higher demand on public and private developments in Cork city centre and Dublin city centre to have a greater focus on this, it would enhance those neighbourhoods.</p><p>It is important we do not just have a meeting where we agree with each other.  It would be a good idea if the Chairman, who has a good read of this issue, could take on a draft letter to the Minister, which we could then discuss and make some amendments to in private session next week.  It is a thing that would be relatively straightforward for the Government to work into the fabric of other work it is doing this year.  It could be a positive outcome for the committee and Community Gardens Ireland.  </p></speech>

A green space is normally in front of houses that are facing a square but in the case of Gurranabraher and Farranree it is actually at the back of houses.  What has happened is that people have put up fences and walls around their houses and there are now green islands trapped in the back.  The intention was that the local community whose houses back onto those green spaces would use them.  Whether it was due to antisocial behaviour or privacy issues, people have built walls and fences and now those spaces just lie idle.  It is a shame.  I have contacted Cork City Council about it.  Some people have taken ownership and made their gardens bigger.</p><p>We are really losing out on the whole community aspect and it is something we should consider.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the local authorities and many areas of government became more flexible.  An example is the St. Mary's orthopaedic hospital campus, which put in a Sl&iacute; na Sl&aacute;inte during the height of the restrictions.  That location is less than a kilometre from my house and it is a place where people could go with their families and not have to meet anybody but they could see people.  They have now stopped cutting back sections of it because of biodiversity concerns.  The back of my father's house is up against the old hospital and people always wanted to have that part cut back.  This demonstrates how people are changing attitudes.</p><p> In Churchfield, not far from where I live, there is an allotment that Cork City Council set up approximately 15 years ago.  It is a tremendous success and people have called me saying they would love to get space in the allotment or asking if their community could get an allotment like it.  It is a great model and it is a pity there are not more of them.  The council has done good work there and I do not know if there is a funding issue.  It was a green piece of land that the council owned.  It is right next to Scoil Padre Pio and the nursery so the kids looking out have a park, a playground and allotments.  That is what people want growing up and what they want to look at from a school window.</p><p> I had a meeting last week with some representatives of the Clogheen and Kerry Pike community association.  They have a community park and are looking for some funding to put in a community garden.  Councillors Kenneth Collins, Mick Nugent and I met those representatives last Saturday about Ballycannon Park, which is named after six volunteers who were killed in the War of Independence.  They are looking to put the community park right where the volunteers were killed.  Cork City Council has put in benches, one for each of the volunteers, but now they are looking for a community garden.  There is a Sl&iacute; na Sl&aacute;inte and the group is also looking for the location to have an area for biodiversity.</p><p> There is great work being done by communities.  I am talking about a great community with many volunteers who are doing work and funding.  Not all community groups would have the organisational support that Clogheen and Kerry Pike would have.  We can see what they are doing in the community and they are really doing well.  We cannot have other communities being left behind.  I commend the group on the work it is doing but with anything we do we must ensure there is action right across the board.</p></speech>

There is the affordability perspective as well.  We have spoken about local authorities having public land and we have said that when we densify, we should have green open spaces.  Maybe we could start calling them green growing spaces or something like that.  We see areas being called "public open spaces" but perhaps a portion should be for public open space for kids to kick a ball around and another portion can be a public growing space.  There could be little tweaks in design standards contained in county plans.</p> <p>  There may be private land available on the outskirts of a town, for example, that is not used.  The owners might want to offer it as allotments.  Does it become unaffordable in such cases or is it very much open to the group to negotiate with a landowner, for example, about putting 20 allotments on land?  I know there are other issues, including parking and water access etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.806" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nal McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030100002#L00300"><p>It depends on the landowner.  One issue we see as beneficial for the public side versus private is the inclusion of a definition of affordability.  I am not sure how to define that.  In Germany they benchmark this against the cost of agricultural land; it is four times the cost of agricultural land or something similar to that.  They still look at some type of model out there.</p> <p>  The whole point is that this is something that was lost in the 1934 Act.  Some local authorities include some basis of affordability and South Dublin County Council includes in its allotment process a factor if somebody is unemployed or a pensioner, and they have reduced costs to pay versus the general public.  I am not sure what is the answer with affordability but we must have some measure of it.  My fear is that over time the local authorities may increase costs when times get hard again because there could be massive demand.  Private suppliers may also increase to a level that would limit the point of doing this.  We are here looking to get as many people growing as possible.  That is why we call the report Let's Get Growing.</p> <p>  We want some type of benchmark for the private lands.  Comparing English and Irish prices, for example, there are plots in some parts of Newcastle where the cost could be &pound;20 or &pound;30 per year for a plot of 250 sq. m.  That would not be got in Ireland.  We never had much emphasis put on affordability and that is really what we are looking for in the first place.</p></speech>

There are many green spaces and people with land that is not zoned on the outskirts of town.  From a practical perspective, they need water supplied but what else is needed?  Do people require storage and sheds?  Can these areas operate without that?</p></speech>

Some of the more established allotments on private or public land would see the allotment holder install his or her own shed.  The provider of the land often provides water sources, with taps that people can access.  People could also have rain barrels and if they have a shed, a rain barrel can operate off that.  At Pearse College in Crumlin there are allotments on land that it owns and they have provided some storage facilities and communal composting facilities.  That is perhaps a good model as the college gives over some of its land.  I am not sure what is the cost of the allotments there.  I think they vary from approximately &euro;80 to &euro;120 per year.</p></speech>

I remember reading before that an allotment could be &euro;350 per year.  It goes back to the affordability element.  That is going a bit too far.</p></speech>

I have a final point.  The witnesses have said there are 100 community gardens and allotments in the country.  What helps to get political momentum going is lobbying and contacting councillors, especially around development plans, as well as Deputies and Senators.  When public opinion pushes in a direction, politics tends to follow.  I have no doubt the group would get good responses from everybody, although maybe not action.  If the process gains momentum, the group could at least work with the good response and ask people to get behind it.  There may be more than 100 gardens.</p></speech>

I will go briefly through some points.  I can put together something.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right that we can work on this as a committee.  We are looking at the planning code and process and there is an ongoing assessment of that.  There may be an opportunity in that to seek some of these elements.  On legislation, I know there was a recent public consultation on county development plans and what should be included in them.  I do not know if the witnesses had the opportunity to make a submission.</p></speech>

A point was also made in regard to legislation on operation versus legislation to provide the space.  We will have to be clear on that.  We also talked about the design per population and what might be required in that regard, that this be provided for in county development plans and that social housing projects or private housing developments include within their design that communal growing aspect.</p></speech>

We feel this is way too long a timeframe.  We need a type of community garden-community growing census.  Again, it could be done every five or ten years at a local authority level such that local authorities will know how many community growing spaces are in their local area.  It allows for trending and so on.  We think it would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting today is to discuss speed limit reductions in urban areas and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the RSA, Mr. Sam Waide, CEO, and Mr. Michael Rowland, director of road safety, research and driver education.  From Love 30, I welcome Ms Muireann O'Dea and Ms Joan Swift.  I also welcome Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy of Technological University Dublin, who is joining us remotely.  All of the witnesses are welcome to the meeting.  I thank them for their forbearance.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked reluctantly to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. </p> <p>  I call Mr. Waide to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The first topic is the Government Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030.  Our Journey Towards Vision Zero, Ireland&rsquo;s fifth Government road safety strategy for 2021 to 2030, was published in December 2021.  This transformational strategy was designed in collaboration with key road safety partners, international experts and the public.  More than 2,000 submissions were received from the public as part of the consultation process to develop the strategy.</p><p>The primary aim of the strategy is to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Irish roads by 50% over the next ten years.  This means reducing deaths on Ireland&rsquo;s roads annually from 144 to 72 or lower and reducing serious injuries from 1,260 to 630 or lower by 2030.  The strategy will be delivered in three phases.  Phase 1, which runs from 2021 to 2024, is backed by a projected &euro;3.8 billion investment and includes 50 high-impact actions and 136 support actions.  Two further phases are planned up to 2030.  The strategy is also the first step towards achieving vision zero, which is the elimination of all road deaths and serious injuries on Irish roads by 2050.  These targets are also in line with European Commission and UN global road safety goals.</p><p> The strategy is led by a safe system approach covering the following seven areas: safe speeds; safe and healthy modes of travel; safe vehicles; safe roads and roadsides; safe road use; safe work-related road use; and post-crash response.  The safe system approach emphasises the shared responsibility among those who design, build, manage and use the roads, including vehicles, to prevent or reduce collision impacts.  It also includes those who provide post-crash response to mitigate injury.  Ireland&rsquo;s road safety strategy for the next ten years will be delivered with a heightened focus on the provision of infrastructure and vehicle safety enhancements, improved road user behaviours and enforcement in addition to post-crash response.  All priority actions for the strategy sit within the safe system approach and are included in the briefing document submitted to the committee.</p><p> As the committee asked that we address the subject of speed limit reductions in urban areas, I will refer to the safe speeds element of the aforementioned strategy.  It involves consideration of road and vehicle planning and design, the setting of injury-minimising speed limits, as well as public education and awareness, and the enforcement of these limits.  The phase 1 action plan of the strategy includes five high-impact actions under safe speeds and these are listed in the briefing document.</p><p> Excessive speed continues to be a leading contributory factor in fatal and serious injury collisions in Ireland and internationally.  It has been estimated that 10% to 15% of all collisions and 30% of fatal collisions are the result of speeding or inappropriate speed.  Implementing lower speed limits, for example 30 km/h limits in urban areas, will have significant safety benefits, particularly for cyclists and pedestrians.  These include reducing the likelihood of collisions occurring and reducing the risk of death or serious injury, should a collision occur.  The WHO has estimated that a 5% reduction in average speed could result in a 30% reduction in fatal collisions.  Safe speeds can also result in decreases in emissions and noise pollution, and improved traffic flow on our roads.</p><p> Evidence shows that many drivers are choosing to speed in our towns and villages.  The RSA&rsquo;s free speed observational study conducted in 2018 found that over half of cars observed on urban roads were speeding.  Our attitudinal survey conducted last year found that a third of drivers exceed 50 km/h limits by more than 10 km/h at least sometimes.  To put this in context, if pedestrians or cyclists are hit by a vehicle at 60 km/h, 90% of them will die, but if they are hit at 30 km/h, 90% of them will live.  In addition to this, many drivers are distracted while driving which puts cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk.  Our survey found that 19% of drivers use their phone to read messages and emails at least sometimes while 12% admitted to using their phones to check social media while driving.  We must reduce the risks posed to pedestrians and cyclists, who face an environment where many drivers are speeding and are dangerously distracted.</p><p> Urban speed limits should not serve to benefit drivers but rather benefit active travel and protect pedestrians and cyclists.  Ireland is falling behind the rest of Europe in setting 30 km/h speed limits. There have been several roll-outs of 30 km/h or 20 mph speed limits by municipalities around the world.  Spain set a national 30 km/h limit for all urban roads with a single carriageway in each direction in May 2021.  Wales has made progress in its plans for a national 20 mph default limit for all built-up roads, to be implemented in 2023.  Scandinavian countries already have a 30 km/h limit for most urban roads, with Oslo and Helsinki recording zero pedestrian deaths last year with 30 km/h as a key reason.  There are other examples including in the briefing document submitted to the committee.</p><p> Our challenge and the challenge for legislators is to keep raising the bar and finding new and better ways of making our roads safer, especially for the most vulnerable members of our community.  In Ireland, road deaths have declined by almost 70% since 1998.  Reducing road deaths and serious injuries by 50% over the next decade is achievable.  Vision zero by 2050 is also achievable and given our road safety journey to date, no target is too ambitious for us.  The starting point is recognising that road deaths or serious injuries should not be the price to pay for our mobility.</p></speech>

Today, drawing on my professional experience as a civil engineer, transportation planner and behaviour scientist, I would like to discuss the importance of good street design practices for safe driving behaviour and how we can balance perspectives on what constitutes a safe street or road.<br/><br/>Substantial work has been done by the transportation agencies over the past three decades to make driving safer in Ireland.  However, practices such as overdesigning roads to increase driver comfort and an emphasis on new car assessment programme, NCAP, ratings for cars which place an emphasis on the safety on those inside the vehicle have left communities dealing with an increased threat of larger and faster vehicles on their streets.  This focus on driver safety has had unintended consequences.  Residential streets used to be places to congregate and play and main streets used to be meeting places and commercial hubs.  Both are now becoming devoid of human interactions because of the dominance of the private vehicle.  This not only has implications for local commerce, but also the health and well-being of our population.<br/><br/>Posted speed limits are just one tool in a suite of measures that can be used to make our streets safer.  However, without enforcement and changes to the physical infrastructure to bring the design speeds of roads or streets closer to the posted speed limit, little is going to change in driver behaviour.  Life and time pressures as well as the sense that we can move faster, since our 21st century vehicles need little encouragement to move considerably faster than those driven in the 1970s and 1980s, increase the temptation to break a speed limit.  Each individual will make their own decision, but if others around us are going faster than us, the temptation to press the pedal can be worth the personal risk.  A favourite phrase of one of my school teachers comes to mind - &quot;You are only sorry because you were caught.&quot;.<br/><br/>Our metric for safe streets should not be how many people have lost their lives or been injured but a multi-criteria assessment that includes the number of people walking and cycling in an area.  Reported traffic speeds should be measured against the context of the street considering time-of-day metrics, for example.  Are more people speeding in low traffic and how can this behaviour be designed out?  We should conduct walk-in-time or drive-in-time interviews or other ethnographic-type data collection to understand what informs in-travel decision making.  We need to listen to school children, but not exclusively.  They are not the decision makers when it comes to household travel but alongside our elderly, they are the most vulnerable on our roads and they deserve our attention.  We must also look at social exclusion and loneliness and other population health indicators, such as the work done by Professor Donald Appleyard in the USA.<br/><br/>The 2020 Stockholm declaration of the Third Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety recognises the importance of this multi-perspective approach.  It recognises:</p> <blockquote> 	... our shared responsibility between system designers and road users to move towards a world free from road traffic fatalities and serious injuries and that addressing road safety demands multi-stakeholder collaboration among the public and private sectors, academia, professional organizations, non-governmental organizations and the media. </blockquote> <p>The task force outlined in the RSA&rsquo;s document, Our Journey Towards Vision Zero, Ireland's Government Road Safety Strategy, Phase 1 Action Plan 2021-2024, is a very welcome start.<br/><br/>The media has an important role to play in delivering a clear and balanced message around road safety.  It can highlight the impact of individual and collective decision-making on population health and well-being and on the prevention of premature death from road traffic collisions, non-communicable or lifestyle diseases or from mental ill-health, compounded by social isolation and sedentary behaviours.</p><p>Why is a default 30 km/h for built up areas a good idea?  A blanket change facilitates a clear communication to the population, which in turn gives it greater awareness of the changes.  Default 30 km/h speeds will facilitate the roll out and a quick delivery of active travel infrastructure and the Town Centres First strategy as street design standards at this speed will facilitate safer design for a greater balance of movement and place.  This in turn helps us meet our climate targets.  </p><p> There is information available and learnings from other jurisdictions on policies to reduce traffic speeds that we can learn from.  We will not be reinventing the wheel.  At present, digital mapping and route-finding apps are directing drivers into residential areas for trip time savings based on current speed limits.  Lower speed limits will discourage algorithms from directing traffic into these areas.   </p><p> Research and evaluation is important, most especially so that we have an Irish evidence base to learn from and build upon.  Multidisciplinary perspectives are important.  This September, TU Dublin will be hosing the Walk21 international conference on walking and liveable communities where a special session will be held to address safety where we can learn from local players and international experts.  </p></speech>

Love 30 is a national alliance of individuals and organisations that support a default 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas.  A 30 km/h as a default urban speed limit is an opportunity to significantly reduce the number of vehicle collisions and related serious injuries; to allow children to play outdoors more safely; to make our cities and towns more liveable by allowing people of all ages and abilities to walk or cycle to study, work, shops and visits to friends and family; to improve the general health of the population; and to contribute to our climate action plan</p> <p>  At a recent school road safety event in Kilcoole where the speed limit is 50 km/h, one of the sixth class pupils said "their speed was quite shocking.  To think that there could be kids crossing the road and the cars are going at that speed."  Why are we seeking a default 30 km/h speed limit in built up areas?  First, it is about safety.  Thirty kilometres per hour is fundamentally safer than 50 km/h for pedestrians and vulnerable road users.  Where speeds are reduced to a maximum of 30 km/h in built-up areas, a decline in casualties of more than 40% will occur with fewer and less severe injuries.  Lower speeds give drivers more time to notice and react to the unexpected and, importantly, reduce the severity of injury when collisions occur.  The importance of 30 km/h speed limits for improved road safety and enhanced liveability is recognised internationally.  Many countries such as the Netherlands, Spain and Wales have legislated for mandatory 30 km/h in all built-up areas.</p> <p>  With lower speeds, children can safely play, walk, scoot and cycle in their neighbourhood.  Confident, independent, healthy and active travel habits form on safer streets.  There are benefits for elderly people, who may have slower reaction times, and people with disabilities making it easier for them to cross the road and travel about.</p> <p>  Lower speeds result in less noise and pollution.  Noise can be reduced by 50%, which is a major issue in cities and towns.  Air pollution currently kills more than 1,000 people per year in Ireland.  Introducing widespread 30 km/h zones is one of the most cost-effective ways of improving road safety.  The wide area means there are no frequent speed changes so fewer signs are needed and it is easier for drivers to understand.  Studies in the UK found that wide area 30 km/h limits are seven times more cost-effective than isolated zones with physical traffic calming.</p> <p>  There is very little impact on journey times.  Much of the travel time in urban areas is spent at traffic lights or stuck in traffic.  On a typical 20-minute journey, travelling at 30 km/h instead of 50 km/h will add between 20 seconds to a minute to the journey time.   Local and international experience shows that drivers quickly acclimatise to lower speed limits in built-up areas.</p> <p>  Ireland was a signatory to the Stockholm Declaration of the Third Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety in February 2020, which mandated a maximum road travel speed of 30 km/h in areas where vulnerable road users and vehicles mix in a frequent and planned manner.  This same declaration also recognises that road deaths and injuries constitute a preventable epidemic.  This agreed resolution needs to be acted upon here in Ireland.  </p> <p>  At present, the setting of speed limits is a matter for local authorities subject to national legislation.  Most local authorities have introduced some 30 km/h speed limits but their introduction has been patchy and inconsistent.  The recent introduction of an appeal mechanism may be helpful in reducing some speed limits but is unlikely to bring about the paradigm shift that is required.  We believe that the best way forward is to introduce national legislation mandating a default 30 km/h speed limit in built-up areas.  It will then be up to councils to decide which, if any, roads should have a different speed limit.  A default limit does not prevent a higher limit being introduced where it is deemed necessary and safe.  </p> <p>  We were very pleased to see that the road safety strategy included a high impact action to establish a working group to examine and review the framework for the setting of speed limits, including introducing 30 km/h limits as the default in urban areas.  We believe that this working group should be established without delay.  It must recognise that for every one road death, there are nine serious injuries on Irish roads and pedestrians, motorcyclists and cyclists account for over half of all serious injuries </p> <p>  We urge that the members of this committee to recognise the wealth of local and international evidence in support of 30 km/h speed limits in built-up areas.  By endorsing the call for a national default urban speed limit of 30 km/h, the committee will leave a lasting legacy of safe, liveable neighbourhoods that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p></speech>

I think there will be general consensus and agreement regarding the fact that we want our roads to be as safe as possible.  Mr. Waide said that it is not so much about being fair to motorists when we are talking about towns.  Rather it is about ensuring people are able to involve themselves in active travel.  I always find that in this State, to some degree, we start from a bad place.  Our road network is somewhat imperfect.  I was in Strasbourg recently.  You have to watch out for people on e-scooters and bicycles and there will always be the element of criss-crossing at certain points but the network in general is better and there is more space to allow that room for active travel.</p> <p>  I will use an example in Dundalk involving a reduction in lanes.  People were obviously worried about this and said it would clog up the town to a further degree.  I am talking about the far end of Bridge Street and Clanbrassil Street.  The general notion was that it would probably slow down traffic and cycle lanes would not be put in because there is no room so it would be shared space.  I am not sure whether it has resulted in a huge uplift in the number of people cycling on it but traffic is probably moving slowly and it has not been the disaster people might have thought it would be.</p><p>I suppose it is about how one builds in that level of planning.  On a personal basis, sometimes I see a 30 km/h limit and think it is incredibly slow.  You would not even realise you had gone over the limit.  I suppose it would take a huge shift change to get people to that point.  It would be a hard sell at this time, while accepting the argument is that we are going to save lives and facilitate the rest.  What are the real moves that need to happen here?  I do not believe we are in a place where tomorrow one could bring this into Leinster House, propose it and get it accepted.</p></speech>

We are surrounded by research and evidence to confirm the effectiveness of the 30 km/h speed limit.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, various cities have introduced it, and the infrastructure is mixed.  In essence, there needs to be a determination to implement 30 km/h.  One of the witnesses referred to the inconsistency, with it being in some towns and some areas and not in others.  There needs to be consistency, and we come back again to the action required.  There is a plan to form a working group within the strategy to actually progress and bring forward recommendations on how this can be implemented.  Yes, it needs to be implemented in a pragmatic way, but it also needs to be implemented in a transformational way, or we will not achieve that 50% reduction.  We will achieve a 50% reduction if it is done in a timely manner and at pace.  That working group will be set up and the expectation is that it will report to Ministers and others on progress.  We intend to bring forward recommendations to implement the 30 km/h limit.</p> <p>  My colleague Mr. Rowland has carried out extensive research in this area.  I will ask Mr. Rowland to share what others have done in implementing 30 km/h speed limits and, most importantly, some of the lessons learned from other EU member states and other countries where we have gathered insight and research.</p></speech>

Ireland is behind the curve here.  Spain has a national default of 30 km/h for all of its urban roads that are single carriageways in each direction.  Wales has made progress in its plans for a 20 mph default speed limit for all built-up areas.  This is to be implemented to 2023.  Scotland, in its road safety strategy, has announced that 20 mph should be the default speed limit in urban and village settings, and is creating a task force to deliver it by 2025.  Brussels now has a 30 km/h limit for most roads in the city.  Paris has a 30 km/h limit for most roads, with many French cities following.  London already has a 20 mph limit for all of its inner-London boroughs with managed roads, and Transport for London, which manages the arterial roads, plans to increase the length of its 20 mph arterial routes from 80 km to 220 km by 2024.  Likewise, measures have been introduced in US cities.  As Mr. Waide has said, Scandinavian countries , and in particular Oslo and Helsinki which have these 30 km/h speed limits, have recorded zero pedestrian deaths with their 30 km/h speed limit as a key reason.</p></speech>

I will go around the entirety of the huge piece of work that the working group would need to look at.</p> <p>  I am going to throw something out there that may be somewhat tangential.  At this stage it is not just an issue with urban roads, it is an issue also within housing estates.  Any member who was ever a councillor will know that one must go through an elongated process when looking to get speeds reduced or even get ramps installed.  There is a requirement for speed tests and it needs to fit certain criteria and so on.  I am not saying that the RSA wants to slow everything down so that literally there is no traffic moving, but we probably need a streamlining of that system also.  Sometimes there can also be a failure at consultative level for this to occur, and people may only realise that speed limits are being reviewed after it has actually happened.  Or else, it only becomes an issue when there is a fatality or near fatality.</p></speech>

Our role in the RSA has been to do the research to see what works and what is best practice.  This is what we have reflected.</p></speech>

That working group has met at least twice.  They are developing terms of reference.  They will also have special consideration of the introduction of a 30 km/h default limit in urban areas.

The difficulty still around a lot of urban settings is that we just do not have the space on the roads.  We do not have the pavement width or what we would like to have to be able to deliver proper, active living and travel.  The difficulty is in how we make the best of what we have.  The RSA's argument will be that the first step is the 30 km/h speed limit.</p></speech>

It can and should be done in a pragmatic way.  By this I mean that outside schools, for example in an urban area, in a built-up city or town, or even rural schools, there are practical measures whereby if we are serious about road safety in Ireland, we can implement 30 km/h zones in areas where they do not currently exist, and where there is a moral argument.  I would be amazed if anyone argued against having a 30 km/h zone outside the school gates.  There are practical measures from which we can learn and implement without necessarily an extensive investment in basic road furniture and infrastructure.</p><p>I have driven across the whole country.  There remain areas without 30 km/h limits outside school gates.  The first part of the strategy is a four-year plan.  I do not want to be sitting here in four years, having this debate that this is difficult to implement.  The longer we leave this, the more collisions, serious injuries and fatalities will occur.</p></speech>

One can look at Louth or any other county.  I will use the example of Sheelagh school in north County Louth.  There have been attempts to have speed-limiting ramps or such installed, or to have the speed limit changed.  The difficulty is that it is a rural road.  It is along the road from a junction with a relatively major arterial route.  If it was at all possible, if we introduced 30 km/h limits around schools, we would have to make it much easier for people to be able to deliver on this.  We would have to deliver those solutions.  Many people have engaged with local authorities and whoever else they need to.  They constantly have obstacles thrown in their way.  Many of those obstacles relate to planning laws and to the particular location.  Sometimes, people decide that what they actually want is a speed limit that, in a perfect world, would only exist when children are travelling to and from the school.</p></speech>

This makes complete sense from the point of view of children's safety.  We could just make it happen and work with the current rules.  It means that parents and schools will not have obstacles thrown in their way.</p> <p>  I realise that my questions were all for Mr. Waide.  Do any other witnesses wish to speak?</p></speech>

We have built new developments in suburbs and peri-urban areas on the edge of towns.  We built wider roads.  As a result, people started driving faster.  We then built ramps and people started to buy bigger cars with better suspension to counteract that and continued to speed.  There has been a chicken-and-egg situation all along.  We need to design for people rather than cars and to reallocate the space.</p></speech>

It is important to say that we can change cultural norms and have done so in the past few years, with the various measures that we took to address the pandemic.  We became accustomed to them.  We thought at one time that only people in Asia wore masks, then suddenly we were all wearing them.  There is a recent example of changing norms being possible.  Another matter directly related to road safety is drink driving.  In 2015, a survey showed that 61% of people agreed that a no alcohol limit was correct if people wanted to drink and drive.  In 2017, that had changed to 71%.  That example relates directly to road safety.  We have not put enough effort into the speed issue.  There has not been enough awareness of the difference that it makes.</p> <p>  Mr. Waide's contribution is exceedingly welcome, and I am pleased with it.  He said that it is not a question of prioritising motorists but of prioritising pedestrians and cyclists.  It is as if they are different bodies, in conflict with each other.  As soon as people get out of their car or step off their scooter or bike, they are pedestrians.  This absolutely should be introduced for safety reasons.  The people who live in various towns and villages with a 30 km/h limit instead of vehicles flying by at 75 km/h will be able to hear their children when walking to school.  Older people will be able to walk to the shop with their friends.  People can mix and mingle.  It will make a significant difference.  It ticks all the Government's boxes.  We are talking about road safety here, but it also helps with policies such as Town Centre First, Our Rural Future, health policies such as the National Physical Activity Plan, and most certainly climate and emissions policies.  Mr. Waide and his colleague have really illustrated the difference that the lower speed limit would make.  If it is in place, and people feel safe enough, they can make that choice about travel.  We should remember that the 2019 national travel survey showed that 29% of our journeys are less than 2 km.  The option is there.  It is possible to change the culture.  It would be a superb legacy for this committee, as Ms O'Dea said.  I know the high-level committee exists.  Mr. Waide and the RSA will do their utmost.  To get the backing of members of the committee would be wonderful.</p></speech>

Active travel will allow for a greater amount of public transport.  We can also deal with the issue of e-scooters, e-bikes etc.  I noticed commentary online a second ago.  When I spoke about the time-limited speed limits around schools, I was speaking as a devil's advocate.  Sometimes, planners do not necessarily want limits all the time.  I agree with Mr. Waide that there is a moral obligation for us to introduce those speed limits and to accept that different things happen at different times in schools, on different days.  There is a moral imperative to ensure safety.  We can build the rest of the planning rules around that.</p></speech>

I was chairing another meeting.  I thank the Chair and committee members for agreeing to hold this meeting.  This is an important issue that affects every city, town and village in Ireland.  We all want to have safer roads for everybody, including car users.  When car users step out of their cars, they become pedestrians, perhaps holding a child's hand.  This is for our children, pedestrians, cyclists and grandparents walking round the streets.  We want our streets and towns to be nice places for people to go.  If we had slower speeds in our towns, not only would they be safer, they would also become quieter.  A road with a 30 km/h speed limit is much quieter than a road with a 50 km/h, 60 km/h or 80 km/h speed limit.  The noise where there are higher speed limits creates an unpleasant, unwelcoming place for people to go.  If our streets are not welcoming, it is bad for local business, which is bad for a town and eventually sucks the life out of it.  As we become more car-dependent, we end up in a negative loop where we all get in our cars to drive out of town, which sucks the life out of our towns.  This is primarily about road safety for everybody.</p> <p>  There is a guidance document on setting speed limits from the Department of Transport.  When I was a member of the local authority in Wicklow, we had a blanket 30 km/h zone for residential housing estates incorporating culs-de-sac.</p><p>That was important and it was important to put the signs up, but there were many highly residential roads in my area with the same characteristics as housing estate cul-de-sac roads, being narrow with parking on both sides and much footfall, to which the blanket 30 km/h speed limit could not be applied.  There was potential to include slow zones that required interaction between neighbourhoods, but you could not just put up 30 km/h signs.  Does the guidance document need to be changed?</p></speech>

They are being reviewed.  The document is the one referred to as the framework for the setting of speed limits.  Back in 2013 or 2014, it was published by the Department of Transport.  It is that document that is being reviewed as part of action 6 of the road safety strategy.</p></speech>

I was trying to apply 30 km/h speed limits to residential roads, not just cul-de-sac estates.  Mr. Rowland said the document is being reviewed.  When can we expect local authorities to have a document in front of them that states certain roads with certain characteristics qualify and should fall within a 30 km/h zone if the members so decide?</p></speech>

Putting up a 30 km/h sign on a road will probably do very little to address speeding if the road is designed such that drivers take the view that they can go fast on it.  Road design, build-outs and the engineering of roads are also critical.  A lot of this comes down to local authorities.  They are the bodies that can act in this area.  We can only set the guidance documents for them to work to.  Is there enough recognition of that at local authority level?</p></speech>

They have the engineering expertise to be involved in the review of the guidelines.  They are very much involved and are very active in the group.  It has met twice or three times at this stage.  There is representation from Transport Infrastructure Ireland but also the local authorities through the CCMA.</p></speech>

On the joined-up approach within the new strategy, the CCMA and councils are represented in the road safety partnership, as are the Road Safety Authority, the Garda, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  All the relevant delivery agencies sit within that partnership.  There is a forum to ensure that no one is working in a silo and that everyone has access to the views and expertise of fellow delivery agencies to ensure all considered views or expert opinions are recognised and taken on board to influence the timely implementation of the actions.  We have 50 actions to implement in total over the next four years.  The Deputy focused on one of them.

We can have the best guidance documents in the world but we also require implementation at local authority level whereby local authorities ascertain how roads can be altered and the designs required to signal to drivers that certain roads are ones on which they should be going slowly.  Many of the interventions do not have to involve major civil engineering works.  Build-outs and planters, for example, can be used.  It requires losing some road allocation and parking spaces.  I am not sure we have the resources and get-up-and-go at local authority level to knock on doors to say we are going to make a street a safer, nicer civil place, including for children and grandparents, and that it will require the removal of a couple of parking spaces.  We can develop really good guidance but I have concerns about applying it.  I see Dr. D'Arcy has her hand up.</p></speech>

The multidisciplinary group is fantastic, welcome and needed, but it is important that it have some environmental psychologists or urban designers who understand the relationship between how something is designed and how someone behaves in space.  This is something I experienced when I moved from working as a civil engineer.  Where civil engineering is concerned, professional training influences the approach in that the changing of the built environment involves a very structural change.  An urban designer can be much more subtle in the changes, which might involve planters or trees.  &ldquo;Sense of enclosure&rdquo; is the term used, the feeling being that if a place is narrower, you will move slower through it.  It is important to have urban psychologists or urban designers on the team.  In local authorities, we do not have enough of this kind of collaboration.  One of the main drivers for us in setting up the master of science degree in sustainable transport and mobility in TU Dublin was to have interdisciplinary viewpoints regarding how we deliver the schemes.</p></speech>

A really good graphic that I am sure we have all seen shows that if one is struck by a vehicle at 60 km/h, it results in a fatality in nine out of ten cases.  At 50 km/h, there may be a fatality in six out of ten cases.  I cannot remember the figure.  At 30 km/h, nine out of ten people will survive.  I am sure we would all like to see a much higher level of survival than obtains where cars are allowed to drive at such high speeds.  The graphic uses a normal-sized car &mdash; a saloon with a low bonnet that would have been common &mdash; but we have seen a major increase in the use of SUVs, which are monstrous, ridiculous vehicles that are not suitable for the urban environment in any shape or form.  Great marketing is done and everybody wants to drive an SUV across a mountain stream with music playing in the background, but that is not the reality of driving one in an urban environment.  Does the graphic need to be updated to reflect the weight of an SUV and the height of its bonnet, which, unlike a saloon bonnet, strikes a person in the upper body rather than the legs?  Is the fatality rate now much higher, such as ten out of ten at 60 km/h or 50 km/h, bearing in mind that we know the SUV is a common vehicle in the urban setting?  That is probably a hard question to answer.  I will leave it to Ms O'Dea to answer both of my questions.</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, the size of vehicles nowadays make them safe for those in them but very dangerous for those outside.</p> <p>  On the previous point, whether local authorities have the will and resources to produce designs that promote lower speeds, I fully agree with all the points made on designing roads that have a natural traffic-calming effect, but designs should not be a reason to delay the introduction of 30 km/h speed limits.  Edinburgh is a very good example in this regard.  From the middle of 2016, its authorities rolled out wide-area 20 mph zones.  This involved a sign-only scheme, with no physical traffic calming.  With a very modest average speed reduction of about 2 km/h, the authorities saw major benefits.  There was a 38% reduction in road traffic collisions.  A survey showed that 35% more children were allowed to play on the road.  It was based on a sign-only scheme.  It is definitely a good starting point.  It can be built upon with design and enforcement.</p></speech>

I have come from the climate committee meeting.  Obviously, I come with that hat on me.</p><p>I thank all our guests for coming in.  As Deputy Matthews said, that was a striking image of what the current death toll is.  While reducing the death toll must be front and centre, I have heard very little - I am not referring to our guests but to others - about the climate impact of reducing speed limits.   That must be critical in this.  I fully agree that we cannot slow down a campaign for 30 km/h speed limits.  How could this campaign be aligned with a campaign on reducing car use overall?  Does the RSA have some comments on that?  Is it also aligning this campaign with a reduction in car use?</p><p> The fewer the number of cars moving around, the fewer deaths there are.  We also know that the lower the speed limit, the greater the number of people cycling and walking.   We also need to think about the fact that making it slightly uncomfortable for road users who are in their cars can have a knock-on impact in taking people out of their cars and putting them into cycle lanes and onto buses and getting them walking.  That modal shift must be part of this conversation.  Is this RSA campaign aligned with another campaign around reducing car use?</p></speech>

I will answer part of the question and I welcome my colleagues' views on this as well.  At the heart of the road safety strategy is road safety.  It is outcome-based.  It aims to reduce serious injuries and fatalities by 50% by 2030.  We have developed this strategy cognisant of wider policy strategies, including the climate change challenge and the transport strategies developed with industry players and others.  The road safety strategy has been developed with all those in mind.  For the RSA, road safety does not single out any one particular user or try to shame one particular user into doing less or more of something.  It is encouraging, facilitating and enabling all road users to share the road respectfully and that includes vulnerable road users.</p> <p>  On climate change and the reduction in emissions of vehicles being used, the RSA, as a road safety authority, has not got into that.</p></speech>

I was not saying it is about shaming.  I was saying both things have benefits for people's lives and it has to be seen in that way.  Most of us use different forms of transport.  If you are in car behind small children cycling, you are putting them under pressure all the time.  That makes cycling much more difficult for them the next time they go out on the road.  As such, this has a knock-on impact related to climate and safety.</p> <p>  Dr. D'Arcy made an excellent point on communities.  In Galway, where I am from, communities are completely blocked off from each other and divided down the middle by roads on which cars are travelling very fast.  I ask Mr. Waide to speak about that and the issue of permeability, which probably comes from that.  The lack of permeability is probably a knock-on impact of very fast roads.  Is the RSA also looking at permeability in these neighbourhoods to ensure everything comes together at once, as I think it must?</p></speech>

Segregating different forms of travel is safe.  It has been evidenced it is safer for everyone involved.  Although serious injuries have increased significantly in the past ten years, they have reduced in the past year.  I have spoken on this topic with officials.  The RSA believes there has been a reduction in serious injuries because during Covid we put in place infrastructure for cyclists and that has had a positive impact.  It has reduced the number of serious injuries.  The RSA advocates segregating those methods of travel to make them safer, be that for pedestrians or cyclists and, likewise, for vehicle users because when-----</p></speech>

What people do not realise is councillors are given something by an executive.  They do not just come up with a decision about which road is to have a 30 km/h speed limit and which will have an 80 km/h speed limit.  One of the challenges for Galway City Council was that an entire package was delivered under which the speed limit in some areas, similar to the areas Deputy Matthews mentioned and just as residential as some housing estates, increased to 80 km/h, while in others the speed limit was reduced to 30 km/h.  Quite apart from the call from Love 30 to have this as a national campaign or national function, how can we ensure at national level that  councils are making proposals for councillors to vote on that are respectful of the guidelines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.897" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sam Waide" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030100002#G00600"><p>That is a very good question and I am glad the Senator asked it.  It comes back to a term referenced earlier, namely, consistency.  As road users, whether we are pedestrians, cyclists, motorists or heavy or light goods vehicle drivers, we need a level of consistency across the country, so we are not driving, walking or cycling into one council area and having one set of rules and then driving, walking or cycling into another council area that has another set of rules.  The political system has a major role to play to ensure consistency is applied across the country.  As I stated, the councils are represented on the road safety partnership board in that regard but outside my remit, there is a major role for councillors and elected representatives to ensure that consistency of approach, whether it is implementing a 30 km/h speed limit as a default or various forms of that.  I would welcome that consistency and I am sure all members of the public and road users would welcome that consistency.</p> <p>  I keep coming back to the point that the longer we debate this in the coming months and years, the greater the number of serious injuries and fatalities that will occur.  This is about outcomes, notably the 50% reduction by 2030, so I am asking everyone to help move this at pace in political circles, organisational circles and in support of the public as a whole.</p></speech>

It is good to hear the RSA is pushing this measure.  We need to take a leap on this but what we are finding is that on a local authority level, those leaps are not happening.  For instance, the Salthill cycle lane was voted down, which goes back to the matter of a lack of segregation and lack of safety for people.  Perhaps the question for everyone is what more we can do to bring the public on board.  Some of the questions asked earlier by one of the members pointed to the fact that some politicians may be worried that the public will not be on board.  I do not think that is true.  What more can we do to ensure everybody understands this is an imperative for safety but also for climate?  We saw from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report released yesterday that half of the world's population is now impacted by climate change.</p></speech>

The public have spoken in regard to speed.  One of the members mentioned enforcement.  The RSA conducted a public survey and over two thirds of the public agree to an increase in penalty points for speeding and distracted driving.  The RSA has carried out research of public opinion in the past and we are willing to carry out more public opinion research on 30 km/h or whatever the topic might be to achieve greater and safer roads in Ireland.</p></speech>

First, I am glad the committee is hosting this meeting today and I welcome it.  I pay tribute to the work of the Road Safety Authority, to Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy and particularly to the Love 30 campaign.  Its enormous work over many years and the use of data and evidence to persuade people of the need to reduce speed limits have been critical to bringing us to where we are now and where we need to go.  I fully support the call to introduce legislation to have speed limits of 30 km/h by default in built-up areas across the country.  The common thread through the conversation today is that if we have a safe speed approach, it will be vital to promoting active travel within communities and to encouraging more cycling and a safer space for pedestrians.</p> <p>  I am based in the north side of Dublin and live in communities that are gateways to the city centre for cars.  We must ensure that they are communities for pedestrians, cyclists and people as opposed to communities for cars just to pass through.  The key thing from this committee today is that the evidence has been unequivocal regarding the need to move to a speed limit of 30 km/h in built-up areas.  I thank the three groups of contributors for that.  That Ireland is a laggard is a very important message to get across.  I thank our guests for pointing to the examples in Wales, Spain, Scotland, Belgium and other countries in terms of how far ahead they have moved and how little we have done here.</p> <p>  For me, there is a practical impact from this.  Dublin City Council has rolled out safe school zones across the city.  It has been very successful, but schools on the Ratoath Road and St. Joseph's in East Wall cannot get the full school zone treatment and ensure there is full safety for their pupils and parents going to school.  They cannot have a 30 km/h speed limit on their roads because they are on busy primary roads.  We need to be able to change that, to have the speed limit by default at 30 km/h and ensure that schools and every other public amenity can be afforded that safe space.</p> <p>  I have a question about enforcement because this is continually thrown back at us.  People ask: "What is the point in having a 30 km/h speed zone if there are no speed cameras or if the garda&iacute; are not there?"  The conversation this morning with Deputy Matthews has been very instructive, and the Road Safety Authority dealt with it in its contribution.  That is the secondary issue here.  Having the speed limit alone is very important.  What are the witnesses' views on the power and the resources that now need to go into complementing the 30 km/h speed zone, if we were to have that by default?  The Love 30 campaign has been campaigning on this for many years so what additional powers at national level and what resources does it believe need to go into those complementary actions?  I believe local authorities need to be better resourced.  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p></speech>

Not everybody was happy a few years ago when the drink driving legislation was tightened.  Nonetheless, it happened.  People still drink and drive but that is not a reason not to have the legislation.  There will have to be a cultural shift.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have to answer regarding its resources for enforcement.  However, some of it is that we do not really see or have not fully grasped how dangerous the speed is.  People might say: "Sure, he is only doing 55 km/h, so why bother?"  A national change countrywide would make a difference because if it is only in this little estate or that little estate, it will not be seen or taken seriously enough.</p> <p>  Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke earlier about what we could do to bring people along and change people's minds.  I have been thinking about the myths there are about how much people will be delayed if the speed limit is changed.  There was an example of it on Newstalk's "Lunchtime Live" yesterday.  People were talking about the Phoenix Park and a couple of the contributors felt it would be the end of the world because they would be held up so much.  Legislators have a responsibility, as well as people like us, volunteers and so on, to counter that myth.  I was thinking about it this morning and about a commute where there are no bypasses.  For example, if somebody is travelling from Donegal to work in Sligo, the person has to pass through four or five different villages.  I worked out that if the full total of 30 km/h limits in those villages was 10 km, that would add eight minutes to one's trip of 60-odd km.  A person could say that would mean he or she would have to leave at 7.50 a.m. instead of 8 a.m., but the difference it would make to the communities in Grange, Rathcormack, Drumcliff and Cliffoney if people were willing or had to give that eight minutes would be enormous.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be very familiar with the road from Tipperary to Limerick.  That would be very similar, with Dromkeen, Boher, Oola and Pallasgreen.  I have not worked that one out, but if one were to put 30 km/h zones in those villages-----</p></speech>

It might only be 4 km.  However, even if it were 10 km until one gets to the motorway to Limerick, one is talking about eight minutes.  I believe all of us, and particularly legislators, have a responsibility.  HGV drivers might be upset because they are tied to time and can be penalised for late deliveries and the like, but on the road I mentioned from Donegal to Sligo they are just as likely to be delayed by being behind a tractor or a bin lorry or in a traffic jam, so it is not really an issue and it is something we need to counter.</p></speech>

In the design manual for urban streets and roads there is a principle set out on the hierarchy of the street, which is that vulnerable pedestrians are first, then pedestrians in general, then people such as cyclists and then we get to motorised vehicles.  If we look at the operation of how we are running the country, we are placing the onus and responsibility for safety on small children whom we are asking to wear high-vis material.  Is this a fair reflection of what is happening?</p></speech>

Schools welcome the RSA's intervention.  One of the most effective campaigns the RSA has conducted in the past, and one which it continues to conduct, is to be safe and be seen.  RSA officers are enthused by the enthusiasm of children in schools to be safe and be seen.  As a parent I encourage my children to be safe and be seen when they are walking on the road with me on family walks and when cycling.</p></speech>

To be honest, research on high-vis material and cycling is poor.  Research on high-vis material and pedestrians is almost non-existent.  We spend huge amounts of money with very little research behind it.  The question is whether we should be spending this money on educating drivers and putting money into making our streets safer.</p></speech>

In the road safety strategy there is a specific action on safe road use and safe travel to work.  This will be a programme with employers.  It will not only encourage safer driving.  One of our delivery partners is the HSE.  One area is van drivers wearing high-vis vests.  This is something they already do as some employers provide high-vis vests for their van drivers.  If there is a recommendation in the road safety strategy, we will implement it if it helps and encourages safer road use.</p></speech>

It is again on the hierarchy of the street and how important Love 30 believes it is to making streets safe and making decisions on the design and maintenance over time of a street.  The hierarchy sets out that vulnerable pedestrians and people with disabilities are of particular note.  Is there an opportunity to include gender, for example?</p></speech>

From reading some of the documentation for today I was struck by the fact we speak about segregation but we need to be more explicit about what we mean by segregating when it comes to cycling and pedestrian routes.  Along our national routes, it will be safer for people to cycle on a segregated route but not if they feel vulnerable or isolated and it is not well lit.  There is a gender aspect.  We have started to do a little more on this.  We are training people up to consider gender mainstreaming in infrastructure delivery.  It is very new and we rapidly need to upskill people throughout the country on it.</p> <p>  Equally on provision for people with disabilities, there are a lot of inconsistencies on how tactile paving is implemented.  We need clearer guidance, education and checks after it has been implemented to make sure everything is okay.  I do not think we understand enough about the limitations to people's movement.  I do not think we have interviewed and walked or cycled with enough people with disabilities to understand what are the real true barriers.  Designers make an assumption that something needs to be put in.  Footpath parking is an issue.  We tell people to go out onto the road to walk around a car when it is parked on a footpath.  It is the ultimate antisocial behaviour as far as I am concerned.  We need to consider these things more.</p></speech>

Men tend to get more physical activity in their day-to-day lives.  We see the figures for girls cycling to school.  The numbers are very low.  There are one in 250 girls cycling to school.  There is something going wrong there.  We have to create a safer environment.  Safety is what is holding women back.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it is recommended that children and teenagers get 60 minutes of physical activity a week.  The plan began in 2016.  The 2019 review found that only 17% of primary school children were reaching the target and only 10% were reaching the target at second level.  When we break this down further, boys were getting more exercise than girls.  We also know that men get more exercise than women.  Gender does come into it in terms of safe spaces.  This includes safe speeds.</p> <p>  While I have the floor I would like to mention high-vis material.  Some of the UK local police forces are quite vocal on social media making the point that, unless people are looking, they will not see someone.  They show photographs of a police car with high-vis or, as we have seen all too often here, railway bridges plastered with high-vis material and nonetheless people drive into them.  I support Deputy Hourigan in the sense it is not that we do not want our children to be safe and to be seen but is the onus on the child?  We do not know whether high-vis materials make a difference or whether there are other measures that might make a bigger difference.</p></speech>

We deal with this issue on a daily basis.  People in residential areas approach me to say they want speed limits reduced.  I go back to the council and interact with it.  I have been dealing with this for years and I understand it.  The question is: what will work?  I always look at things in the round.  I would like my child to wear a high-visibility jacket because it is better than not wearing one.  I take the point about education certainly around users of cars and vehicles.  What model actually works, is practical and gets us to the same endpoint?  I would like Mr. Rowland to do housekeeping on this.  Is the working group the RSA recommended in the strategy up and running at this stage?</p></speech>

Mr. Rowland mentioned Caherconlish, which he knows well.  It is a narrow lane with a significant amount of traffic going through.  We need to get a bit of knowledge.

The next step is on a practical level.  Typically, people in a particular estate or road want to get a speed limit reduced not increased.  Typically, the local authority only reviews that every three years or so.  In the other countries Mr. Rowland mentioned, who sets the speed limits?  They are moving towards a default speed limit of 30 km/h in urban areas.  Were they historically set by the local authorities or a national authority like the RSA?  Who sets them and has it evolved over time?</p></speech>

I understand that in the UK it is a function of the local authorities.  In Wales it was actually the minister for transport and the parliament that made the decision.  In Spain to start with it may have been the city authorities in Madrid, Seville or wherever.  As we understand it the national government set the default in built-up areas.</p></speech>

It then becomes a question of the 30 km/h and how it is implemented.  There are inconsistencies between different local authorities and even in specific areas within local authorities.  The working group is operational but its terms of reference have yet to be defined.  The committee will write to the Department to get the details on that.

The structure around this is that a working group has now been established, as recommended under the RSA's new safety strategy.  The terms of reference will be key.  We need to look at that.  Then there is membership and the outcome of the work.  There is a process in play.  For decades, speed limits have been a reserved function of local authorities.  In many cases the officials were bringing these to councillors.  However, in many cases councillors would bring these to officials when they get requests from people.  There are inconsistencies between local authorities and in areas.  If this working group can be structured in a way that everyone is included, then significant sections of society can be brought along this journey.  It is a big change but anything that improves safety is important.  All the research indicates that it is the next big step.  We will follow up on that.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a few matters of my own.  As representatives of the RSA are here, I wish to ask about something that is slightly off topic.  I would also be interested to hear the views of Ms O'Dea and Ms Swift from Love 30 and from Dr. D'Arcy.  Tomorrow we will have a session on scooters, which has become a big issue that also feeds into road safety.  What is the RSA's view on speed limits and age limits for scooters?</p></speech>

We have been clear with Ministers that we want e-scooters to be regulated.  We want them to be regulated in terms of being introduced safely.  What we have discussed with the committee is about reducing serious injuries and fatalities.  As a system and a country, we cannot bring on board and regulate a new form of mobility when we are taking one step forward in reducing serious injuries, fatalities and potential collisions, but taking two steps back in terms of not taking on board RSA's recommendations in regard to e-scooters.</p></speech>

In Belgium, the Vias institute, the road safety knowledge group, is recommending a minimum age requirement of 16 years for e-scooters.  In Austria, the age recommendation is 14.  In France, it is 12 years of age, in Denmark it is 15 years of age, and in both Portugal and Switzerland, it is 16 years of age.  They have all mirrored the recommendations we are making that the age restriction requirement for e-scooters should be 16 years and over, as Mr. Waide has said.</p></speech>

There was a great mix of people on the panel, including representatives from local authorities and the industry creating the scooters.  The discussion went from the particulars around the speed and the nuances to the balance and allocation of road space.  As has just been mentioned, there was discussion of the relative speeds of the different modes of transport, the relative risk of harm from different vehicles and how we can better allocate that space.  It was really interesting because so much of the media discussion has been around regulation, but the conversation that we had was more on the question of where there is a place for e-scooters.  They do have a place, but the question we need to consider is where that place is.  We only have a limited amount of space between our buildings.  It is about how we best share that for everybody to get around.  E-scooters have a role.  Those of us involved in pedestrian advocacy sometimes latch onto the fact that e-scooters are actually taking more from the walking fraternity than they are from cars, as was the intention.  If e-scooters get more people out in spaces, they are a much more social way of moving around than by using a private vehicle.  There is a lot to be considered.  It is a nuanced issue.</p></speech>

The situation seems straightforward.  We are going to write to the Department to find out where the working group is at and inquire as to its membership.  We will be encouraging the Department to bring in Love 30 as part of that membership because it has a role to play.  The fact that there is now a definitive structure in place and a reporting date by the end of the year is welcome.  The devil is always in the detail and the terms of reference will be hugely important.  If there are any follow-on issues for the representatives of Love 30 and Dr. D'Arcy, we can follow up on that.  I will ask Ms O'Dea and Ms Swift if that is what they are looking for.  Does that cover what they want?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.1043" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Swift" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030100002#M02000"><p>I think so.  We would like the high-level report to be available before the end of quarter four.  As Mr. Waide said, the sooner it happens, the better.  On the other hand, we understand there must be research, agreement and so on.  There is no point in just barrelling through.</p> <p>  I will briefly mention a point relating to the local authorities and the reserve function versus the national function.  I am on our public participation network and sit on the infrastructure committee.  I remember when questions of revising speed limits came up, our director of services said it was an incredibly onerous process because there are so many roads.  It would require the resources of the engineers.  Our director of services would say that those engineers would not be doing other things because they would be spending all their time on the speed limits.  I know local authorities are understandably jealous of the functions of their foreign counterparts because they have so few.  By comparison with other countries, we are very centralised.  On the other hand, it is demanding on the executive and the engineers because we have a dense road network.  Perhaps local authorities might welcome a suggestion of a speed limit that applies to every road in a particular area because they would not have to agonise street by street.  Instead, looking at the exceptions would be a simpler process.</p></speech>

I think there is a body of work to be done.  It is important that proper due diligence is conducted.  I take Ms Swift's point that she would like to see the report sooner rather than later.  However, if it takes an extra few months to get everyone on board and we can ensure we will get it right, that is the most important thing of all.  It is a very straightforward idea.  Every urban, built-up area will get a 30 km/h speed limit and there will be exceptions allowed where a case can be made.  The devil is always in the detail and nothing is ever straightforward.  However, there is a structured process in place.</p> <p>  I will ask a question of Mr. Waide.  The RSA obviously put thought into that recommendation in terms of the working group.  What does he see the working group doing?  There is a framework.  What does he see the working group doing?  It is his vehicle so what does he see it doing?</p></speech>

I am not going to get into the detail of what this particular group will do.  The key here is delivery.  I sit on the road safety partnership board.  There has been reference at this meeting to the fact that people want things done quickly.  I, of all people, want to deliver stuff.  We are here to deliver outcomes.  However, it would be remiss of me not to discuss details.  Let us get down to brass tacks.  All the agencies, including the councils, were part of that partnership submission for a statement of resource.  It is new money, above and beyond what was planned big infrastructure.  It is an amount of money over the next four years to help deliver some of this transformational, additional stuff we have identified within the strategy.  It will be available over a four-year period.  For this year, the partnership has been told it is not getting that money.  I know the doors of my colleagues in councils and other delivery agencies are always open.  Sometimes "No" is a complete sentence.</p></speech>

Delivery is obviously key, as is the availability resources.  Will Mr. Waide come back to us on when that statement of resources was submitted?  That is something we, as a committee, can follow up on.  Our role is to support initiatives.  There are a number of components involved.  It is great that the working group is being set up but it must deliver and that requires resources.  If Mr. Waide will write to us in that regard, we will follow up on that issue.  Did Dr. D'Arcy wish to contribute?</p></speech>

I was going to suggest inputs into the committee from a health perspective, from emergency departments, schools of emergency medicine and public health.</p><p>This is because road traffic fatalities account for 0.5% of all-cause mortality in Ireland.  However, cardiovascular disease etc. is considerably more.  Some 14% of all-cause premature mortality in Ireland is attributable to physical inactivity.  Road safety, therefore, does not just relate to those who are getting injured and, unfortunately, killed on our roads.  It is equally those who are dying of cardiovascular disease and cancers because they are not getting the opportunities to be physically active.  Therefore, a public health voice on that group would be very welcome.</p></speech>

We all want to deliver on this, because the sooner we make the roads safer, the fewer fatalities we are going to have.  Even one fatality more would have an immeasurable impact on family and friends.  I will tell a story on delivery in a minute.</p> <p>  First, I want to talk about why I think that we will still be here in five years&rsquo; time talking about delivery.  I notice action No. 6 in the document the witnesses supplied to us, which relates to this working group.  It consists of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the County and City Management Association, CCMA, the local authorities and the National Transport Authority.  It talks about 50 different groups feeding into that.  Does that figure count the 31 local authorities as part of that 50, or is it one?</p></speech>

I thought they were contributory groups.  We have to look historically here.  For the past 60 years we have been planning for cars.  It is ingrained in everything we tried to do.  We are trying to flip that around at the moment.  That takes time.  It takes time for designers, for decision-makers and for road users to start adapting to that road design.  I am concerned there is a predominance of the windscreen view when we design our streets.  It is designed from the perspective of the car user.  The Road Safety Authority may come back to me that other groups will give the cyclists&rsquo; view, the pedestrians&rsquo; view or even the shop owners&rsquo; view.  It is better for local businesses when people are walking around safely in their towns.  Many people have to feed into this when it comes to changing our streets.  I am not attacking the RSA on this.  I appreciate the work the authority does.  I am just concerned we will talk about this for a long time and not implement these measures.</p> <p>  I believe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will join us at some stage and we will have a second meeting on this.  It is critical to this.  I have a lot of criticism for the force, but I will save it for when representatives of the Garda are before the committee because they are not here at the moment to defend the force.  The Garda needs to step up its actions on enforcement, road safety, speeding and other things such as parking on footpaths and in disability bays.  The local authorities need to do so as well.</p> <p>  In terms of delivery, in 2015, I monitored streets.  I was a fairly newly elected councillor and I was full of enthusiasm.</p></speech>

I monitored the streets in Bray where I lived.  I looked at the cars that were driving, their speeds, the vulnerable users and the design of those roads.  I drove those roads at 30 km/h.  I always had cars behind me with frustrated drivers.  If you try to drive along an urban street of 800 m at 30 km/h, it is hard to do unless there are signals not to speed up.  I monitored those streets.  I got a map done that showed a 1 km radius from the centre of the town, as well as a 3 km radius and a 5 km radius.  Then I tweaked it so it would correspond with junctions, schools etc.  I presented it to the Bray councillors.  They said we should go to the district engineer with it.  The district engineer had a look at it and he tweaked it as well.  We then gave it to the local garda&iacute;, who came back and said they would support it.  The councillors in Bray supported it.  It was then sent to Wicklow County Council.  That was in 2017.  It is still sitting there, waiting for a decision to be made.</p> <p>  That is my concern.  It is simple to draw a 3 km radius around town, make it a 30 km zone, put up the signage, the signals and whatever is required and say to drivers it is a 30 km zone.  That is the starting point.  I do not want us to spend years and years talking about this.  There are simple measures.</p> <p>  Tell me why I am wrong.  Tell me why it is not simple to look at that and adapt it to each town.  In small villages and towns, there may only be a 200 m main street, with 50 m off that.  They can be made into 30 km/h zones, where people are walking and cycling to schools.  Bray, which is a bigger town, is 4 km wide.  A 2 km radius around the town would pick up most of the urban housing estates where people want to walk and cycle.  Let us face it: parents are afraid to let their children walk and cycle because of the dominance of the car.  Why do we not address this quickly?  Tell me when we are going to have mandatory 30 km zones, according to the Road Safety Authority strategy.  What is the time limit on it?</p></speech>

I cannot speak for county councils.  My question to the Deputy is who is blocking all of this?  To answer his question about when we will have 30 km/h as a default, this is the whole purpose of us appearing at this committee today.  The RSA is certainly not pushing back on 30 km/h default speed limits.  We have the governance structure in place.  As part of the governance structure, we have layered a legislative group on top that will have representatives from all the organisations.  I am in agreement with the Deputy.  I am not here just to talk about this for the next four or five years.  I want to deliver.  It is the case that we should have the respectful debate with whoever is blocking it.  They may be blocking it for a valid reason.</p></speech>

Why not go the other way?  We could look at each town, village and larger urban centre and tweak it with a 3 km radius around it and say it is a 30 km/h zone.  Does the RSA think that is a quick approach we could take to this?  Put this before the councils and that the councils make the decision.  I am not trying to take the decision-making away from the councils.  I am looking for a way to do it.  Sometimes this can just be stuck in the way that councils are overstretched in many areas and nobody is driving this.  Unless I had done up that map and produced it-----</p></speech>

The terms of reference of this working group will be key because they will determine the outcomes.  What is needed is almost an implementation plan coming out of the working group.  If it was straightforward, it would have been done.  However, it involves myriad local authorities. We can take up the terms of reference of the working group.  It is there and it is up and running.  The membership is key.  The terms of reference are vital because they deal with putting in place an implementation programme, more or less straight away, rather than it just being a report.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Waide.  Equally, I know one thing from my years around this.  In the long term, it works to put in the work, to get the due diligence right and to have a structured approach.  Otherwise, what happens is, there is great enthusiasm, the balloons go up, and then, basically, the document is found to be toothless.  The devil is in the detail.  I do not know if Ms Swift or Ms O'Dea would agree, but there is an opportunity here in implementation.  I agree with Deputy Matthews.  The question here is not just about Bray; it is about a multitude of areas.  Everyone wants safety and everyone wants us to reduce speeds.  Equally, there will be those who give out that they cannot get from point A to point B.  This is about serious public buy-in as well.</p></speech>

What we want is for motorists to use the streets courteously and for the streets to be shared with everybody.  The streets are not just for cars.  We are ingrained to think they are, and that has happened over many years.  The amount of street space allocated to cars is disproportionate given the modern society we are in.</p><p>I am not criticising the RSA.  I want delivery on this, as does the RSA.  We all want safety.  I want to save lives and I want it done quickly.  I think this measure would save lives and, not only that, it would make for more pleasant living on streets in towns.</p></speech>

The working group has to examine and review the framework for setting the speed limits.  It is not just the 30 km/h default and it is not just in urban areas, it is the overall scope.  Consideration is to be given to recommendations on the 30 km/h default limit as that mirrors the programme for Government.  That is where the action is generated from.</p></speech>

It is a vital piece of work.</p> <p>  I was taken with a point Dr. D'Arcy made earlier about seeking short-term fixes and that mitigations occurred.  I remember on the county council that people would look for ramps, which were necessary at times, especially for reasons of child safety in estates, and if they were lucky enough to get them there would be complaints from residents because people would hit the ramp at speed and continue on.  It is a case of accepting if something has not worked and looking at something that works better.</p> <p>  We all know the significant issues with planning; the elongated processes involved in dealing with local authorities and from time to time local authorities trying to do their element of due diligence.  We need to do our piece of due diligence.  We will have to invite in the local authorities, be that the LGMA or whoever else, just to see exactly where they are in this regard, because they might say it is all well and good but that they need to deal with X, Y and Z to get to the bottom of it.  I also assume the working group will deal with some of the issues.  Beyond that, it is a case of getting on with it.  Do the witnesses from the RSA think there are other issues that will impact, such as planning and the elongated way of dealing with local authorities or whatever else?  At the end of the day, there is one item on the agenda, which is to try to bring about a safer urban space that will also allow for active travel.</p></speech>

That is one of the 50 projects over the next four years.  Three common themes have been identified in the Government's road safety strategy: data, legislation and funding.  I have touched on the funding already.  I have not touched on the data and legislation as I am mindful of everyone's time, but there will be challenges, perhaps not necessarily in this particular project on the 30 km/h default, but I accept and respectfully acknowledge that a consultation of sorts will be required for many of the 50 high-impact actions and projects over the next four years.  There will be legislative and data challenges.  We discussed data briefly in one regard but those are systemic challenges that we all need to be courageous about in terms of what needs to change from a legislative point of view.  An example was given about the role of an organisation in the system and what role it plays in the decision-making process.  There are complexities.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy who wants to do things quickly, the sooner we deliver, the sooner we will see reduced collisions, serious injuries and fatalities but it is complex.  Some things are more complex than others but data and legislation are two massive challenges that I expect I and others will be back to discuss with the committee.</p></speech>

They include the Departments of Transport, Justice and Education.  This is a multifaceted, multi-Department, cross-agency challenge.  There will be difficult conversations, challenges and issues at many junctures.  I will not go through some of the obvious ones today, but I touched on the fact that the data and legislation will be very challenging for all of us.  It is important that we discuss, debate and address these matters.</p></speech>

I have said before and I will say it again that we will continue to share data on a legal basis but we need encouragement and support from the system as a whole because countries around the world share data to save lives and whether it is for diabetes, cancer or whatever the condition might be, road safety is no different and we should be sharing data in a more agile way to save lives.</p></speech>

However, I read all of the briefing documents and the opening statements and I was here at the start.  I watched online the RSA&rsquo;s launch of the strategy back in December and its chairperson, Liz O'Donnell, is a former Deputy from my area, so I certainly fully support the work the RSA has done, which has been phenomenal in bringing the figures down.  In 1972, there were close to 600 deaths a year at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road, although cars were not as safe in terms of seat belts and other equipment.  I fully support the work of the RSA.</p> <p>  I get from the briefing documentation the 30 km/h issue in that Ireland seems to be a good bit further behind than many other countries.  Although I had not been on the M50 for a long time, I happened to be on it recently and I was coming off at an exit which has a 30 km/h limit on the loop from the M50 to the M7.  Even when I was trying to do 30 km/h, everyone was flying past me.  If we put a camera there, we would find there is not a single car that is doing 30 km/h or anything like it.  I look at the arterial roads in Donnybrook, Ranelagh, Rathmines and Stillorgan.  If we were to make all of those roads 30 km/h in the morning, I could not see many people doing 50 km/h half of the time.  Obviously, they are stuck in traffic when in traffic, but when the traffic is not there, the challenge is to get them to even do 50 km/h.  I apologise if I am repeating questions that were already asked.  How do we get people to slow down?  Is there telemetry that can do this?  Hopefully, we are transitioning to electric cars and so on.  As I drive near a school or into a town centre, could there be some type of beam that tells my car that it can only do 30 km/h and it slows me down from whatever speed I am doing towards 30 km/h in a measured way, and the car just does not let me go any faster than that?  Is that technology there?</p> <p>  I imagine it is there but can it be enforced?  Can we insist on every new car being that way?  It is not the job of the RSA and I know insurance companies do their own thing.  However, insurance companies could say to people that if they put the equipment in their car, the insurance company will give them a significant discount when it tracks their behaviour and sees what they are doing.</p> <p>  I was recently on a motorway for the first time in about six months.  I was doing no more than the speed limit at any stage but there were plenty of cars going past me and the speed limit was much higher than 30 km/h.  I wonder how enforceable it is.  I know we can enforce it in certain areas and, for example, in a built-up housing estate there are ramps and potentially a lot of parked cars which force people to slow down, but how do we get people to drive at 30 km/h?  I see many people will not even do 50 km/h or 60 km/h in the areas where that is the speed limit.  I live in a built-up urban area in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where I sometimes see this in housing estates.  If people could do 50 km/h and stick to it, that would be a good start, in my opinion, but how do we get all of us to drive at 30 km/h?</p></speech>

For the past couple of years, the RSA has been working with the European Commission and the European Transport Safety Council.  Ireland has taken a lead and has influenced intelligent speed assistance and the mandatory requirement for car manufacturers to have that intelligent speed assistance.  I agree with the Senator that many cars already have that functionality which tells drivers they are breaking the speed limit.  Whether they pay heed to that or ignore it is a personal choice.  More and more, and similar to delivery, the technology is often ahead of policy and legislation.  At the same time, it creates opportunity.  The majority of vehicles now have a map application in the cabin so that as soon as a person drives from a 50 km/h zone into a 30 km/h zone, it tells them on a screen in front of them that they are in a 30 km/h zone, so not only is there an audible warning that the driver is at an inappropriate speed, there is also a visible warning.  My colleague has much more detail on this in terms of the research.</p> <p>  To answer the question of what we can do as a country, there is one transformational intervention in that we can make it law that vehicles do not exceed the national speed limit.  That is transformational.</p></speech>

There are other transformational interventions.  I have engaged in continued conversations with my colleagues in Europe on automation so that it takes the stress off drivers and the car automatically switches to the permissible legal speed limit.  However, those are things which are not only transformational but would need extensive consultation with EU members.</p></speech>

I was a councillor and was the chair of the transport special policy committee in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is five miles wide and eight miles long and has a significant population living in a built-up urban area.  I cannot count the number of times we got requests for ramps everywhere.  If we could take out the ramps or not have to spend a fortune putting in ramps and, instead, as the car turns off the main road or off a side road it has to be brought to a certain speed, we would not need to repair ramps and we would not have trouble with car suspensions and people getting their lights set before the NCT because every time they go over a ramp, it knocks them out.  There is so much technology but we are way behind.  Has the RSA ideas that it could bring to us, as legislators, and that it wants us to implement so that every new car has this technology?  It is all very well saying a car cannot go past 120 km/h but, equally, as it drives into a town and it hits a 30 km/h limit, it should be forced to slow down to that speed.  Can we do that?</p></speech>

Technology is moving apace but there is a great opportunity for Ireland to lead on road safety, not just follow.  Recently, a Spanish television channel came over to interview me because there was interest in what Ireland was doing on road safety.  Our Celtic neighbour, Scotland, wants to find out what we are doing because everyone in Ireland is talking about road safety.</p><p> We have put in place an ambitious strategy.

For example, we could all drive to Cork at 10 km/h but it would take us four weeks, 40 hours or whatever.  No one is suggesting that.  Much of the time, I see people flying past me but, when I get to the lights, I am going past them because they are in a queue of cars.  I do not understand people who accelerate to lights just to sit in a queue, but that is a separate issue because the queues are not there at night and people are flying up and down many arterial roads at much more than 50 km/h or 60 km/h.</p> <p>  We must do whatever we can to harness technology that tracks people's behaviour.  It was a former Minister for Transport, Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan, who asked me to run for local office the first time.  He introduced penalty points.  All of a sudden, we saw driver behaviour changing considerably.  At the time, it was three offences.  Is it 70 now?  I believe it used to be just seat belts, mobile phones and something else.  Whether we liked it or not, the penalty points system was transformative.  Dr. D'Arcy might speak about the technological aspect of speed limits and how deliverable that is.  It will be the game changer, given what happens when people are monitored, be it via a tracker device in the car or any other technology.</p> <p>  I would love to see ramps gone from estates because they wreck cars, are annoying and expensive to maintain and do nothing for the environment.  They are a blunt tool and were necessary 20 or 30 years ago.  I would love to see them being replaced by intelligent technology in cars that stops people from speeding wherever they are.</p></speech>

My understanding is that this committee is inviting the Garda to appear before it.  I hope that, like me, the Garda would welcome the Senator's question on there being no cars on the road at night-time.  The other night, I was travelling down the motorway and a car overtook me.  I guesstimated that it was probably doing 200 km/h.  This relates to section 38, which deals with whether someone is driving 5 km/h or 55 km/h over the speed limit.  I would encourage the committee to take up that question with the Garda.</p></speech>

Technology is a sticking plaster, in that it takes away the individual's personal responsibility for his or her behaviour.  If we want a cultural change in terms of adhering to traffic speeds, we need people to have personal responsibility.  There needs to be a cultural acceptance of not travelling faster.  The RSA has done an excellent job with its information campaigns down the years &ndash; New Zealand has brilliant ones as well &ndash; empowering people to say to the driver of the car to put away his or her mobile phone, to stop being distracted and not to break the speed limit.  There are ways and means of drawing on people's hearts and minds to adhere to that.  These initiatives come in cycles and we have to keep reminding people of the "Why".  If we place an over-reliance on technology, it removes personal responsibility, so we have to think of creative ways of getting people to adhere.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I have a direct clash at this meeting's time &ndash; that happens sometimes &ndash; but I will be happy to watch it later.</p> <p>  I am familiar with the RSA's strategy.  I believe its launch was before Christmas.  What changes does it entail for the RSA's structures, governance and relationship with other agencies?  Is the strategy sufficiently resourced to deliver on its objectives in the timeframe that has been set out?</p></speech>

As a country, we have been successful in reducing road fatalities.  The previous strategy comprised a number of actions and, using their best efforts, people delivered a lot of good stuff.  However, they did not deliver some other stuff because there was a lack of funding or funding was reallocated.  The difference with the new strategy and governance model is that a partnership approach is being taken.  We have already mentioned the various organisations and pressures involved, but we are in a partnership room together and I look forward to us helping one another to address problems rather than going "He said, she said" and pointing fingers.</p> <p>  We have already covered the second part of the Deputy's question on funding.  We are talking about a 50% reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries between now and 2030.  Does anyone believe that a 50% reduction in anything is possible without additional or new moneys to transform road safety in Ireland for the good?  It is the right thing to do.  There needs to be a recognition that this is additional.  I have shared with the committee what the additional request for the first four years will be.  Our organisation and our delivery partners are all determined to have break points in the strategy &ndash; 2024, 2027 and 2030 &ndash; so that we can step back and determine whether it is realistic and whether we need more funding than was set out originally.</p><p>There may be areas where we have good strands, make good progress and do not need as much funding as we thought but I do not believe that.  I believe this will always be a case of an ongoing commitment to provide new, different money.  This is not just about building new roads and putting in extra cycle lanes.  It is much more than that.</p><p> I have shared with the committee the statement of resource for the next four years.  Concern was expressed earlier about there being so much to do.  My delivery partners in all the agencies and I have committed to delivering those 50 high-impact actions in that time but we need support and funding to make that happen.  Otherwise, I will be here in one year or four years and it will sound repetitive.  I will be saying it has not been delivered because the funding was not released or allocated.</p></speech>

The amount of money involved does not appear enormous.  It is &euro;4 million per year, basically.  There is a strategy.  We will follow up on that.  I am conscious that we are here to discuss the 30 km/h campaign.  We want to push on that.</p></speech>

How does Ms D'Arcy reflect on that?  Does it align with her objectives?  What is the framework for change?  If we got the behaviour piece right, we could do without the constraints in terms of infrastructure, engineering and, in some cases, regulations and enforcement.  What are the most important elements to get right initially to deliver the transformational change needed?</p></speech>

The first is to change the current default of 50 km/h in built-up areas to 30 km/h.  That makes it simpler for all local authorities.  They know what the default is and only need to discuss roads where a higher speed limit is more appropriate.</p> <p> The second change relates to the definition of "built-up areas".  It is out of date and many newer towns are not included.  That list of built-up areas needs to be updated.</p></speech>

It is comprehensive, and it is clear that the RSA listened to its stakeholder consultation.  There is a broad reach to it.  In my opening statement, I mentioned that traditionally we have been about protecting the people in the car and driver safety.  That was the remit of the RSA when it was set up but there is a broader viewpoint now and it is great.  We do not know what we do not know.  Sometimes, speaking from experience as a civil engineer, we get taught a particular viewpoint on something and to solve problems in a certain way.  It is only when we start to consider different viewpoints that we understand better.  The RSA has been great in commissioning and funding research but we need more research in this space.  From an Irish perspective, we need to invest in more active travel research.  We do not have enough.  Active travel interventions have a high burden of proof, as we well know.  Every time we try to do something, we come up against the fact that we do not have Irish research.  There is a lot internationally for us to feed from.</p> <p>  I will use one example that has come to mind a few times when people have mentioned putting the foot down and speeding between junctions.  When we design for walkability and put the pedestrian first, as per the street user hierarchy we are meant to be implementing as part of DMURS, and put more pedestrian crossings along a route, it slows the car because it moves slowly between the sections.  A driver can feel he or she moves faster but then is waiting, when actually the average speed over the journey can be quicker by travelling at lower speeds.  Slower is faster in some cases.</p> <p>  Preliminary results have emerged from London recently concerning when lights are on a default pedestrian mode.  Respecting that hierarchy, in urban areas the pedestrian has priority at every light.  The default setting of lights is the green man.  When a car approaches, the microwave technology causes the light to change if there is no pedestrian waiting.  This was found to have resulted in no overall change in travel times.  Travel times have not increased for cars but have been greatly decreased for pedestrians.  We then get more people walking and cycling on 2 km trips or short trips in our neighbourhoods and have more walkable neighbourhoods because it reinforces itself.  People will drive more carefully because they expect to see pedestrians and cyclists and have got used to seeing them.</p> <p>  A cultural change needs to happen.  In neighbourhoods like Donnybrook, Ballymun and around the country, such as in Sligo, wide roads cut through urban areas.  We have to consider how we redesign these because we have segregated neighborhoods and there is a research area around that.  We do not want segregated neighbourhoods because of the impact on climate, population health and road safety.</p></speech>

I know that Senator Horkan has left, but it was interesting that he mentioned speeding at night.  I have at home a photo I took in Trier, Germany, a couple of years ago of a 30 km/h sign, but the difference is that underneath is written "between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.".  It was on a residential road where the residents were not to be disturbed by speeding cars.  That is another aspect of this.  I was also interested to hear Dr. D'Arcy mention pedestrian lights and the fact that they do not actually delay drivers.  It is logical that if I press the button and am waiting two and a half minutes, which is how long it can be in some cases, and on the new road in Sligo that was mentioned there is some fault and I could be waiting four minutes, and if I get fed up waiting and dash across the road, the light still changes and then the driver has to stop.  The driver having to stop in the first place would make more sense than his having to stop when I am gone.  It is therefore logical that the pedestrian priority, the green man, would not in fact impede traffic.</p></speech>

By definition, once there were fewer cars, they were getting through more easily.  There was a disincentive to travel by car because drivers were hitting lights all the time.  That might be a layman's view, but was that one feature of it?</p></speech>

That is the other part of this, that is, not having to stop for anybody for 2 km, as opposed to having to stop four or five times.</p></speech>

We had a discussion earlier about the road network, pavement size etc.  None of this is perfect.  We have to build it into the planning process.  Do the witnesses have a view on any of that?  In fairness, Ms Swift's answer was a decent one.  Near my house, there is a roundabout at a crossroads at the bottom of the Avenue Road, in Dundalk, and there are traffic lights at it.  If somebody presses the button and wants to cross the road at only one point, it has an impact across the board, and from time to time there are probably accidents.  Some people think pressing the button is not necessarily always the most sensible solution, and some people probably drive through red lights.  I would say there is only a percentage of adherence to the pedestrian light.  It is the worst of all worlds.  I assume that something better than that could probably be arranged.  It clogs traffic at busy times.</p><p>I accept the reason it is done.  Rather than me pontificating, I ask Dr. D'Arcy to outline what else we can do?</p></speech>

As there is no requirement to press a button and wait for the green light, it promotes better awareness among motorists because that they have to look out for a pedestrian at the crossing.  I have seen wide roads and streets in towns in Spain where there is a zebra crossing every 200 m and so the traffic goes very slowly and stops if there is somebody at the crossing.</p></speech>

Would Dr. D'Arcy like to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-01a.1198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030100002#T00400"><p>I echo the point with regard to zebra crossings.  In Oslo, where there are zero pedestrian fatalities at every junction, whether on the periphery of the city or in the city centre, there is a zebra crossing at every corner.  Some of the crossings that are on the more heavily trafficked roads or the distributor roads have lights on them as well but there are not that many distributor roads.  The default pedestrian was mentioned.  One of the key challenges in terms of training traffic engineers and in learnings about junction and traffic light design is that the pedestrian is always at the lowest ebb of it.  The full cycle of movement of all of the cars has to happen before the pedestrian face comes in.  The pedestrian face might only happen if the button is pressed, but one still might have to wait for the three minutes regardless of whether there are any vehicles at any junctions.  There is an issue in regard to compliance with red lights.  We see that happening everywhere.  People think that because there is nothing coming they can keep going.</p> <p>  Reference was made to "having to look".  Zebra crossings force people to slow down and look out for a pedestrian.  The person driving the car does not have the priority in that case.  This refers back to Deputy Hourigan's point earlier about the hi-vis jackets.  It is about the expectation that one might see something.  It can be seen as victim blaming but it puts the onus on the pedestrian to be seen rather than on the driver to keep a look out and to be mindful of what is happening.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's point with regard to London, they are at very early days in that study.  It is hard to tell yet if there is going to be what we call "traffic evaporation" in that case.  There is long-standing literature and evidence around traffic evaporation in other cases when pedestrians are prioritised.  Where we facilitate and make safer pedestrian and cycling trips, we see less cars on the road.  This is not necessarily because people feel like they are stuck in traffic for longer.  It is more that they see that bicycles can move about much more efficiently.  People give out that nobody is using the cycle lanes.  That is because they are so efficient people are moving through them quickly.  When people are stuck in traffic they do not really take note and accept that they are the traffic that is causing the problem.  </p> <p>  Equally, when we design for better pedestrian infrastructure and cycling infrastructure, when we are more equitable in our provision, we find that females by default are a lot more affected.  When we design around the car and default to the car, we assume that everybody in the household has access to a car but it is the women of the household who are generally left without mobility.   Added to that, is the issue around having a child and a buggy or a mobility issue.  Anyone who has ever had to hold on to two toddlers at the same time while trying to cross a road when there is no pedestrian crossing knows how difficult that is.  I refer to the KCR junction in Dublin as being one of those junctions where my heart went through my mouth so many times.  If there is no pedestrian crossing, the person is forced to get into a car to drive 500 m to the shop because it is too difficult and too dangerous to do otherwise.  The older person who wants to collect a pension has to rely on somebody else coming to collect and bring him or her to the post office instead of him or her being able to travel their independently.  We have to consider all of these causes and balance the provision.</p> <p>  Walkability is my area.  Walking is top of the hierarchy.  For me, it is about pedestrian infrastructure and recognising walking, cycling, active travel, sustainable transport, including public transport, because every public transport trip includes a walking trip and so in providing better public transport we are providing for walkability.  By default, that makes people slow down.  It makes people much more aware of their surroundings.  There are more people that they have to consider and therefore behave more responsibly.</p></speech>

In regard to hi-vis, our preference would be that we would not have to distribute hi-vis.  That will happen once we reduce speed limits and we have safer streets.  In the meantime, we are left with no choice but to ensure that our children are safe on the roads and that is the reason we distribute hi-vis jackets.</p> <p>  Part of our function as the Road Safety Authority is to make people aware and to educate people.  As a result of that, our annual conference later this year in December will deal with the issue of speeding.  We are bringing in some international experts, including Rod King, who is an expert on 20 km/h.  He was instrumental in its delivery in the UK.  We will let the committee know about that closer to the time.</p></speech>
