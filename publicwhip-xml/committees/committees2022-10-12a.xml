Members are required to participate in the meeting remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Senators Paul Gavan and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey.  Today we are going to discuss the cost of living, the minimum wage increase and the Low Pay Commission report.  Most employees in Ireland are entitled to a minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Since 1 January 2022, the national minimum wage is &euro;10.50 per hour.  In July 2022, the Low Pay Commission published its report, Recommendations for the National Minimum Wage.  On 14 September, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, announced that he had received Government approval to accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023.  </p> <p>  Today I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider these matters further.  I would like to welcome from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Dr. Laura Bambrick, head of social policy and employment affairs, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.  We had invited IBEC but unfortunately its representatives were unable to attend.  We tried to get others to attend but it was too late.  That is why we just have one side, so to speak.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person when giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable or engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially damaging to a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all the members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Dr. Laura Bambrick to make the opening statement on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#A00300"><p>On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to input into its considerations on the cost of living, the minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission recommendation for 2023.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Liam Berney.</p> <p>  The minimum wage is the lowest rate of pay an employer can legally pay their workers.  It is currently set at &euro;10.50 for each hour worked.  Much is made of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest minimum wage rates in the European Union but this is misleading.  Ireland was already the second most expensive country in the EU 27 before the ongoing inflation surge.  In 2020, when there was zero inflation, the price of a sample basket of 2,000 everyday consumer goods and services was more than a third higher than the EU average.  In other words, when the purchasing power of minimum wage workers is taken into account, it drops from second to seventh position in the rankings and behind our wealthy EU peers.</p> <p>  Likewise, much is made of the near doubling of the rate from when it was first introduced in 2000 at &euro;5.58, which was &pound;4.40 at the time.  Again, this is misleading.  Increases to the minimum wage have not kept pace with wage growth in the wider economy.  When it was introduced, the minimum wage was equivalent to two thirds of the median hourly wage for all employees in the workforce.</p><p>This is official low-pay threshold set by the OECD.  By 2019, pre-pandemic, it had dropped below 45% of median earnings and we had the third lowest minimum wage as a percentage of our median wage in the EU, only after Estonia and Malta.  This is from European Commission research.  The current minimum hourly rate of pay is 52% of the median hourly rate and remains below both the 60% poverty line and the 66% low-pay threshold.  Put simply, despite 14 increases to the rate since its introduction in 2000 the adequacy of the minimum wage has significantly deteriorated over time.<br/><br/>The minimum wage will soon undergo radical reform.  In anticipation of new EU law to ensure adequate wages for workers, the Government is at an advanced stage of planning to move to a new method for calculating the rate.  The so-called &quot;fixed threshold approach&quot; calculates the minimum wage as a percentage of a benchmark.  The Government is proposing that the rate will be benchmarked to 60% of the median hourly wage, to be phased in over four years, that is, by 2026.<br/><br/>Other member states are taking more immediate action.  On 1 October, Germany increased its minimum rate of pay to &euro;12 an hour.  This is equivalent to 60% of their median wage, which is the poverty threshold, and represented a 25% increase in their minimum wage from the start of year, which was then at &euro;9.60.  This will benefit more than 6 million workers, mostly women.  This is a total of 18% of the German workforce.  In contrast, the Low Pay Commission recommended an 80 cent increase to &euro;11.30 an hour for 2023.  As told to this committee by the chair of the commission on 28 September, and widely repeated in Government messaging, &quot;This represents a 7.6% increase and is the largest increase recommended by the commission to date.&rdquo;  While this is true, it is also true that prior to the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015 to make recommendations on the appropriate rate of the minimum wage, larger increases were made to the rate.  We saw a 10.2% increase in 2004, a 9.3% increase in 2005 and an 8.5% increase in 2007.<br/><br/>The Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for both 2022 and 2023 have also fallen short of inflation.  Incomes would have to increase by 15.5% over the two years to maintain pace with inflation.  An 80 cent increase in the hourly rate is inadequate to protect the living standards of workers on the lowest wage, which is why the two ICTU nominated members on the commission opposed the recommendation.<br/><br/>Trade unions do not underestimate the scale of the challenges facing some businesses.  An estimated 165,000 workers, or 7% of the workforce, are earning the minimum wage or less and comprise those on sub-minimum rates and more than half of these are working in just two sectors, namely, hospitality and retail.<br/><br/>To move from the sectoral level to the firm level, Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research from 2021 funded by the Low Pay Commission shows that just 3% of all businesses pay more than half of their employees a minimum wage.  Where there is proven financial difficulty, there is provision under the legislation to exempt an employer from the obligation to pay the minimum wage rate.  Ultimately, we draw the committee's attention to the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive impact assessment of its directive, which finds that the negative impacts of an adequate minimum wage on SMEs are expected to be limited.  The impact assessment summary states: </p><blockquote>	  	Firstly, they are likely to be able to pass on increased labour costs to consumers by increasing prices.  Secondly, increased minimum wages may also increase demand for their services.  Potential negative impacts of increased labour costs for SMEs would be partly counterbalanced by more gradual and predictable minimum-wage increases, which would improve the business environment.   </blockquote><p>Before Cabinet took a decision on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation for 2023, our general secretary Patricia King reminded them that the legislation allows for the Government to implement a different rate than that recommended and urged it to go beyond the recommended 80 cent.  It did not do this.  The Finance Bill provides it with another opportunity to do right by our lowest-paid workers, many of whom are the same workers who were lauded as essential during Covid.<br/><br/>I thank members for their attention and we are happy to take questions. </p></speech>

I remind members who are joining us remotely to use the "raise hand" feature and, importantly, to take it down when they are finished speaking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#B00300"><p>I thank our witnesses for the information provided.  I would have preferred to receive a copy of this before I read about it on RT&Eacute;.  We can discuss that on another date.</p> <p>  On the calculation of the living wage, which is a stated aim of the Government - although it has put the timeframe for it outside the lifetime of its own Government, which is quite handy - 60% of the median hourly rate is where they are going.  Do the witnesses have a view on how that should be done?  Would the Irish Congress of Trace Unions, ICTU, be agreeable with 60% of the median?  Would ICTU favour the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, approach?  I understand there are pros and cons to both approaches but does ICTU have a preference for that?  As encompassed by the living wage, does ICTU see the move to the living wage as being a realistic roadmap to the complete elimination of the sub-minimal rates of pay?  We have not spoken about that.  I understand it is not in Dr. Bambrick's submission but I am sure that she does have a view on it, as do I.  There is an issue.  It is not just that the headline figure is the minimum wage, there are still people who, some for legitimate reasons, do not attain the full rate.  Some people are doing the same job but with the wrong date of birth are getting less money.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The first thing to say is that the commitment to move to a living wage, or 60% by 2026, is making a virtue of necessity.  As this is coming from European law, this is happening.  The only thing we really have to discuss and flesh out today is when it is going to happen and the timeline, as the Deputy has mentioned, and possibly the calculation method.</p> <p>  Let us take the calculation method first.  ICTU supports the proposal of using the fixed threshold approach for a couple of reasons.  First, no other country has a national living wage that uses the MESL approach.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It is very subjective to do as it is based on focus groups.  There would be a lot of consternation about how those focus groups are selected and then what they decide as to what is the basket of goods.  We sort of would be going back to far-gone times where it was for others to decide what the low-paid should be spending their money on.  Do we include alcohol?  How much to include for socialising?  Do we include housing, especially in the context of an economy and a society with high housing costs?  It is highly subjective, there is an administration burden on it and it is financially burdensome to the State.  The main thing is that it is not very responsive and it does not give employers clarity.  At least if we peg it to a fixed-threshold approach, it is more responsive for the employees and it is much more realistic for the employers.</p><p>They can see what is coming down.  For those reasons, while the fixed threshold approach is not without its problems, we do think it is superior.  We also think it should be pegged at 66%, in other words, the low pay threshold.  That has the added benefit that at 66%, or the fixed threshold approach, it is at or slightly above the<b></b>minimum essential standard of living, MESL.  Therefore, we get the benefit of having that basket of goods without all the problems the MESL approach can bring.  We think that is an appropriate approach.<br/><br/>The four-year timeline is very problematic.  Economies like Germany are not known to be fast and loose in economic terms.  As I mentioned, on Saturday two weeks previous, they moved a 25% increase from &euro;9.60 to &euro;12.  They are showing it can be done.  They have the same percentage of their workforce, that is, 18%, that would benefit in our economy if we moved to 60% this year.  To be fair to the Low Pay Commission, in its recommendations around the living wage, it does make allowances in certain situations, whether it be economic or evidence-based experience from other countries, for the process to be speeded up over those four years.  We think four years is too long, however, as the Deputy mentioned.  It is outside the Government's own commitment to move to a living wage within the term of this Government.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00300"><p>Ireland is really unusual in the EU.  We are one of four European members of the OECD that pays a sub-minimum rate to young adult workers, that is, those aged over 18.  We are well behind the curve.  Many countries would have had them previously but they have moved away.  We are delaying that.</p> <p>  We were really disappointed because we were very strong in our evidence to the Low Pay Commission when it was looking at how the progress to a living wage would be structured.  A large chunk of our evidence was made looking at this area of sub-minimum rates for young adults.  We were very disappointed to see that the commission decided the new living wage should exclude those workers.</p> <p>  What is particularly worrying is that at the same time, we are quite rightly seeing Government encouraging apprenticeships.  That is a gold standard of trade union policy.  We have a concern, however, that we will see more quasi-apprenticeships and traineeships as a workaround to a living wage because, of course, apprentices are the other large group that are not covered by either minimum wage or a living wage.  It is, therefore, an issue on which we are behind the curve.  There is no reason for this.  More worrying, it is EU law that if we are going to exempt certain types of employment from minimum wage legislation, it must be evidence-based.  We cannot find the evidence base for not covering young adults for a minimum wage and in turn, a living wage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00400"><p>I am relieved that Dr. Bambrick cannot find the evidence because I cannot find it either.  It is fair to say we have both been looking.  It would also be reasonable to say that the evidence does not exist.  To be fair, if we have looked and others have looked and we cannot find it, the evidence or justification cannot be found.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00500"><p>The strongest justification we have been told is that it is there to encourage young adults to stay in education.  This is contradictory, however.  We have the highest cost of education for young adults.  Therefore, how can those two opposing facts sit side by side?  We would say that it really is open to challenge.</p> <p>  According to the T&aacute;naiste's evidence to this committee last week, a paper is going to Cabinet around what the living wage will look like now we have had the public consultation.  We hope this has dealt with it.  It is, however, something we will be pursuing and campaigning about for the rest of this year and into next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00600"><p>I should mention that my colleague, Senator Gavan, also introduced legislation on this issue previously.  It is something that is of concern to Sinn F&eacute;in as well.</p> <p>  Dr. Bambrick mentioned the minimum wage increases ranging from between 8.5% and 10.2% between 2004 and 2007.  I absolutely know this was not Dr. Bambrick's intention but it looks on paper as if the Low Pay Commission was getting in the way of those increases.</p> <p>  I want to make a broader point regarding a potential for wage spiral, however.  It has been put to us in flashing blue lights that any increases in the minimum rates of pay that are beyond the very modest one that was announced recently would cause a wage spiral inflation.  I am not convinced of that.  Does Dr. Bambrick have a view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00700"><p>To be clear, we are not saying that the Low Pay Commission itself has resulted in lower recommendations than when it was a decision by Government.  However, we are saying the consensual approach for reaching agreement on what the rate of pay is has failed.  To be fair, it has not just failed in Ireland, because 19 of the 21 EU countries with a statutory minimum wage have minimum wage rates below 60%.  This is why the EU has to step in.  Right across the block, we have minimum wages that are not keeping workers out of poverty.  The consensual approach was introduced in 2015.  We have an equal number of worker representatives, businesses and independents, as well as a chair, to make a decision, taking into account various evidence and factors.  It is majority rule, however.  It goes to Government and, as I mentioned, the legislation allows Government to accept or reject and make its own recommendations.  That has never been done but that safeguard is built into the legislation.  As I said, however, the consensual methodology of the commission has added to the inadequacy of the minimum wage over time.  That will be dealt with in this move to a fixed-base approach.</p> <p>  On the wage spiral, we are talking about pay increases to 167,000 workers out of a working population of 2.5 million.  These are the people who will be spending those extra few cent they are getting in their hourly wage and who will be driving up the demand in the sectors in which they are working.  Therefore, no, there is no evidence of wage spiral.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00800"><p>I could not find any of that either.  I thank Dr. Bambrick.  In the last couple of days, civil and public servants voted to accept pay rises that do not keep pace with inflation.  That has been acknowledged by ICTU.  It is 6.5% for the average and 7.8% for those on the lowest pay.  I am not in any way trying to interfere with the democratic process within the trade union movement, nor did I ever thank any politician for interfering in it when I was on the other side of the table.  I want to make a point with regard to returning, however.  The president of ICTU said that should the need arise, and it very well might, the union reserves the right to use the clause within the agreement to return back to the negotiating table.</p> <p>  Similar can happen with regard to the minimum wage.  Would Dr. Bambrick see there being a reasonable case to be made for reconvening the commission and asking it to make another suggestion?  Would she see a scenario whereby the relevant Minister, obviously, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, could take that decision independently if inflation is to go way further than is recommended?</p> <p>  As Dr. Bambrick rightly pointed out, it is money in, money out when a person is on a low income.  It goes straight into the local economy.  It goes right down to the local shop and into local businesses.  However, would Dr. Bambrick foresee a scenario whereby either the Government itself can make a decision or the Low Pay Commission can be reconvened and asked to make an additional suggestion?  It is very clear within the public service agreement how that will happen.  Clearly, there is a mechanism in place to trigger those negotiations.  How can that happen outside of that provision within the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission?</p></speech>

With regard to the minimum wage, however, our two colleagues who did not sign off on the Low Pay Commission recommendation made a minority report.  They recommended in their report that the increase would be done in a two-step approach.</p><p>This is exactly what Germany did.

However, the results of the ballots from trade unions last week indicated that workers in the public sector are broadly in favour of the recommendations, and on that basis, we have given our indication to the Government.  Nevertheless, the increased rate of pay in the public sector, and in particular the 3% from 1 March, came about as a review of the Building Momentum agreement, which was referred to.  The trade union movement will not be shy in triggering the review if that is required on another occasion.</p></speech>

I did not receive their opening statement until after 9 a.m., which is not acceptable.</p> <p>  Between February 2015, when the Low Pay Commission was established, and July 2021, prices increased by 4.4%.  In February 2015, the minimum wage was &euro;8.65 and in July 2021, the commission recommended a minimum wage of &euro;10.50 an hour, which the Government agreed to.  That equated to a 21% increase over a period when there was an increase of only 4.4% increase in prices.  Clearly, for a variety of reasons, we have seen much higher inflation most recently and that needs to be addressed.  Nevertheless, does Dr. Bambrick believe that prior to the recent surge in inflation, and certainly until July 2021, the Low Pay Commission was ensuring that the situation of lower income workers was improving consistently?</p></speech>

As I set out in my opening statement, we have not kept pace with that.  We started at 66% of the median wage and over time we have dipped as far as below 45%.  We are back at 52% but the 80 cent will bring us down to 51%, so we will be back down further.  We do not peg the minimum wage to prices but rather to other wages in the economy.  This is a better barometer of how much people will have to spend on the cost of living in that economy, and over time the value of the minimum wage related to wages in the economy has rapidly declined.  It is not like index-linking in social welfare, where it is indexed either to wages or to prices.  With the minimum wage, it is just about wages.</p></speech>

It is good to renew old friendships.  I think the Government's objective, which is in line with my belief, is that we need the fastest sustainable move to the living wage, but we do not have IBEC or any other employer representatives before the committee during this meeting, so I will put to our guests what I hear from small business.  It is looking at the 1.5% auto-enrolment, the new sick pay scheme starting in January, extended parental leave and the remote working legislation, and it is saying to us that this is a lot happening very quickly together and that we need some question of phasing and of understanding that the capacity of some businesses is very different from that of others.  That is the sort of question the Government tries to balance.  Today, the Central Bank indicated that 4% of businesses are at high risk of going under, and it suggested half of them can survive while the other half will go.  In the budget, the Government attempted to support workers through a difficult period when pay increases they would like to get might not be possible because of other pressures in the economy.</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear our guests' takes on those sorts of issues.  I acknowledge they do not represent small business and I do not expect them to, but are these issues they are hearing across the table?  Do they see scope for this sort of balance?  It is correct to say we could accelerate things if the economy does not go as badly as some fear.  This is a bit like "Hamlet" without the prince but I would like to hear our guests' views on those sorts of pressures that the other side, particularly the representatives of small business, has highlighted to us.</p></speech>

To be clear, unions are in the business of keeping people in their jobs; that is our ultimate reason for turning up for work.  We do not put forward recommendations that put jobs at risk.  The Deputy is correct that a lot of change is coming down the road.  This week, we heard that auto-enrolment has had several false starts, there will be sick pay at the start of next year and there is the move to a living wage, but that just means we are moving to a European style of pay compensation where it is not just about the wage that is paid at the end of the week but about the full package, of which the wage is one part.  The wage is protected when the worker is sick or retired or when he or she needs family leave.  Other countries are able to do this and there is much more predictability in wage demands when it is part of that package.</p></speech>

In our submission, we talked about the transposition of a new European directive on minimum wages.</p><p>An important part of that directive is the issue of extending collective bargaining coverage to 80% in the economy.  Research shows that the most effective way of combatting poverty and increasing wealth redistribution is through collective bargaining procedures at the level of the sector, of the enterprise or at a national level.  Over time, as collective bargaining coverage increases in the economy through the implementation of the directive, the type of issues to which Deputy Bruton referred will become less relevant, because collective bargaining will produce better outcomes for workers.  It will produce a more equal society and it will reduce poverty.  In our view that is the most effective way of dealing with wage adequacy in the economy.</p></speech>

Hospitality and those areas are hugely supportive.  The Deputy may have attended meetings during the pandemic and since the pandemic has eased where the Government met with representatives of small businesses and in particular with hospitality.  Those sectors continue to have their hands out for continuing supports.  Sometimes, quite frankly, it was a bit embarrassing to listen to it.</p> <p>  The other thing I would say is that they benefit from the 9.5% VAT rate.  In our experience, that 9.5% VAT rate is not passed on.  They soak it and they take it in increased profits.  While the representatives of small business do complain about all of the things that the Deputy has spoken about, a more balanced view about how small businesses are supported generally by Government, as well as the necessity to have workers compensated fairly, is the right approach that we should be taking in the longer term.</p></speech>

I thought that was an interesting point that ICTU made.  ICTU also said, I think that 5,000 workers, or 7%, were earning the minimum wage and that less than half of 54% are in hospitality and retail.  There are approximately 90,000 working in that area.  Does ICTU have any detail with respect to how many of those workers are under the ages of 24 or 25?  I note that the ESRI had a paper on decent working quite a while ago which said that 33% of the 18- to 24-year-olds were in temporary employment.  Many of those would possibly be students who would be working in those sectors in part-time jobs etc.  They would be working in the evenings, and they are needed.  I am also curious with respect to the other side of 54%.  Where are they and what areas are they in?</p> <p>  My other question relates to how when we walk around any towns now we will see signs in windows here and there for vacancies and jobs that are available and so forth.  In ICTU&rsquo;s view and in its experience, have the pressures in the area of labour pushed up wages?  In other words, if I am an employer and I want to employ somebody and if my competitor down the road is paying more, there is a risk that the worker will move to the competitor, rather than staying with me.  Has that had an impact on wages overall and on pushing them up?  Those are just a couple of questions to start with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#E01100"><p>I will go first on that.  I have the figure for the percentage of under 20s, although I do not have it with me because I did not expect us to go down this rabbit hole.  I should have expected that.  However, we know from the research that minimum wage workers are more likely than the overall workforce to be younger, to be female, to work part time and to be migrant.  That is a general point and I will get back to the Deputy with that percentage of the sub-minimum wage rate.</p> <p>  Regarding the point about the pushing up of wages, one of the issues we mentioned was that the two big sectors that are employers of people who are on minimum wage are also the biggest sectors that are seeing the problems with retention and recruitment.  If we are not seeing wage increases, we are seeing people following the wages.  This started coming out of Covid-19 where people were changing.  We have seen a lot of people not just moving, but employers moving sectors.  That has sped up now with inflation, so we are seeing people moving into higher paid, more predictable hours and more secure employment.  It is a difficulty for these low-paying sectors.  Wages and low pay is a real difficulty for these sectors.  They have skin in the game to get involved in addressing the wages of their staff.  This is therefore inadvertently pushing up the wages in these sectors because of the recruitment and retention difficulties.  This is more than the cost of living in the first instance.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton has already alluded to some reports and some that I think were in the <i>Irish Independent</i>that 4% of 10,000 businesses are facing the restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the business completely.  Could increasing the minimum wage in those circumstances actually accelerate the closure of some of these businesses?  We know from a more recent discussion that we had here that there are some methodologies where businesses can plead inability to pay and they do not do that.  Why does ICTU think that they do not do that, if they cannot?  They often instead go out of business or let people go.</p></speech>

Absolutely not.  If one's business model is premised on paying below-poverty wages, then there is something wrong with the business model.  It is not pushing that.  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, there is a withdrawal of Covid-19 supports, so we are seeing a delay in closures.  Many businesses have been kept on life support over the last two and a half years because of what were correctly very generous Government supports to keep vulnerable but viable businesses in place.  In doing that, we kept vulnerable non-viable businesses in place.  It is difficult to separate out how many of those businesses are failing because of the last recent crisis and the ongoing crisis.  However, this is certainly not about paying an extra 80 cent or more to 160,000 workers of a working population of 2.5 million.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Bambrick saying, then, that she expects quite a lot of businesses to go out of business in the short to medium term because of the other pressures and because their business model, as she says, is not sustainable?  This may be through no one&rsquo;s fault other than that maybe the business is not working and is not viable anymore.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  Is the percentage of workers who are on the minimum wage over the years going up or down?  Has it improved or disimproved overall?  This is bearing in mind that we did say that quite a number of people on the minimum wage are part time, temporary etc.?</p></speech>

It did dip for a while and then last year it went up.  That is because we are seeing many more young workers entering the workforce because of the tightness of the labour market.  The Deputy might have heard representatives from the hospitality industry speak about how when the schools and colleges reopened they were having real staffing problems because much of the previously available labour was not there.  We have seen an increase in 2021 and 2022 but it had reduced.</p><p>We have to remember as well that our workforce has been growing and has never been as large as it is now.</p><p> There were lots of good things about the State supports during the Covid crisis.  Not only were they generous but they have been one of the longest-running supports.  Unlike in other jurisdictions, when they were removed, there has been not been the tsunami here we were told to expect.  My colleague wants to come in at this point.</p></speech>

We are not going to see that; the increase will be about 9%.  We have been told, and it is correct, that wages cannot chase inflation.  That is why we had the &euro;11 billion budget package only two weeks ago, the bulk and lion's share of which related to cost-of-living measures.  However, as I mentioned, low-paid, minimum wage workers, first, will not benefit from the &euro;1.1 billion tax package because they do not earn enough to get the &euro;800 per year and, in addition, because they are mostly young, part-time workers, migrants and women, they will not benefit from a lot of what is in the cost-of-living packages.  A single worker with no children, for example, will not get the benefits of the 25% reduction in childcare costs, which we really welcome, or the move to free schoolbooks, which, again, we hugely welcome.  They might get the benefit of the income disregard increases for the medical card, which means they may be able to get GP care free at the point of use, and they will get the reduction in public transport.  If they are able to live outside the family box room, they may see the benefit of the tax relief for renters.</p> <p>  These workers are earning too little to benefit from the very generous tax relief package and, because of their circumstances, they will not benefit from many of the cost-of-living measures.  In addition, the vast majority, if they are working full-time, will not be on social welfare income supports.  They are caught between those two tools and their wages are the only avenue available to them for keeping up their living standards.  In that respect, the decline in the real wage is really important to this cohort.  We absolutely understand what the Government was trying to do with the budget.  It goes back to Deputy O'Reilly's point about public sector workers agreeing to a below-inflation increase.  Many of those workers will benefit from the childcare package, free schoolbooks and the other very good and permanent cost-of-living measures around the social wage the Government has introduced.  However, for the cohort of workers we have been discussing, their wage packet is the only buffer to protect their living standards.</p></speech>

I want to unpack that.  The unions did not agree with the proposed increase in the minimum wage.  It does not look very consensual when the body representing the vast majority of workers in this country did not consent to this inadequate increase.  Can she explain that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, not everybody has to vote for one's position but once enough people do, one gets a seat at the table.  To be fair, a year of work was put into coming to this decision.  It was not based on a show of hands.  Ultimately, that is what it comes down to, but there is a lot of trying to find a balance.  As Deputy Bruton laid out, it is about the cost for employers and making sure the wage is adequate but sustainable.  That is really important.</p></speech>

It is not unusual for that to happen and employers have done it as well.</p></speech>

The directive sets out that Governments shall provide a framework for enabling conditions for collective bargaining, by law and after consultation or agreement with the social partners, and shall establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining.  What level of consultation has taken place with the unions on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#F01200"><p>We estimate collective bargaining coverage in the economy is somewhere around 40% at a maximum.  In advance of implementation of the directive, there has been engagement at a high-level group comprising employer and union representatives.  The Government has accepted three very important recommendations around how to increase collective bargaining coverage.  These are to increase the use of the joint labour committee system and remove employers' veto on the operation of that system; increase the adequacy of the 2015 legislation whereby employees can make a claim to the Labour Court if their employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining by making that process much easier; and, more important, to encourage and provide a legislative framework for good faith bargaining whereby employers will be required to negotiate and have discussions with union representatives where unions represent employees in an enterprise.  People remember the LloydsPharmacy dispute, which was the most recent of several such disputes, in which the employer simply refused to negotiate with the union that represented its workers.  That will not be possible any more if the report of the high-level group is transposed into law in the way in which its report envisages.</p> <p>  There are other provisions in the directive around how public procurement can be used to increase collective bargaining coverage.  How that will be done is yet to be worked out.  As the Deputy said, it is a very important directive and its transposition will be crucial.  Members of the Oireachtas can have a strong role in ensuring the recommendations of the high-level group are implemented and active measures to increase collective bargaining coverage are put in place.</p></speech>

When we talk about low pay, there is an obvious focus on the national minimum wage but it is not the only tool to address low pay.  I am conscious that while some 7% or 8% of people are on the national minimum wage, between one fifth and one quarter of all workers in the economy are classified as being low paid.  As this meeting is taking place, there is a large crowd in the D&aacute;il Gallery watching the Labour Party motion on section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers and community employment scheme workers and the appalling situation they have found themselves in, whereby they have not seen a pay increase in 14 years.  I would like to hear the views of the ICTU witnesses on this sizeable group of workers, many of whom are low paid, who are providing a vital service to the State in the health, disability and other sectors and who have not seen any sort of pay improvement for well over a decade.</p><p>Does ICTU have strong views about how we ultimately crack that nut and ensure those workers are better paid because they form a large part of the low paid in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#G00200"><p>The workers referred to by the Senator work for organisations that rely predominantly on State funding.  For many years before the financial crash in 2008, in providing resources to the organisations in which these workers work, Governments would have provided money to give workers either the increases applying in the public sector or another type of increase.  There was a link between what was happening in the wider economy and the grant paid by Government.  When the Government of the day cut public sector pay in 2008, it also insisted on the pay of these workers being cut.  We had a campaign to restore that pay that was partially successful but the majority of these workers have not received a pay increase for over 14 years.  The only way we can see that happening is if there is a mechanism through which there is a sectoral collective bargaining mechanism that allows employers and unions to discuss how wages should be adjusted in light of the circumstances these organisations face with the Government playing an active role in that in providing resources for whatever the results of those negotiations are.  Unless we have something like that, we will not solve this problem.  I noted that last Friday the T&aacute;naiste said that the Government would provide &euro;100 million or &euro;110 million for one portion of the problem, that is, the section 39 organisations, but we have yet to see the detail of that.  It does not solve the problem for the remaining workers who would be classified as being in the voluntary and community sector who need an active process of collective bargaining that would allow their wages to keep pace with wage growth in the economy generally.</p></speech>

What strikes me is the number of people who are stuck on the minimum wage.  There is a perception that the minimum wage is a labour market entry wage or that people move off it fairly quickly but we know that 56% of those on the minimum wage are on it for 12 months or more while 23% of those on the minimum wage are on it for four years or more.  How do we fix that?  The minimum wage is supposed to be this wage floor upon which people can progress and yet we are seeing very substantial numbers stuck on that wage for a particularly long period of time.</p></speech>

In Scandinavian countries, whose model we all believe should be followed, minimum wages across the board do not exist.  They set minimum wages through collective bargaining in sectors.  The Low Pay Commission does not exist in countries like Sweden and Norway but collective bargaining produces good-quality outcomes, prevents low pay and inequality and increases workers' spending power.  All of the evidence points to collective bargaining as being the way to deal with the problem.</p></speech>

There is the bit relating to joint labour committees, the bit relating to enterprise bargaining and the bit relating to good faith bargaining.  How will it play out in the medium term and who will see the benefit the most?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#G00800"><p>At the industrial relations news conference last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste said that he envisaged the directive being transposed by the end of 2023.  However, it requires either amending or primary legislation to bring about the changes about which we have spoken that form part of the high-level group report.  Members of the Oireachtas have a crucial role to play in ensuring that the report is implemented.  However, there are no recommendations relating to other provisions in the report, particularly around public procurement and using public procurement as a tool to encourage collective bargaining.  If the T&aacute;naiste is faithful to his word, we should see enacting legislation or a draft Bill very shortly if the process is to end by the end of 2023.  The devil is in the detail.  I remember when the information and consultation directive at national level was being trumpeted as the directive that will increase collective bargaining coverage through information and consultation.  The transposition process was a disaster because it excluded firms with fewer than 50 employees, which made it meaningless for most workers because, as we all know, many workers work in small and medium-sized enterprises, so transposition is crucial.  The legislation that transposes the directive and the high-level group report is where the game will be won or lost.</p></speech>

I know employer groups were asked to come in but it is always good to have the balance and, hopefully, we will have that again in the future.  I have stated a number of times in this committee that I would support a living wage but it must be done on a phased basis that is cognisant of the pressures in the marketplace.  Oftentimes when we have these discussions, we tend to use large employers with the ability to pay as the standard across the working environment when that is certainly not the case.</p> <p>  Dr. Bambrick identified two sectors with regard to SMEs with 54% of low-paid workers working in hospitality and retail.  As a general rule, if one walked in and found 20 or 30 people in an organisation, how many of those does she believe would be represented by the minimum wage?</p></speech>

In particular, I think retail will see the most fall off in jobs over the next three to six months.  I think it will be the sector that suffers the most.  In fact, it is already happening largely because of competition, inflation and affordability.  Although we want to raise wages, how does it help workers if we increase business costs at a time when business volume is reducing?  Regarding whether we do a one-step or phased increase, I do not think we have a choice other than to consider a phased increase.  We have full employment.</p><p>What is Dr. Bambrick's perception of the labour market over the next six months in terms of where she sees indicators going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#H00200"><p>Retail and hospitality have a jobs problem at the moment.  They have problems finding individuals who are willing to take up those jobs and, specifically, in recruiting and retaining people in those roles.  That is because workers are acting with their feet and moving to employers that can guarantee them more predictable hours, more secure employment and better pay that allows them to have an adequate standard of living.  That is the biggest problem facing retail and hospitality.</p> <p>  The other issue is the question of whether it is right to inflict an adequate minimum wage on certain sectors.  As was mentioned at the outset, this is coming from European law.  It is not about a small group within the Government using their leverage to push through a very noble pet project.  We know that the European law will be signed by the end of this year, and two months after it goes into the journal, the clock will be ticking down for two years in the context of having a process in place to ensure that no worker will be earning less than 60% of the median wage.  This is happening; it is not some idea that was dreamed up by trade unions.  It will soon be law.  As my colleague mentioned, Ireland has the fourth highest rate of low pay in the eurozone and the eighth highest in the EU 27.  All of the countries that do not have the level of low pay still have vibrant retail and hospitality sectors.  The idea that paying staff an adequate wage is the difference between a viable business or not is just a fallacy.  It just does not add up.  There is no evidence to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#H00300"><p>With respect, we have to take the wider economy into consideration.  We will probably see, over the next six months, where the fallacy lies in terms of the cost of employment.  I would say that the costs relating to employment are not divorced from the other inflationary costs in the business environment.  Unfortunately, costs are going north at a time when revenues are going south.  I am all for adequate wages and a living wage in principle, but we are at full employment at the moment.  Obviously, there are some industries in which people with very low skill levels unfortunately do not have much bargaining power and are therefore subject to only being offered the minimum wage.  We have a lot of talented people in the workforce who are doing far better than that.  Our biggest problem is inflation eating into everybody's ability to pay.  I am a supporter of adequate wages for people.  Obviously, I would like to see everybody earning enough money to pay their bills, live, eat and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  All I am concerned about are the two issues that Dr. Bambrick mentioned.  One is the single step transition up to a living wage.  I do not think it is possible to deliver in the economy.  It will cause a lot of damage to the SME sector.  The second issue that was discussed is collective bargaining across all sectors.  Again, that is going to be very difficult for the SME community.  That is where my interest lies primarily, as a member of this committee.  I would like to see us taking stock and taking time to reflect on all these changes.  As Deputy Bruton outlined earlier, we have made a number of significant advancements in terms of pay and social supports for employees over the last year, with more to come.  All of this has been loaded onto the SME sector, which employs 1 million people in this country.  I am dealing with many business owners at the moment who are in significant financial distress and are reporting significant losses.  Adding more costs to their businesses is not going to make them any more sustainable.</p></speech>

Unless people want to come back in a second time, I have a question for Dr. Bambrick.  She said that 3% of companies have more than half of their staff on the minimum wage.  Without mentioning any companies, do we know whether it is a particular problem with a number of bigger companies?  Is one company distorting the 3% figure?</p></speech>

I do not have the names of employers to reel off anyway, so the Chairman does not need to worry about cutting my mic.  We know that it is 3% of all companies in the economy, but that those companies are more likely based in two sectors, the hospitality and retail sectors.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the size of the employment and the minimum wage.  We hear a lot about the SME sector, but it is the bigger part of our economy.  Most workers are in workplaces with fewer than 50 employees.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Durkan and Doherty.  Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will be substituting for Deputy Doherty.  All those present in the room today are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risks of contracting Covid 19.  For those of us here and those watching, we have broken up this session, as we did last week, into two sessions.  We have Animation Ireland, Screen Guild Ireland and Screen Producers Ireland with us now and in the later session, we will have Screen Ireland.  I thank everybody for their co-operation.  There are many voices in this debate and it is really useful that everyone is co-operating in terms of getting everybody into the room.</p> <p>  I would like to welcome Ms Louise Cornally, Ms Moe Honan and Mr. Ronan McCabe from Animation Ireland; Mr. Eoin Holohan, Mr. Greg Keeley and Ms Jessica Drum from Screen Guild Ireland; and Ms Aoife O'Sullivan, Mr. James Hickey and Ms Susan Kirby from Screen Producers Ireland.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity, although I do not think that pertains to today's session.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Throughout the proceedings I might give a little reminder if the committee strays into territory where it might be making people identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I will now go to opening statements.  We will start with Mr. Ronan McCabe from Animation Ireland who will be followed by Ms Jessica Drum from Screen Guild Ireland and by Ms Susan Kirby from Screen Producers Ireland.</p></speech>

Animation Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of the extension of section 481 to 31 December 2028.  Animation is a global business and is expensive to produce and projects are in planning many years in advance of production and distribution.  This announcement will give certainty to our members in the financing and production of animation projects.</p> <p>  Animation Ireland is the representative body for the animation industry on the island of Ireland, with 42 member studios, employing approximately 2,500 people full time.  The sector is well spread geographically with members operating in all parts of the island.   There are established creative hubs in Belfast, Galway and Kilkenny and other members' studios are located in the counties of Clare, Cork, Derry, Offaly, Louth and Roscommon.  Members are producing 2D and 3D animation for television and feature films and immersive content for the domestic and international market.  The mix of our inherent national creativity and business acumen, coupled with our section 481 tax credit, has created a fertile ground in which the animation sector is growing exponentially.  Animation Ireland members produce award winning, globally celebrated animation that is viewed in more than 180 countries and territories worldwide, building companies of scale, creating high-value, all-island and regionally spread investment and employment, embracing new technologies and nurturing Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen.</p> <p>  Animation Ireland comprises a range of companies, from one or two person operations running "ideas factories" to large-scale studios employing hundreds of animators, working in both the Irish and English language.  The unique regional spread of companies was aided by the regional uplift and Animation Ireland would like to express its disappointment that this incentive has not been extended.  Animation Ireland operates at the centre of a very sophisticated ecosystem and has regular engagement with stakeholders.  Working in tandem with the industry, Animation Ireland has developed and implemented training programmes that are opening doors to many young people whose entry into the workforce will sustain the growth of the industry in the coming years.  </p> <p>  Animation is a global and a competitive business.  It is very labour intensive and expensive to produce.</p><p>Other jurisdictions offer a variety of regional and national tax credits, often exceeding that available here, and if Ireland is to remain competitive, it is essential that our tax credit is retained.</p><p> The animation industry in Ireland comprises two major components, namely, service work, which consists of producing animation for international partners by way of foreign direct investment, and our own intellectual property, IP, story development.  Most Irish animation studios attempt to find a balance between service work, which affords companies the ability to build their studios and gain expertise by working with the major animation financiers and broadcasters, and reinvesting that expertise and capital into developing our own series and stories.  The animation industry in Ireland has proven remarkably successful in both of those endeavours.  In recent years, Ireland has been home to major productions such as "The Bob&rsquo;s Burgers Movie", "The Cuphead Show!", "Vampirina" and "Zog and the Flying Doctors".  These productions alone saw investments in Ireland of tens of millions of euro and served to showcase Irish creative talent.  It is not only international stories that are told by Irish studios.  Section 481 also supports indigenous production.  Recent examples of which include the Oscar-nominated "Wolfwalkers", "Two by Two: Overboard!", "Jessy and Nessy", "Kiva Can Do!" and "Pins and Nettie".</p><p> There is a strong competitive environment for inward production or foreign direct investment in the locating of animation television series and film productions in EU member states.  Ireland has punched well above its weight in that regard, and continues to do so.  Many studios get their start by taking on service work and thereby gaining the experience to develop, pitch and produce their own projects.</p><p> The growth of major subscription video on demand, SVOD, streaming services, including Apple+, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, in the past ten years has meant that demand for content has never been greater.  This has provided opportunities and threats for our industry.  On the plus side, there are well resourced customers seeking content but, on the downside, many SVODs insist on retaining 100% of the IP in the content.  The ability of Irish producers to bring Irish financing to a project in the form of section 481 and broadcaster and screen agency investments is critical to Irish studios&rsquo; ability to retain IP.  The funds generated from IP are then invested in the development of future projects - securing jobs, building companies of scale and creating a virtuous circle of investment for companies.</p><p> Screen content plays a vital role in how Ireland is perceived abroad and is an essential element of our cultural exports and the projection of Ireland&rsquo;s soft power.  Without indigenous content, Irish audiences would not see their stories reflected back at them on screen and diverse storytelling voices simply would not be heard.  Without section 481, our domestic market simply would not have the resources to bring our stories to the world.  Any review of section 481 must, of course, include a financial analysis for the taxpayer, but it must also include a full recognition of the cultural dividend of screen content production made in Ireland for Irish and global audiences.  On behalf of Animation Ireland, I thank the committee.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr.Keeley, is also a non-executive director on the board of SGI.  He works as a model maker in the Irish film and television industry.  Ms Drum is the chief executive officer of SGI and, prior to taking up that role, worked for many years in the camera department in the Irish film and television industry.  On behalf of SGI, we thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the film credit.<br/><br/>SGI represents Irish film and television industry crew and their respective guilds who play a vital role in every aspect of production across the various departments within the Irish film and television industry.  We currently represent more than 2,500 Irish film and television crew, both PAYE and self-employed, spanning 22 departments.  Our focus is predominantly in the area of skills training and development across many departments, including accounts, art, assistant directors, camera, construction, continuity, costume, facilities, editing, grips, hair, locations, make-up, model-making, production, prosthetics, set decoration, sound, special effects, stunts, transport and visual effects.  We are continuing to grow and we endeavour, in time, to be fully inclusive of the Irish film industry as a whole.  We are a proud community of crew working together in a creative industry, utilising a wide range of individual skills, crafts, experience, and expertise with one common goal - to promote excellence in the art of film making, both here in Ireland and through recognition abroad.<br/><br/>SGI aims to promote excellence in all fields of film and television production in Ireland through the representation of its member guilds, made up primarily of Irish film crew.  Each department or guild nominates a crew member to represent it in discussion and negotiation of all business relating to our professions within the industry.  Our members were involved in securing a new working agreement in 2022, including the introduction of the provision for the construction workers' pension scheme, CWPS, which is a welcome progression for the welfare of the crew.  SGI, as a representative for these guilds, is proactive in its direct engagement with F&iacute;s Eireann-Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, SIPTU, Screen Skills Ireland and other recognised industry bodies on all matters concerning our members, namely, Irish film crew.<br/><br/>SGI is committed to establishing and promoting a fair and transparent working environment for all film crew engaged in film and TV production in Ireland, spanning national and international productions of all scales and genres.  We are committed to the continued training and upskilling of our members through all grades, ranging from entry-level trainees right through to heads of department, and to the introduction of a fair and transparent upgrade process within the various departments we represent.<br/><br/>Film and television production is an ever-evolving industry and we aim to safeguard our collective interests while upholding the highest of standards in production.  Our members, across all guilds, are passionate about working in the Irish film industry and are highly regarded worldwide.  We have internationally recognised writers, directors, directors of photography, production designers, costume designers, hair and make-up designers and visual effects technicians to name but a few.  We relish the challenges of working across different genres on indigenous and international productions.  We understand that a healthy Irish film industry requires international inward production, shooting in tandem with indigenous Irish productions.  We enjoy bringing the skills we learn on international films to smaller Irish films, and often <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>The screen sector is currently undergoing a period of intense growth.  We must attract new entrants to the industry to cope with this demand.  We must ensure that these new crew receive proper training while also ensuring that existing crew members have the opportunity to upskill and progress their careers.  Our membership of more than 2,500 crew continues to grow at a rapid pace with the introduction of these new entrants to the industry and returning professionals.<br/><br/>SGI welcomes the extension of section 481 to 2028 as confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  We recognise and acknowledge that section 481 has been, and continues to be, crucial to the existence and continued development of our industry.  Section 481 affords all of us the opportunity to work and establish careers in a vibrant and creative industry where we can develop skills that allow us to work across the many different genres of film and television.  We are proud to be a part of the Irish film industry, and we do not take it for granted.  We were especially pleased to see the introduction of the skills development plan in 2018 as part of the application process for section 481 funding.</p><p>Since 2019, Screen Ireland has assessed over 160 skills development plans and has tracked over 1,700 skills participants across 160 section 481 productions.  The benefit to our members is obvious.  This emphasis on skills development within the structure of section 481 compelled us at SGI to consult our membership and develop our competency framework, which is an informative breakdown document for all crew grades across the various departments in the Irish film industry.  We completed this work in consultation with the Screen Guilds of Ireland at Screen Ireland.  This was a very significant undertaking and is the first of its kind for our industry in the world.  The framework is an invaluable tool to crew and it exists as a direct result of the emphasis on skills development within section 481.</p><p> We are concerned that the regional uplift continues to decrease and there is no allowance for it in the recent extension to section 481.  It is essential that the industry grows and is nurtured in the regions, as well as in the production hub of Dublin and Wicklow.  This will require further incentives to locate production in the regions but we are confident that this would pay dividends in the long term.  We would like to be involved in a discussion with all stakeholders to reach a consensus on how best to promote filming in the regions and create an industry that is nationwide.  We look forward with a positive outlook to the extension of section 481 and especially welcome any opportunity to be involved in future developments of this tax credit as we continue to work in a career full of possibilities within the Irish film and television industries.</p></speech>

SPI is a national representative organisation of independent film, television, animation and digital production companies.  With over 170 company members, SPI is recognised as the voice of independent audiovisual production in Ireland.  SPI members are creative entrepreneurs who produce globally celebrated film, animation and television material.  They create high-value, all-island and regionally spread employment, foster Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen and preserve Ireland&rsquo;s artistic heritage.  SPI comprises a range of production companies, from emerging producers to producers of large-scale high-end film and television series, working in both the Irish and English languages.<br/><br/>We are happy to appear before this committee again.  We appeared here previously in 2019 to discuss section 481 and we had a positive engagement at the meeting.  We note in the invitation the request that only matters directly related to the section 481 tax expenditure that are under the remit of this committee are to be discussed.  Therefore, we have kept our opening statement to this area.  We hope that our statement and subsequent discussion will inform the committee of the vital role that section 481 plays in the sustainability of the Irish screen sector, both for incoming and indigenous productions.<br/><br/>At the outset, I must welcome the budget 2023 announcement that section 481 has been extended to 2028, something which SPI called for in its pre-budget discussions.  It is worth adding that this decision was made on foot of a positive recommendation to do so in a 50-page cost-benefit collective analysis completed recently by the Department of Finance.  This report included a detailed analysis of how section 481 works, gave details on the great advances that have been made in the film and television production sector in training and upscaling, and set out the very significant progress that has been made in industrial relations, including the two new collective bargaining agreements which have been concluded in the past couple of years.<br/><br/>Section 481 is one of the most crucial incentive schemes for independent producers in Ireland.  It provides much-needed tax relief for eligible productions.  This extension provides much-needed clarity for independent producers seeking to undertake long-term production planning.  The Government has shown us through the extension of section 481 to 2028 that it realises the potential of international and indigenous production here in Ireland.  I know that our producer members, crew and casts will create the world-class, award-winning content that they have the ability to create.  However, we are disappointed that there was no extension of the regional uplift which proved very valuable in bringing productions out of the Dublin-Wicklow hub.  The uplift has seen considerable production activity across the country from Kerry to Donegal and SPI will continue to advocate for its return in some form.<br/><br/>As I have mentioned, the Department of Finance released a new cost-benefit analysis of section 481 which showed the growth in the sector in both employment and economic size since the previous analysis in 2019.  The Department analysis noted: </p> <blockquote> 	Supporting the development of a thriving Irish audio-visual sector remains an objective of the Government.  By providing tax relief to Irish producer companies in respect of qualifying films the scheme directly contributes to the growth of a creative screen production industry in the State. </blockquote> <p>The Department also pointed out that it is important that we begin to capture the cultural dividend of section 481 projects beyond economics alone.  We are glad to see that Screen Ireland will be releasing a cultural dividend report on section 481 in the coming weeks and we believe this will show a significant impact.  SPI believes that with this clear statement of support from the Government, our sector can reach the targets set out in the Government's audiovisual action plan, which seeks to double employment in film, television and animation, and double the economic worth of the sector.  The Creative Ireland programme audiovisual action plan also sets out the role of section 481 in contributing to the development and sustainability of the Irish screen industry, supporting jobs in the domestic economy, which is a strategic cultural industry, and supporting the tourism sector in Ireland.  This can be seen through Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.<br/><br/>The past decade has seen Irish productions being nominated for over 30 Oscar nominations which is a very significant achievement for a country of our size.  &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; is breaking Irish and UK box office records for an Irish-language feature film, surpassing &euro;1 million at the box office.  It has been chosen as the Irish entry to the International Feature Film Oscar and is being touted as a possible nominee.  The key to all of this success is the ability of Irish producers to hold on to intellectual property for their projects.  By retaining intellectual property, producers can reinvest into new development for projects which enables them to grow their company into one of scale.  This is a key issue for SPI in the coming years.<br/><br/>It is important to note the economic return of section 481.  According to the Government-commissioned Olsberg report, for every &euro;1 of the cost of section 481, &euro;1.02 in tax revenues was paid to the Government and there was an economic net benefit of &euro;2.82 from the activities supported.  We firmly believe that this return on investment has increased in the years since then due to the increasing size of the sector and that section 481 is a good return on investment on behalf of the taxpayer.<br/><br/>With the arrival in Europe of major streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, over the past ten years, the scale of screen content production, which was already at high levels in film and television production, has increased dramatically.  There is a strong competitive environment for inward production, which is the locating of films, television drama, animation and games in EU member states.  Ireland has done well for all of the reasons it has done well in other areas of inward investment, including its talented and creative workforce, the English language and its proximity to the UK - which is the largest single production country in Europe - as well as the film tax credit and other supports currently in place.<br/><br/>It is important that we reflect on the types of productions that section 481 supports in this country, both incoming and indigenous.  It supports multi-million budget television dramas such as the Apple TV-funded sci-fi drama series &quot;Foundations&quot;, which was shot in Troy Studios in Limerick.  The challenging new feature film &quot;Aisha&quot;, which was directed by Frank Berry and is set in Ireland's direct provision system, recently screened and received great reviews at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.  Section 481 also supports recently released Irish indigenous productions like the worldwide success that is &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; and the newly released &quot;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank&quot;, both of which were also supported by the Cine4 scheme.  Documentaries like &quot;Vicky&quot; and &quot;Nothing Compares&quot;, both of which were released in cinemas last week, are supported by section 481, as are television dramas such as &quot;Kin&quot; and &quot;Normal People&quot; on RT&Eacute;.</p><p> SPI welcomes the opportunity to engage with the committee.  We look forward to a good discussion about section 481 and its impact on the screen sector.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; acu ansin thar a bheith suimi&uacute;il.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and for taking the time out to do so.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the cost-benefit analysis the Department undertook, which was published along with budget 2023 and which found that the net economic cost of the credit in 2020 was &euro;78.5 million.  In other words, a net welfare loss to society.  The witnesses will mention intangible benefits that cannot be quantified in such an analysis.  In terms of euro and cent, however, do they agree that is a worrying finding for the taxpayer?  All three groups can answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#D00300"><p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  We welcomed the cost-benefit analysis report.  It is a detailed report.  It sets the policy context of the investment of section 481 on behalf of the State in so far as it places it firmly within Government policy to support the arts and, within that, the audiovisual sector.  It points clearly to a rigorous process attached to section 481 and details the process the producer companies go through to attain section 481.  It also speaks widely to the great progress that has been made.  The last time the cost-benefit analysis was published was 2019.  It speaks in detail to the industry development test and the cultural test which are attached to section 481.  On the industry test, which is part of the foundation of quality employment, it makes the point that:</p> <blockquote> 	Since the publication of the first WRC report on the Irish Film and Television Drama Production Sector, significant progress has been made in relation to agreements between employers and worker representatives.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The introduction of these two industry agreements, negotiated and agreed between employees and producer representative bodies, demonstrate the ongoing focus on promoting positive work practices to ensure that the Irish audio-visual industry is attractive to employees and as a location in which to produce feature film and high-end TV drama. </blockquote> <p>It is an important point that is made in the cost-benefit analysis.<br/><br/>The Deputy raised the ultimate net economic being negative.  There are a number of factors to that.  That was also the case in a previous analysis.  The factors include the dead weighting attached to the economic findings.  There is an interesting table in the cost-benefit analysis, which I am sure the Deputies have read.  It is a fascinating document.  If we remove the dead weight and the concept of shadow costs of labour, for example, the cost-benefit analysis will quickly report a positive and points to the necessity to apply to what I referred to as the cultural dividend.  The Deputy also referred to the intangibles.  It is around that creative, cultural dividend delivered by section 481.<br/><br/>The recommendations from the cost-benefit analysis were to extend section 481, which all here have welcomed.  It looked to have more data, and, again, we would welcome if more quality data was gathered to allow us create the economic case around section 481.  It also pointed to the idea that Screen Ireland will be producing a cultural dividend report which will allow us to apply the full economic and cultural benefit of section 481.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I take Ms Kirby's point that with cultural things there is more than just dollars and cents but the question was specifically on that.</p> <p>  I will move on to the reference in SPI's opening statement to the role of section 481 in attracting foreign direct investment.  We know many production companies availing of the relief are foreign.  Do the witnesses have any information on the proportion of credits through section 481 relief that remain within the State and the proportion that are repatriated out of the State?  I would also be interested in that analysis and to hear witnesses' view because I have heard in the past the relief has effectively become a taxpayers' subsidy to foreign production companies.  I am sure the witnesses disagree but how would they respond to that?</p></speech>

On the first half of the question, there is a requirement that any recipient of section 481 is an Irish production company.  Even in the case of inbound production, there is a benefit to the Irish production ecosystem.  That requirement of attaching to an Irish producer is something I imagine ourselves and Animation Ireland would advocate strongly.  That is there and provides protection.  Mr. Holohan referred well in his opening statement to the idea of inbound production being that we need a balance between both.  Our vision is for a balanced sector with strong inbound production.  That allows producers, crews and casts to have experience on major TV, drama and film production, while balancing it with indigenous so we can potentially have a diverse ecosystem and sustainable career in the creative industries.  Screen Ireland should be commended for the great work it does.  It is something Ireland does very well.  We have a global reputation for producing incredible inbound work and we would like to see a strong balance between indigenous and inbound sectors, and a strong ecosystem.  Key to that is a sustainable, diverse career working across the two elements.</p></speech>

It gets thrown out there quite a lot.  At the core of this, we have to remember that section 481 is in place to support and build the industry and create talent.  Without international players coming to Ireland, we would not have that ability.  The EU Commission recognises that Europe needs subsidies and the countries need to support local producers in order to attract production which allows them build on the indigenous industry.</p><p>We are competing with very strong US-based production entities.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we must remain competitive in order to maintain the industry which is at the heart of all of this.  If we did not have section 481, essentially, we would not have an industry.  It is very important to make that point, alongside the question of section 481 subsidising foreign productions because when a producer is looking at where he or she is going to produce animation, a live action film or a TV series, he or she will look at tax credits that are currently available right across the globe.  If we did not have the tax credit, essentially, we would not have an industry here.  That is the first point about the international studios either shooting or producing animation here.</p><p>In terms of producing IP, and the indigenous companies producing their own content and retaining some rights, it is extremely challenging to do that whether it is animation or live action.  If one is going to finance your own production, the budget can range from &euro;1.5 million right up to &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million - that would be spent locally - in order to finance it one might go to international broadcasters to get licence fees - there are multiple ways of financing it - but there would always be a gap in the production.  There is simply no way an Irish company could produce that content without having section 481 in place, so it does also come back to the indigenous industry here in that regard.  Despite the fact that there are international broadcasters attached to it, the point I want to make is that they are not going to fully finance the full cost of the production via a licence agreement.</p></speech>

I know Deputy Farrell mentioned it in her opening remarks.  Animation Ireland represented Ireland at Expo 2020 in Dubai this year.  We were at the Ireland pavilion.  We had three days of Irish animation being exhibited over there, both at the Al Wasl dome and on site.  It was a fantastic event to be at in terms of the projection of Irish soft power and Irish stories.  We were very much front and centre of the Ireland offering at Expo.  There were more than 200 countries there.  It is difficult to put a price or value on that.  Even when we go to markets and festivals, a significant amount of people come up to the Ireland stand and inquire about the projects that they have seen.  They want to visit and come and work in Ireland because of that.  It is a worthwhile exercise to try and put a value on that.  I do not have those figures to hand but it would definitely be something worth doing.</p></speech>

We have been waiting to have this conversation for a long time.  I am grateful that the witnesses have shown up in such numbers.  Clearly, it is an indication of how seriously they take the issue.  I hope I am not misrepresenting him, but Deputy Boyd Barrett has been particularly exercised in simple terms on the broader issue of pay and conditions, in particular for those who are considered to be lower down the food chain.  The witnesses have spoken about the issue in general terms.  To some extent, it is at the heart of why the witnesses are here, so I will spend a little bit of time on the issue.  I have eight and three quarter minutes left, so I will give the witnesses time to respond until we have five minutes left and then I might raise my hand again.

It is a key tenet of section 481 but it is a core issue for the industry.  If I can, I might reflect back to 2019 when Screen Producers Ireland, the ICTU-affiliated union group and SIPTU requested the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to conduct an audit of the sector.  I understand it carried out very broad consultation and it came up with four recommendations.  I will not go into the audit in great detail, but I will give the committee an update on it.  One of the recommendations was the importance of the guild structure.  We can see today that there is a very well organised and strategically focused set of guilds.  We work very closely with the guilds.  Similarly, they are developing competency frameworks.  We welcome the development of competency frameworks for the guilds.  The simplest description of the competency frameworks is a journey map for one's development through one's career at the various grades in the guilds.  That was the first element and it is being delivered on and that continues to be the case.</p> <p>  The second area concerns HR and the development of HR capacity within the producer communities.  Screen Producers Ireland has placed an enormous emphasis on sectoral development.  We have a dedicated role within the company for sectoral development.  We run detailed HR development programmes for members and we work in collaboration with Screen Ireland, previously Screen Skills Ireland, on the delivery of those.  We continue to focus on the area.  It is not a destination; it is a constant journey.</p> <p>  The third recommendation that was made was in the space of industrial relations, IR.  It placed significant importance of the industrial agreements.  In 2019-----</p></speech>

In that structure we have minimum rates set out for trainees.  SIPTU has a preproduction meeting at the start of every production when we go through all of the plans for the job.  We organise a meeting every month with SIPTU and the representatives from each of those departments.  Each department has a guild and its representatives come along to the meeting and they can discuss any issues that they might have.  That is the communication channel that is there.  We all recognise that the best way to learn in film is to be on the floor.  It is not something that one can learn in a classroom.  I was a trainee myself in the camera department.  That is the only way to learn the trade.</p></speech>

When we formed the guilds, we needed a new agreement.  We approached SIPTU and, between it and SPI, we now have a new agreement.  It is working quite well.  The guilds structure we have maintains communication among crew members.  I am a crew member, as is Mr. Keeley.  Communication is maintained between all the productions that are happening.  If an industrial relations issue arises on a production, it is dealt with very quickly.  A crew member can come to us, and we can go to SIPTU.  We are in our infancy but the system is working.</p></speech>

I have two minutes after all that.  I am sorry this is such short, sharp stuff.  If SGI is in its infancy, as Mr. Holohan says, I would certainly be interested in being kept abreast of how it develops and in the committee having a monitoring brief regarding it.  I am serious about that.</p> <p>  I am aware that the expenditure of companies in Ireland as a result of productions was &euro;500 million last year.  That is phenomenal.  I am old enough to remember the closure of Ardmore and the devastating effect.  Walking along a very narrow coast road in Achill last year, I came to a bend and saw a stop-start traffic system.  I was trying to figure out why it was needed and noticed there were guys thatching the cottage roof.  It was part of the film set for "The Banshees of Inisherin", which has just won a major award.</p></speech>

Two thatchers were employed.  The Chair talked about the cultural dividend.  To me, that was one of the obvious ones.  My late mother was from west Kerry, which is still attracting tourists as a result of "Ryan&rsquo;s Daughter", which was made 50 years ago.  I do not know whether Deputy Boyd Barrett will be unhappy with bits and pieces of this yet, but he is right to raise workplace conditions.</p> <p>  I see a world that has opened up for filmmakers, who are young but not exclusively so, actors and everybody else associated with the industry.  My eldest brother was in "Excalibur".  Everybody remembers working as an extra on the set.  The industry has developed well beyond that now.  That guilds of professionals and trades in the film industry have been established is telling.  Section 481 seems to have been critical in this regard.  That is essentially what the delegates are saying.  The industry would not and could not have survived without it.  Without it, we would not be making movies here.</p> <p>  There are other cultural dividends, some of which I am not so happy about.  I am not happy with the impact on Skellig Michael.  I have seen the impact of "Star Wars" on little villages and in Dingle.  It is a question of skills, whereby young people can leave school, get training and know they can have employment in the film sector in Ireland.  It simply was not a reality heretofore; it was very nebulous.</p> <p>  Those are some of the points I wanted to make.  I have two questions.  Is there any potential in the film industry arising from Brexit, because Ireland, along with Malta in the European Union, is an English-speaking country?</p></speech>

Projects can extend for multiple years.  They can take from a year to three or four years.  There is good career progression within that.  There are training plans in place under section 481.  Animation Ireland is the lead organisation for the National Talent Academy for Animation.  Within that academy, we are bridging the gap between college and the industry, making people industry-ready.  We also provide mentoring at all levels, and master classes are being provided.  We are running animation fairs around the country.  Our first was in Athlone.  We are trying to bring people into the sector from non-traditional places.  My colleague Ms Cornally has some statistics on training.</p></speech>

I was just trying to ask whether there was anything specific for us to consider from an animation perspective.  As Mr. McCabe outlined, the industry itself tends to be much more longer term in its commitment to employment because the production schedule is longer.  Owing to the scale, there is a greater ability to focus on the longer-term sustainability of the business investing in learning and development.  Anecdotal evidence indicates one of our members invests 9,000 hours per year in learning and development across all levels of staff and spends about &euro;150,000.  Bearing in mind the individual studios and, as Mr. McCabe mentioned, the establishment of the talent academy that Animation Ireland is leading, we wanted to ask whether members had any specific concerns about the terms and conditions of employment in the animation sector.</p></speech>

This has been really useful and very respectful to the committee.  I might have some more questions later given that the delegates have turned up in such numbers.  I am seeking a brief and to join some dots.  I found our discussion thus far quite reassuring, aside from the obvious exciting pieces that we cannot really develop here and the enthusiasm for what the delegates do.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions on animation.  Our job is to assess whether section 481 is delivering what it is supposed to deliver.  From what I see of the animation industry, it is.  They are companies, full-time jobs and industry development.  The industry is supposed to be developing and growing and creating companies of scale and career opportunities.  That is not to say it is perfect, because I have heard a few stories about particular companies, but it is obvious that there are jobs and an industry.  My questions, therefore, are directed at the live-action sector, where I do not see the jobs.  The credit is supposed to be strictly dependent on creating jobs.  You either create quality employment and training or you do not, and you either contribute to culture or you do not.  In fact, the European rules on this are very clear.  You should not get state aid if you are not doing these things.</p> <p>  I want the film industry to get state aid but do not understand the contrast.  I do not understand how the animation sector can create jobs and companies of scale and how theatres such as the Abbey, Gate and Project can create jobs and careers when given public money while the live-action sector does not.  To put it bluntly, the testimony we heard last week from the Irish Film Workers&rsquo; Association was that every time a production ends, the clock goes back to zero from the point of view of the employee.  In other words, an employee who has worked for successive designated activity companies, DACs, does not have an employer because that employer was his or her last DAC, which is now gone.  Therefore, an employee starts from scratch.  Even if he or she has worked for 20 DACs over 25 years, he or she effectively starts from scratch, meaning no recognition whatsoever of his or her service in the industry.  There is no comeback if, for example, employees are blacklisted, as they say they are.  Many of those who raised concerns about the industry with members of this committee in 2018  have not worked in the industry since.</p><p>Some of the witnesses present know that they have not worked in the industry again even though they were never formally dismissed and there was no process through which they were dismissed.  They just do not get to work again.  I am not here to advocate on individual cases, but I see nothing in how the industry is structured to prevent that from happening.  How does the industry prevent it?<br/><br/>I am confused by the Screen Guilds of Ireland.  I understand it is a private limited company with a CEO and it says that it represents 2,500 workers.  According to the Department's analysis, we only have 2,500 people in the industry and, unlike in animation, only a few of them have full-time jobs, so it is not clear to me how the Screen Guilds of Ireland can represent people when they do not have jobs and it is a private company that I understand is wholly funded by Screen Ireland.  I am confused about that.  Who, then, does SIPTU represent?  There is also the Irish Film Workers Association, although there are not many film workers left in the industry because they do not get jobs anymore.  I do not understand how this works.  Are people right in saying that the clock goes back to zero each time?  Will the witnesses explain the process involved in someone getting a job on an Irish film?  Who does the person go to?  Who decides whether he or she gets employed?<br/><br/>Members of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, get section 481 relief under the explicit requirement that it creates quality employment and training, yet Ms Elaine Geraghty, SPI's former chairperson, told the Labour Court:</p><blockquote>	I will give further evidence before the Court that there is no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment can be said to have existed between the parties hereto.  This is on the basis of the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in this sector, including the operation of Section 481 Relief. </blockquote><p>There were similar testimonies from representatives of some of the large recipients of section 481 relief.  The people who are getting this relief are saying that they have no employees and could not possibly have any, yet they are explicitly given the relief on the basis that they are creating quality employment and training.  This is a contradiction and I would like it explained.</p></speech>

I am delighted that the crews are present to explain the situation from their point of view.</p> <p>  To give a snapshot, I produced three projects in 2021, two of which were regional while the third was in Dublin and Wicklow.  They were two films and a TV drama.  We were lucky enough to get the regional uplift to the tax credit for a film called "Joyride" in Kerry and a TV production called "North Sea Connection" in Galway.  Those projects would not have happened in the regions without the regional uplift.</p> <p>  As part of the regional uplift, it is important that skills, investment and training be taken on.  In some ways, what the Deputy is saying points to a wild west, but it is not like that.  It is heavily regulated.  People have to understand that this is a project-based industry.  We cannot offer continuous employment to crew members.  For one thing, they do not want it because they enjoy the fact that they go from project to project and have a choice.  The industry is also booming and going through a period of intense growth.  Since it is so busy, we cannot get the crews back.  For example, if I wanted to get the same crew for the three projects in Kerry, Galway and Dublin-Wicklow, I could not.  I would love to work with the same people over and over again because we establish great working relationships, but they have moved on to the next-----</p></speech>

There is an employment relationship between the DAC and the employee.  The nature of that employment is defined by the contract.  As Ms O'Sullivan stated, this is a project-based industry and, in large part, the contract is a fixed-term contract.  For various reasons, this is the global norm, including in Ireland.  It is also a career choice.  Speaking as someone who has worked in the creative industries for more than 25 years, and as I imagine some of those present will want to testify, one aspires to work on numerous creative projects.  The concept that one producer company will move between doing a large-scale creative period piece to a small indigenous project to another project is infeasible.  The committee has heard testimony that there would be an aspiration towards permanent employment.</p></speech>

Everyone present will testify to that.</p> <p>  My next point is important because what we are debating is section 481.  Section 481 provides the Government and the taxpayer with an even greater assurance of a high level of compliance.  The DAC is a requirement of section 481 and is exactly what it says on the tin, that being, a designated activity company.  It is for one purpose only.  It provides everyone with transparency and auditability in terms of how the spend happens.  It also exists for up to 12 months after the completion of the project.  Any issue that arises for an employee &ndash; in our experience, this does not occur regularly &ndash; can be dealt with within those confines.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised an important point and I have been pleased to clarify it.

We want to see sustainable, good jobs in a vibrant industry.  Production companies will make section 481 applications.  The designated activity company, DAC, is a special purpose vehicle where the money can be put.  It deals with the ins and outs and all the operations relating to a film.  I am always interested in the rules and regulations regarding how that works out.  All the obligations and costs end up in that.  Eventually, the DAC is put to one side and disappears, for want of a better term.  A question about this came up.  Actors spoke about how they have to sign over their intellectual property, IP.  Who owns the intellectual property after that?  Will someone address the ins and outs in case I have missed anything about how it works and the relationship between the production company and DAC with regard to drawing down the money?</p></speech>

The tax credit is paid to the producer company, which is an ongoing company.  Revenue places great importance on this, because as far as it is concerned, it wants to deal with people it knows and who it is satisfied will stay around for the purposes of continuing compliance with their obligations under section 481.  An equally important matter for both Revenue and business as a whole is the separate special purpose vehicle which is established for each project.  The establishment of special purpose vehicles for each project is a practice which dates to long before section 481 was established.  It was always the case, and still is the case in most other jurisdictions, that for each different project, the financiers and other people involved in the production of a feature film or television drama series want a separate vehicle for each project, because that is the kind of transparency and accountability that the financiers want.  The Revenue Commissioners see the value of that transparency and accountability from having a single company producing the project, so that all the eligible expenditure goes through that production and is seen to be properly spent.  Revenue is happy to look at dealing with eligible expenditure.</p> <p>  I will come back to the separate question about rights ownership.  This depends on the different types of projects which people are undertaking.  In the case of indigenous projects which are produced by indigenous producers, the copyright and distribution rights of the project vest in the producer company.  I will clarify that it is important that the producer company owns all the rights from all the contributors to the project.  That includes all the actors, the director, the writer, the set designer and the costume designer.  Everybody must assign all their rights to the producer company because if it does not own all the rights, the producer company cannot distribute the film.  If the broadcaster, distributor or cinema in Paris is told that one of the people involved in the production has not assigned his or her rights to the project, the cinema owner in Paris will not want to screen the film because the person who owns those rights could come and stop the screening of that film.  The structure of the industry involves all rights from all contributors to the production having to vest in the production company.</p></speech>

An agreement was entered into in 2016 in respect of television drama enters.  There was an agreement in 2019 in respect of docudrama actors.  An agreement was entered into by Screen Producers Ireland and Irish Equity in 2021 in respect of feature film actors.  These agreements included provisions which allowed the actors to receive shares of downstream revenue from the exploitation of television dramas, films and docudramas.  These agreements were all entered in good faith by Screen Producers Ireland and Irish Equity.

Some of that has come from workers, crew members and Irish Equity.  They do not believe that they are represented in the bodies that are here or by Screen Ireland, which will attend.  Whether that is right or wrong, that is the belief.</p> <p>  I will follow up on an issue that Deputy Boyd Barrett dealt with.  There was an accusation of blacklisting.  It is easy to see that if the head of department, HOD, does not ring people, then they are not in play.  We will not be able to determine here whether that happens or not.  There was an accusation of there being a move away from using experienced staff to having far more trainees.  I accept that there will always be trainees since people need to be trained, but at this point, people believe that they are being blacklisted.  They would call it a race to the bottom.</p> <p>  We are under time pressure here.  I am sorry if I am being a bit short.</p></speech>

My understanding of blacklisting is that somebody is in some way discriminated against on the basis of their union membership.  As we sit here today, we are showing the committee the great progress we have made in reaching agreements across five unions.  We are also saying that the last Irish Equity agreement, which, in fact, we co-signed, was negotiated and entered into in good faith and was operational for over a month before Irish Equity exited.  What I will say is that despite the fact it should be the producers who are aggrieved by that, we are sitting here today asking that, potentially, one of the outcomes of this committee would be to encourage Irish Equity to come back to the negotiating table and reach an agreement.  This actually fulfils a lot of what its issues were in terms of dealing with the copyright directive, in our opinion.  That would be the opinion of the missives attached in explanation of the copyright directive.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a very important point in regard to trainees.  Not just in our industry but across industry, we are seeking to encourage trainees to join.</p></speech>

SGI will also speak to this.  As part of the industry test, it is around identifying a head of department or a suitably qualified individual who will work with the trainee, be it through mentorship, shadowing or whatever, in order to develop their career.  The industry should stand proudly over the fact that it is bringing in trainees.  We would encourage that even more, if I can use this platform to say so.  It is a fantastic and vibrant industry.  We would absolutely aspire to sustainable careers and I would 100% agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p> <p>  Any suggestion that a trainee is replacing somebody who is deeply experienced is, again, probably not for me to refute, but I imagine that SGI is in a good position to speak to the Deputy on that.  We would welcome the idea of the growth of trainees.  How else are we to achieve the great aspirations that have been set out in the audiovisual action plan?</p></speech>

I work as a location manager and I am a head of department.  On my recent job which just wrapped two weeks ago, I had three trainees.  There were up to five at one stage.  On the job previous to that, we had two.  On the job I did this time last year - the job that Deputy Lahart came across - I would have had at one stage maybe five trainees.  They are all different.  Some of them might be available to do my next job, which is great, and some are not and they bounce on to another job.</p> <p>  When those trainees come to work on the film I am working on, or to work in my department, we monitor their progress and we teach them the skills because we want to hang on to them.  We need them.  I need those trainees to develop into location assistants and to then become assistant location managers.</p></speech>

I have been in this industry for 25 years.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked how people get a job.  I got a job as a trainee.  I knocked on a door and asked could I have a job on a film set, and that is what I got.  People acquire the skills and they move up through the grades.  There has always been training on the set from the crew: you teach your crew the skills that you have, and that is how it progresses.  In 2018, when skills development came into section 481, it was fantastic for us because, finally, the crew were recognised and the skills development progress was recognised as a requirement.  We want trainees to come into the industry.  I do not want them to have it as hard as I did and, although I am not playing the violin, there have been tough years in the past, when people could not get work and they would be hoping the phone would ring, but it would ring.  People do go from job to job.  I and the people who work with me want to work on different types of films.  I want to work on big budget international movies and I want to work on indigenous Irish productions; I have worked on both and that is how I made my career.  For the trainees that come into my department, that is how I train them up, and they then move on and work for another location manager.  Maybe the next time they come around in my direction, they will be a location assistant because they will have acquired those skills and moved on.</p></speech>

In terms of the model we are working with here, and speaking on behalf of Animation Ireland, we also work with actors for voice work.  In our model, where we are co-producing all of the time with partners across Europe in my case, and others with other international partners, we are in a position where we have to negotiate a buyout because, otherwise, as Mr. Hickey alluded to, no distributor will sell a film and no distributor will screen it.  I want to make the point that, in that context, that buyout fee is higher than a daily fee, so it is compensated for upfront as opposed to back-end, where, frankly, the actor may never get anything.</p></speech>

If there are two words which are repeated over and over throughout the whole copyright directive, they are &ldquo;collective bargaining&rdquo;.  The copyright directive is there to protect authors and performers.  We want to conclude collective bargaining agreements as the very best way of looking after remuneration for authors and performers.  If there is a takeaway from all of this, we would love to recommend that much greater effort be put into the encouragement and incentivisation of collective bargaining.  We would very much welcome that.</p></speech>

I will then open it to a second round.  We must finish for the next session, which is at 7.30 p.m.</p> <p>  I want to use my short time to talk about regional uplift, its future and the view of each representative group on that.  I will start with SGI because I am trying to get a sense with regard to the workers and the guilds.  We have not heard from Mr. Keeley.  He has my dream job, which is model building.  I might offer to swap as I would love that job.  I want to get a sense of how that works in terms of trainees and people on set who are providing particular skills.  The impression from the outside is that people travel to particular projects.  I am interested in the guilds approach to regional uplift and how important it is to SGI.  Is that of any importance to it?  I will then ask everybody else to come in.</p></speech>

I get a script and I break it down by the locations, and then I scout and source the locations.  We then secure all of the contracts and the permits, and then they make the film.  It sounds easy but it is not.  To have the whole country available as a location is the reason a lot of international production is coming here.  To have it all available to us would be fantastic and that is why the regional uplift is so important.  When we had that, it did promote filming in the regions.  I worked on a couple of films in the regions.  I would hire local trainees and it is part of regional uplift that we have to hire local trainees.  They would go around to each department, such as my department, and ask what we need, and I would, for example, ask for two trainees, if possible.  Those trainees would work with us.</p> <p>  We can see there is a willingness in the regions.  There are crew in the regions who want to work and they do not necessarily want to come to Dublin or Wicklow.</p><p>They should not have to come to Dublin or Wicklow; it should be nationwide.  It is going to take time to build up that crew base.  To make a film in the regions, there is a cost involved because the crew will be based in Wicklow and they will have to be brought over.  There might also be some local trainees or other grades.  Galway, for example, would have more crew elements available than, perhaps, Donegal, which is nonetheless a great place to film.  It is going to take a longer period to build up that crew base but it could be done if there were the regional uplift.  It would make the industry nationwide and take the pressure off Dublin and Wicklow being the main production hubs.</p></speech>

Sometimes, if a development is happening locally, as I know in the case of building developments, for example, there will often be a local employment clause that sets out what "local" means.  What does "local" mean in this context?</p></speech>

Normally, the word is put out and CVs come into the production office, and all the departments get those CVs.  Pretty much everyone who applies gets a job.  Last summer, we worked on Inishmore and Achill and a couple of those trainees made the move and came to Dublin, which was great because there is work here and they are working.  Nevertheless, I wish there were also work in the regions.</p></speech>

There is a want in the regions to work in the film industry.  I do not come from Dublin and I moved to Dublin to work in the film industry.

There is activity in the regions in the animation sector, as I mentioned in our opening statement, and the uplift was really beneficial, with people getting into it.  It is not quite fit for purpose, however.  The Chairman mentioned Donegal.  The 45 km rule is a little restrictive for animation at times because it is a highly technical industry that needs people with skills.  Sometimes it was difficult to find people within the 45 km, so we had asked for that to be extended to, perhaps, 75 km.  If somebody is working in Mayo, Leitrim or Donegal, it just geography.</p></speech>

Of our 42 members, seven are in Northern Ireland, while of the remainder, there are probably about 20 in Dublin and 15 in the regions.

Some of the other areas are smaller, such as Roscommon and even Cork, which is surprisingly small for a city.  In Kilkenny and Galway, there is an awful lot of activity and that draws in other people as well.</p></speech>

The intent of the scheme was so important that it was probably too short and, obviously, it was badly impacted by the fact that Covid emerged in the middle of it.   The full aspirations of the scheme were probably not reached and it is our contention it should be extended at the higher level.  Realistically, it is a declining base from 5% and the costs everyone is aware of, which Mr. Holohan mentioned, are very real.</p> <p>  While we represent the indigenous industry, we are cognisant that a vibrant indigenous industry is also represented in the regions.  We represent more than 170 members and they are not all Dublin based.  Ours is an all-island membership.  The regional uplift is critical to the development of that regional base.  One group I would like to speak to is na baill at&aacute; ag cruth&uacute; i nGaeilge.  We represent Irish language producers as well.  We have all referenced the films of the year, &ldquo;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;Arracht&rdquo; and &ldquo;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank&rdquo;.  It is such a vibrant, rich part of our achieving the cultural aims of section 481 and the ability to support that work in the regions.</p> <p>  Tying those two things together, the aspirations were fantastic but an entire ecosystem probably cannot be developed in five years with a declining base of percentage, so we should revisit that.  Is there an opportunity for Ireland Inc. to support unique aspects of our culture, namely, our Irish language and our Irish regional identity.</p></speech>

There is the TG4-Ard&aacute;n fund, for example, and the studio bases that are being built in the regions, with some of them already existing and more planned.  We want our member in Donegal, The Bothy, to produce work and we want all that regional work to be supported.  We also want to allow metro-centric producers, such as in Dublin, Cork and Wicklow, to bring work to the regions, but it needs an all-agency, multifaceted, mid-to-long-term strategy.</p></speech>

Having listened to the debate last week, I felt that needed to be mentioned.</p> <p>  Our guests talked about young people in the industry and their training.  How specifically does section 481 revolve around that?</p></speech>

Mr. McCabe referred to the national talent academies.  We are also part of those.  It is again quite a broad strategy of attracting trainees into this sector across the different disciplines both above and below the line and then assisting them to create.  For example, the work of the competency framework is defining the career path that one might take in any given grade.  As for the training, the mentorship and the shadowing that are required, I believe - and I think this was referred to in one of the opening statements - that the next generation of that is a view to work towards accreditation within the sector.  That would be the journey of trainees.  Ultimately, if we are putting all that effort into attracting people into the sector, it has to be a very sustainable, attractive place to work.</p></speech>

More recently, we have had diversity, equality and inclusion added to that skills plan.  You have to go through all those checks and balances, and there is very rigorous compliance to be achieved when you do that.  Then it is so important to continue the regional uplift and the regional trainees who were required for that.  Deputy Ryan asked about trainees staying in the industry.  They are not necessarily in a position to move to Dublin-Wicklow to work.  If we want to sustain the industry nationwide and keep the trainees in the industry, it is really important that the regional uplift is there.  The two projects I have produced in Kerry and Galway would have happened in Dublin-Wicklow if it were not for the uplift, not because we wanted them to happen in Dublin-Wicklow but because we would just not have been able to afford to make them in Kerry or Galway.  We were very fortunate because both those projects were based and set in those places and we would have had to cheat them in-----</p></speech>

Take one recent project we looked at.  The production schedule is really long.  It is a four-and-a-half-year production schedule.  We have 20 trainees on the project but they are all at different stages.  There are trainees basically coming in as interns.  They are learning as with a first job.</p></speech>

Then there are people who are part of that training programme and who are moving into a director, art director or episodic director role for the first time.  They are moving into new positions and being mentored.  As part of tracking their performance and seeing how they are getting on and what their challenges are, they will meet not only with their mentor but also with the HR function to have an open discussion as to what their challenges are and how they are getting on, getting feedback from the mentorship.  It is not just introductory roles, which this does include, but also roles right along the entire career path.  That all forms part of the training programme for section 481.  It is a requirement.</p></speech>

In respect of productions between two countries - for example, in Britain - how is relief work on a practical level, and how does it compare with similar relief work in other countries?</p></speech>

That is one of the reasons why it is really important that section 481 remains in place.  If there were no section 481, virtually all production activity that currently takes place in Ireland would move elsewhere.  For example, in Northern Ireland there is a tax credit which is fully available and which would be availed of if there were no tax credit for all production in Ireland.  We have to live in this very competitive international economy.  It also has to be said that there is great co-operation and co-production between the various countries.  We have co-production treaties for the whole of Europe on the one hand and, on the other, co-production treaties with individual territories, Canada being a good example of a country with which we have a very strong co-production treaty.  There is enormous co-operation between the countries but also a certain amount of competition between the countries in respect of the locations of productions.  One has to be at one's absolute highest efficiency, with the best skills available, in order to attract the production activity here.</p></speech>

What is his opinion of the regional uplift that was introduced in July 2019?  Has it worked, notwithstanding Covid?  In his opinion, do changes need to be made to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#L01600"><p>The regional uplift has decreased to 2% going into 2023.  My experience is as a location manager.  I worked in the regions during the time the regional uplift was there and I worked there when we all went back to work just after Covid, and I think it worked.  I think it brought production to the regions.  I think it was maybe Ms Kirby who said this.  I would like to see it come back.  Everyone needs to sit down and discuss what to do.  It needs to be a seven-year plan, almost.  What we want is an industry in the regions.  For that to happen we would want crew in the regions because what is holding us back from shooting in the regions at the moment is the lack of available crew.  We have to bring the crew over, and there is a big cost involved in that.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg.  If we bring in a regional uplift or some kind of incentive to shoot in the regions, the crew will develop in the regions.  It will start with trainees.  To use my department as an example, those trainee location staff will become, after a couple of years, location assistants and, a couple of years after that, maybe six years down the line, assistant location managers.  There you go.  Then there should be beneath them location assistants and location trainees as well.  That is across all the departments that work on a film.  When you see the credits of a film, that is us.  That is all those departments.</p> <p>  The uplift worked.  I wish it would come back.  That is just me being selfish as a location manager.  I would prefer to work there more often, but I think that the people in the regions who want a career in this industry deserve it.</p></speech>

They want the intellectual property.  The witnesses are saying it has to be signed over to the producer companies, and that is the standing company, so it has the intellectual property and, presumably, then benefits from the royalties from that.  Maybe the witnesses could clarify that point.  However, these companies do not want the employees.  They are left with the DAC.</p></speech>

We want to work with the actors, the dancers, the stunt people and whoever else is involved.  What we would like to do is make sure that there is an organised collective bargaining system in place in line with the copyright directive.</p> <p>  The copyright directive was introduced last November and it is very new.  We are all trying to work our way through to make it work.  It entitles authors and performers to fair and proportionate remuneration.  We are committed to doing that but it is important that we have everybody working with us.  We urge the committee to encourage collective bargaining.</p></speech>

That goes on with A, B, C, D.  It is the same producer company employing the same people but, because the DAC is now gone, that producer can say that they are not his or her employees.</p></speech>

It is a project-based industry in every jurisdiction of the world at this stage.  It is true that each time somebody is employed, he or she is employed in connection with a project.  The project has a fixed period of time.  It may be only six weeks for a feature film, it may be six months for a season of a television drama series and it may be two or three years for an animation television series, but there is always in the end a project-based approach to this industry.  That is fundamental to how the industry is structured.</p> <p>  In terms of recognition of the work people do, they are recognised through each of the projects they work on.  As the Deputy will know, every person involved in the project, the production of a film or a television series is given a credit at the end of the production.  That is the credit acknowledgement of the work that has been achieved in relation to those people who are working in the industry.  It is important.  People get work on the basis of the projects they have worked on.</p></speech>

If someone is to point out certain issues in pay and condition, one is not necessarily in a very strong position.</p> <p>  I welcome what has been said about collective bargaining agreements and getting a deal that everyone can live it.  We need a system that will deliver for that.</p> <p>  We have that problem that there are a number of crew and actors who do not believe they are equal players in this.  I do not know how we will provide them with a fora and a system that provides them with a decent level of representation but that looks like what we need to at least get us to the next step.</p> <p>  In fairness, the other question I was going to ask has been dealt with to a degree.  How do these working conditions and the contracts that we have spoken about previously compare with those in Britain, France or wherever?</p></speech>

It is a moveable industry.  People work from both areas and, by and large, all the remuneration is comparable between one jurisdiction and the other.</p> <p>  One last point, the collective bargaining agreements provide for dispute resolution mechanisms in relation to anything that may go wrong between a worker and an employer in the film and television production sector.  The vital aspect of the new shooting crew agreement, which was re-concluded in 2020, and the construction agreement, which was concluded in 2022, provide for dispute resolution mechanism for employees.  It is really important to us that those dispute resolution mechanisms are in place to protect employees in the context of any dispute they may have with their employer.</p></speech>

The references that are being made here relate to a small proportion of people.  A lot of work has gone into the communicating with crew and all other stakeholders.  There are so many systems in place and the guilds are there as a representative body to help everybody and make sure that things are done in a fair way.  I am not sure that it is representative of a small number of people when we have never had such a busy time in film over the past few years.  We all recognise there are always issues in every industry with employers and employees but the channels of communication here are open.  At no point is anybody ever in a situation where he or she does not have somewhere to go.  We have our website.  Anybody who works in film in any capacity is welcome to call me and we can help them with any issues they might have.  I would very much refute the blacklisting allegations.  It is not something that I have come across.  It is important to say that that is a small minority of people and it is not representative of the people we deal with.</p></speech>

We need better channels across the board so that we can have this communication and can put some of these issues to bed.  All we want to see is a vibrant film industry that produces good films, good television and good animation and provides people with good jobs, which they will need to sustain the industry anyway.</p></speech>

There is a suggestion that there are no real jobs.  I have heard the likes of that bandied about.  I ask the committee to visit us.  We will show the committee around and the members can meet the people who are working on the ground and can talk to them.</p> <p>  I did not get a chance to answer some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions properly, such as how one gets a job and where the guilds come from.  Briefly, in 2018, a large number of crew felt we did not have a voice.  There was a voice being heard but we felt that we did not have a voice.  I felt I did not.  We are film crew, we are good at getting organised and we got organised.  We organised ourselves into guilds really quickly.  The locations guild was the first guild.  It is probably ten years old.  Other crew took our lead and formed guilds.  Then we decided we should have a representative body - Screen Guilds Ireland - and that is where we come from.</p><p>We are ambitious.  We have looked for funding and got it from Screen Ireland, but we are also looking further afield.  That will get bigger.</p><p> I think there is some confusion.  We are all for quality employment.  We want it and it is a part of section 481 that we get it but there seems to be confusion between quality employment and permanent employment.  Most of us, myself included, want to work in a freelance industry.  That is why I got into it.  It is a creative industry and it is freelance.  I want to go from job to job.  I do not want to be tied to one production company and to only do the work that it does.  I want to be able to move around.  To have a career in this industry, how do you get a job?  You go in as a trainee and get to know people.  You make contacts and find out who is on the next job.  People tell you who is on the job, and to ring this guy and so on.  That is what happens.  It sounds like a clich&eacute; but film crew are like a family.  We help each other out.  We tell each other what jobs are coming in and what jobs need people.  I hope that answers some of the question.  The committee should come out and meet us on set and can ask us anything it wants.</p></speech>

On the question of using trainees, it would be impossible for us to crew up any production with just trainees.  There is a defined academic path into animation.  There are many animation courses on the island of Ireland.  We take those people.  Some go directly into the industry and some we have to put through bridging courses and give them some additional training.  There is a recognised pathway into the animation sector.</p></speech>

In my professional career in the creative industries, I have spent a great deal of time advocating and believing in the creative industries' proposition for Ireland Inc.  The film sector and the Irish audiovisual sector has such a key role to play in that.   There is something that we have not touched on, so I wish to acknowledge what we have all experienced in the last number of years.  This sector stayed open.  It very quickly pivoted, galvanised and stayed open.  It educated, informed and entertained.  It gave us a bit of solace.  I want to publicly recognise all those who were on the front line of that.  That is part of the representation here today.  I am very grateful for the opportunity.  I believe very firmly in the proposition of the creative industries in Ireland Inc.  It has been my passion.  We have an ability to deliver on great ambition.  A figure of &euro;4 billion was mentioned before.  We would welcome that level of commitment.  I guarantee that if we had that level of commitment, the sector would deliver.</p></speech>

I thank them for being with us this evening.  This follows on from the session we just had with three other groups.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Finnegan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Screen Ireland is the national agency for the Irish film, TV drama, animation, documentary, shorts and visual effects industry.  The agency works closely with industry stakeholders and creative teams to fund and assist Irish projects from early stage development through to production, distribution, marketing and exhibition.  Screen Ireland is responsible for promoting the expression of national Irish culture on screen and developing skills across the sector.</p> <p>  In recent years, there has been extensive growth in both local and international production.  From 2019 to 2021, local Irish feature film activity increased by 52% and local TV drama production spend increased by 40%.  Irish animation also demonstrated a further increase in 2021, following a decade of rapid growth that resulted in record-breaking production levels. Last year, Screen Ireland-funded projects earned over 35 major international award nominations, including Academy Award, Emmy and BAFTA nominations.</p><p><font color="#00201F">Screen Ireland has a dual remit and is also responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland in the form of international production in line with the Government&rsquo;s audiovisual action plan ambition to make Ireland a global centre of excellence for production.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> Ireland is a recognised leader globally in animation with approximately 2,500 people currently employed across 42 studios.  Ireland has also become a world-class visual effects hub for large-scale projects.  Screen Ireland welcomed the opportunity to showcase this sector's work on a trade mission to Los Angeles with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> National Irish-language cinema has also been redefined in recent years.  In the middle of an intensely difficult time for cinemas and the cinema-going experience, an Irish-language film broke domestic box office records, reaching a diverse audience across many different generations.  It created a cultural sensation at home and abroad and is now the Irish entry for the Academy Awards.  As a result of the cine4 scheme and section 481, we now have more Irish-language feature films being produced than ever before, ensuring that Irish filmmakers&rsquo; voices can be heard as Gaeilge as well as in English.  The tax incentive for film and television production has been part of public policy in Ireland for more than three decades and we have provided a written submission with further detail on the importance of the credit to the sector.  It exists to stimulate and support the local indigenous industry and it also attracts high-end international production to Ireland.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> Section 481 supports live-action film and TV production, animation production, creative documentary, post-production and visual effects, supporting both creative endeavour and employment across all these sectors.  The credit is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  In March 2019, Screen Ireland was asked by the Department to take on a new role to develop and then oversee a new process for tracking training and skills development opportunities on projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  This was a new departure for the agency, providing an opportunity for Screen Ireland to introduce a more structured approach to work-based learning and skills tracking, making Ireland the first country in the world to link such a formal skills tracking process to a tax credit.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Gareth Lee, who is head of skills and professional development, to take the committee through some of this work.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Lee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#O00200"><p>Since the introduction of the new system, Screen Ireland has assessed more than 160 skills development plans and tracked more than 1,700 skills participants across section 481 productions.  As well as the skills development aspect of the plan, producers are also encouraged to introduce both sustainability initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives on their productions.  This has seen significant positive change within the sector.<br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  The value of the section 481 skills process to Ireland's film production sector is significant.  It ensures that formality and structure is given to training.  It also gives reliable front-line data on the key skills shortages and gaps that are being experienced on the ground.  This, in turn, allows the sector to ensure that there is a pipeline of skilled talent to support both local and incoming production in a sustainable way.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  In 2022, Screen Ireland, in collaboration with Screen Guilds of Ireland, launched a new competency framework that captures all of the skills, knowledge and competencies for in excess of 80 crew roles across 17 different departments.  This resource enhances the section 481 skills tracking process, opens up access and career opportunities within the sector and supports third-level institutions and training providers with more targeted and relevant curriculum development.  The next evolution is the development of a certification-accreditation model for work-based learning.  Screen Ireland has started working closely with third-level partners and industry on this.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  To improve workplace culture, Screen Ireland has developed two new online, self-led training programmes on bullying and harassment and unconscious bias that those working on section 481 productions will be requested to complete.  These new programmes are also included as part of Safe To Create, a new collaborative programme aiming to provide safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the wider arts and creative sectors.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  Screen Ireland works closely with industry stakeholders and is dedicated to doing everything possible to ensure fair opportunities for all.  Before the end of the year, the agency will launch a new crew and services database for the sector that will help increase visibility of employment opportunities and access points for all to the industry.  Everyone working in the industry and any new entrants will be able to self-register on the database and indicate if they are available and seeking work.  Producers and companies will also be able to register on the site, search for crew and advertise opportunities centrally.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  As evidenced above, a huge amount of positive work on skills and workforce development has happened in the screen sector in Ireland in recent years.  This progress has either been directly related to section 481 or inspired by the section 481 skills requirement.  Screen Ireland is proud of the work to date and the progress that has been made.  We are keen to see even further progress in the years to come.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  We thank the committee for its work on the film credit and look forward to answering any questions the members might have.</font></p></speech>

We have heard those calls for a number of years now.  Mr. Lee and the skills team have spent a long time investing in it and trying to build it out as a resource.  We feel that not only will it represent crew but it will also represent facilities and services.  It will be a full directory for the industry.  To my knowledge, the industry has never before had something this comprehensive.  What we like about it is that we see it as a tool for the industry itself.  We want to ensure that the industry is as open and inclusive as possible, and that it gives fair opportunities for employment to everyone.  As a State agency, we play no role in the employment relationship but we felt this would be a valuable tool to enable any individual to self-register.  If a local or international production company is looking for crew, this resource would be available to them and allow them to connect with people.  We hope the database will launch in the next few weeks.  It is a pilot programme.</p></speech>

The film credit is given to create employment and training.  From what I gather, which was more or less confirmed by Mr. Hickey during the committee's earlier session, the DAC is the employer.  DACs only exist for the period of the production and approximately a year thereafter.</p></speech>

We did not have time to drill into it further but Mr. Hickey said we need the DAC system as an accountancy tool for investors and to provide transparency about what happens financially on a particular production.</p><p>I put it to the witnesses that it absolutely runs counter to the purpose of section 481 if the producer company that is a self-standing ongoing company can say it is not the employer of the people who worked on that film, even though that company set up the DAC, owns the DAC, but yet can disown responsibility for the people who work on the DAC.</p></speech>

It makes the application to the Department, receives approval and the tax credit.  That tax credit is then passed down from the producer company to the DAC.  The DAC is the company that employs the cast and crew and secures the location and all the necessary rights.  There is a commissioning relationship between the producer company and the DAC.  The delivered film passes back from the DAC to the producer company.  My understanding is that the DAC is the company that employs the crew.  It concludes the employment contracts and is responsible for the employment relationships, as per legislation, between that company and the crew.  I suppose it is a function of section 481 that there is a DAC in the structure.  I know that reference was made to the fact that the DAC ensures there is transparency, which it does, by the way.  It is also a structure of financing.</p></speech>

I understand that, and I understand the rationale of the DAC as an accountancy and financial tool.  If a section 481 tax credit is given for quality, employment and training, the basic requirement for an industry and employment is that we know who the employer is and we know who the employee is.  The problem is we do not.  The DAC exists purely for the duration of the production and for one year afterwards.  The DAC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company, for want of a better phrase, which is the recipient of the section 481 tax credit.</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make was that as the Deputy has probably gathered from the previous sessions, film production is a pretty expensive business.  Section 481 is just a part of it.  With any projects of scale, and when I say "scale" I am really talking about projects of a value of more than &euro;2 million, there needs to be other financing and banking in terms of ensuring the cash flows work within the production.  Banks will often lend against contracts and pre-sales and often provide gap financing.</p></speech>

I am getting back to the issue of employment and training.  Once the DAC ceases to exist, who does the employee on a film production have recourse to as their employer?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the employment relationship exists between the DAC and those who are hired on that particular production.  The DAC then stays in place for 12 months for compliance and transparency.  If any issues arise, they can be addressed in that time period.  Often, the crew members are going from one production with one employer to another production with a different employer.  That is where that-----</p></speech>

By the time the case reaches the court, the employer no longer exists, even though the company that got section 481 tax credit for that production on which the employee worked still exists, and that company says it has no relationship with the employee, even though the DAC was 100% owned by that company.  To me, that is a problem because it means the employees and the trainees do not have an employer they can go back to once the DAC is gone.  Therefore, all of the legislation those companies are required to sign up to is meaningless.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 is meaningless if the only legal employer an employee ever had only existed for a year and a half or less, for example, six months.  Do the witnesses know what I mean?  I just do not understand how the workers or the trainees can have any kind of rights, continuity or recognition of their service if their employer disappears after a period, even though their actual employer that got the money clearly still exists, but says it is not their employer.</p></speech>

That is a fact; they cannot.  I have one last question, and I know I am out of time.  Taking just one of the roles in the film that was mentioned, we had a witness who said they were a production manager.  How many people have qualified and been accredited as production managers through the skills training structures that have been set up?</p></speech>

It is a requirement around training and skills development.  It is not linked to a specific role, and it is not specifically about trainees.  As some of the witnesses explained in the previous session, the approach we have taken to it is very much holistic.  It is about capturing skills development across productions at all levels.  As an industry, we need to make sure we are developing people at all levels.  It is very much Government and European policy to address lifelong learning and continuing professional development within the industry.  In terms of how the system works, at the outset of a production, a producer will engage with crew and a skills development officer to develop a skills plan.  That skills plan will outline the skills that will be developed across a production.  That could include learning on the job, courses, shadowing, mentoring and skills development at the different levels I mentioned.  Our role is to approve that plan if we feel it is approvable or to go back to the producer to request changes.</p> <p>  Once in place and approved, our role is to oversee the delivery of that across the production.  We engage with the skills participants, as they are called, during that process.  We do set visits and so on.  At the end of the process, there is a compliance stage where we look and verify that the skills that have been developed across that project have been signed off and captured.  Our role is not around what level that person might get hired at on the next job.  That is obviously something for the employer and the individual.  That is their remit.  Our remit is to ensure skills are being tracked on production and they are being developed in that formal structured way.  It is important to say skills have always been developed on production.  That is why we have the fantastic crews we have in Ireland and we do the fantastic work we do.  What this system has put in place is a more formal structure around it.</p><p>One of the great things that was referenced in the last session and is important is the development of this competency framework, which captures all the skills, knowledge and competencies for every role across 17 departments.  Our plan, as a next step, is to look at certification for work-based learning.  We are engaging with third level providers around developing certification, be it micro-credentials or whatever, that will give people certificates for the work that they do and the skills that are tracked on production.  That is kind of the next step.  Again, that is not us being involved in the employment relationship; it is just us putting resources and processes in place to help with that, which is where the certification would come into play eventually.</p></speech>

It was clearly out of some conversations that happened at this committee.  It is working very well.  It is the first time in the world, I think, but certainly in Europe, that we are linking the tax credit to skills development.  In fact, many European countries are coming to us now, looking at the value of what was created and are quite eager to replicate it.  As Mr. Lee said, we developed the competency framework, which will go into a deeper level of linking the skills within the framework to the skills development plan, the further tracking and then compliance.</p></speech>

In respect of the industry development test, a post project compliance report must be submitted to Screen Ireland with a final version submitted within six months following production completion.  Companies are also required to provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission decisions as well.  If a producer does not comply with these requirements, any amount of the relief already claimed may be recoverable with interest.  Can the witnesses provide an example of a production company failing the industry development test and application for the section 481 relief?</p></speech>

Usually with these, it is quite common that there would be ones that fail in terms of receiving relief.  That is fair if that is a question more so for the Department and we will put that in.</p> <p>  The witnesses are probably also aware of claims made at this committee with regard to blacklisting workers.  We have been hearing from workers that they feel that they have been blacklisted by production companies etc.  Do the witnesses have any comment on that specific statement?</p></speech>

The crew and services database is part of what we were speaking about in that regard in providing a tool for industry to give as open and fair access points and opportunities of employment for all in the industry.</p></speech>

I am asking specifically about the blacklisting that some people have mentioned.  When we are looking at this particular tax credit, that is something that has arisen in previous committees, so it is more specifically on that.  Is Ms Finnegan saying that she does not feel she can comment on that?</p></speech>

The feedback that we get from across all the stakeholders that we engage with is that the industry is thriving.  Despite the pandemic, last year was a record-breaking year for the sector - it generated &euro;500 million in production spend.  We are hearing very positive feedback generally from across the sector and about employment levels as well.  It is an industry that is maturing and scaling.  Ensuring that there is open access for all feels like the appropriate role for us to play in that so that anybody who has experience has an opportunity to display that experience and be able to respond to employment opportunities within the sector.  We hope that this database will help provide that.</p></speech>

As people who work around the industry, if they have not been concerns that have been highlighted with Screen Ireland before - I would imagine that it is perhaps coming out of this committee - that is something that we would very strongly say needs to be looked at from what we have heard from witnesses.  It is obviously extremely concerning, if that is the case.  However, it fair enough if Ms Finnegan is saying that at this moment that is not necessarily something she will exactly comment on.  I would then perhaps urge that Screen Ireland looks at it at a later point.</p> <p>  I just also wanted to note something that was said by Irish Equity last week.  It noted that all performers and creatives are or should be protected by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the European copyright directive, which among other things, enshrined the right to proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial rewards that derive from their performance.  It stated that this is not an explicit requirement under section 481.  Can our witnesses comment on this with their understanding of requirements under section 481 and whether it is a stipulation for receipt of such relief?</p></speech>

Again, we do not administer the tax credit, but I can speak from the Screen Ireland perspective on this.  The European copyright directive and copyright in general is a very complex area.  From our understanding, it requires very careful consideration.  As an agency, over the past 12 months or so, we have met with each of the stakeholders across the sector to try to understand the different views and where there might be challenges around the implementation of the directive.</p> <p>  We welcome the European copyright directive and its full implementation, but we believe it requires the industry to come together.  Therefore, we proposed to the sector an informal working group around this.  We have been seeking an independent chair because we, as an agency, are also investors within content.  We wanted to make sure that we could better understand some of the complexities around it.  We are actively looking at including the European copyright directive in our own contract provisions along with all of the other legislation that we have requirements around.  We hope that we get full engagement from across the sector, which we believe we will, to work through where views may not fully align on certain aspects of it.</p></speech>

That obviously accepts on some level that there is an issue and we need to bring that to a head as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I ask about the remit of Screen Ireland, including but beyond its involvement regarding section 481.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, Screen Ireland has a dual remit.  They are both equally important in finding a fine balance between both areas of responsibility.</p><p> Screen Ireland is responsible for the expression of national Irish culture on screen.  We work with a production and development team to invest in projects.  We support projects literally through every stage of the process.  There is our version of research and development where one develops an idea for a film, a television drama, an animation or whatever.  We probably have between 80 and 100 projects in active development within the agency.  That supports Irish talent to come in and develop work in this area, which we do in a variety of different ways.  Production companies and producers come in with their ideas.  Throughout the pandemic we worked really hard as a team to ensure that we supported opportunities for other creative talent as well.  We have run a number of different programmes.  For example, one programme is called The Voice and it supports Irish directors.  The Screen Directors Guild of Ireland came to us with the idea for this fantastic programme as it allows directors funding so they can go off and develop their own ideas.  We are seeing some of those ideas come through now.  Initially, this was a Covid-19 support measure but we are seeing it now coming through the production lane  We have a number of different programmes, including one called Spotlight for writers.</p></speech>

Across the board, Screen Ireland has a responsibility to ensure the industry is supported.  The agency fits itself in where ideas can be developed and that obviously means dealing with all of the relevant stakeholders.  On some level, people view the agency as a general representative group of the film industry.</p></speech>

On some level, that fits in with what Mr. Hickey spoke about earlier having not only a collective bargaining agreement but a system that can deliver that, which is what I think we are missing.

In particular, through the pandemic we worked directly with creatives across the board.  We support crew.  We have worked with the Screen Guilds of Ireland to develop crew hubs around the country to respond to the increased demand for crew because of the growth in the industry.</p></speech>

We have received feedback, particularly at high points of production.  By that I mean there is a huge demand for crew during the summer months in Ireland.  We have received feedback that there is an oversubscription and people cannot find enough crew.  That is why we launched crew hubs to bring more people into the industry.  Mr. Lee can speak to the training piece and the work that we do there.</p></speech>

So it is about new entrants and trainees but it is also about upskilling and progression because one needs people to move up in order to have an industry.  So that is very much our approach.</p> <p>  As the witnesses in the previous session have stated, it is important that we bring new people in and grow the industry.  We should be very supportive of that and we are.  We also need to ensure that we upskill those who are in more senior positions and so on, and we do that through our work around section 481.  We do a whole host of other things in the skills department around continuous professional development and so on.</p> <p>  As the witnesses in the previous session said, I agree, I do not think that there is an imbalance.  Certainly with skills, we see a balance between the upskilling of people who are in the industry already and new entrants coming in.  We are keen to grow the industry so we should not deter new entrants and trainees from coming in as well.</p></speech>

We seem to have an issue with a number of people.  I cannot determine how big a number that is but it seems to be significant and it is people who have worked in the industry for years.  The way the industry operates, as you move from project to project, creates a certain level of difficulty.  I have no wish to make headlines but there seems to be a pre-1913-type set-up whereby it is almost that you show up and then the employer takes you on.  That is just the nature of project-to-project circumstances and we must discover ways to fix that part.  I do not know whether we need a forum or a greater level of representation, even as I have said about Screen Ireland, of some of these people.  Can we do that?</p></speech>

However, I believe we need the piece where we can have representation in order that people's views can be aired and we can find a structure that works a bit better.

Even over the past few years it seems that there has been huge progress made in the industry in terms of having a crew agreement in place now.  Such an agreement provides stability not only here in Ireland but when looking for international productions to come to Ireland.  It is great to be able to communicate that there are stable agreements in place.</p> <p>  My understand is that the second agreement is the construction agreement.  I suppose that any issues of pay and conditions would be dealt with through those agreements.  Our view on that is that we would welcome all parties coming together and trying to get those agreements in place across all areas.  As we look at our counterparts across Europe, we see that these agreements are in place.</p><p>Again, there are dispute resolution mechanisms within those agreements.  As the industry is maturing, we see that growth.  The growth from 2019 to 2021 was huge.  It was a 40% increase in that time despite it being the second year of a pandemic.  The sooner we can get to that point, across any areas where there are concerns, that is the method by which, typically, the industry deals with pay and conditions.  That should be fair and proportionate-----</p></speech>

It is about the work that is done on due diligence in the context of section 481.  A while ago we had a production that was up and running and that subsequently fell on its backside.  I would have thought there would have been an element of due diligence that needed to be done to ensure that funding was in place before anyone thought about providing State money for the production.

It is incredibly important to Screen Ireland that the growth the industry is experiencing is nationwide and across the country.  The regional uplift was a very effective intervention at the time but we feel it did not fully meet its policy objective to build a permanent pool of talent outside the hub of Dublin-Wicklow.  We have had a very strong, positive working relationship with the Department of Finance and, in particular, with the Department with responsibility for culture in the context of trying to bring the industry together and understand what might be the next intervention that might be slightly more precisely targeted.</p></speech>

That is fair enough, but the regionality aspect brings a bit more complexity to the issue.  Judging whether the mechanism works or not during a pandemic is complex.  I am not saying Screen Ireland is writing it off, but is it appropriate to draw a line under the uplift as a mechanism in that context or should we give it another go?</p></speech>

What we felt about the regional uplift, which is now in its dying days as we go into the 2%, is that it was a fantastic initiative for pushing production out of Dublin and Wicklow and developing the production base around the country.  A further issue arose which is that it was initially linked to a state aid map.  That map has just changed again this year for next year so it is questionable, even if it had not tapered off, how valuable it could be.  It was going to be rather messy and chaotic as to what was going to be included and excluded.</p></speech>

When the original EU approval came through, it was linked to a state aid regional map.  Unfortunately, that excluded Cork.  It just so happens that we always have a lot of production which favours going to Cork.  That state aid map has changed so of course the change----</p></speech>

As a result, for film production, it was going to become a bit more difficult.

Were the regional uplift to continue at 5% we are now well-structured to capitalise on that.  One of the things we have launched in recent years is a number of talent academies around the country that are in place to potentially support the uplift, were it to continue.  We have also developed very strong collaborative links with third-level providers around the country as well.  If it were to continue we would be in a very good place to capitalise on all that.</p></speech>

We definitely need to have more clarity and answers.  That said, I am going to move on.</p> <p>  I have two questions I am going to go through consecutively because of the time constraints.  Ms Finnegan's referred to the increase in the number of Irish language productions.  How important is section 481 in this regard?  Also, do we know what percentage of productions are in the Irish language and what the figure was prior to section 481?</p> <p>  The other question is a brief one.  Screen Ireland has taken on the role of developing and overseeing a new process for tracking, training and skills development opportunities on section 481 and its funded projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  How is this work going and what challenges has Screen Ireland faced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#T00100"><p>Section 481 has been critical to funding Irish language film.  There has been a resurgence, which people have also described as a new dawn, in Irish language cinema.  The work that has been generated is incredible.  When we talk about cultural dividend we see projects such as "An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in", "Arracht" which came before it and which we believe is the first time the famine was ever depicted on screen in that way, and "R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank", which is a third project that has come through.  We believe that section 481 is absolutely critical to that.  It was also part of the scheme called Cine4, which was a partnership between TG4, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and Screen Ireland.  It has really shown the creative talent that exists there and the impact it can have.  To see a film generate Ireland on screen the way it did, and to show that it can get huge audiences across multiple generations, is something very rare.  There are very young people going to see it but also up through the generations.  To see the critical response and the reviews across the UK, and it is to be released in the US, and ultimately to see how it fares in awards is huge.  Section 481 is highly important to that process.</p></speech>

As Ms McGrane referred to earlier, Ireland is the first country in the world to link such a structured skills tracking process to the tax credit.  We are the first country in the world to develop a competency framework for crew within the sector.  We are doing extremely pioneering work as Ms McGrane mentioned.  Other territories have come to talk to us to see the work that we are doing and in particular with the competency framework.  We have had lots of inquiries about that.  As for challenges, because we are doing pioneering work we are, to a certain extent, learning as we go.  It is evolving.  That has always been our approach, namely, how can we evolve and enhance the process to make sure it is working the best it can and to make sure it is as inclusive as possible.  We are always enhancing and we are open to enhancing that.</p></speech>

We are always looking to enhance.  The challenge is we do not necessarily have a template to copy.  Other sectors have things in place but there are aspects of our sector that we must address through the work that we do.  There are no other screen sectors internationally to copy.  That pioneering side of it is probably the most challenging bit.</p></speech>

We went out to tender and commissioned a report by Olsberg, international entertainment industry consultants that work globally, to assess both the cultural dividend and the industry development value of section 481.  It was a much more complicated undertaking than we had anticipated because cultural value manifests itself in a variety of ways, many of which can be quite hard to quantify.  We hope to have that report imminently to share with the committee.  One of the aspects I found very interesting in the report is a key finding around the Irish language.  They applied a framework to assess cultural value across intrinsic, institutional and instrumental values.  Within one of those instrumental values they talk about how it works to encourage, promote and preserve the Irish language.  They surveyed a number of individuals across the Irish public.  Respondents under the age of 35 were more likely to say that Irish screen content encouraged people to be proud of the Irish language and made them want to learn the Irish language or speak it more frequently.  The report also went on to comment that projects made in the Irish language have an especially important cultural and educational role in helping to engage people of all ages and especially learners.  We thought that was a very interesting takeaway from the report.</p></speech>

There was no dispute about that.  I would like to see more money going in, not less.  The big question that I feel is unanswered comes back to this issue of work being project by project.  At the end of the day it comes back to that notion.  It is a mantra I hear repeated.  I question it, to be honest.  Of course it is project to project.  So are plays.  The plays that go on in the Abbey Theatre, are project to project.  Just about every form of artistic endeavour is project to project at a certain level.  There seems to be a unique conclusion drawn with regard to live-action film that because it is project by project, nobody can have a job.  In every other area where work is project to project, people have jobs.  Uniquely in live-action film nobody can have a job.  I do not accept that, to be blunt about it.  It involves two groups of people.  From the point of view of the actors, I perceive we are saying "We know that because of the nature of acting we cannot have a permanent job but we want the full remuneration for our performance.  That is what we want but we are not getting it."  That is what Equity is telling us.  Then there is the crew.  There is an idea that the crew are in the same position as the actors but there are different requirements.  It is different.  There is an idea that one must get rid of set painters, stagehands, drivers or prop makers every time a project is finished with absolutely no security for them getting onto the next production.  It must be remembered that much of this is funded with public money, which is in fact their money and taxpayers' money.  Both groups emphasised that this is taxpayers' money.  I just do not accept that.  I do not see why it is necessary, based on the assertion that it is project to project.  It is not the case anywhere else.  This also relates to the question of trainees.  I get that things have moved on; it is partly because some of those groups have come in here and raised these issues that things have moved on.  If I understand it correctly, while Screen Ireland is assessing that there may be some training going on in film production, we do not know if those trainees will be employed on the next production by that same film producer.  Am I right in saying that?  Also, there is no accreditation for their training.  Unlike an apprentice carpenter or bricklayer there is no point at which we can say they are qualified in a particular occupation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the project to project idea creates that power differential issue that we need to deal with, whether it is the actors or the crew.  If we could get around that piece we could deal with the collective bargaining issues and some form of representation, in whatever forum that it needs to be, so we can bridge that gap and that power differential.  Perhaps there could be a database or whatever, so there is a recording of all of those people involved and maybe it would have their skill set, an element of their CV, and who is working where, and that sort of detail.  Then we could track the training across the board by having that information.</p><p>That also provides us with an overview of the industry that taxpayers' money is going into.  Then we can get the best bang for our buck, for all of us.</p></speech>

On a site, there are often different crew requirements for different projects.  A massive large-scale sci-fi production will require certain crew, whereas a location-based romantic comedy, for want of a better example, would have a very different requirement.  That is our understanding from talking to the screen guilds that represent thousands of crew.  Even within this report there is an element about quality employment.  Olsberg has applied a framework to look at what constitutes quality employment in terms of meaningful work.  Over 50% of people within the sector have been working in it for more than ten years.  That would suggest there is a form of stability there.  The ability to go from project to project with different employers each time is part of the nature of the industry we are in.  I know that sounds repetitive.  With regard to pay and conditions, it is through industry agreements that that dynamic is managed appropriately.  Everybody, hopefully, comes out of those agreements with fair and proportionate remuneration and feels they work well.  Where there are disputes, there is a mechanism within those agreements to address those.</p></speech>

The Supplementary Estimate is required in respect of a number of subheads across the Vote.  Additional funding is required principally to meet the cost pressures occurring due to the extraordinary demands placed on my Department in the discharge of its role in the humanitarian response to the Ukraine crisis and in relation to its response to the exponential growth in the numbers of international protection applicants arriving in the State over the course of 2022.</p> <p>  The primary driver for an additional provision is the cost of accommodation for new arrivals from Ukraine.  Almost 53,000 beneficiaries of temporary protection have arrived in Ireland since March, of whom 41,500 have sought accommodation.  The expected full year cost in 2022 for Ukraine accommodation and related costs is &euro;593.2 million.  I remind the committee that there was no provision for Ukraine spending in the 2022 Vote for my Department as, of course, the entire crisis was unforeseen.  The committee is also aware that the costs associated with the Ukraine crisis, the largest element of this Supplementary Estimate, are unprecedented.  The Government has committed to continue to provide safe shelter for those fleeing the war in Ukraine.  As a result these costs have to be borne by the State and, in particular, by the Department's Vote.</p> <p>  Other areas of the Vote are also experiencing significant pressure.  The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, provides accommodation and associated services to international protection applicants.  This is a demand-led process and the additional funding required in 2022 is due to the cost of accommodation for the increased number of new international protection arrivals.  The IPAS budget for 2022 was based on 7,244 applicants accommodated at the start of the year and an expected additional 4,500 to arrive in 2022.  In fact, however, more than 10,000 people have arrived in Ireland to 25 September, more than double the numbers anticipated for the full year.  As a result, the additional provision being sought for international protection is &euro;102.9 million.  These two areas respectively account for &euro;696 million of the total Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  There are much smaller requirements for the delivery of services across a number of other areas in the Vote, including Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and early learning and childcare as well as other smaller areas of the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Tusla is expected to have an overspend of &euro;16.2 million due to cost pressures arising on non-pay elements of its expenditure, mainly relating to the provision of residential care and costs associated with the extension of the Building Momentum agreement.</p> <p>  Early learning and childcare is experiencing a higher than expected uptake of both the early childhood care and education scheme and the access and inclusion model, AIM, programmes.  Applications for the national childcare scheme, a relatively new scheme, have also increased beyond expectations.  These factors combined result in an overspend of &euro;27.2 million across the early years subheads.</p> <p>  Smaller amounts are required for other elements of the Department's Vote.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland requires an additional &euro;600,000 driven by expenditure arising in preparation for the enactment and implementation of the Birth Information and Tracing Act.  The Office of Ombudsman for Children is experiencing increased pay costs and requires an additional &euro;200,000.  The Magdalen fund has a shortfall of &euro;300,000 arising from increased claims.  The Irish Youth Justice Service requires an additional &euro;400,000 and the National Disability Authority requires an additional &euro;100,000 to meet costs associated with the extension of Building Momentum agreement.</p> <p>  Savings of &euro;35.2 million across other areas of my Department's Vote have been found to help meet the overruns.  As a result, the Supplementary Estimate required for my Department is &euro;719.4 million.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate for the Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Vote to the committee and I am happy to address any questions members may have.  As they can see I have brought pretty much the entire Department with me just in case.</p></speech>

I apologise because I did not think I would make it to the meeting.  I am watching D&aacute;il proceedings because I am due to speak there shortly.  More than anything else I want to acknowledge the work the Department has done in response to the Ukrainian crisis.  It is unprecedented.  We could not have planned for this situation last year before it happened.  The response from the Department and from the workers in the Department has been very good.  This needs to be acknowledged and I want the Minister to pass it on to the Department and anybody else delivering the response.  I am happy to see that Ireland is playing its part in the humanitarian response.  It is important for us as a nation to be able to roll out the welcome mat for people coming into the country, especially those with trauma and in crisis and fleeing a war situation.</p> <p>  Not everything is perfect and I am glad the situation in Killarney was resolved.  If it has not been I would like the Minister to let me know.  One of the biggest challenges we have is people coming here who have lost their homes and sometimes family members.  They come over to a new situation and they find themselves in a community.  After a period of time they become embedded in the community and put down roots.  I was listening to the radio earlier and I heard a lady who went to college in her community but all of a sudden there was a threat of her being moved to a different community at the other end of the country.  I would like to see measures in place whereby this approach cannot be taken.</p><p> There is an overspend for Tusla of &euro;16.2 million, much of which relates to the provision of residential care.  The CEO of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, appeared before the joint committee yesterday and there was discussion on what seems to be an increase in the number of children accessing bespoke temporary accommodation, such as bed and breakfast establishments, hotels, holiday chalets and so on.  Does that account for any part of the increase in Tusla's expenditure?</p><p> Will the Minister elaborate on the &euro;35.2 million in savings across certain areas, which may alleviate some of the cost overruns elsewhere?  From where did those savings come?  I am concerned that when savings are made, certain services that were in place might not be delivered as well as they were in the previous year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022101200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I very much appreciate his acknowledgement of the work the Department has done on the response to the war in Ukraine.  It has been done by the staff, not by me, from the assistant secretaries, one of whom is here today, all the way to clerical officers in Citywest working to help people move around the country.  Amazing work has been done by the officials in my Department, and, in addition, we have had people seconded in from other Departments and agencies.  I appreciate the Deputy's recognition of the phenomenal work that is being undertaken.</p> <p>  Regarding the situation in Killarney, none of the Ukrainian families or individuals in that hotel will be moved from the town.  They will be provided with alternative accommodation in Killarney.  We have identified one hotel and are looking to find accommodation for some of the larger families that cannot be accommodated there.  What happened in Killarney is an indication of the pressures and difficulties associated with having to accommodate so many people within a short period.  That applies to people coming from Ukraine and also the people in the international protection process.  Numbers arriving from Ukraine have more than doubled in the past month, from 700 a week at the start of September to 1,500 last week.  That is very much a consequence of the renewed targeting of civilian infrastructure by Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>  The numbers of international protection applicants remain very high as well.  As I have said on a number of occasions, we find it particularly hard to source accommodation for international protection applicants.  In Killarney, we had a situation where there was a hotel that could accommodate such applicants.  The reason the Department sought to move international applicants there is that, three weeks ago, as the Deputy will recall, we were not able to provide accommodation for them over a five-day period and people were being turned away.  I want to avoid that situation recurring.  Much as I would like to, I cannot make a guarantee that we will not have to ask people to move in the future.  Sometimes, people have to move if hotels do not renew contracts.  In this instance, however, there was a particular situation whereby the need to secure accommodation for international protection applicants was significant.  Through working with local representatives and others, we were able to secure significant alternative accommodation.</p> <p>  Killarney's profile as a major tourist town made it more likely than elsewhere to have another big hotel to step in.  The same may not be likely to happen in every other place.  We will try to avoid situations like that.  I am acutely aware that this situation would have been traumatising for families but I am also acutely aware of the need to avoid, as much as possible, a situation where we cannot offer accommodation.  The Department's most basic aim is to provide accommodation and meals to people.  That is the core part of our role in responding to humanitarian crises.</p> <p>  Regarding Tusla, the Deputy is absolutely right that the vast majority of the overspend relates to those extremely complex cases in which not only the location of accommodation must be bespoke but the support apparatus of support staff, social workers and social care staff has to be put in to deal with the particular difficulties these young people are experiencing and the range of needs they have.  Sometimes, due to wider issues in terms of security, risk of flight and the like, there may have to be multiple teams supporting one individual.  These are very complex cases that always fall back on Tusla because it is ultimately responsible for young people in such situations.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, Tusla has brought forward or is in the process of bringing forward a number of papers on alternative care.  Mr. Gloster spoke about that yesterday and one of those reports is on residential care.  Tusla is looking to strengthen the State and community and voluntary element of residential care with a view to being able to rely less on private residential care.  Complex cases often end up in private residential care but the most complex cases always come back on the State and those are the cases in which very significant sums have to be invested to provide and protect these young people with particularly complex needs.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the saving of &euro;35 million.  The biggest saving was &euro;14 million in the context of the transition from the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for early years providers.  When the EWSS ended this year.  Before core funding kicked in, we had a bespoke scheme in place to support childcare providers.  The EWSS was originally meant to end in January.  We had budgeted for the transitional scheme to go from January until the end of August.  In fact, the EWSS did not stop until the end of April, which meant there was more money allocated for our scheme than was needed for the months in which it ran.  That was the biggest element of saving.</p> <p>  The next biggest element of saving was on pay relating to posts within the Department's staff complement that we were not able to fill.  There was also a saving on the response to the mother and baby and county home institutions, arising primarily from the fact the Tuam agency is only now being established, whereas we had budgeted for its establishment earlier this year.  We got Government approval two weeks ago to establish it but there was a &euro;3 million allocation for its operation this year that will not now be met.</p></speech>

We received responses from 20 of them and have met with the management in all those cases.  There is a wide range of issues in schools, as the Minister knows, but I was reminded while he was speaking of one of the issues that was raised.  What conversations or interactions does he have with the Department of Education around school places for either Ukrainian nationals or international protection applicants?  What seems to be happening is that schools located closest to the hotels and centres where people are placed are inundated with applications.  People have been walking to them and looking for places for their children.  In other parts of my constituency, the schools have had no such applications.  There seems to be an <i>ad hoc</i>kind of arrangement whereby people fleeing here from Ukraine or elsewhere and seeking international protection are having to find school places for their children themselves, without support from the Department of Education.  In fairness to the people we met in the various schools, they were more than willing to help as many children as possible, if they have the resources, and do their bit in a humanitarian crisis.  What engagement has the Minister had with the Department of Education on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022101200002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  On the higher level, when we are opening new accommodation either for Ukrainians or international protection applicants, we engage with the Department of Education and let it know people will be moving into the area in question.  The Department now has a sophisticated scheme for identifying the areas in which there is pressure on school places.  We engage with it on that and it can flag the issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy probably is focusing more on the micro level of individual schools.  As part of the Ukraine response, the regional education and languages teams have been working very closely with schools to try to ensure Ukrainians are linked in with local schools.  That has been working very successfully.  Allocations for integration officers for this year are set out in the White Paper.</p><p>My Department has an allocation for the employment of integration officers in every local authority throughout the country.  That is an area where the integration officers could provide an important link between people in international protection or Ukraine and State agencies and schools, as well as engaging with educational welfare officers and the like.  We also have a budget to increase supports for NGOs in terms of the White Paper and reaching out to international protection applicants.  I am very focused on education supports, knowing that probably one of the best ways to integrate children and, indeed, their parents into their new communities is to build up those linkages at schools.  We will be looking to roll that out further.</p><p> Like the Deputy, I try to meet with schools in my area.  A number of schools across a wide part of Dublin 15 were providing great support to students who were in emergency international protection.  When that hotel was not available anymore and they moved out, the schools were looking to try to facilitate buses to continue to link people in.  Schools do amazing work in terms of supporting both Ukrainians and international protection applicants.  There are some bespoke measures in place from the Department of Education and we are looking to build further in terms of, particularly, the area of international protection applicants.</p></speech>

One of the biggest direct provision centres is in my area in Clondalkin.  It is there a long time and the families are part of our community at this stage.  They play on the local football team and go to school with my kids and other children in the area.</p> <p>  One of the biggest issues we have is people who have the right to remain but cannot exit direct provision.  For example, people in homeless hubs will get key workers in and people to help them exit that.  Do people in direct provision who have the right to remain get those housing supports and people to help them through the housing assistance payment, HAP, or homeless HAP situation, whatever it might be?</p></speech>

We provide those supports.  We have a staff member from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, seconded to our Department who works as a key worker for people in international protection to assist them in moving on.  We would be looking to increase that level of support and perhaps get more support and more people working on these cases to support people to move on.  We all know the incredible pressure on the housing market right now.  Obviously, someone who has status is entitled to HAP and go on the social housing list.  However, we also know, particularly in terms of the housing list, the time spent is key there.  The statutory supports are there in terms of finances, but there are personnel supports as well, which we are hoping to grow.</p></speech>

I just had a couple of people on to me in the past couple of days who are in direct provision and are struggling to find a way out.  I do not know if they have had that support.  When I asked them, they had not got it.</p></speech>

I have one last issue to raise.  Can the Minister open the intercultural centre in Clondalkin for me?  I spoke to that employee.  In fairness, I spoke South Dublin County Partnership and it indicated that it looks like it will be opening the door soon.  If the Minister&rsquo;s Department can put any pressure to have it open, that would very welcome as well.</p></speech>

I actually have a question tabled about this tomorrow.  On the domestic violence services, is there any breakdown of where exactly that is going?  How will that work?  The Department of Justice is supposed to be taking it all under one umbrella, which is welcome and it is good to have it in one area.  The Department of Justice is probably a good fit for it.  What impact will that have on the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  The refuges are still being funded by Tusla.  Will that be the plan going forward?  Is there any more information?</p> <p>  Out of interest, I had never seen the Magdalen fund referenced.  Perhaps I just missed it before.  Has there been some new interest in that?  Is that partly because of all of the discussions on mother and baby institutions, redress and the Birth Information and Tracing Act?  Has that brought up perhaps other things that has led people to start looking into that scheme?  That is more just kind of an interest question.</p></speech>

This will take probably about 18 months to two years to establish.  Once that is done, policy but also front-line services will be directly the responsibility of that and the role Tusla currently plays in funding refuge services will move out of Tusla and to this agency fully.  In the interim, because this will all fall within the Department of Justice&rsquo;s remit, it is now responsible for that part of Tusla&rsquo;s Vote.  My Department is responsible for the vast majority of Tusla&rsquo;s Vote.  The education welfare service is run by the Department of Education and it gets the money for that.  Now, the Department of Justice gets the money for that part of Tusla that does domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, response.  I got a significant increase last year, but it is the Department of Justice&rsquo;s role now.  I am afraid I do not have the detailed figures for the Department of Justice on me right now.</p></speech>

In the medium term, it will actually come out of Tusla and into this new agency.  The Magdalen fund was also originally in the Department of Justice.  When the first transfer of functions happened in October 2020, it moved over to this Department.  The Ombudsman looked at the original Magdalen scheme and made a report on that, which broadened out access to the scheme somewhat.  It is primarily on the basis of more people being in contact with the Magdalen scheme and applying to it that the original estimate we had in this year&rsquo;s budget has been exceeded.  We are just looking to make sure we have the sufficient amount.</p></speech>

There was even much media focus and everything on it.  It is good we keep awareness up and keep whatever funding we can definitively in there so that people know they have support services and everything.</p> <p>  Does the Minister want to make any closing remarks?</p></speech>

We are joined by Mr. David Moloney, Ms Ciara Morgan and Mr. John Howlin.  We will begin with an opening statement but before we do that, I have a little local matter to attend to.</p> <p>  We are joined in the Public Gallery by Pippa Gaunt, Ellen Gaunt and Eleanor Cleary.  An in-house magazine was produced by their school for which I was interviewed.  I have a copy here.  It was a nice little publication by the school for which they went around and got the backgrounds of their Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la.  They were anxious to come here today to see the Oireachtas and how we function, which is a great thing for the school.  They are now attending the Model School in Kilkenny College.  They will be going on a tour of the Seanad and D&aacute;il afterwards, which I hope they will enjoy.  I thank them for coming along today to see democracy in action and to see our Oireachtas members working.  I acknowledge the very fine work they did in their magazine.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>  We will move on to the opening statement.  See the important things in life?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss issues related to the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  The role and status of Ministers with regard to Departments and their responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are set out in Article 28 of the Constitution and are further elaborated in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.</p> <p>  The 1924 Act has two distinct functions.  First, it provides a legal basis for the Civil Service, outlining the structure and organisation of central administration while also defining ministerial responsibility.  Second, the Act established the Departments of State, their remits and distributed the associated public activities.  The Act also provides that the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, appoint the principal officer of each Department, which is now known as the Secretary General.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance was assigned the function of prescribing the terms and conditions of appointments for civil servants under section 2(3) of the Minister and Secretaries Act.  Most recently, these functions were transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the formation of my Department in 2011.</p> <p>  Under section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions such as the regulation and control of the Civil Service, the classification, reclassification, numbers and remuneration of civil servants and the fixing of the terms and conditions and conditions governing the promotion of civil servants.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act 1997 provides a statutory basis for the management structure of the Civil Service.  This Act assigns to Secretaries General certain functions, which include managing the Department, implementing Government policies appropriate to the Department, delivering outputs as determined by the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department and providing advice to the Minister.  The Public Service Management Act also obliges Secretaries General to prepare a strategy statement setting out the key objectives, outputs and strategies of the Department.  It is important to note that the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 do not change the core policy responsibility of Ministers, who remain responsible for the functions of the Department under the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also assigns responsibility for using resources so as to meet the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 with regard to the regularity and propriety of public expenditure as well as to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  This relates to the role of Accounting Officer.  The Secretary General of a Department acts as Accounting Officer and is accountable to the Oireachtas for the use of the Department&rsquo;s resources.  Secretaries General, in their Accounting Officer capacity, are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts which, in turn, reports to the D&aacute;il in respect of its stewardship of public funds.  The Accounting Officer system means that while accountable as Secretary General to the Minister for managing the Department and for the other duties under the Public Service Management Act, the Accounting Officer is also answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for regularity, propriety and value for money.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also provides a formal structure for assigning authority and accountability within the Civil Service.  Officers within Departments who are assigned functions are accountable to the Secretary General.  The framework of assignments for each Department to principal officer level is published annually.  The Public Service Management Act also gives the Secretary General responsibility for managing all matters relating to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of staff below the grade of principal or its equivalent in the Civil Service.  Generally, the management of staff is assigned to the line manager, who is responsible for making civil servants aware of acceptable standards of attendance and conduct and for dealing with shortcomings promptly and fairly.</p> <p>  With regard to work performance, there are systems to support performance management.  The performance of civil servants up to and including the grade of principal is managed under the performance management and development system, PMDS.  There is a separate process of performance management, namely, the leadership evaluation and development system for senior grades in the Civil Service above the level of principal officer.  Finally, for Secretary General level, there is an annual performance review process in place intended to support the performance of Secretaries General.  On a more general point, I would note that Secretaries General are also employees and are covered by most of the existing employment and other legislation.</p> <p>  From an international perspective, even among countries with relatively similar systems, there does not seem to be a comprehensive solution that can be applied to issues of accountability in a categorical way.  I would draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the ongoing work of the OECD in this regard, however, building on its Recommendation on Public Service Leadership and Capability report.</p> <p>  Overall, there are a range of complex and interlinking responsibilities associated with the role of Secretary General.  They are accountable to Ministers for certain functions and to the Oireachtas for others.  They are appointed by, and accountable to, the Government.  I am very interested in hearing the committee's views on these issues and welcome members' ongoing input.</p></speech>

I have quite a number of questions to get my head around certain aspects.</p><p>My first question relates to the capacity in which Mr. Moloney is speaking in front of this committee today.  The reason I ask is because the particular circular on guidelines for civil servants appearing before or providing information to Oireachtas committees states:</p> <blockquote> 	The following should be borne in mind by civil servants in contacts with these committees:<br /><br />- a civil servant who appears before, or provides information to, an Oireachtas Committee does so on behalf of his Minister who, as a corporation sole, is legally responsible for the official acts of his civil servants. </blockquote> <p>Will Mr. Moloney comment on that?</p></speech>

Yes, absolutely.  That is correct.  In my capacity in front of this committee, I am acting as Secretary General of the Department on behalf of the Minister.  Therefore, in that capacity, for example, there are certain constraints on what I can and cannot comment on.  I cannot comment on the merits and demerits of Government policy.</p><p>I speak largely on behalf of the Minister.

It is important for me to understand how these things work.  Will he start by explaining the Carltona doctrine?  I have to say that name in my head before I say it out loud.  Will he say initially what the doctrine is and then whether there are limitations on it?</p></speech>

The Minister is a corporation sole and the Department as a whole performs functions on his or her behalf.  That does not require any act of express delegation; it is simply a way and means of carrying out the business of the Minister and the Department.  It is sometimes set out specifically in legislation, sometimes by precedent, that certain functions cannot be carried out except by the Minister.  Certain orders, for example, can only be signed by him or her.  Broadly, however, in the day-to-day running of the Department, the Carltona doctrine, in effect, represents this idea of a corporation sole, whereby the officials of a Department are acting on behalf of the Minister in what they do.</p></speech>

As we know, civilian control over the military is a core principle of democracy.  This submission expressed concerns about the overreliance by the Department of Defence on the Carltona doctrine as a means of exercising control and said this overuse needed scrutinising.  I am not commenting on that but it is something I have noted.  As far as Mr. Moloney is aware, has there ever been an external review carried out to see how well the doctrine is performing?</p></speech>

A lot of the time when we look at accountability issues in the Civil Service, it is centred around the exercise of the discretion within the Carltona doctrine and the relevant and appropriate division of responsibilities between Ministers and Secretaries General.  The role of Departments and Ministers is set up under the Constitution and provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.</p> <p>  Part of what the 1997 Act did was to try to provide further clarification around some separation of those responsibilities within the overall context of the delegation of authority, notwithstanding the Carltona principle.  What the Act really tried to do was to separate the day-to-day issues of running a Department, move them away from being a direct responsibility of the Minister and make them more the responsibility of the Secretary General.  While the Minister would retain policy responsibility, he or she would not necessarily be dragged into the minutiae of day-to-day issues.  That is the thinking behind the Public Service Management Act.</p></speech>

That report looked at the interaction between Ministers and Secretaries General, the operation of the different roles and how accountability and performance could be strengthened.  It looked at a wide variety of relevant issues that would come up in this context.  As far as I know, the Carltona principle itself has not come under particular focus.</p></speech>

It was designed as well to minimise agency loss.  The idea is that the principal, that is, the Minister, has his or her policy administered by the agent, that is, the Secretary General.  However, in an extreme situation, say, where an agent was not happy or found the Minister's decisions and policy changes were undesirable and decided to sabotage them, what avenues are open to Ministers if they feel something like that has happened?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is an ongoing conversation between Ministers and their Secretaries General in regard to issues and the delivery of the statement of strategy and the business plan for Departments.  There is a structure there, introduced in the 1997 Act, to allow a conversation, a setting of objectives and a review of those objectives.  If specific issues arise whereby the Minister feels action has been taken without authority, the process allows him to raise those issues.  In terms of the Deputy's net point, the Civil Service Regulation Acts make the Government the appropriate authority for Secretaries General because the latter are appointed by the Government.  If an issue were to be escalated, it would be escalated to the level of Government.</p></speech>

The context is the Civil Service disciplinary code, which begins with the issuing of a level 1 verbal warning, followed by a written warning, a level 3 written warning, extension of the period of validity of the warning, deferral of an increment, debarment from competitions and promotions, withdrawal of concessions, reassignment to a different location or duties and withdrawal of allowances.  Those are all measures the Minister can take prior to going to the Government.  There are elements of the Civil Service disciplinary code that do not apply to Secretaries General.</p><p>Because of their appointment by the Government, they do not apply by statute.  Those elements are lower-rate remuneration, reduction to a lower grade and suspension without pay.  Those are not available to the Minister in respect of a Secretary General.  The final level of sanction is dismissal, which would be a matter for the Government. </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Moloney for that.  Sometimes with these things there are so many different circulars etc. that it can be a bit confusing.  As for the sanctions the Minister can do at that level, say the ones Mr. Moloney read out - barring the ones that cannot be given to a Secretary General - have they been done in the past?  I am not asking him to comment on names or anything like that but out of interest, is that something that Mr. Moloney is aware has occurred?</p></speech>

That would be like any other employee-employer disciplinary process.  It would, by and large, be considered confidential to the people involved.</p></speech>

In terms of the ministerial-senior official relationship, does Mr. Moloney think that the concepts of accountability and responsibility and the differences between them are well clarified?  Does he think that is clearly laid out or does he think there needs to be further clarification?</p></speech>

There is the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Public Service Management Act and the Civil Service Regulation Act.  Then of course there are the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer, which operate almost as a separate pillar.  The role is therefore a complex one.  It is capable of causing some confusion, particularly in terms of the interaction between the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Public Service Management Act.  At a general level, Secretaries General are responsible for running their Department but a Minister of the Government might be forgiven for thinking that they were able to take decisions in relation to the day-to-day operation of a Department.  The two Acts need to come together in that context.  There is a level of complexity involved and that is something that we can always review.  The international experience is that these same issues are grappled with.  The OECD material underlines the idea that these issues are grappled with across many jurisdictions.  Greater clarity is always possible but specific functions are set out in the different items of legislation.  It is in the implementation of those functions that there is sometimes the potential for misunderstanding what is or is not allowable.</p></speech>

They are selected by the D&aacute;il and they can be deselected by it.  The concept of responsibility implies a direct personal involvement in a decision or an action with accompanying credit or blame.  The Carltona doctrine then allows many actions to be taken in the name of the Minister, some of which I imagine they may be completely unaware of, given everything that happens in a Department.  There could be a situation where the Minister would have to go before the D&aacute;il or a committee like this one and can be held accountable in that way.  Would it be fair to say that this could result in a situation where if things go right, even if it is because of the officials, that the Minister can get credit for that?  By the same score, if things go wrong, and again the Minister might be unaware of this, could the Minister be held responsible in the same sense because of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00700"><p>There are big differences between the level of political accountability and scrutiny in terms of the Oireachtas and electorate compared to the administrative accountability, which is more in the nature of a different employment relationship and a more standard employment type of relationship.  Fundamentally, Ministers are responsible for the operation of their Departments under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That overall level of responsibility is quite comprehensive and places quite a deal of accountability and responsibility on them.  The ideal operation of the Public Service Management Act was to in some ways try to lighten that load by referring to the Secretaries General.  It does that by saying that if something very basic goes wrong in the operation of a Department, for example, if somebody trips on the stairs, then it is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  This is the day-to-day operation of the Department.  The challenge, then, is where that line is drawn.  When does it become the responsibility of the Minister and when is it that of the Secretary General?  I do not think that there will be a one-size-fits-all.  That is where the OECD talks about building up a relationship of trust and an open dialogue between the administrative and political levels in order that there can be a shared understanding of where the responsibilities lie.  I think the principles are sound in their own way.  It is right that the Secretaries General are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their Department.  It is probably in many cases an unreasonable burden to expect a Minister to account for that.  On the other hand, there is political responsibility under the Constitution and under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  A similar thing happens within the Departments.  I spoke in my opening statement about the framework of responsibilities.  I can delegate the responsibility within my Department down to principal officer level through a framework of assignments.  Even as I delegate responsibility in particular areas, however, I remain responsible as Secretary General for those areas.  There is that balance because you are the head of the Department, political or administrative, so you retain some responsibility for what goes on there.</p></speech>

We discussed the idea that there could be a need for clarification and that things could be looked at to make matters a bit clearer.  Has there ever been consideration given to amending the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Public Service Management Act whereby the relationship could be clarified in relation to all those issues we were speaking about?  Is Mr. Moloney is aware that there has ever been a look to do that in a serious and comprehensive manner?</p></speech>

The committee produced a report earlier this year in relation to certain senior pay issues.  The Minister set up an independent review panel that will look at many relevant issues.  It is chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and is on senior pay and remuneration.</p> <p>  The interaction between the kinds of accountability issues that the Deputy raises, the method and the ways and means by which senior civil servants are appointed and remunerated are an interlinked set of issues.  To substantively restructure them would require a root-and-branch look at the three blocks of legislation, namely, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Public Service Management Act and the Civil Service Regulation Act.  Those are the three blocks of legislation that determine the different pieces of that.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to how the three come together.  That is a set of issues that we are looking at.  We have not made proposals at this stage.  At this stage, we will probably await the finalisation of the independent review panel to do so but we are aware of the conversations that have gone on before committees and we are aware of the issues that have been raised in relation to it.  We are happy to consider that and in due course to bring forward proposals to the Minister in relation to them.  The only issue is that it would be quite a significant exercise.  The reality is that the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the constitutional provisions are fairly fundamental building blocks for how governmental authority is structured.  Moving to amend that in any significant way would potentially make a very fundamental difference.  </p></speech>

There has not been a huge amount of academic research done on this interesting topic and it might merit research.</p> <p>  The traditional system of accountability is that civil servants are accountable to their superiors and, ultimately, to the Minister and then the Minister is accountable to the D&aacute;il and obviously to the Taoiseach.  Has that changed in recent years?  Are there other bodies to whom civil servants are accountable now? </p></speech>

A lot of the legislation that sets out the accountability has been unchanged for quite a while and some of it dates back quite far.  The one change that I could identify relates to the level of accountability, this idea of the appropriate authority as being the person who can impose the most severe of sanctions.  That used to be only the Minister and a Department and now for a principal officer it is the Secretary General and for a principal officer and the Assistant Secretary it is the Minister, with the Government being the appropriate authority only for the Secretary General.  There has been some slight change in that.  In terms of the line management responsibility for the day-to-day performance management regarding the Accounting Officer role, those are very well established roles.</p></speech>

I suppose that is a different form of accountability that civil servants have now that probably would not have been as frequent 30 or 40 years ago.  Would it?</p></speech>

Yes, I think that there is a greater engagement.  There is greater engagement with committees.  There is probably a greater number of committees now as well so there is much greater openness to scrutiny.</p></speech>

In terms of the spread of Civil Service accountability, under the Freedom of Information Act people within the Civil Service have a direct responsibility to citizens who apply for documents.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

It is very much so.  Across the range of our activities, since the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was established there has been a range of legislation which is really about openness and accountability of Government, including whistleblowing, lobbying, freedom of information, the establishment of an ombudsman and the extension of his remit.  All of those things are things that civil servants engage with on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>

Can civil servants sometimes find themselves in a position where their interests or obligations for accountability and the interests of a Minister may not necessarily align?  Does that pose difficulties for the civil servant?</p></speech>

The one place that has been identified as, potentially, giving rise to a conflict has always between the role of Secretary General and the role of Accounting Officer.  When the Mullarkey Report, which dates back to the early 2000s, looked at that issue it suggested a process that could be adopted if a conflict arose between a Secretary General and what he or she perceived to be his or her role as Accounting Officer.  Other than that, given that our job is to advise on policy and then implement the policy, I would not think that those conflicts would arise.</p></speech>

Obviously media is more fluid than it was and there is greater attention paid to various public conversations.  Freedom of information has supported a huge increase in the amount of information that is available to a broader variety of people and that has given rise to discussions that are possible now that would not have been possible 20 years ago.  Those discussions have, increasingly, involved what advice that civil servants have or have not offered.  So that has become part of the general discussion and, in many ways, that is a sign of increased openness and transparency.  It is probably a risk that needs to be managed about confusing the roles of civil servants, who are there to implement policy, and Governments, which are there to make it.  In the main, we are aware of and seek to manage that risk.</p></speech>

If one looks at how political controversy can develop, people can gain access to advice, through the freedom of information process, that gets into the public domain, the Minister then says, "I am following the advice that I was given", the advice is then questioned and at that stage civil servants do, it seems to me, end up at the centre of the public issue.  Is that good or bad?  Is it something that we must go along with as a fact of life?</p></speech>

We need to also be aware of the risks that might be inherent in a public discourse that discouraged the collecting together of relevant policy, evidence and advice.</p></speech>

I am conscious that if we were having this discussion here, and we probably would not have this discussion here 40 or 50 years ago, but 40 or 50 years ago I would have thought that very few senior civil servants would have been publicly well known whereas now quite a few of them are.  How much in the public eye does the Secretary General think an effective Secretary General or civil servant should be?</p></speech>

Even if one looks over at what is happening in the United Kingdom now there seems to be an acceptance that when a new political regime comes in that they may want to change civil servants.  Fortunately, that is something that we have not really had in Ireland as of yet.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

That is not part of the legislative and administrative context in which senior public servants are appointed.  They are appointed for the Government by the Government for a seven-year term, which is traditionally extended by three years.  Those are the parameters within which we work so that is obviously not tied into an electoral cycle or change of Government.  The expectation is that we will impartially and objectively advise on and implement Government policy regardless.</p></speech>

It is my first time here.</p> <p>  Could I return to something Mr. Moloney said to my colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  It related to the disciplinary options open to a Minister and written warnings.  I fully accept that I may have picked up Mr. Moloney incorrectly.  If I did, he should please tell me.  At the beginning of this conversation, he said that when he was in front of committees, with the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts, he was the voice of the Minister.  He said he almost has a dual reporting function, reporting on the one hand to the Minister and on the other hand to the Oireachtas.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

Implementing the policies of the Minister in the Department is a Secretary General role.  I report to the Minister, and the appropriate authority is the Government.  With regard to the Accounting Officer function, which entails a separate body of legislation, I report in a personal capacity.  I cannot delegate that function.  It is separate from my duty in respect of the Minister.  I report to the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Comptroller and Auditor General audits.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Moloney subject to two separate disciplinary systems?  I refer to actions such as written warnings and the removal of allowances.  Are there two parallel systems?</p></speech>

Accountability to the Oireachtas is structured such that the Comptroller and Auditor General produces a value-for-money report or audit report.  I get questioned on that at an appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee then reports to the D&aacute;il on it.  That is the process.  There is not really a Civil Service disciplinary process associated with that.</p></speech>

The Civil Service disciplinary code sets out a multistage process.  The reality of an issue that would arise between the head of a Department, namely, a Secretary General, and the Minister is very different.  One could think about it as being the same as a conflict between a chief executive officer and a board.  It is a more complex issue than other disciplinary issues within an organisation.  The way in which the Government would seek to discharge its powers in relation to this as the appropriate authority would really depend on the case and its circumstances.  The Mullarkey report considered in passing whether a more structured approach would be beneficial and more or less came down against it in the sense that the benefits would not outweigh-----</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that there are some limitations and constraints concerning what the Government is allowed to do in such cases.  There is, of course, the constitutional right to fair procedure.  There are employment laws that may be relevant, although not all employment law applies to Secretaries General.  There is the need for process.  Given the seniority involved and the circumstances, it would probably require a bespoke response.</p></speech>

That is probably the correct term to use.</p> <p>  Mr. Moloney referred to the Rafter report and the Mulcahy report.  The accountability of Secretaries General was reviewed in 2002 by a working group.  The report pointed out the potential of bringing Secretaries General within the remit of the existing disciplinary process, a move that would require legislation.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of any legislation in that regard that is to be introduced or that is even being drafted?</p></speech>

First, there was legislation in 2005 that effectively expanded the remit of the disciplinary process we have been talking about to Secretaries General.  That was the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act.  It effectively brought Secretaries General into the net.  The extent to which they are in the net is limited in the way I discussed with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell because the nature of the appointment by the Government precludes certain of the steps.  We are currently examining the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act in terms of how we see disciplinary matters working broadly within the Civil Service.  I do not believe we specifically intend for it to address Secretaries General at this point.</p></speech>

Let me refer to other jurisdictions, as referred to by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  In the United States, for example, Ministers can dismiss senior officials within the limits set down by a certain law that is in place.  In Canada, the Prime Minister appoints those in the two most senior levels of officials and has the power to remove or dismiss them.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of whether this was ever considered in any of the reviews of the legislation or in respect of potential legislative changes that are needed?</p></speech>

The Mullarkey report was a couple of years later.  There was also the Rafter report, which I discussed with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  All of these things do arise.  In effect, the arrangements remain as set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, the Civil Service Regulation Act 1924 and subsequent measures.  The decision, as expressed in legislation, is that the appropriate authority is the Government.  In other jurisdictions, it can be the Prime Minister or equivalent of the Minister for Finance.  In our neighbouring jurisdiction, as I understand it from recent events, it is the Cabinet Secretary.  There are different models; it is just that the OECD work does not necessarily point to one ideal solution.  The legislative model we have used this as I have described.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is considering amending and consolidating Acts that date back to the mid-1940s.  I refer to really historical Acts.  In Mr. Moloney's experience, does he believe there is a better way to do this?  Does he believe the current system is working?  If we have had so many reports, reviews and amendments of various Acts, is the arrangement fit for purpose at this point?</p></speech>

As I said, there does not appear to be an obvious right answer in terms of the OECD, legislation and so on.  What the OECD points to as the solution is more in the nature of culture and values and of a co-operative arrangement and relationship of trust between the heads of the Civil Service and their respective Ministers and the Government as a whole.</p><p>It is very hard to create a policy or legislative solution that tries to bridge any gap there.</p></speech>

I appreciate his coming in.  Along with many Deputies and Senators, I am certainly interested in this topic from the point of view of improving the system.  There is no other motive behind it.  The opening statement refers to the 1924 Act.  Under section 17 of the 1956 Act, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions including: the regulation and control of the Civil Service; classification and reclassification; numbers; remuneration of civil servants; and fixing the terms and conditions.  That might be the case at a very senior management level, but the workings behind that are carried out by the officials.  In general, the officials in each Department would recommend the range of responsibilities and functions.  The classification and reclassification would be a matter for negotiation with the unions.  The conditions governing the promotion of civil servants are part of the normal process within a company or business.  The general level of activity on all of these issues is part and parcel of everyday stuff in the Civil Service.  The Minister would act in those areas on instruction or recommendation from his or her Secretary General.  Is that not generally how it functions?</p></speech>

Any of those day-to-day decisions are taken within a policy and legislative context.  In effect regulations inform recruitment, promotion, the Civil Service disciplinary process, bullying and harassment legislation.  There is a significant policy context within which any day-to-day decision is made.  Of course, the Minister is fundamental to setting in place that policy context.  Once that happens, the day-to-day operation of that is taken forward on his or her behalf by civil servants or public servants.</p></speech>

Many other strands come together to work in the interest of the Department.  That is the only point I am making on that.</p> <p>  Is there a need for a Secretary General and a Department that would be in control of the overall performance of Secretaries General?  Therefore, there would be a boss, one Secretary General, who would deal with complaints and other stuff that normally arises in the management of a big entity like the State because that is not the case today.  A Secretary General appeared before this committee and explained that there really is no boss because each Department is structured in such a way that the boss is the Secretary General or the Minister, depending on what is going on.  However, there is no layer above Secretaries General to pull them in line should they depart for any reason.</p></speech>

The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 makes the Minister for Finance responsible for the Civil Service.  That has changed a few times.  It became the Minister for the Public Service at one point, back to the Minister for Finance and now it is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act is fundamental to the Chairman's question because it places the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the person politically responsible for the regulation and control of all the Civil Service and all that flows from that.</p> <p>  We also need to bear in mind the point about the appropriate authority.  The Government is the appropriate authority for the Secretaries General.  That is also set out in the Civil Service Regulation Act.  The statutory provisions we have there set out a large and significant role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but there is also a role for the Government as a whole.  One of the changes made since 1924 is exactly the one the Chairman mentioned, which is that the responsibility for employing people is no longer a central responsibility but is now within the remit of individual Departments.  A set of responsibilities goes up from individual Departments to Ministers and then, of course, Government has a collective responsibility.  I suppose that is-----</p></speech>

There definitely people are whose employment has been terminated.  It is not the objective of the Civil Service disciplinary code or the performance management process to sack people.  The objective is to work with them and to make sure they are fit for purpose but there are severe breaches of trust.  There have been issues.  The most obvious thing to think about would be theft.  If someone was found guilty of a criminal offence, or misused their position in some way, these are very severe things for which people have faced termination.</p></speech>

As for some of these reports on protecting taxpayers' money and getting greater efficiency in terms of the spend, I will not say they have been ignored because somebody obviously has read them but in terms of the extent of change demanded, very little change is seen in the mechanisms there to guard loss of money or efficiency.  There are many examples over the years.  How much input does a Minister have into those reports?  In Mr. Moloney's case, it a question of the reports being read and that is the extent of it?  I have not seen any major change in my time here on the Committee of Public Accounts or other committees that would lead me to believe there was a mechanism in place that fully looked at these reports with a view to making the changes that might be necessary.</p></speech>

The Department says whether it accepts, does not accept or partially accepts the recommendation and gives some indication of what action will be taken.  There is quite detailed consideration and the final part of the process is a minute signed on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is put to him for approval.</p></speech>

Going back to the second page in Mr. Moloney's submission, the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees are said to examine various aspects of a Department's work, make recommendations to either the line committee of the Department, or in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which would then send these to the relevant Department, which comes back with the recommendations or a rebuttal of the points that were made.  The Committee of Public Accounts then gets a minute on that, as the Secretary General noted.  I have read many of those reports and have looked at the recommendations.  Very few recommendations are taken on board by the Department, in spite of the fact that a considerable amount of money could have been wasted.  Procurement or administration of one kind or another could have gone wrong and it just goes on like that.  It seems to be a process with lip service to the Committee of Public Accounts but no real analysis of what is required, or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not forcing the Department at fault to question itself enough to bring about the necessary reform so that the issue will not arise again.</p></speech>

From where I sit, I would say there has been significant structural and behavioural change in the last decade.  That is not to say there cannot be more and there are not other issues that need to be progressed further.  Certainly the recommendations to the Committee for Public Accounts are taken very seriously.  There is a reluctance to not accept them.</p></speech>

There is a huge volume of recommendations made through various reports, that have, by and large, been ignored.  I have often asked this committee how many recommendations through all of the reports were made and how many of those were actually accepted.  It would be a very worthwhile piece of work to do to find out.  It tells you a lot about Departments if you take the time, as I do, to see how it all functions.  My interest is not to catch anyone out but to understand why the Committee of Public Accounts is still in business.  The overriding desire should be to put it out of business because we have such an efficient operation that very little will happen.  I see the waste and very little scrutiny in terms of the public accounts side of the work at local government level.  Even though there might be local audit committees, they do not function in the way I would expect them to function from a business perspective.  I can name many outstanding pieces of work of complaint that just rest there.  There is a resistance either within local government or the broader Civil Service to having one master audit committee that is a Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with local government and with every other aspect of government.  There is a resistance to that.  I wonder about the resistance to change right across the different Departments.  Changes are happening slowly but in terms of the vast amounts of money Departments are now spending, there should be a far greater drive at that level to get the necessary change and to drive it down through the Civil Service structure itself.</p></speech>

They take the recommendations very seriously and are very reluctant to not accept them.  Constant improvement is what we all seek and I am not suggesting this is not possible.  The Civil Service now is not recognisable from that of ten to 20 years ago.  We have a National Shared Services Office, we have increasing ICT-----</p></speech>

I see a huge effort being made in businesses big and small to ensure IT and reporting are up to scratch and that change can happen immediately.  You just have to take the HSE, the Department of Finance and you find there is little or no IT infrastructure there to record the necessary financial reports and outputs from all of the various sections.  That would not happen in business and if it did, that business would not be in business for very long.  I do not see that type of real step change being made in big Departments and that really concerns me.  Before I go away from that, I have one more comment on the reports that come through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and are channelled to the different Departments, with the minute then being channelled back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>Would it be a worthwhile exercise to look at the various reports from the Committee of Public Accounts going to the various different Departments and do an exercise to find out how many recommendations were accepted, how many were totally rejected and how many were partially acted on?  That would be a worthwhile exercise and would give some sort of insight into how it all operates.</p><p> Will Mr. Moloney explain the recruitment process at senior level?  That is a public process.  It is a process that tries to attract others within the Civil Service to come forward.  There is a public end of it to try and get people from the private sector in.  How many private sector people have been employed within the Civil Service in the past ten years at that level?</p></speech>

One would often see people who worked previously for the HSE or previously for a Department and they are given a job to review something or other or to create a report on some issue or other.  Does the Civil Service reach beyond that?  Are there independent bodies out there that can be used to give a greater indication to the public that there is a drive here for greater transparency?  I am not questioning the credentials of these people.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are appointed by the relevant Minister or Government or both to the position.  That is a question of trying to look around and see who is available with an expertise in any particular area.  For State bodies, we have a State bodies appointments process now.  There is a greater degree of transparency, hosted by the PAS, in relation to that.  However, we are a relatively small country.  By the time one is looking for something, a relatively particular piece of expertise and independence in that, there generally are not a large number of experts available.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, it is difficult to measure yourself against other countries.  What we normally do is look to the OECD or other international organisations that undertake comparisons of how countries operate in particular ways.  It is often difficult to see into the detail of that, for instance, other countries, other cultures, other systems.</p></speech>

Our ranking on the traditional public service values indicator, that is, on independence, freedom from bribery and corruption, transparency of liability and administrative fairness, has been well above the EU average with Ireland ranking sixth of the EU 28 in this indicator in 2020.  To the extent that there are data, in terms of these surveys which are only surveys, the data are positive about the operation and the integrity of our civil administration.  That is not to say that there are not ideas there that we could bring in and use, and we engage with the OECD and others in relation to that.</p></speech>

I refer to the outsourcing of parts of the work of a Department or an agency where, let us say, citizens information or some other organisation like that is created.  Is that happening widely now in the organisation where there is a certain shedding of different responsibilities and they are being farmed out with new agencies being created?  The big example would be the Department and the HSE.  It can come down to much smaller agencies.  Is that a big change in the organisation?</p></speech>

If one is thinking about our new agencies being created, the Oireachtas created two new agencies.  It has created one, in terms of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and will, if it has not already, create a media commission.  They are two areas where it is felt that is the best way of delivering on the ambitions in those areas.</p><p>There has been great growth in both of those areas in the Irish context with the offshore renewable ambitions for the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and the prevalence of particular types of companies in the Irish industrial landscape for the media commission.  Those are two areas where new agencies are being created.</p><p> In other areas, the administration of some services can be achieved through partial outsourcing but that only happens where the existing administration is incapable of fulfilling what needs to be done.  Overall, we address different challenges in different ways.  We have changed organisational arrangements and used different ways of delivery over time.  Obviously Revenue is an example.  The Chairman earlier mentioned ICT and I agree that the future of the Civil Service and public service requires a shift towards ICT.  That is reflected in the Civil Service renewal plan.  There is an idea for 24-7 public service delivery by 2030 and that sort of thing, and there are EU targets in that regard.  We are mindful of those issues.  We are open-minded about how to deliver on some of those issues.</p></speech>

IT is essential to do that.  In such a case, does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get involved by telling the line Department we are not getting anywhere, we need greater transparency and accountability in respect of where the money is going and how we can improve on the structures and the big-spending Department does not have the appropriate IT systems.  Those systems might be too old and do not speak to each other.  Would the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get involved in that type of action with a Department?  Does it conduct a critical analysis of these big Departments in respect of how they are controlling everything?</p></speech>

It provides advice and a resource to Departments that want to achieve ICT transformation.  It has relationships with the chief information officers in most Departments.  There is a network of people who share best practice and link in with each other.  We would have traditionally taken an active role in trying to support those types of projects.  The Chairman earlier mentioned the HSE IT and financial management system.  We have become involved in groups trying to push that forward.  We facilitate to the extent we can from the centre of those projects.  However, at the end of the day, the organisations themselves must deliver.</p></speech>

Considering the amount of money the HSE spends, is it not essential for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to demand the type of IT infrastructure that would give the managers in the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the necessary information?  I attended a trade fair when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce.  There are companies that excel in that area around the world and yet we do not seem to be able to get to grips with the provision of technological advancement to an extent that would allow us to say it is all working.</p> <p>  I attended the opening of a wing in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  It has single rooms and state-of-the-art technology which tells the medical professionals everything about the patients.  We need to get to the point where we are getting all of the information from the likes of the HSE or any big-spending Department.  What is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard.  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get annoyed with Departments that do not deliver with the efficiency or speed it would expect, given the money they are controlling?  Surely Accounting Officers across the board would want to have those systems in place so they could stand over whatever happened, what went wrong and right, and so on.  Mr. Moloney can tell me I am wrong if I am, but it seems that certain bodies within the Civil Service are very slow and we do not achieve levels of efficiency as quickly as we should.  If there was a single manager for all these Departments, I would be asking him or her what is going on in the Department and why is something not happening.  Those managers could be moved on if they were unable to deliver.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerned about the weaknesses around the financial reporting that is now necessary in respect of these big sums of money?</p></speech>

The Department has a large and active interest in the development of appropriate ICT, both financial and broader, across the Civil Service and public service.  It is the only way to effectively deliver cost-effective and impactful services.  That is very much at the core of the Civil Service renewal strategy, which we are driving.  We have a digital leaders group, which is chaired by the Government chief information officer, whose office is a division of our Department.  We play an active role in encouraging and exchanging best practice.  In respect of finances, we support different ICT projects.  However, it comes back to the reality we spoke about earlier in respect of where responsibility lies and who the decision-makers are.  The decision-makers, as is set out in different pieces of legislation, are either the Department or the agency involved.  We cajole, oversee, encourage, support where we can, and provide advice, networks and best practice.  Our role is in that sphere.</p></speech>

In big organisations, one sometimes has to take steps to make sure the organisation is moving in the desired direction.  It sometimes takes an intervention far greater than just cajoling.  I would have thought there would be competition among civil servants to make their Departments the key players or the models to follow.  I do not get the impression that is the case.</p> <p>  I am trying to examine the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would have thought its role would be far more authoritative and that it would if not dictate, force through the agenda of change and technological transformation in each area.  I do not see the same pace of change everywhere.  I would have thought the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would insist on that pace of change so that those different Departments and agencies were reporting on all fronts, including financial and administrative, and in respect their governance role, which is also important.  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

That is absolutely right.  We are central to driving forward transformation in ICT.  That is fundamental to the Civil Service renewal plan.  It is one of the key roles of the Government chief information officer.  The point I made was that the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the Departments remains fundamentally a matter for the Minister, Secretary General or Accounting Officer of individual Departments.</p></speech>

I ask members joining on MS Teams to mute their microphones when not making a contribution and to use the raise hand function to indicate.  All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protection against the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Today we are considering the implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality generally.  I warmly welcome the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and thank him for giving his time to join the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  We are conscious of the demands on his time and are grateful to him for attending.  I also welcome the officials accompanying the Taoiseach, Ms Elizabeth Canavan, assistant secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Barry Vaughan, principal officer at the Department of the Taoiseach, and Ms Jane Anne Duffy, principal officer at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable. </p> <p>  Before I invite the Taoiseach to give his opening statement, I note we have been working on the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality for the past few months.  We are grateful to the citizens for all of the work they put in and to Dr. Catherine Day and her team for chairing the assembly.  Our work is focused on the practical implementation of the recommendations.  We will hold a number of public hearings over the next two to three weeks and will then hold private meetings to deliberate on our final report which we hope to present to the Taoiseach and the Government by the start of December.</p> <p>  I now invite the Taoiseach to give his opening statement before opening the floor to members for questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation and am delighted to take up the opportunity.</p> <p>  Gender equality is a key priority for this Government and if we are to make meaningful advances in gender equality, it will require a broad and inclusive approach.  The catalyst for inviting me today is of course the admirable work carried out by the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and the subsequent report and associated recommendations on this issue, guided by the excellent chairing of Dr. Catherine Day, whom I would like to acknowledge and thank.</p> <p>  The report is a comprehensive assessment of the issues at play in considering gender equality across multiple domains including constitutional change; care; social protection; leadership in politics, public life and the workplace; norms, stereotypes and education; pay and workplace conditions; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and gender equality in law and policy.  As the committee is aware, these are all complex areas and I will not be able to cover all relevant developments in each of them, but I will highlight some of the advances that have been made in specific issues of concern.</p> <p>  One important issue the citizens' assembly report called attention to is the need to facilitate women to participate and assume leadership positions in politics, public life and the workplace.  It is incumbent on the Government, and indeed all of us in politics, within our parties or groups, to do our utmost to ensure women do not face unnecessary barriers to their full participation.  In negotiating and agreeing the current programme for Government, this was an important issue for all three parties.  In the programme for Government, we pledged, among other things, to empower local authorities to encourage improved gender and ethnic mix in local elections; require local authorities to be more flexible with meeting times and to use remote working technologies and flexible work practices to support councillors with parenting or caring responsibilities, including childcare, and reduce travel times and absences from work; and examine further mechanisms informed by international best practice to encourage political parties to select more women for the 2024 local elections.  As we approach the half way point in this Government&rsquo;s mandate we are making good progress in this area.</p> <p>  The Government has published the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to transpose the remaining elements of the EU work-life balance directive including a right to request flexible working within the terms of the directive and an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes.  This legislation will also fulfil a long-standing Government commitment to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts to two years.</p> <p>  In addition, earlier this year, the Government gave approval to draft a general scheme to grant an entitlement of maternity leave to councillors.  The scheme offers the choice to appoint an individual as a temporary substitute in the place of a councillor who takes a period of maternity-related absence or is absent due to illness.  We know female councillors have felt pressure to turn up to important votes or debates, when they needed to be at home caring for a new baby.  It is not credible maternity leave if you cannot fully switch off from your work.</p> <p>  An extension in July this year has brought the entitlement to parent's leave and benefit to seven weeks for each eligible parent to be taken within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life or adoptive placement.  The Government has also committed to introducing domestic violence leave.  This leave will create a valuable support for victims of domestic violence to take the time they need to access supports and to maintain their employment.</p> <p>  Another initiative we have brought forward, which has good potential in terms of building capacity and encouraging more women into public life, is the All Island Women&rsquo;s Forum established with the support of the shared island unit I established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I want to acknowledge and thank the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland for its active support in making that happen and in making it the catalyst I am certain it can be.  Indeed, it has also been an important partner in our work on improving female participation in the 2024 local elections and in our free contraception initiative.</p> <p>  Another important area addressed within the citizens&rsquo; assembly report was on childcare and workers in the sector; more specifically, making the former more affordable and improving the terms and conditions of the latter.  Four years ago, annual State investment in early learning and childcare stood at &euro;485 million.</p><p>Just three weeks ago, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, announced that budget 2023 would allocate &euro;1.025 billion to early learning and childcare.</p><p> The fact that the target of spending &euro;1 billion on this area by 2028 was exceeded five years ahead of schedule is a demonstration, I hope, of the value this Government places on early learning and childcare and a recognition of the benefits it confers to children and their families, society and the economy.</p><p> On 15 September 2022, the first ever employment regulation orders for the early years services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the early years services sector.  The orders are supported by our core funding scheme, which commenced on 15 September this year and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freezing parental fees.  It is estimated that almost three quarters of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the employment regulation orders, with the wages of half of all employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more and the wages of 20% of employees expected to rise by 20% or more.  It is interesting that those involved in social partnership and the social partners see the development of the employment regulation orders as one of the most significant things to happen in recent times in respect of childcare, in particular, and standards of conditions in childcare.</p><p> While no single one of these initiatives will deal with all the issues, cumulatively they amount to tangible and meaningful progress.  As the committee knows, another important aspect of the citizens&rsquo; assembly was examining the gender equality principle in law and policy.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is currently undertaking a review of the equality Acts.  This review aims to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combating discrimination and promoting equality.  I know the committee has been actively engaged on the citizens&rsquo; assembly recommendations for constitutional change.  This is a complex area and the position paper developed by this committee as part of its interim report is very welcome and will help to inform the development of Government proposals in partnership with the Oireachtas.  I know the specific proposals are being considered by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, at present and all the various complexities notwithstanding the Government is committed to holding a referendum on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p> This Government is also genuinely committed to advancing measures that assist in developing and promoting gender equality through the kinds of measures and reforms I have mentioned in this brief statement.  There is much more to talk about in the wide-ranging citizens&rsquo; assembly report and I hope that we can explore some of the issues more fully now in our discussion.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p></speech>

Thank you for the opening statement.  A number of colleagues have already indicated and I see many more.  In order to facilitate everyone getting in in the time available, exchanges will be limited to six minutes per question and answer.  I ask everyone to adhere to that.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach commit to holding a referendum on Article 41, but the committee recommended in its interim report that a referendum be held in 2023, next year, to give effect to recommendations Nos. 1 to 3.  Colleagues may wish to explore that issue further with him.  We will certainly be returning to it in our final report.</p> <p>  The colleagues who indicated first were Deputy Cronin, Senator Warfield and Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  After that, I will call Deputies Hourigan, Cannon, Carroll MacNeill, McAuliffe and Clarke.</p></speech>

I welcome the Taoiseach to our committee.  The Taoiseach's Department is responsible for the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence implementation plan.  That is a whole-of-government approach across Secretaries General and there is meant to be a dedicated secretariat in the Taoiseach's Department.  Last week, we raised the proof aspect of domestic violence leave with IBEC and SIPTU.  Is the Taoiseach in favour of it?  If he is not, why did the Minister responsible for equality, Deputy O'Gorman, have in his report that employers should retain the request for reasonable proof?  Who defines "reasonable"?  What defines "proof"?  How do you define a psychological injury?  Is it two points for a bruise or four points for breaking the skin?  I feel sick even talking like that because it is sick that we would expect a woman or man who has suffered domestic violence to provide proof for the paltry five days that is being proposed.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach is over a Government that is dealing with legacy issues on how this State has treated women.  It brings us back to the dark days when women had to suffer extra social scrutiny about whether they could be trusted or not.  I am deeply uncomfortable with the proof aspect.  I will be talking on the work-life balance Bill this afternoon and I know this has not made it into the Bill.  I believe it is the Minister's intention to introduce it on Committee Stage.  I hope that after the reaction IBEC got last week, that will not happen.  I would like the Taoiseach's comments on that matter.</p></speech>

We want to arrive at conclusions that are in the best interests of women, particularly in the application of this.  It is not the intention to require proof.  As I said to the Deputy's colleague yesterday in the D&aacute;il, when a woman or man comes forward to an employer in respect of seeking domestic violence leave, it is not a cross-examination they require; it is consideration, help, assistance and the provision of the leave.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be tendering for expert advice to come forward to create templates and provide guidance for employers on how to deal with this.  This is about culture and people being properly equipped to deal with situations like this, which will emerge.  It is groundbreaking that we are bringing in domestic violence leave.  It is the first time any Government has ever done this.  That in itself is a positive; that is the way I would approach this.  It is not the Government's view that the victim would be required to provide proof of domestic violence when availing of the leave.  I cannot be clearer than that.  I discussed this with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth before this meeting.</p></speech>

It was the Minister, Deputy Harris, I think, who took the initiative in respect of the third level sector regarding the ten-day leave.  These matters are kept under review.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth looked internationally at how this has worked out in different jurisdictions.  The average sought in Australia was three days, as it turned out.  As I said, this is the first time this measure has been introduced.  It is important we get it through and I have no doubt we will do so.  The facility will always be there to extend that, as it is for various provisions.  It is open to employers and State employers to go beyond the five days as part of the policy of any given employer.  That is what has happened in the third level sector.</p></speech>

It is essentially Government policy, given that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has written to all universities asking them to introduce ten days paid leave for victims and survivors of domestic abuse.  The main universities have agreed to that.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill in 2018 that had ten days statutory leave.  Statutory leave in the North of Ireland is ten days leave.  It was initiated by Green Party MLAs and that is now law in the North.  Surely we should harmonise our all-island policy and introduce ten days leave in legislation, as the Taoiseach's party proposed in 2018.</p></speech>

We are providing in law for a statutory minimum domestic violence leave of five days.  There is a two-year review in the legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has gone ahead already in terms of third level and said ten days.  It is open to employers to go beyond the statutory minimum.  As I say, when this goes into the Oireachtas, the Minister will take on board the views of Members of the Oireachtas and we will take it from there.</p> <p>  It is a good measure to bring this in.  The international evidence is showing, as I said, so far, in terms of what the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have looked at, that three days was the norm in Australia.  Five days is being provided as a statutory minimum in legislation.</p> <p>  There will be a need for cultural changes.  We can see that in some of the submissions that have been made and that have been referenced, in terms of the IBEC submission etc., and that of the Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, and others.  Clearly, there needs to be further work done in terms of the broader issue and in ensuring that this is brought through in all sectors and accelerated without any resistance, opposition or misguided ideas around it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will appreciate there is some frustration among women and people who have been campaigning for this referendum to take place at the delays that have faced that referendum.  We have provided the Taoiseach with an interim report for the purpose of getting on with the matter as quickly as possible.  Can the Taoiseach give us a commitment that it will come to Cabinet in the coming weeks and that we can have a referendum in 2023, as the committee's interim report called for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#C00300"><p>My understanding was that the committee must do a full report on the constitutional position and the Government would obviously await the fuller consideration by this committee.  I put this out there, as I spoke to the Chair beforehand.  My experience of the eighth amendment is that the Oireachtas committee looked at that specific recommendation from a citizens' assembly, amended it to a certain extent within the committee, did not have unanimity in the committee, but a majority of the committee was able to vote positively for the formula of words that eventually became the proposition that was put to the people and one had a degree of Oireachtas support around it.</p> <p>  My preference would be that one would have as great a degree of Oireachtas consensus as possible around the wording on this.  That could be achieved through this committee because I understand the committee has some further work.  I have looked at the interim report and that tells me it is complex.  Personally, the more simply we keep it, the better.  From a constitutional perspective, we must be mindful of existing jurisprudence on these issues.  There are two fundamental ways of evolving a constitution: through judicial interpretation, which has been one of the more radical features of the Constitution since 1937, which is understated but which has been the great revolution in terms of evolving constitutional rights; and amendment by the people in the form of a referendum.  My understanding is the committee's work may be completed by the end of the year.  Therefore, if the committee can bring a definitive conclusion and certainty from a constitutional perspective to the proposals, the Government would be anxious to progress this in 2023.</p> <p>  I am reluctant to give a specific timeline.  There are a number of elements to this.  We must get it right, but also we must give time to the Referendum Commission.  Historically, the Referendum Commission gets annoyed when it is shoehorned into a particular narrow timeframe.  It has obligations, in terms of timelines in presenting the proposals and giving full information to the people.  That is the only qualification I would put in.</p> <p>  I would be anxious to get on with it as quickly as we possibly can.  Various Oireachtas committees have looked at this in the past and it has not been proceeded with.</p></speech>

Others will pick up on that.</p> <p>  It is not a question, but a comment.  I commend the Taoiseach on the important interventions he has made around transgender rights and empathy for trans folks.  I welcome those.  I thank the Taoiseach for them.  I remind the Taoiseach that trans citizens and residents still travel abroad, for instance, to Poland, for healthcare and our 16 and 17-year-olds are still waiting for recognition.</p></speech>

It was a unique time because it was during the pandemic.  Much of the work took place online.  We have heard from some of those who were involved in it and that gave a good footing for this committee.</p> <p>  Something that surprised many people was the amount of references there are to care in this Citizens' Assembly report and in the recommendations.  Prior to the pandemic, people would not have recognised that importance of well-being, possibly to the extent that this Citizens' Assembly did.</p> <p>  It is important to point out in relation to recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive, that this is a different referendum from the referendums that were being spoken about previously and it is not a case that people have been waiting for this referendum and now we have to get on with it.  Previously, it was removing reference to the place of a woman in the home whereas now it is about putting into the Constitution a reference to the importance of care work.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that.  The Green Party was probably the only party that did not want to see the reference removed in its entirety, but wanted it changed to be something that was more reflective of the caring nature and value of the work done by women and men and those of all genders in the home and changed to be something which did not leave all of the caring responsibilities with one particular gender.</p> <p>  The other point that I wanted to raise with the Taoiseach is the question of leadership, which we have discussed in detail in this committee and had excellent witnesses before us.  With quotas, we have not seen a change in the numbers of women being elected.  I have a deep concern that some of the parties are not putting women into electable seats sometimes and we need to call on political parties to do more.  It is not enough that we have, as we will have, a necessity to have 40% women on the ticket if we only return half of that into the D&aacute;il.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>  On my position, I am chair of my party.  We are looking to get women, but we also need to make sure that it is not only putting women down on paper but dealing with what it takes to get women over the line.  One suggestion was that we look perhaps at something like what the Taoiseach had done, which was to put in mainly women when it came to the Taoiseach's nominees for the Seanad.  That really shifted the balance in the Seanad.  We now have 40% women in the Seanad.  It means that we bring up many issues that relate to women's lives that probably do not come up in the D&aacute;il to the same extent.  Let us be innovative about it but let us also push back on the political parties to do more to get women over the line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.667" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#C00700"><p>I would make two points.  On the constitutional point, I accept the general view that it cannot be simple deletion and that part of the amendment should involve care.</p><p>The devil is in the detail and the balance between the constitutional, the Executive and the Parliament and what functions fall to Parliament and to the Executive to develop and implement.  I recall being involved in the Disability Acts in the 2000s and the EPSEN Acts as a Minister for Health.  I would have been an advocate on the rights side of it.  In terms of what constituted even a disability, for example, healthcare people said it could go to the hip or it could go to what we might consider normal health stuff.  If we put something into the Constitution, all sorts of interpretations can flow and there can be unintended consequences.  That is why the work the committee is doing is important in terms of how it is defined.  Policy issues should be for the Executive and the Oireachtas.  There has to be a written constitutional framework to govern people's basic rights.  It will be challenging to get a formula of words that embraces care but I think it is possible.  The committee has already done good work on that in its interim report.</p><p> On politics and the electoral issue, as a party leader I would be very close to this having overseen two local elections and two general elections.  Gender quotas were useful and effective in national elections because at national level each party will look at a five, four or three seat constituency and will say it has the prospect of two here or one here and winning the seat becomes a dominant issue and a primary consideration.  What that means is one could restrict candidates and one might run one or two candidates.  It becomes very difficult and challenging.  However, it worked because we were able to say to the national executive and to the party at large that we wanted to get 30% and we will do it come what may.  That meant adding women who may not have gotten through local conventions.</p><p> It is totally different at local elections if I am honest.  I do not think the quota is as critical at local elections.  There are more fundamental issues.  We need to look more broadly at other barriers to entry into politics, particularly for women but for men also.  We set up the Markievicz commission and brought academics in to chair it and they went through the literature and the four Cs, namely, cash, confidence, childcare and culture.  I have said to the chambers of commerce over the last number of years and when I met them as an opposition leader.  I do not think the whole of society is focused on politics.  What do I mean by that?  If somebody working in an industry - it could be pharmaceutical or financial services - put their hand up and said they wanted to be a candidate and to go forward for the city or county council, how would the employer look at that?  Is it a career limiting move?  I suspect it is.  Most party leaders and most HQ organisers will say the panel from which you choose candidates is narrowing all the time.  Once most people get out of secondary school or college, they go to work and not all can come out of that work world, so to speak, and go into politics.  That is a cultural thing we need to turn around.  That is my sense of it.  I meet many young people in the youth wings of political parties.  They are all enthusiastic and turn up to conferences and everything else.  They graduate, get the qualification and go to work in some firm.  I get the sense it is a career limiting move if they say that they want to become a councillor.</p><p> There are other issues.  I outlined some of the moves we have made on maternity leave and all of that.  The salary improvements will help.   That gives people an option in some instances to opt in full time and to remain at home.  That salary issue is important, and could perhaps be enhanced in the future at local government level.  The timing of meetings and basic things like that are also important.  When I started in local government, we met at 7.30 p.m., which everybody could make.  It was brought forward to 5.30 p.m., which I could still make because I was a teacher.  The committee meetings were in the afternoon, which not everybody could make.  We have to be more flexible around that.  There are lots of issues that are deterring people from going into local politics and we probably need to take a fresher look at it.  I would support any measures we could bring in that would make the choice easier for people.  I find that sometimes one is persuading someone that it will not be as bad as they think it is.</p></speech>

I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach pick up on the programme for Government because something we have been trying to do is flag certain issues that align with the work of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I want to use my time to draw his attention to two areas in the programme for Government, which pertain to what we are dealing with at the committee, namely, the section on anti-poverty and social inclusion measures.  The first is something I raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when he came to the committee and is around gender and equality budgeting.  I know the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance have done excellent work on well-being budgeting which encapsulates gender equality budgeting.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also looked at gender budgeting.  However, in every budget we are hoping to see a fully tested and gender equality budgeted budget, if that makes sense.  We want to see every measure and every policy put forward with sufficient data.  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and other Ministers who have appeared before us have said is that they will come to Cabinet with those details but sometimes that detail is not within the public sphere.  What is the development in terms of well-being budgets and gender budgeting and making all that information fundamentally a part of budget decision-making and making it legible not just to people in Leinster House but to NGOs which I know would find that incredibly useful?  I know it is difficult sometimes in Ireland to get one's hands on enough disaggregated data to make it meaningful in terms of decision-making.</p> <p>  My second question is also on that section and is borne out of some of the discussions around the referendum where we talked a lot about how it interacts with the rights of children and how we recognise marriage and those kind of things.  In the programme for Government, we have committed to reform our child maintenance system and address key issues such as calculation, facilitation and enforcement.  I know many parents, in particular lone parents, find it difficult to chase maintenance.  It is an ongoing issue that the women's caucus has called out.  Since we have committed to it in the programme for Government, what are the developments on child maintenance?</p></speech>

We have been developing the well-being framework which has been an intense piece of work and I take the Deputy's point about making it legible.  The late Bobby Kennedy spoke much more eloquently about well-being than we are at the moment, and that is no offence to how we are putting all of the documentation together.  It is a very significant bit of work but he described it as needing a set of measurements that measure.  He said that GDP "... measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile".  Then he went through education, children and so forth.  That is what our well-being budgeting is about.  It should be possible.  If I am honest, part of the issue since this Government came into power has been a degree of responding to the major crises of the day - Covid-19 and now the war in Ukraine and the consequential impact of that on energy and the cost of living - in terms of budgets, capital allocations and so forth.</p><p>That has impacted to a degree on doing the body of work that is required and which the Deputy is talking about in respect of the gender inequality budget, as well as having the proper metrics that people can relate to and measure as opposed to generalities and language.  I do not know whether the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has had any focus on that front-----</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is exactly right.  Covid threw up such a dynamic situation that data got parked for a little while because we were looking at situations that were just so extreme.  It was very difficult to parse the numbers on that level.  One issue is that the performance indicators from Departments present a particular challenge.  They have to be contextualised within gender equality and social inclusion.  We do not want to be constantly changing them because a performance indicator that changes every year is meaningless.  It is tricky.  I take that point completely.  We do not want constant change but they need to be contextualised in the right way.</p></speech>

In some areas, such as social protection, we know now what measures will help with combating poverty.  People can argue whether we do that rightly or wrongly or to the extent that we should but we have a fair idea of what types of payments can deal with consistent poverty or the prevention or avoidance of consistent poverty.  I will go back to the Ministers to see if we can get that template in place for the next budget.  I would have to go back to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the maintenance issue.  That has always been a continuing issue when it comes to successfully enabling people to get maintenance, enforce maintenance and make sure people fulfil their responsibilities.</p></speech>

If I were to point to one policy decision or piece of work that would be really meaningful for those families, it would be the removal of the pressure and responsibility on lone parents to look for maintenance.  We should have a system that is more reliant on the State and the State should take some responsibility for supporting the parent and making sure they have legal access and reasonable access to that income.</p></speech>

I would agree with that and I will work with the Deputy on the mechanisms by which we can do that.  There is change happening in the family court system and even with the new family court building.  I am determined to get those changes through.  The Deputy is correct about removing the pressure from the individual.  It should be more systemic.  When decisions are made in the courts, they should be followed through on and there should be an oversight mechanism that makes sure a person fulfils the obligations as determined by the courts.</p></speech>

I will raise two quick points.  One of them was already covered by Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  I refer to the issue of women in politics and creating a more family-friendly political environment.  Gender quotas have worked to a certain extent.  However, as both the Taoiseach and the Senator acknowledged, we also need to look at how we frame the workplace that the politician ultimately enters into, be that at local or national level.  We have an awful lot of work to do in this area and we need to lead by example.  To be frank, these Houses are far from family friendly with the sitting hours that form part of a typical day here.  We often run up to midnight on a Wednesday.  There are many representatives who sit in these Houses who do not get to see their families for two or three nights a week.  Those who do are very fortunate.  From conversations with them, they find that is conducive to them having a long and productive career in politics.  For those for whom it is difficult, particularly those who travel from the furthest reaches of the western seaboard, it is and will remain a challenge.</p> <p>  Getting down to local level, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, how local government works and the timing of meetings can erect significant barriers in the way of both parents becoming involved in politics at local government level.  I agree that we need to take a serious look at the salaries we pay our local government representatives.  The hours they commit to that work during the day and late into the evening and the commitment they give to their constituents are very significant and I do not think they are adequately rewarded for that commitment.  As the Taoiseach alluded to, we should perhaps move to a point where somebody can consider it a full-time career rather than a part-time one.  That is exactly the route other countries that have been successful in this area have gone down.  I would encourage the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Department to look in that direction.</p> <p>  The other point I want to make is on the area of remote working.  We had the greatest social experiment of our generation foisted upon us during lockdown.  We essentially said to thousands of civil servants to lock the doors on their offices, leave their offices, go home and try to do their work from their homes.  Not alone did they try to do their work, they succeeded in becoming ever more productive and ever more supportive of the people they aim to serve across the whole of our Civil Service.  The Department of Social Protection and Revenue, particularly during lockdown when everybody was working from home, did extraordinary work and proved categorically that they can be as productive and as effective in that remote work setting as they were previously.  It would be a crying shame if there were not significant learnings from that social experiment that was foisted upon us.  The Civil Service and local government should lead by example in the area of remote working.  Those of us in the political realm, who work in partnership with civil servants, need to lead by example.  In the Taoiseach's own Department, which has an oversight role for all of the Civil Service, has any research been done into productivity during lockdown and that enforced remote working period?  It went on for the guts of a year and a half to two years in some instances.  Is there work ongoing right now to ensure we can be ever more flexible in the future in how we support civil servants working remotely?  I think they have proven conclusively that they can do it.  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about quality of life.  This could be a hugely positive move in enhancing the quality of life of our civil servants.  It is something we need to seriously look at.  It would be a crying shame if we reverted to the Ireland of old, the pre-pandemic and pre remote working Ireland.  That is something we need to focus on in the next two to three years.</p></speech>

We should have a legislative day but the politics of it do not allow for that because people want the argy-bargy every day.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is looking at me.  People want Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business.  In a previous Government, back when I was a backbench Deputy in the late 1990s, we did a legislative day on a Friday.  It was civilised.  We got legislation through more expeditiously and in a better way.  People want to be in their constituencies on a Thursday and so we get into this Tuesday to Thursday thing.  I do not think it can be done in two and a half days, if I am honest.  That is my view.  It is a minority view but I genuinely do not believe we can do the work of the national Legislature in two and a half or three days.  Some might say it is more than that as there are committees.  I am not saying this in a disparaging way.  I understand there is committee work and so on.  It is a fundamental challenge that we have to be everywhere.  What Covid taught me as a politician, for the first year and a bit, is that we were almost exclusively focused on policy.  We got online calls and emails but the Friday nights were free and we were not at functions on Saturday nights.  It was quite an interesting year and a half for politicians.</p></speech>

As we return now, that is being dragged left, right and centre.  It is full on again.</p><p>Some of us love that engagement with people and so on.  I like that kind of politics.  I know what I signed up for, so to speak, so I do not complain about it.  That said, it is very challenging and frightens people away from coming into politics.  The point is that we need to take greater charge of how we organise our weeks and so on.  To be fair, a lot of progress has been made.  The situation was far worse in respect of late nights and so on in the past.  The voting situation has been reformed effectively and the voting block works well.</p><p> There have been international assessments of productivity with remote working.  It depends on the type of job but there has been an increase in productivity in some areas.  Other workplaces need person-to-person engagement.  Politics needs person-to-person engagement through meetings and so on.  The Civil Service was quite proactive on remote working and still maintains it.  I think we will end up in a hybrid situation.  My personal view is that young people need to be in the workplace for certain times of the week.  That is required for people who are starting out in a job from a mentoring perspective.  It gives them the opportunity to engage with people and learn the ropes.  We have all done that.  The negative side of the pandemic for Leinster House was that the newly elected Deputies and Senators met nobody in their first year and had none of the normal engagements with people that we all had when we were first elected and which we found very useful.  A senior politician would tell a newly elected politician how things work.  There is a balance to be struck and I think we will end up in a hybrid scenario where people will be in the workplace for a good part of the week and will then be in a position to work remotely at home or from another location on other days.  Training will require people on the job.  It all depends on the type of work and the nature of the workplace.  Some of the international research is already showing productivity gains from remote working in some sectors.</p></speech>

There are demands to be everywhere.  Everyone's event is, naturally, the most important to them but I would like to put my kid to bed some nights of the week.  Choices have to be made and it is very difficult.  We must talk positively about politics before we can attract more people but we cannot be dishonest about the realities of the pressures involved and how little politicians see their children, no matter how they structure things.  In my view, it is almost better to be in the Chamber at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday because it means I have the flexibility to do a collection from school at 4 p.m. on a Monday.  I do not necessarily agree that a 9 p.m. to 5 p.m. arrangement works as well as possible.</p> <p>  I have proposed a Bill, which the Government supported on Second Stage, addressing the potential for remote and proxy voting for Deputies in certain circumstances.  It would give an option during maternity and paternity leave.  There are many male Members of Parliament whose partners have had babies in recent years.  There is no real reason for a Member to be in the Houses at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday for the first six months of a child's life.  That Member could be at home supporting his partner as he or she looks after the small child.  That is one of the Bills we are considering at this committee.  I want to flag that as part of the proposed referendums.</p> <p>  In respect of the broader cultural piece, I want to pick up on what my colleague, Deputy Hourigan, said about gender budgeting and considerations.  Much of this committee's consideration relates to cultural changes and the differences in care and the additional responsibilities that fall to particular Members and the additional difficulties they face.  A group of parents were before the Joint Committee on Autism recently.  The five or six guests of the committee were all women.  This Government has extended considerably the eligibility for carer's allowance.  Those are the sorts of practical things the Government can do to try to help.  Deputy Hourigan spoke about maintenance.  There are women from every walk of life and across every demographic in my constituency who have experienced divorce, desertion or domestic violence.  These things can happen to anybody.  There are critical junctures in people's lives.  Perhaps they have had a child with a significant care need, or they have a maintenance problem or need to sort out a new life after a situation of domestic violence.  Universal measures are important in that regard.  A universal approach is required.  That would, for example, include the removal of the means test for supports in situations of domestic violence.  Easy access to maintenance is required.  These are just additional things that the people affected must do.  We have also talked about effecting cultural change in the corporate sphere where men and women are looking for flexible working.  That should be the norm.  These are all cultural changes.  The universal measures are important.</p> <p>  The free books scheme was fantastic for everybody concerned.  However, even in my constituency, that will not apply to fee-paying schools.  I know of a number of women in that situation who would benefit from a universal approach.  Those sorts of schemes should apply to everybody and not only some people.</p> <p>  How can we use the body of work this committee has undertaken in seeking to win a referendum, whenever that happens?  How can we use that dialogue politically to try to effect the cultural changes that are going to be crucial for effecting long-term change for women and men?</p></speech>

A vote would not be called on a Friday, amendments would not be put and so on.  The Deputy is absolutely correct about having flexibility on a Monday.  One positive about politics is that one has a degree of autonomy over one's working day, to a certain degree.  That is a benefit.  One can move things around and balance them.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the universality of certain payments that deal with particularly difficult situations that women or families can find themselves facing.  People are sometimes ahead of politicians and the political system, and I think that is the case in respect of these issues.  Societal change has already happened.  I might be wrong but I believe a referendum would pass but one cannot take that for granted.  We have to work hard to get it right.  We must prepare the ground and comprehensively inform people in advance of a referendum.  Preparation and the provision of information is key.</p> <p>  I think people are moving ahead faster than politicians in respect of cultural changes around gender budgeting.   I attended Christ the King Girls' Secondary School on Monday.  The students themselves showed leadership and I got to see cultural change in front of me.  That change has been led by the principal, in a way.  The students introduced me to the school and guided me in.  The students spoke.  They are involved in international organisations.  One or two of them are involved with the UN.  They want to be involved in society.  The mission of the school is for citizens to contribute to the world.  That shift is happening and we are sometimes delayed in reflecting it in legislation, the Constitution and our budgeting systems.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the carer's allowance.  We have improved it but-----</p></speech>

To be fair, someone has to watch public expenditure within any governmental system.  That is the role.  However, we need to look at the situation in the round.  That goes to the Deputy's point about universality of access to maintenance, child benefit and so on.  Child benefit was always universal but that approach was questioned.   When times got tough, people questioned that universality and asked should it continue.  We have always held the line on the universality of child benefit but sometimes it does not get the provision it should because people want to target other areas.  The argument has been made that because it is universal, it will cost a certain amount and that money could be used elsewhere.  Does the Deputy get my point?</p></speech>

It is too tempting for us to continue talking about gender, democracy and our electoral system because it is a subject where we have direct experience.  I certainly agree with the Taoiseach that quotas alone at local level will not necessarily produce the benefit we want.  We have been quite successful at achieving good gender balance in some councils and a strict quota could lead to the perverse situation where you would have to increase the number of males contesting, which over two terms might reduce the capacity we are trying to build.  I know my party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party on Dublin City Council all have majority female representatives, which is fantastic.  Some of them are first-time councillors and you would like to them develop their experience over time, so we need to be very careful with quotas.  There are definitely other benefits such as maternity leave and the increase in pay.</p><p> The other area referenced by the Taoiseach is the constitutional amendment.  The committee has not spent all its time talking about the constitutional amendment.  We have spent far more of our time talking about the other recommendations.  The Taoiseach suggested a collaborative approach.  Has he sought the Attorney General's view on it?  As for us drafting wording and so on, is there a method whereby we can receive some of the directions from the Attorney General that might help inform our final wording?  That would be useful.  I have two more questions but I might let the Taoiseach come in on that one.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#G00200"><p>Regarding gender, democracy and participation, workload is an issue.  This is why I mentioned the issue of pay and conditions because increasingly, councillors have an enormous amount of work to do at local level from planning to housing and very often, the councillor is the first point of call in terms of representations on these issues.  At county council level in particular, the geographic terrain in some rural areas that councillors have to cover has become larger since the changes of 2014 and county councillors have an enormous workload, which militates against women becoming involved to that degree.  Less travelling to meetings is something that could be encouraged.  Travelling to meetings is something people bring upon themselves and is not healthy or good.  The workload in larger areas has become enormous while in cities, there is more intense engagement regarding a range of issues.  That is a factor we need to work on.</p> <p>  Regarding the constitutional issue, the role of the Attorney General is to advise the Government, not the Oireachtas, but equally a proposal or at least the formula around a proposal needs to be on the table before you could ask the Attorney General or people with a constitutional legal bent who could advise or give their recommendations.  I would have thought the policy aspect of it is key.  I acknowledge the committee is doing further work on this but it has a lot of other things to do as well.  There are two pathways here.  One is for the committee to continue and finish its report while the other is that we ask a specific all-party committee to focus on this very narrow area of the Constitution and come up with a formula of words.  This is something I will leave to the committee to consider.  Alternatively, the Government could come forward with its wording.  If the Government comes forward with its wording in isolation, it cannot take into account the wording that may come from this committee.  That will still have to go back to the Oireachtas, which may make it easier for people to say they do not like the Government's wording and want to add this and that and then we are back to square one again, as in trying to resolve it.  The Government can go to the people with a wording but the more consensus we can build up around the wording the better.  Does that make sense?  Either this committee finishes it, and it will finish its report anyway by December, or we just get a very sharp time-bound group that looks at the actual wording, possibly even taking wording from this committee.  It really needs a constitutional legal lens as well to get it right, as far as possible.  We can never guard against unintended consequences, because jurisprudence will lead us in a certain direction anyway.  </p></speech>

Certainly the issue of parents of children with a disability and their access to school places has been a key discussion.  Where does the Taoiseach stand on this?  We have made some moves in terms of helping to secure the rights of children with disabilities, particularly those with autism, and access to school places.  Schools are reluctant to do that.  We would like to see this significantly improve.  Where does the Taoiseach stand on that?  My next question concerns a publicly funded network of domestic violence refuges, about which we have had some discussions.</p></speech>

That competes with other rights in terms of autonomy of the school but where the State is funding schools to the degree that it does, the broad principle of the State is inclusivity.  When I was Minister for Education and Science from 1997 to 2000, we had very little difficulty in transforming the special education system in terms of primary schools coming forward to create special classes and take children with special needs into mainstream schools and employing SNAs.  To be fair, if that obligation is on schools, we must then provide the resources and we are doing that.  The obligation should be there and legislation has changed and is changing to reflect that but resources must follow that in terms of the broad spectrum of needs but also different types.  There is no one size fits all.  It is at post-primary level that it has become particularly challenging with autism.  We have established new schools in the past two years.  About three to four special schools have been established.  That is where I see that.  There are other issues on the health side that are separate but must be dealt with in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme and its limitations so far.</p> <p>  Regarding refuge places, as part of its overall strategy, the Government's objective is to provide that everyone who needs a refuge space would get one.  I think we are up to 141.  I am still working with the Department of Justice regarding the timeline for providing the places.  When we get the agency set up, I believe it should drive the provision of refuge spaces with the proper optimum model.  Historically, the model has been localised and bottom-up, which is okay to a degree, but we do need standards and high quality, which we have achieved in many other areas of public life.  We have improved schools and healthcare settings, including primary care settings, dramatically so there is no reason why we cannot have a high-quality spec for refuge spaces and centres for families.  The strategy commits to doubling the figure to over 280 over the next five years.  I would like to see as much as we can do.  Some of that is back loaded.  I would like to see whether there are mechanisms we can work with local authorities to bring some of that forward faster.  </p></speech>

However, this annoyance pales into insignificance compared to the annoyance and frustration felt by women outside and inside this building.  We have been speaking about Article 41.2 for longer than I have been alive.  It was the biggest single policy issue at the time the Constitution was being drafted so this is not a new issue.  I agree with the Taoiseach, however, that it is complex and there are a number of different aspects to it.  Simplicity may very well be the answer.</p><p>However, given the complexity and length of time for which this has been going on, would the Taoiseach consider a cross-departmental document similar to that containing the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence or something similar to a Housing for All pathway that would lay down key performance indicators and give a documented progression rate in achieving the recommendations made by the citizens' assembly.  We need more than statements in the D&aacute;il on this matter.  We have had statements on the citizens' assembly recommendations last year.  What we now need to see is documented, transparent progress.  It is not good enough that when we finish this work, Members of the Oireachtas will be reliant on parliamentary questions to seek an update.  That is not transparency.  Any member of the public should be able to get access to the information.  The commitment is in the programme for Government and has been in other programmes, but we need to provide accountability, timelines and clear deliverables when it comes to gender equality.  Citizens deserve no less than that.</p><p> I have a second question for the Taoiseach.  It relates to the citizens' assembly model.  Earlier this year, Professor David Farrell warned that the high-profile successes of the repeal and marriage equality referendums disguise the fact that many recommendations of previous assemblies have been ignored, rejected or left to gather dust, thus wasting time and effort, not least that of citizens' assembly members, and wasting public funding for very little return.  He describes the evolved assembly model as sub-optimal, very top-down, very managerial, tightly controlled by civil servants and a Government-appointed chair, running the risk of stifling innovation.  Does the Taoiseach share Professor Farrell's concern regarding State stifling of citizens' assembly recommendations and the failure to advance those within a meaningful timeframe?</p></speech>

I have been involved with various referendums.  Referendum commissions are given a job to do and need time to do it.  When I am asked for a specific timeline, I want to make sure it allows the commission time to do its work comprehensively and in an informed way.  I do not want it alleged that a commission was just put together at short notice and did not have time to do its work properly.  That is all I am saying.  It is something we should all agree with.  If we want constitutional change, we should do it properly.  The first stage is to settle on wording.  We do not have wording right now.  We have disagreement on that.  "Disagreement" might be too strong a word but we are trying to work towards agreement.</p></speech>

The programme for Government commits to delivering on each and every one of its recommendations.  My question relates to how we provide transparency and accountability in respect of each of the 41 recommendations.  Will the Taoiseach consider something like a cross-departmental document similar to that containing the third strategy or the Housing for All pathways?  I refer to a published document on which there can be accountability and that delivers timeframes.</p></speech>

It falls to the Oireachtas to make decisions.  The Oireachtas committee worked on the eighth amendment, for example.  It did not stick to the letter of what the citizens' assembly prescribed.  Not every member of the committee voted for it.  Some were against, some abstained and some voted in favour of changed or amended wording.  It got through eventually and was passed.  Some recommendations have been taken on board.  Not all are.  It has to be clear that very often what the citizens' assembly achieves is a very good articulation of the ideas and a teasing out of the issues, but it can never be the view that whatever the citizens' assembly recommends has to be, de facto, implemented by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Members are elected by people as well, and they have different views, as we know.  People will want to do things differently.  That is the balance we want to get right.  I would engage on Professor Farrell's point that the model is too managerial.  I believe he was involved with the original models.  There was criticism in certain quarters of this House of what I would call wrong allegations in respect of the thing being managed and choreographed and so on.  </p> <p>  We will always consider ways of improving the model, but we are at the cutting edge in Europe.  Very few are doing this in Europe to the same degree as us in terms of our model of participatory democracy.</p></speech>

I agree with the statement the Taoiseach made on people often being ahead of the system and the politics.  The reason I ask my question is that if there is not a clear response to those who participated in the Citizens' Assembly, particularly the one conducted during the Covid pandemic, which was a very difficult time, it may undermine the very basis of the assembly and make it difficult to get people to partake in it.</p></speech>

Also, this committee represents a response.

We are committed to producing our final report on 1 December and, without pre-empting our work, to consider further the options we have already put forward for wording constitutional change.  This is so we might provide the Government and the Oireachtas with a clearer and more precise plan for the holding of a referendum, which we would like to see next year, to give effect to citizens' assembly recommendations Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive.  The exchanges we have had today with the Taoiseach on this have been very helpful.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  Two more members wish to contribute, and also a non-member, who I did promise we would try to facilitate.  I ask Senators Higgins and Doherty to keep their remarks within three minutes, if they can, so the Taoiseach will have time to respond, perhaps to both together.</p></speech>

I have very specific questions.  I welcome the Taoiseach to the committee.  In his opening statement, he specifically mentioned committing to holding a referendum on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na &Eacute;ireann but, as he will be aware, the recommendations of the citizens' assembly relate not only to Article 41.2 but also, crucially, Article 41.3 and Article 41 more widely.  Therefore, it is not solely a matter of Article 41.2.  There is not much ambiguity in relation to Article 41.2 on care.  Any time a question has been put to the public on this, they always came back looking for gender-neutral recognition of care.  There is very much a close alignment with the options this committee has put forward so far.  This requires action.  I am concerned that while the Taoiseach mentioned Article 41.2, we have not had any discussion of Article 41.3, specifically the fact that the latter, as it stands-----</p></speech>

It is all Article 41.3.  I apologise.</p></speech>

Under Article 41.3 at the moment, the definition of "the Family" really only entails the marital family.</p><p>That has a very real impact.  We have spoken about lone parents where 25% of all the families in Ireland are single-parent households.  That is 25% of all our families who are not recognised as families by the Constitution.  We have also heard very detailed testimony from a number of witnesses about the impact that has personally with identity and also in policy areas, including social protection policy.  We heard of one very interesting court case this weekend that involved a widower whose partner of more than 20 years had died.  They had three children in their teens.  The judge described them as a loving family in the sense of which family is generally understood in our society but the man was judged not be entitled to the widower's contributory pension because the purpose of that widower's contributory pension was defined by the judge as supporting and promoting the marriage contract.  There are couples, therefore, of 20 years living together and their families are not considered to be a priority in the same way that marriage is.  Marriage is considered to be a greater priority than them.  It is similar for lone parent families.  These policies have real impacts.  We talk about consequences and unintended consequences.  There are consequences now from how our Constitution is framed.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that in his intention to hold a referendum, the Taoiseach is also committed to those provisions in Article 41.3 around recognising all families and including, of course, the marital family?</p></speech>

I fully accept that for a long time the definition of marriage was too restrictive in the context of the understanding of that article.  Many legal people might have a different perspective legally on that but I am very clear that the family is a very broad concept as far as I am concerned.  I look at it in the broadest way.  I am very committed to changing that.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, where we are now is the method by which we arrive at a proposal to go before the people.  I understand that this committee has done an interim report and that there is to be a fuller report.  I have put forward the idea that we need to do something more specific on these three.  I referred to the three areas in my contribution earlier, but not in the formal speech, and that we would deal with these areas as identified by this committee.  The committee has already come forward with proposed amendments to them.  The Senator has said that they may need further work.  It is just a methodology by which we do this now.  I favour achieving as great a consensus as we possibly can, although there will not be unanimity on this, before it comes to the Executive.  Then we will go to the people with the wording.</p></speech>

To be honest, there is very wide agreement in this committee but the information we do not have is on the questions or concerns that the Government has, including from the Attorney General and others.  This is why we have constitutional experts who are coming to meet with the committee and who have spoken to us.  We have legal experts on the committee.  The key point is that we do not want a situation where we give a specific wording, the Government then says that there is a technical problem from the Attorney General's perspective with this one wording, and then it all gets kicked to touch again.  This is why we have given options.  It is not because there is disagreement within the committee.  There was a very strong collective general direction of travel from this committee.  We have been trying to anticipate what concerns the Taoiseach might have but we have not had any input from the Government around what it is considering.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Referendum Commission.  The other part of the policy is ensuring that our social protection policies and other revenue policies are reviewed for the consequences of the referendum and are prepared for advance in a constructive and positive way.</p></speech>

I was on the Order of Business in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the amount of work that this Government and the previous Government have already done to address what we have been talking about for what feels like generations.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten, as they say, and we are concentrating on all of the things that are still left to do.  The difficulty I have is that we are literally talking ourselves to death.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I say that but I feel aghast when the Taoiseach says that he is going to set up another little commission to talk about the wording.  I was at the Cabinet table when we came to the last wording.  When we went out to open consultation this is why that had to be scrapped and why the Government had to establish a commission.  We are going around in circles.  The list of things that we need to change by law in order to change the culture of Irish society - not political society but Irish society - to make it equal for men and women keeps getting longer.  Because those voices are minority voices they always end up at the end of a list.  For argument's sake, we talk about gender-proofing budgets yet the automatic enrolment heads of legislation that were published this week continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap that exists for society today.  This is a brand new scheme that has been around since S&eacute;amus Brennan's days in its making.  We announced it this week and it continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap.  There are parents of incapacitated children who are born to women and men who are probably in their 20s or 30s.  They are abandoned by the State because the woman must give up work to mind her child, and we give the husband a tax credit that is so miserable instead of recognising the value of the care that they give.  The contribution to the family and society that such carers give should be rewarded or at least acknowledged by the State.  We do not even give them credits for their pensions.  They do not exist in the State any more.  We talk about valuing care yet we pay carer's allowance as an income support and not as valuing care.  It is mostly women who do it.  If a husband is lucky enough to earn over the threshold then the carer is expected to just carry on herself and the State does not value the care.  We expect the wheels of those families to keep on turning.  All of these things perpetuate the culture where we feel that we are always last in the queue.  Women, care and family life is always last in the queue.  We deserve timelines.</p> <p>  I genuinely believe in the citizens' assembly, which was a group of women and men who came along to establish a report for us on all of the ills they think need to be fixed, and to fix it.  We are here now and it is going to take nine months to talk about those ills again.  We deserve timelines.  It is not acceptable for us to say or for the next Government to say that we will get to these things.  I would love to see the referendum happening next year but that is only a tiny part.  It is also about all of the other small incremental pieces that go to form the culture of how we value women and value the equality of opportunity between women and men in this country.  It might be a hard thing to do but I beg the Taoiseach to put in timelines or to allow us to put timelines in.</p></speech>

All political parties have a responsibility to reform how we govern ourselves, to ensure that councillors, first of all, are heard if they suffer a sexual assault, that there are proper investigations internally within the political parties in relation to that, and that the people who were the perpetrators of that assault are not in a case where they are selected for election then by those political parties as well-----</p></speech>

The role of this Oireachtas committee is to consider the citizens' assembly report on gender equality and bring forward recommendations for Government to bring forward and implement.  That is where we are.  The final report will be published on 1 December.  I would like to see a referendum in 2023.  I am always cautious of setting a date and someone coming back on the date and saying that we promised we would have a referendum.  I have been through this before.  Referendums have been lost through bad preparation, people not being informed properly and people thinking that the wool was being pulled over their eyes.  The most dangerous referendums are sometimes those where all the parties are for the issue.  Recently, I was reminded of that, but I do not know who brought it up.  Tommie Gorman wrote an autobiography recently, which referenced former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, when the Nice referendum went down.  His press secretary rang Tommie to say that he had something interesting to say.  He was in the Government that promoted the referendum.  He announced that it was a very healthy thing that the people of Ireland had voted against all the political parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Farmers' Association, which was true Charlie McCreevy style.  He said that was a healthy thing in a democracy.  The point is that the referendum was lost and we had to go and have a second referendum in the overall scheme of things.  My only point is that preparation is important, and I ask the committee to take that in good faith.</p></speech>

Once an allegation is made that a referendum commission is not allowed to do its job, that increases suspicion about what they are at and what the elite are at by putting a referendum on citizens when it has not been fully explained, and whether they are covering something up.  That is my point.</p> <p>  We have improved the credits as well in terms of home care credits, tax reliefs, the carer's allowance and so on.  Finally, on that overall point, &euro;11 billion was allocated in the last budget in a cost-of-living package.  Even that did not enable us to do everything.  Obviously, it was a once-off package.  Childcare is getting there.  It is a very difficult area because of the multiplicity of providers and how it began in the first instance.  It did not begin like our primary school system did.  There are private, community and State providers.  However, it is getting there over time.  As I have said, we have gone from providing &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1 billion in funding.  We need to do more in terms of almost getting to a stage where money is not a barrier to accessing childcare.  Even with the improvements we have made, we need to do more, but I think we are getting there.  In politics we want to be everywhere, but sometimes we need to say that we will deal with one issue, such as childcare, over the next two or three years.  That is how to respond to citizens' assembly recommendations.  We might not cover everything optimally but do we deal with the childcare issue once and for all?  In the past two years we have taken steps towards that.  I think the employment regulation order was very important.  I think that having terms and conditions in childcare for workers is vital to retain people and to create a career in childcare for workers.</p> <p>  I do not know if I am permitted to respond to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's points.</p></speech>
