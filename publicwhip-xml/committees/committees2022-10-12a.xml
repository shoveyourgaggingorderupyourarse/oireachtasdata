Members are required to participate in the meeting remotely from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Senators Paul Gavan and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey.  Today we are going to discuss the cost of living, the minimum wage increase and the Low Pay Commission report.  Most employees in Ireland are entitled to a minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Since 1 January 2022, the national minimum wage is &euro;10.50 per hour.  In July 2022, the Low Pay Commission published its report, Recommendations for the National Minimum Wage.  On 14 September, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, announced that he had received Government approval to accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023.  </p> <p>  Today I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider these matters further.  I would like to welcome from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Dr. Laura Bambrick, head of social policy and employment affairs, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.  We had invited IBEC but unfortunately its representatives were unable to attend.  We tried to get others to attend but it was too late.  That is why we just have one side, so to speak.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person when giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable or engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially damaging to a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all the members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Dr. Laura Bambrick to make the opening statement on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#A00300"><p>On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to input into its considerations on the cost of living, the minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission recommendation for 2023.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Liam Berney.</p> <p>  The minimum wage is the lowest rate of pay an employer can legally pay their workers.  It is currently set at &euro;10.50 for each hour worked.  Much is made of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest minimum wage rates in the European Union but this is misleading.  Ireland was already the second most expensive country in the EU 27 before the ongoing inflation surge.  In 2020, when there was zero inflation, the price of a sample basket of 2,000 everyday consumer goods and services was more than a third higher than the EU average.  In other words, when the purchasing power of minimum wage workers is taken into account, it drops from second to seventh position in the rankings and behind our wealthy EU peers.</p> <p>  Likewise, much is made of the near doubling of the rate from when it was first introduced in 2000 at &euro;5.58, which was &pound;4.40 at the time.  Again, this is misleading.  Increases to the minimum wage have not kept pace with wage growth in the wider economy.  When it was introduced, the minimum wage was equivalent to two thirds of the median hourly wage for all employees in the workforce.</p><p>This is official low-pay threshold set by the OECD.  By 2019, pre-pandemic, it had dropped below 45% of median earnings and we had the third lowest minimum wage as a percentage of our median wage in the EU, only after Estonia and Malta.  This is from European Commission research.  The current minimum hourly rate of pay is 52% of the median hourly rate and remains below both the 60% poverty line and the 66% low-pay threshold.  Put simply, despite 14 increases to the rate since its introduction in 2000 the adequacy of the minimum wage has significantly deteriorated over time.<br/><br/>The minimum wage will soon undergo radical reform.  In anticipation of new EU law to ensure adequate wages for workers, the Government is at an advanced stage of planning to move to a new method for calculating the rate.  The so-called &quot;fixed threshold approach&quot; calculates the minimum wage as a percentage of a benchmark.  The Government is proposing that the rate will be benchmarked to 60% of the median hourly wage, to be phased in over four years, that is, by 2026.<br/><br/>Other member states are taking more immediate action.  On 1 October, Germany increased its minimum rate of pay to &euro;12 an hour.  This is equivalent to 60% of their median wage, which is the poverty threshold, and represented a 25% increase in their minimum wage from the start of year, which was then at &euro;9.60.  This will benefit more than 6 million workers, mostly women.  This is a total of 18% of the German workforce.  In contrast, the Low Pay Commission recommended an 80 cent increase to &euro;11.30 an hour for 2023.  As told to this committee by the chair of the commission on 28 September, and widely repeated in Government messaging, &quot;This represents a 7.6% increase and is the largest increase recommended by the commission to date.&rdquo;  While this is true, it is also true that prior to the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015 to make recommendations on the appropriate rate of the minimum wage, larger increases were made to the rate.  We saw a 10.2% increase in 2004, a 9.3% increase in 2005 and an 8.5% increase in 2007.<br/><br/>The Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for both 2022 and 2023 have also fallen short of inflation.  Incomes would have to increase by 15.5% over the two years to maintain pace with inflation.  An 80 cent increase in the hourly rate is inadequate to protect the living standards of workers on the lowest wage, which is why the two ICTU nominated members on the commission opposed the recommendation.<br/><br/>Trade unions do not underestimate the scale of the challenges facing some businesses.  An estimated 165,000 workers, or 7% of the workforce, are earning the minimum wage or less and comprise those on sub-minimum rates and more than half of these are working in just two sectors, namely, hospitality and retail.<br/><br/>To move from the sectoral level to the firm level, Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research from 2021 funded by the Low Pay Commission shows that just 3% of all businesses pay more than half of their employees a minimum wage.  Where there is proven financial difficulty, there is provision under the legislation to exempt an employer from the obligation to pay the minimum wage rate.  Ultimately, we draw the committee's attention to the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive impact assessment of its directive, which finds that the negative impacts of an adequate minimum wage on SMEs are expected to be limited.  The impact assessment summary states: </p><blockquote>	  	Firstly, they are likely to be able to pass on increased labour costs to consumers by increasing prices.  Secondly, increased minimum wages may also increase demand for their services.  Potential negative impacts of increased labour costs for SMEs would be partly counterbalanced by more gradual and predictable minimum-wage increases, which would improve the business environment.   </blockquote><p>Before Cabinet took a decision on the Low Pay Commission's recommendation for 2023, our general secretary Patricia King reminded them that the legislation allows for the Government to implement a different rate than that recommended and urged it to go beyond the recommended 80 cent.  It did not do this.  The Finance Bill provides it with another opportunity to do right by our lowest-paid workers, many of whom are the same workers who were lauded as essential during Covid.<br/><br/>I thank members for their attention and we are happy to take questions. </p></speech>

I remind members who are joining us remotely to use the "raise hand" feature and, importantly, to take it down when they are finished speaking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#B00300"><p>I thank our witnesses for the information provided.  I would have preferred to receive a copy of this before I read about it on RT&Eacute;.  We can discuss that on another date.</p> <p>  On the calculation of the living wage, which is a stated aim of the Government - although it has put the timeframe for it outside the lifetime of its own Government, which is quite handy - 60% of the median hourly rate is where they are going.  Do the witnesses have a view on how that should be done?  Would the Irish Congress of Trace Unions, ICTU, be agreeable with 60% of the median?  Would ICTU favour the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, approach?  I understand there are pros and cons to both approaches but does ICTU have a preference for that?  As encompassed by the living wage, does ICTU see the move to the living wage as being a realistic roadmap to the complete elimination of the sub-minimal rates of pay?  We have not spoken about that.  I understand it is not in Dr. Bambrick's submission but I am sure that she does have a view on it, as do I.  There is an issue.  It is not just that the headline figure is the minimum wage, there are still people who, some for legitimate reasons, do not attain the full rate.  Some people are doing the same job but with the wrong date of birth are getting less money.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The first thing to say is that the commitment to move to a living wage, or 60% by 2026, is making a virtue of necessity.  As this is coming from European law, this is happening.  The only thing we really have to discuss and flesh out today is when it is going to happen and the timeline, as the Deputy has mentioned, and possibly the calculation method.</p> <p>  Let us take the calculation method first.  ICTU supports the proposal of using the fixed threshold approach for a couple of reasons.  First, no other country has a national living wage that uses the MESL approach.  There are a number of reasons for that.  It is very subjective to do as it is based on focus groups.  There would be a lot of consternation about how those focus groups are selected and then what they decide as to what is the basket of goods.  We sort of would be going back to far-gone times where it was for others to decide what the low-paid should be spending their money on.  Do we include alcohol?  How much to include for socialising?  Do we include housing, especially in the context of an economy and a society with high housing costs?  It is highly subjective, there is an administration burden on it and it is financially burdensome to the State.  The main thing is that it is not very responsive and it does not give employers clarity.  At least if we peg it to a fixed-threshold approach, it is more responsive for the employees and it is much more realistic for the employers.</p><p>They can see what is coming down.  For those reasons, while the fixed threshold approach is not without its problems, we do think it is superior.  We also think it should be pegged at 66%, in other words, the low pay threshold.  That has the added benefit that at 66%, or the fixed threshold approach, it is at or slightly above the<b></b>minimum essential standard of living, MESL.  Therefore, we get the benefit of having that basket of goods without all the problems the MESL approach can bring.  We think that is an appropriate approach.<br/><br/>The four-year timeline is very problematic.  Economies like Germany are not known to be fast and loose in economic terms.  As I mentioned, on Saturday two weeks previous, they moved a 25% increase from &euro;9.60 to &euro;12.  They are showing it can be done.  They have the same percentage of their workforce, that is, 18%, that would benefit in our economy if we moved to 60% this year.  To be fair to the Low Pay Commission, in its recommendations around the living wage, it does make allowances in certain situations, whether it be economic or evidence-based experience from other countries, for the process to be speeded up over those four years.  We think four years is too long, however, as the Deputy mentioned.  It is outside the Government's own commitment to move to a living wage within the term of this Government.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00300"><p>Ireland is really unusual in the EU.  We are one of four European members of the OECD that pays a sub-minimum rate to young adult workers, that is, those aged over 18.  We are well behind the curve.  Many countries would have had them previously but they have moved away.  We are delaying that.</p> <p>  We were really disappointed because we were very strong in our evidence to the Low Pay Commission when it was looking at how the progress to a living wage would be structured.  A large chunk of our evidence was made looking at this area of sub-minimum rates for young adults.  We were very disappointed to see that the commission decided the new living wage should exclude those workers.</p> <p>  What is particularly worrying is that at the same time, we are quite rightly seeing Government encouraging apprenticeships.  That is a gold standard of trade union policy.  We have a concern, however, that we will see more quasi-apprenticeships and traineeships as a workaround to a living wage because, of course, apprentices are the other large group that are not covered by either minimum wage or a living wage.  It is, therefore, an issue on which we are behind the curve.  There is no reason for this.  More worrying, it is EU law that if we are going to exempt certain types of employment from minimum wage legislation, it must be evidence-based.  We cannot find the evidence base for not covering young adults for a minimum wage and in turn, a living wage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00400"><p>I am relieved that Dr. Bambrick cannot find the evidence because I cannot find it either.  It is fair to say we have both been looking.  It would also be reasonable to say that the evidence does not exist.  To be fair, if we have looked and others have looked and we cannot find it, the evidence or justification cannot be found.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00500"><p>The strongest justification we have been told is that it is there to encourage young adults to stay in education.  This is contradictory, however.  We have the highest cost of education for young adults.  Therefore, how can those two opposing facts sit side by side?  We would say that it really is open to challenge.</p> <p>  According to the T&aacute;naiste's evidence to this committee last week, a paper is going to Cabinet around what the living wage will look like now we have had the public consultation.  We hope this has dealt with it.  It is, however, something we will be pursuing and campaigning about for the rest of this year and into next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00600"><p>I should mention that my colleague, Senator Gavan, also introduced legislation on this issue previously.  It is something that is of concern to Sinn F&eacute;in as well.</p> <p>  Dr. Bambrick mentioned the minimum wage increases ranging from between 8.5% and 10.2% between 2004 and 2007.  I absolutely know this was not Dr. Bambrick's intention but it looks on paper as if the Low Pay Commission was getting in the way of those increases.</p> <p>  I want to make a broader point regarding a potential for wage spiral, however.  It has been put to us in flashing blue lights that any increases in the minimum rates of pay that are beyond the very modest one that was announced recently would cause a wage spiral inflation.  I am not convinced of that.  Does Dr. Bambrick have a view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00700"><p>To be clear, we are not saying that the Low Pay Commission itself has resulted in lower recommendations than when it was a decision by Government.  However, we are saying the consensual approach for reaching agreement on what the rate of pay is has failed.  To be fair, it has not just failed in Ireland, because 19 of the 21 EU countries with a statutory minimum wage have minimum wage rates below 60%.  This is why the EU has to step in.  Right across the block, we have minimum wages that are not keeping workers out of poverty.  The consensual approach was introduced in 2015.  We have an equal number of worker representatives, businesses and independents, as well as a chair, to make a decision, taking into account various evidence and factors.  It is majority rule, however.  It goes to Government and, as I mentioned, the legislation allows Government to accept or reject and make its own recommendations.  That has never been done but that safeguard is built into the legislation.  As I said, however, the consensual methodology of the commission has added to the inadequacy of the minimum wage over time.  That will be dealt with in this move to a fixed-base approach.</p> <p>  On the wage spiral, we are talking about pay increases to 167,000 workers out of a working population of 2.5 million.  These are the people who will be spending those extra few cent they are getting in their hourly wage and who will be driving up the demand in the sectors in which they are working.  Therefore, no, there is no evidence of wage spiral.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#C00800"><p>I could not find any of that either.  I thank Dr. Bambrick.  In the last couple of days, civil and public servants voted to accept pay rises that do not keep pace with inflation.  That has been acknowledged by ICTU.  It is 6.5% for the average and 7.8% for those on the lowest pay.  I am not in any way trying to interfere with the democratic process within the trade union movement, nor did I ever thank any politician for interfering in it when I was on the other side of the table.  I want to make a point with regard to returning, however.  The president of ICTU said that should the need arise, and it very well might, the union reserves the right to use the clause within the agreement to return back to the negotiating table.</p> <p>  Similar can happen with regard to the minimum wage.  Would Dr. Bambrick see there being a reasonable case to be made for reconvening the commission and asking it to make another suggestion?  Would she see a scenario whereby the relevant Minister, obviously, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, could take that decision independently if inflation is to go way further than is recommended?</p> <p>  As Dr. Bambrick rightly pointed out, it is money in, money out when a person is on a low income.  It goes straight into the local economy.  It goes right down to the local shop and into local businesses.  However, would Dr. Bambrick foresee a scenario whereby either the Government itself can make a decision or the Low Pay Commission can be reconvened and asked to make an additional suggestion?  It is very clear within the public service agreement how that will happen.  Clearly, there is a mechanism in place to trigger those negotiations.  How can that happen outside of that provision within the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission?</p></speech>

With regard to the minimum wage, however, our two colleagues who did not sign off on the Low Pay Commission recommendation made a minority report.  They recommended in their report that the increase would be done in a two-step approach.</p><p>This is exactly what Germany did.

However, the results of the ballots from trade unions last week indicated that workers in the public sector are broadly in favour of the recommendations, and on that basis, we have given our indication to the Government.  Nevertheless, the increased rate of pay in the public sector, and in particular the 3% from 1 March, came about as a review of the Building Momentum agreement, which was referred to.  The trade union movement will not be shy in triggering the review if that is required on another occasion.</p></speech>

I did not receive their opening statement until after 9 a.m., which is not acceptable.</p> <p>  Between February 2015, when the Low Pay Commission was established, and July 2021, prices increased by 4.4%.  In February 2015, the minimum wage was &euro;8.65 and in July 2021, the commission recommended a minimum wage of &euro;10.50 an hour, which the Government agreed to.  That equated to a 21% increase over a period when there was an increase of only 4.4% increase in prices.  Clearly, for a variety of reasons, we have seen much higher inflation most recently and that needs to be addressed.  Nevertheless, does Dr. Bambrick believe that prior to the recent surge in inflation, and certainly until July 2021, the Low Pay Commission was ensuring that the situation of lower income workers was improving consistently?</p></speech>

As I set out in my opening statement, we have not kept pace with that.  We started at 66% of the median wage and over time we have dipped as far as below 45%.  We are back at 52% but the 80 cent will bring us down to 51%, so we will be back down further.  We do not peg the minimum wage to prices but rather to other wages in the economy.  This is a better barometer of how much people will have to spend on the cost of living in that economy, and over time the value of the minimum wage related to wages in the economy has rapidly declined.  It is not like index-linking in social welfare, where it is indexed either to wages or to prices.  With the minimum wage, it is just about wages.</p></speech>

It is good to renew old friendships.  I think the Government's objective, which is in line with my belief, is that we need the fastest sustainable move to the living wage, but we do not have IBEC or any other employer representatives before the committee during this meeting, so I will put to our guests what I hear from small business.  It is looking at the 1.5% auto-enrolment, the new sick pay scheme starting in January, extended parental leave and the remote working legislation, and it is saying to us that this is a lot happening very quickly together and that we need some question of phasing and of understanding that the capacity of some businesses is very different from that of others.  That is the sort of question the Government tries to balance.  Today, the Central Bank indicated that 4% of businesses are at high risk of going under, and it suggested half of them can survive while the other half will go.  In the budget, the Government attempted to support workers through a difficult period when pay increases they would like to get might not be possible because of other pressures in the economy.</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear our guests' takes on those sorts of issues.  I acknowledge they do not represent small business and I do not expect them to, but are these issues they are hearing across the table?  Do they see scope for this sort of balance?  It is correct to say we could accelerate things if the economy does not go as badly as some fear.  This is a bit like "Hamlet" without the prince but I would like to hear our guests' views on those sorts of pressures that the other side, particularly the representatives of small business, has highlighted to us.</p></speech>

To be clear, unions are in the business of keeping people in their jobs; that is our ultimate reason for turning up for work.  We do not put forward recommendations that put jobs at risk.  The Deputy is correct that a lot of change is coming down the road.  This week, we heard that auto-enrolment has had several false starts, there will be sick pay at the start of next year and there is the move to a living wage, but that just means we are moving to a European style of pay compensation where it is not just about the wage that is paid at the end of the week but about the full package, of which the wage is one part.  The wage is protected when the worker is sick or retired or when he or she needs family leave.  Other countries are able to do this and there is much more predictability in wage demands when it is part of that package.</p></speech>

In our submission, we talked about the transposition of a new European directive on minimum wages.</p><p>An important part of that directive is the issue of extending collective bargaining coverage to 80% in the economy.  Research shows that the most effective way of combatting poverty and increasing wealth redistribution is through collective bargaining procedures at the level of the sector, of the enterprise or at a national level.  Over time, as collective bargaining coverage increases in the economy through the implementation of the directive, the type of issues to which Deputy Bruton referred will become less relevant, because collective bargaining will produce better outcomes for workers.  It will produce a more equal society and it will reduce poverty.  In our view that is the most effective way of dealing with wage adequacy in the economy.</p></speech>

Hospitality and those areas are hugely supportive.  The Deputy may have attended meetings during the pandemic and since the pandemic has eased where the Government met with representatives of small businesses and in particular with hospitality.  Those sectors continue to have their hands out for continuing supports.  Sometimes, quite frankly, it was a bit embarrassing to listen to it.</p> <p>  The other thing I would say is that they benefit from the 9.5% VAT rate.  In our experience, that 9.5% VAT rate is not passed on.  They soak it and they take it in increased profits.  While the representatives of small business do complain about all of the things that the Deputy has spoken about, a more balanced view about how small businesses are supported generally by Government, as well as the necessity to have workers compensated fairly, is the right approach that we should be taking in the longer term.</p></speech>

I thought that was an interesting point that ICTU made.  ICTU also said, I think that 5,000 workers, or 7%, were earning the minimum wage and that less than half of 54% are in hospitality and retail.  There are approximately 90,000 working in that area.  Does ICTU have any detail with respect to how many of those workers are under the ages of 24 or 25?  I note that the ESRI had a paper on decent working quite a while ago which said that 33% of the 18- to 24-year-olds were in temporary employment.  Many of those would possibly be students who would be working in those sectors in part-time jobs etc.  They would be working in the evenings, and they are needed.  I am also curious with respect to the other side of 54%.  Where are they and what areas are they in?</p> <p>  My other question relates to how when we walk around any towns now we will see signs in windows here and there for vacancies and jobs that are available and so forth.  In ICTU&rsquo;s view and in its experience, have the pressures in the area of labour pushed up wages?  In other words, if I am an employer and I want to employ somebody and if my competitor down the road is paying more, there is a risk that the worker will move to the competitor, rather than staying with me.  Has that had an impact on wages overall and on pushing them up?  Those are just a couple of questions to start with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#E01100"><p>I will go first on that.  I have the figure for the percentage of under 20s, although I do not have it with me because I did not expect us to go down this rabbit hole.  I should have expected that.  However, we know from the research that minimum wage workers are more likely than the overall workforce to be younger, to be female, to work part time and to be migrant.  That is a general point and I will get back to the Deputy with that percentage of the sub-minimum wage rate.</p> <p>  Regarding the point about the pushing up of wages, one of the issues we mentioned was that the two big sectors that are employers of people who are on minimum wage are also the biggest sectors that are seeing the problems with retention and recruitment.  If we are not seeing wage increases, we are seeing people following the wages.  This started coming out of Covid-19 where people were changing.  We have seen a lot of people not just moving, but employers moving sectors.  That has sped up now with inflation, so we are seeing people moving into higher paid, more predictable hours and more secure employment.  It is a difficulty for these low-paying sectors.  Wages and low pay is a real difficulty for these sectors.  They have skin in the game to get involved in addressing the wages of their staff.  This is therefore inadvertently pushing up the wages in these sectors because of the recruitment and retention difficulties.  This is more than the cost of living in the first instance.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton has already alluded to some reports and some that I think were in the <i>Irish Independent</i>that 4% of 10,000 businesses are facing the restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the business completely.  Could increasing the minimum wage in those circumstances actually accelerate the closure of some of these businesses?  We know from a more recent discussion that we had here that there are some methodologies where businesses can plead inability to pay and they do not do that.  Why does ICTU think that they do not do that, if they cannot?  They often instead go out of business or let people go.</p></speech>

Absolutely not.  If one's business model is premised on paying below-poverty wages, then there is something wrong with the business model.  It is not pushing that.  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, there is a withdrawal of Covid-19 supports, so we are seeing a delay in closures.  Many businesses have been kept on life support over the last two and a half years because of what were correctly very generous Government supports to keep vulnerable but viable businesses in place.  In doing that, we kept vulnerable non-viable businesses in place.  It is difficult to separate out how many of those businesses are failing because of the last recent crisis and the ongoing crisis.  However, this is certainly not about paying an extra 80 cent or more to 160,000 workers of a working population of 2.5 million.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Bambrick saying, then, that she expects quite a lot of businesses to go out of business in the short to medium term because of the other pressures and because their business model, as she says, is not sustainable?  This may be through no one&rsquo;s fault other than that maybe the business is not working and is not viable anymore.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  Is the percentage of workers who are on the minimum wage over the years going up or down?  Has it improved or disimproved overall?  This is bearing in mind that we did say that quite a number of people on the minimum wage are part time, temporary etc.?</p></speech>

It did dip for a while and then last year it went up.  That is because we are seeing many more young workers entering the workforce because of the tightness of the labour market.  The Deputy might have heard representatives from the hospitality industry speak about how when the schools and colleges reopened they were having real staffing problems because much of the previously available labour was not there.  We have seen an increase in 2021 and 2022 but it had reduced.</p><p>We have to remember as well that our workforce has been growing and has never been as large as it is now.</p><p> There were lots of good things about the State supports during the Covid crisis.  Not only were they generous but they have been one of the longest-running supports.  Unlike in other jurisdictions, when they were removed, there has been not been the tsunami here we were told to expect.  My colleague wants to come in at this point.</p></speech>

We are not going to see that; the increase will be about 9%.  We have been told, and it is correct, that wages cannot chase inflation.  That is why we had the &euro;11 billion budget package only two weeks ago, the bulk and lion's share of which related to cost-of-living measures.  However, as I mentioned, low-paid, minimum wage workers, first, will not benefit from the &euro;1.1 billion tax package because they do not earn enough to get the &euro;800 per year and, in addition, because they are mostly young, part-time workers, migrants and women, they will not benefit from a lot of what is in the cost-of-living packages.  A single worker with no children, for example, will not get the benefits of the 25% reduction in childcare costs, which we really welcome, or the move to free schoolbooks, which, again, we hugely welcome.  They might get the benefit of the income disregard increases for the medical card, which means they may be able to get GP care free at the point of use, and they will get the reduction in public transport.  If they are able to live outside the family box room, they may see the benefit of the tax relief for renters.</p> <p>  These workers are earning too little to benefit from the very generous tax relief package and, because of their circumstances, they will not benefit from many of the cost-of-living measures.  In addition, the vast majority, if they are working full-time, will not be on social welfare income supports.  They are caught between those two tools and their wages are the only avenue available to them for keeping up their living standards.  In that respect, the decline in the real wage is really important to this cohort.  We absolutely understand what the Government was trying to do with the budget.  It goes back to Deputy O'Reilly's point about public sector workers agreeing to a below-inflation increase.  Many of those workers will benefit from the childcare package, free schoolbooks and the other very good and permanent cost-of-living measures around the social wage the Government has introduced.  However, for the cohort of workers we have been discussing, their wage packet is the only buffer to protect their living standards.</p></speech>

I want to unpack that.  The unions did not agree with the proposed increase in the minimum wage.  It does not look very consensual when the body representing the vast majority of workers in this country did not consent to this inadequate increase.  Can she explain that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, not everybody has to vote for one's position but once enough people do, one gets a seat at the table.  To be fair, a year of work was put into coming to this decision.  It was not based on a show of hands.  Ultimately, that is what it comes down to, but there is a lot of trying to find a balance.  As Deputy Bruton laid out, it is about the cost for employers and making sure the wage is adequate but sustainable.  That is really important.</p></speech>

It is not unusual for that to happen and employers have done it as well.</p></speech>

The directive sets out that Governments shall provide a framework for enabling conditions for collective bargaining, by law and after consultation or agreement with the social partners, and shall establish an action plan to promote collective bargaining.  What level of consultation has taken place with the unions on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#F01200"><p>We estimate collective bargaining coverage in the economy is somewhere around 40% at a maximum.  In advance of implementation of the directive, there has been engagement at a high-level group comprising employer and union representatives.  The Government has accepted three very important recommendations around how to increase collective bargaining coverage.  These are to increase the use of the joint labour committee system and remove employers' veto on the operation of that system; increase the adequacy of the 2015 legislation whereby employees can make a claim to the Labour Court if their employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining by making that process much easier; and, more important, to encourage and provide a legislative framework for good faith bargaining whereby employers will be required to negotiate and have discussions with union representatives where unions represent employees in an enterprise.  People remember the LloydsPharmacy dispute, which was the most recent of several such disputes, in which the employer simply refused to negotiate with the union that represented its workers.  That will not be possible any more if the report of the high-level group is transposed into law in the way in which its report envisages.</p> <p>  There are other provisions in the directive around how public procurement can be used to increase collective bargaining coverage.  How that will be done is yet to be worked out.  As the Deputy said, it is a very important directive and its transposition will be crucial.  Members of the Oireachtas can have a strong role in ensuring the recommendations of the high-level group are implemented and active measures to increase collective bargaining coverage are put in place.</p></speech>

When we talk about low pay, there is an obvious focus on the national minimum wage but it is not the only tool to address low pay.  I am conscious that while some 7% or 8% of people are on the national minimum wage, between one fifth and one quarter of all workers in the economy are classified as being low paid.  As this meeting is taking place, there is a large crowd in the D&aacute;il Gallery watching the Labour Party motion on section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers and community employment scheme workers and the appalling situation they have found themselves in, whereby they have not seen a pay increase in 14 years.  I would like to hear the views of the ICTU witnesses on this sizeable group of workers, many of whom are low paid, who are providing a vital service to the State in the health, disability and other sectors and who have not seen any sort of pay improvement for well over a decade.</p><p>Does ICTU have strong views about how we ultimately crack that nut and ensure those workers are better paid because they form a large part of the low paid in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#G00200"><p>The workers referred to by the Senator work for organisations that rely predominantly on State funding.  For many years before the financial crash in 2008, in providing resources to the organisations in which these workers work, Governments would have provided money to give workers either the increases applying in the public sector or another type of increase.  There was a link between what was happening in the wider economy and the grant paid by Government.  When the Government of the day cut public sector pay in 2008, it also insisted on the pay of these workers being cut.  We had a campaign to restore that pay that was partially successful but the majority of these workers have not received a pay increase for over 14 years.  The only way we can see that happening is if there is a mechanism through which there is a sectoral collective bargaining mechanism that allows employers and unions to discuss how wages should be adjusted in light of the circumstances these organisations face with the Government playing an active role in that in providing resources for whatever the results of those negotiations are.  Unless we have something like that, we will not solve this problem.  I noted that last Friday the T&aacute;naiste said that the Government would provide &euro;100 million or &euro;110 million for one portion of the problem, that is, the section 39 organisations, but we have yet to see the detail of that.  It does not solve the problem for the remaining workers who would be classified as being in the voluntary and community sector who need an active process of collective bargaining that would allow their wages to keep pace with wage growth in the economy generally.</p></speech>

What strikes me is the number of people who are stuck on the minimum wage.  There is a perception that the minimum wage is a labour market entry wage or that people move off it fairly quickly but we know that 56% of those on the minimum wage are on it for 12 months or more while 23% of those on the minimum wage are on it for four years or more.  How do we fix that?  The minimum wage is supposed to be this wage floor upon which people can progress and yet we are seeing very substantial numbers stuck on that wage for a particularly long period of time.</p></speech>

In Scandinavian countries, whose model we all believe should be followed, minimum wages across the board do not exist.  They set minimum wages through collective bargaining in sectors.  The Low Pay Commission does not exist in countries like Sweden and Norway but collective bargaining produces good-quality outcomes, prevents low pay and inequality and increases workers' spending power.  All of the evidence points to collective bargaining as being the way to deal with the problem.</p></speech>

There is the bit relating to joint labour committees, the bit relating to enterprise bargaining and the bit relating to good faith bargaining.  How will it play out in the medium term and who will see the benefit the most?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Berney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#G00800"><p>At the industrial relations news conference last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste said that he envisaged the directive being transposed by the end of 2023.  However, it requires either amending or primary legislation to bring about the changes about which we have spoken that form part of the high-level group report.  Members of the Oireachtas have a crucial role to play in ensuring that the report is implemented.  However, there are no recommendations relating to other provisions in the report, particularly around public procurement and using public procurement as a tool to encourage collective bargaining.  If the T&aacute;naiste is faithful to his word, we should see enacting legislation or a draft Bill very shortly if the process is to end by the end of 2023.  The devil is in the detail.  I remember when the information and consultation directive at national level was being trumpeted as the directive that will increase collective bargaining coverage through information and consultation.  The transposition process was a disaster because it excluded firms with fewer than 50 employees, which made it meaningless for most workers because, as we all know, many workers work in small and medium-sized enterprises, so transposition is crucial.  The legislation that transposes the directive and the high-level group report is where the game will be won or lost.</p></speech>

I know employer groups were asked to come in but it is always good to have the balance and, hopefully, we will have that again in the future.  I have stated a number of times in this committee that I would support a living wage but it must be done on a phased basis that is cognisant of the pressures in the marketplace.  Oftentimes when we have these discussions, we tend to use large employers with the ability to pay as the standard across the working environment when that is certainly not the case.</p> <p>  Dr. Bambrick identified two sectors with regard to SMEs with 54% of low-paid workers working in hospitality and retail.  As a general rule, if one walked in and found 20 or 30 people in an organisation, how many of those does she believe would be represented by the minimum wage?</p></speech>

In particular, I think retail will see the most fall off in jobs over the next three to six months.  I think it will be the sector that suffers the most.  In fact, it is already happening largely because of competition, inflation and affordability.  Although we want to raise wages, how does it help workers if we increase business costs at a time when business volume is reducing?  Regarding whether we do a one-step or phased increase, I do not think we have a choice other than to consider a phased increase.  We have full employment.</p><p>What is Dr. Bambrick's perception of the labour market over the next six months in terms of where she sees indicators going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#H00200"><p>Retail and hospitality have a jobs problem at the moment.  They have problems finding individuals who are willing to take up those jobs and, specifically, in recruiting and retaining people in those roles.  That is because workers are acting with their feet and moving to employers that can guarantee them more predictable hours, more secure employment and better pay that allows them to have an adequate standard of living.  That is the biggest problem facing retail and hospitality.</p> <p>  The other issue is the question of whether it is right to inflict an adequate minimum wage on certain sectors.  As was mentioned at the outset, this is coming from European law.  It is not about a small group within the Government using their leverage to push through a very noble pet project.  We know that the European law will be signed by the end of this year, and two months after it goes into the journal, the clock will be ticking down for two years in the context of having a process in place to ensure that no worker will be earning less than 60% of the median wage.  This is happening; it is not some idea that was dreamed up by trade unions.  It will soon be law.  As my colleague mentioned, Ireland has the fourth highest rate of low pay in the eurozone and the eighth highest in the EU 27.  All of the countries that do not have the level of low pay still have vibrant retail and hospitality sectors.  The idea that paying staff an adequate wage is the difference between a viable business or not is just a fallacy.  It just does not add up.  There is no evidence to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022101200002#H00300"><p>With respect, we have to take the wider economy into consideration.  We will probably see, over the next six months, where the fallacy lies in terms of the cost of employment.  I would say that the costs relating to employment are not divorced from the other inflationary costs in the business environment.  Unfortunately, costs are going north at a time when revenues are going south.  I am all for adequate wages and a living wage in principle, but we are at full employment at the moment.  Obviously, there are some industries in which people with very low skill levels unfortunately do not have much bargaining power and are therefore subject to only being offered the minimum wage.  We have a lot of talented people in the workforce who are doing far better than that.  Our biggest problem is inflation eating into everybody's ability to pay.  I am a supporter of adequate wages for people.  Obviously, I would like to see everybody earning enough money to pay their bills, live, eat and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  All I am concerned about are the two issues that Dr. Bambrick mentioned.  One is the single step transition up to a living wage.  I do not think it is possible to deliver in the economy.  It will cause a lot of damage to the SME sector.  The second issue that was discussed is collective bargaining across all sectors.  Again, that is going to be very difficult for the SME community.  That is where my interest lies primarily, as a member of this committee.  I would like to see us taking stock and taking time to reflect on all these changes.  As Deputy Bruton outlined earlier, we have made a number of significant advancements in terms of pay and social supports for employees over the last year, with more to come.  All of this has been loaded onto the SME sector, which employs 1 million people in this country.  I am dealing with many business owners at the moment who are in significant financial distress and are reporting significant losses.  Adding more costs to their businesses is not going to make them any more sustainable.</p></speech>

Unless people want to come back in a second time, I have a question for Dr. Bambrick.  She said that 3% of companies have more than half of their staff on the minimum wage.  Without mentioning any companies, do we know whether it is a particular problem with a number of bigger companies?  Is one company distorting the 3% figure?</p></speech>

I do not have the names of employers to reel off anyway, so the Chairman does not need to worry about cutting my mic.  We know that it is 3% of all companies in the economy, but that those companies are more likely based in two sectors, the hospitality and retail sectors.  I am not sure if there is a correlation between the size of the employment and the minimum wage.  We hear a lot about the SME sector, but it is the bigger part of our economy.  Most workers are in workplaces with fewer than 50 employees.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Durkan and Doherty.  Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will be substituting for Deputy Doherty.  All those present in the room today are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risks of contracting Covid 19.  For those of us here and those watching, we have broken up this session, as we did last week, into two sessions.  We have Animation Ireland, Screen Guild Ireland and Screen Producers Ireland with us now and in the later session, we will have Screen Ireland.  I thank everybody for their co-operation.  There are many voices in this debate and it is really useful that everyone is co-operating in terms of getting everybody into the room.</p> <p>  I would like to welcome Ms Louise Cornally, Ms Moe Honan and Mr. Ronan McCabe from Animation Ireland; Mr. Eoin Holohan, Mr. Greg Keeley and Ms Jessica Drum from Screen Guild Ireland; and Ms Aoife O'Sullivan, Mr. James Hickey and Ms Susan Kirby from Screen Producers Ireland.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity, although I do not think that pertains to today's session.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Throughout the proceedings I might give a little reminder if the committee strays into territory where it might be making people identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I will now go to opening statements.  We will start with Mr. Ronan McCabe from Animation Ireland who will be followed by Ms Jessica Drum from Screen Guild Ireland and by Ms Susan Kirby from Screen Producers Ireland.</p></speech>

Animation Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of the extension of section 481 to 31 December 2028.  Animation is a global business and is expensive to produce and projects are in planning many years in advance of production and distribution.  This announcement will give certainty to our members in the financing and production of animation projects.</p> <p>  Animation Ireland is the representative body for the animation industry on the island of Ireland, with 42 member studios, employing approximately 2,500 people full time.  The sector is well spread geographically with members operating in all parts of the island.   There are established creative hubs in Belfast, Galway and Kilkenny and other members' studios are located in the counties of Clare, Cork, Derry, Offaly, Louth and Roscommon.  Members are producing 2D and 3D animation for television and feature films and immersive content for the domestic and international market.  The mix of our inherent national creativity and business acumen, coupled with our section 481 tax credit, has created a fertile ground in which the animation sector is growing exponentially.  Animation Ireland members produce award winning, globally celebrated animation that is viewed in more than 180 countries and territories worldwide, building companies of scale, creating high-value, all-island and regionally spread investment and employment, embracing new technologies and nurturing Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen.</p> <p>  Animation Ireland comprises a range of companies, from one or two person operations running "ideas factories" to large-scale studios employing hundreds of animators, working in both the Irish and English language.  The unique regional spread of companies was aided by the regional uplift and Animation Ireland would like to express its disappointment that this incentive has not been extended.  Animation Ireland operates at the centre of a very sophisticated ecosystem and has regular engagement with stakeholders.  Working in tandem with the industry, Animation Ireland has developed and implemented training programmes that are opening doors to many young people whose entry into the workforce will sustain the growth of the industry in the coming years.  </p> <p>  Animation is a global and a competitive business.  It is very labour intensive and expensive to produce.</p><p>Other jurisdictions offer a variety of regional and national tax credits, often exceeding that available here, and if Ireland is to remain competitive, it is essential that our tax credit is retained.</p><p> The animation industry in Ireland comprises two major components, namely, service work, which consists of producing animation for international partners by way of foreign direct investment, and our own intellectual property, IP, story development.  Most Irish animation studios attempt to find a balance between service work, which affords companies the ability to build their studios and gain expertise by working with the major animation financiers and broadcasters, and reinvesting that expertise and capital into developing our own series and stories.  The animation industry in Ireland has proven remarkably successful in both of those endeavours.  In recent years, Ireland has been home to major productions such as "The Bob&rsquo;s Burgers Movie", "The Cuphead Show!", "Vampirina" and "Zog and the Flying Doctors".  These productions alone saw investments in Ireland of tens of millions of euro and served to showcase Irish creative talent.  It is not only international stories that are told by Irish studios.  Section 481 also supports indigenous production.  Recent examples of which include the Oscar-nominated "Wolfwalkers", "Two by Two: Overboard!", "Jessy and Nessy", "Kiva Can Do!" and "Pins and Nettie".</p><p> There is a strong competitive environment for inward production or foreign direct investment in the locating of animation television series and film productions in EU member states.  Ireland has punched well above its weight in that regard, and continues to do so.  Many studios get their start by taking on service work and thereby gaining the experience to develop, pitch and produce their own projects.</p><p> The growth of major subscription video on demand, SVOD, streaming services, including Apple+, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, in the past ten years has meant that demand for content has never been greater.  This has provided opportunities and threats for our industry.  On the plus side, there are well resourced customers seeking content but, on the downside, many SVODs insist on retaining 100% of the IP in the content.  The ability of Irish producers to bring Irish financing to a project in the form of section 481 and broadcaster and screen agency investments is critical to Irish studios&rsquo; ability to retain IP.  The funds generated from IP are then invested in the development of future projects - securing jobs, building companies of scale and creating a virtuous circle of investment for companies.</p><p> Screen content plays a vital role in how Ireland is perceived abroad and is an essential element of our cultural exports and the projection of Ireland&rsquo;s soft power.  Without indigenous content, Irish audiences would not see their stories reflected back at them on screen and diverse storytelling voices simply would not be heard.  Without section 481, our domestic market simply would not have the resources to bring our stories to the world.  Any review of section 481 must, of course, include a financial analysis for the taxpayer, but it must also include a full recognition of the cultural dividend of screen content production made in Ireland for Irish and global audiences.  On behalf of Animation Ireland, I thank the committee.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr.Keeley, is also a non-executive director on the board of SGI.  He works as a model maker in the Irish film and television industry.  Ms Drum is the chief executive officer of SGI and, prior to taking up that role, worked for many years in the camera department in the Irish film and television industry.  On behalf of SGI, we thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the film credit.<br/><br/>SGI represents Irish film and television industry crew and their respective guilds who play a vital role in every aspect of production across the various departments within the Irish film and television industry.  We currently represent more than 2,500 Irish film and television crew, both PAYE and self-employed, spanning 22 departments.  Our focus is predominantly in the area of skills training and development across many departments, including accounts, art, assistant directors, camera, construction, continuity, costume, facilities, editing, grips, hair, locations, make-up, model-making, production, prosthetics, set decoration, sound, special effects, stunts, transport and visual effects.  We are continuing to grow and we endeavour, in time, to be fully inclusive of the Irish film industry as a whole.  We are a proud community of crew working together in a creative industry, utilising a wide range of individual skills, crafts, experience, and expertise with one common goal - to promote excellence in the art of film making, both here in Ireland and through recognition abroad.<br/><br/>SGI aims to promote excellence in all fields of film and television production in Ireland through the representation of its member guilds, made up primarily of Irish film crew.  Each department or guild nominates a crew member to represent it in discussion and negotiation of all business relating to our professions within the industry.  Our members were involved in securing a new working agreement in 2022, including the introduction of the provision for the construction workers' pension scheme, CWPS, which is a welcome progression for the welfare of the crew.  SGI, as a representative for these guilds, is proactive in its direct engagement with F&iacute;s Eireann-Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, SIPTU, Screen Skills Ireland and other recognised industry bodies on all matters concerning our members, namely, Irish film crew.<br/><br/>SGI is committed to establishing and promoting a fair and transparent working environment for all film crew engaged in film and TV production in Ireland, spanning national and international productions of all scales and genres.  We are committed to the continued training and upskilling of our members through all grades, ranging from entry-level trainees right through to heads of department, and to the introduction of a fair and transparent upgrade process within the various departments we represent.<br/><br/>Film and television production is an ever-evolving industry and we aim to safeguard our collective interests while upholding the highest of standards in production.  Our members, across all guilds, are passionate about working in the Irish film industry and are highly regarded worldwide.  We have internationally recognised writers, directors, directors of photography, production designers, costume designers, hair and make-up designers and visual effects technicians to name but a few.  We relish the challenges of working across different genres on indigenous and international productions.  We understand that a healthy Irish film industry requires international inward production, shooting in tandem with indigenous Irish productions.  We enjoy bringing the skills we learn on international films to smaller Irish films, and often <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>The screen sector is currently undergoing a period of intense growth.  We must attract new entrants to the industry to cope with this demand.  We must ensure that these new crew receive proper training while also ensuring that existing crew members have the opportunity to upskill and progress their careers.  Our membership of more than 2,500 crew continues to grow at a rapid pace with the introduction of these new entrants to the industry and returning professionals.<br/><br/>SGI welcomes the extension of section 481 to 2028 as confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  We recognise and acknowledge that section 481 has been, and continues to be, crucial to the existence and continued development of our industry.  Section 481 affords all of us the opportunity to work and establish careers in a vibrant and creative industry where we can develop skills that allow us to work across the many different genres of film and television.  We are proud to be a part of the Irish film industry, and we do not take it for granted.  We were especially pleased to see the introduction of the skills development plan in 2018 as part of the application process for section 481 funding.</p><p>Since 2019, Screen Ireland has assessed over 160 skills development plans and has tracked over 1,700 skills participants across 160 section 481 productions.  The benefit to our members is obvious.  This emphasis on skills development within the structure of section 481 compelled us at SGI to consult our membership and develop our competency framework, which is an informative breakdown document for all crew grades across the various departments in the Irish film industry.  We completed this work in consultation with the Screen Guilds of Ireland at Screen Ireland.  This was a very significant undertaking and is the first of its kind for our industry in the world.  The framework is an invaluable tool to crew and it exists as a direct result of the emphasis on skills development within section 481.</p><p> We are concerned that the regional uplift continues to decrease and there is no allowance for it in the recent extension to section 481.  It is essential that the industry grows and is nurtured in the regions, as well as in the production hub of Dublin and Wicklow.  This will require further incentives to locate production in the regions but we are confident that this would pay dividends in the long term.  We would like to be involved in a discussion with all stakeholders to reach a consensus on how best to promote filming in the regions and create an industry that is nationwide.  We look forward with a positive outlook to the extension of section 481 and especially welcome any opportunity to be involved in future developments of this tax credit as we continue to work in a career full of possibilities within the Irish film and television industries.</p></speech>

SPI is a national representative organisation of independent film, television, animation and digital production companies.  With over 170 company members, SPI is recognised as the voice of independent audiovisual production in Ireland.  SPI members are creative entrepreneurs who produce globally celebrated film, animation and television material.  They create high-value, all-island and regionally spread employment, foster Ireland&rsquo;s culture on screen and preserve Ireland&rsquo;s artistic heritage.  SPI comprises a range of production companies, from emerging producers to producers of large-scale high-end film and television series, working in both the Irish and English languages.<br/><br/>We are happy to appear before this committee again.  We appeared here previously in 2019 to discuss section 481 and we had a positive engagement at the meeting.  We note in the invitation the request that only matters directly related to the section 481 tax expenditure that are under the remit of this committee are to be discussed.  Therefore, we have kept our opening statement to this area.  We hope that our statement and subsequent discussion will inform the committee of the vital role that section 481 plays in the sustainability of the Irish screen sector, both for incoming and indigenous productions.<br/><br/>At the outset, I must welcome the budget 2023 announcement that section 481 has been extended to 2028, something which SPI called for in its pre-budget discussions.  It is worth adding that this decision was made on foot of a positive recommendation to do so in a 50-page cost-benefit collective analysis completed recently by the Department of Finance.  This report included a detailed analysis of how section 481 works, gave details on the great advances that have been made in the film and television production sector in training and upscaling, and set out the very significant progress that has been made in industrial relations, including the two new collective bargaining agreements which have been concluded in the past couple of years.<br/><br/>Section 481 is one of the most crucial incentive schemes for independent producers in Ireland.  It provides much-needed tax relief for eligible productions.  This extension provides much-needed clarity for independent producers seeking to undertake long-term production planning.  The Government has shown us through the extension of section 481 to 2028 that it realises the potential of international and indigenous production here in Ireland.  I know that our producer members, crew and casts will create the world-class, award-winning content that they have the ability to create.  However, we are disappointed that there was no extension of the regional uplift which proved very valuable in bringing productions out of the Dublin-Wicklow hub.  The uplift has seen considerable production activity across the country from Kerry to Donegal and SPI will continue to advocate for its return in some form.<br/><br/>As I have mentioned, the Department of Finance released a new cost-benefit analysis of section 481 which showed the growth in the sector in both employment and economic size since the previous analysis in 2019.  The Department analysis noted: </p> <blockquote> 	Supporting the development of a thriving Irish audio-visual sector remains an objective of the Government.  By providing tax relief to Irish producer companies in respect of qualifying films the scheme directly contributes to the growth of a creative screen production industry in the State. </blockquote> <p>The Department also pointed out that it is important that we begin to capture the cultural dividend of section 481 projects beyond economics alone.  We are glad to see that Screen Ireland will be releasing a cultural dividend report on section 481 in the coming weeks and we believe this will show a significant impact.  SPI believes that with this clear statement of support from the Government, our sector can reach the targets set out in the Government's audiovisual action plan, which seeks to double employment in film, television and animation, and double the economic worth of the sector.  The Creative Ireland programme audiovisual action plan also sets out the role of section 481 in contributing to the development and sustainability of the Irish screen industry, supporting jobs in the domestic economy, which is a strategic cultural industry, and supporting the tourism sector in Ireland.  This can be seen through Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally.<br/><br/>The past decade has seen Irish productions being nominated for over 30 Oscar nominations which is a very significant achievement for a country of our size.  &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; is breaking Irish and UK box office records for an Irish-language feature film, surpassing &euro;1 million at the box office.  It has been chosen as the Irish entry to the International Feature Film Oscar and is being touted as a possible nominee.  The key to all of this success is the ability of Irish producers to hold on to intellectual property for their projects.  By retaining intellectual property, producers can reinvest into new development for projects which enables them to grow their company into one of scale.  This is a key issue for SPI in the coming years.<br/><br/>It is important to note the economic return of section 481.  According to the Government-commissioned Olsberg report, for every &euro;1 of the cost of section 481, &euro;1.02 in tax revenues was paid to the Government and there was an economic net benefit of &euro;2.82 from the activities supported.  We firmly believe that this return on investment has increased in the years since then due to the increasing size of the sector and that section 481 is a good return on investment on behalf of the taxpayer.<br/><br/>With the arrival in Europe of major streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, over the past ten years, the scale of screen content production, which was already at high levels in film and television production, has increased dramatically.  There is a strong competitive environment for inward production, which is the locating of films, television drama, animation and games in EU member states.  Ireland has done well for all of the reasons it has done well in other areas of inward investment, including its talented and creative workforce, the English language and its proximity to the UK - which is the largest single production country in Europe - as well as the film tax credit and other supports currently in place.<br/><br/>It is important that we reflect on the types of productions that section 481 supports in this country, both incoming and indigenous.  It supports multi-million budget television dramas such as the Apple TV-funded sci-fi drama series &quot;Foundations&quot;, which was shot in Troy Studios in Limerick.  The challenging new feature film &quot;Aisha&quot;, which was directed by Frank Berry and is set in Ireland's direct provision system, recently screened and received great reviews at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York.  Section 481 also supports recently released Irish indigenous productions like the worldwide success that is &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; and the newly released &quot;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank&quot;, both of which were also supported by the Cine4 scheme.  Documentaries like &quot;Vicky&quot; and &quot;Nothing Compares&quot;, both of which were released in cinemas last week, are supported by section 481, as are television dramas such as &quot;Kin&quot; and &quot;Normal People&quot; on RT&Eacute;.</p><p> SPI welcomes the opportunity to engage with the committee.  We look forward to a good discussion about section 481 and its impact on the screen sector.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; acu ansin thar a bheith suimi&uacute;il.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and for taking the time out to do so.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the cost-benefit analysis the Department undertook, which was published along with budget 2023 and which found that the net economic cost of the credit in 2020 was &euro;78.5 million.  In other words, a net welfare loss to society.  The witnesses will mention intangible benefits that cannot be quantified in such an analysis.  In terms of euro and cent, however, do they agree that is a worrying finding for the taxpayer?  All three groups can answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#D00300"><p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  We welcomed the cost-benefit analysis report.  It is a detailed report.  It sets the policy context of the investment of section 481 on behalf of the State in so far as it places it firmly within Government policy to support the arts and, within that, the audiovisual sector.  It points clearly to a rigorous process attached to section 481 and details the process the producer companies go through to attain section 481.  It also speaks widely to the great progress that has been made.  The last time the cost-benefit analysis was published was 2019.  It speaks in detail to the industry development test and the cultural test which are attached to section 481.  On the industry test, which is part of the foundation of quality employment, it makes the point that:</p> <blockquote> 	Since the publication of the first WRC report on the Irish Film and Television Drama Production Sector, significant progress has been made in relation to agreements between employers and worker representatives.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The introduction of these two industry agreements, negotiated and agreed between employees and producer representative bodies, demonstrate the ongoing focus on promoting positive work practices to ensure that the Irish audio-visual industry is attractive to employees and as a location in which to produce feature film and high-end TV drama. </blockquote> <p>It is an important point that is made in the cost-benefit analysis.<br/><br/>The Deputy raised the ultimate net economic being negative.  There are a number of factors to that.  That was also the case in a previous analysis.  The factors include the dead weighting attached to the economic findings.  There is an interesting table in the cost-benefit analysis, which I am sure the Deputies have read.  It is a fascinating document.  If we remove the dead weight and the concept of shadow costs of labour, for example, the cost-benefit analysis will quickly report a positive and points to the necessity to apply to what I referred to as the cultural dividend.  The Deputy also referred to the intangibles.  It is around that creative, cultural dividend delivered by section 481.<br/><br/>The recommendations from the cost-benefit analysis were to extend section 481, which all here have welcomed.  It looked to have more data, and, again, we would welcome if more quality data was gathered to allow us create the economic case around section 481.  It also pointed to the idea that Screen Ireland will be producing a cultural dividend report which will allow us to apply the full economic and cultural benefit of section 481.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I take Ms Kirby's point that with cultural things there is more than just dollars and cents but the question was specifically on that.</p> <p>  I will move on to the reference in SPI's opening statement to the role of section 481 in attracting foreign direct investment.  We know many production companies availing of the relief are foreign.  Do the witnesses have any information on the proportion of credits through section 481 relief that remain within the State and the proportion that are repatriated out of the State?  I would also be interested in that analysis and to hear witnesses' view because I have heard in the past the relief has effectively become a taxpayers' subsidy to foreign production companies.  I am sure the witnesses disagree but how would they respond to that?</p></speech>

On the first half of the question, there is a requirement that any recipient of section 481 is an Irish production company.  Even in the case of inbound production, there is a benefit to the Irish production ecosystem.  That requirement of attaching to an Irish producer is something I imagine ourselves and Animation Ireland would advocate strongly.  That is there and provides protection.  Mr. Holohan referred well in his opening statement to the idea of inbound production being that we need a balance between both.  Our vision is for a balanced sector with strong inbound production.  That allows producers, crews and casts to have experience on major TV, drama and film production, while balancing it with indigenous so we can potentially have a diverse ecosystem and sustainable career in the creative industries.  Screen Ireland should be commended for the great work it does.  It is something Ireland does very well.  We have a global reputation for producing incredible inbound work and we would like to see a strong balance between indigenous and inbound sectors, and a strong ecosystem.  Key to that is a sustainable, diverse career working across the two elements.</p></speech>

It gets thrown out there quite a lot.  At the core of this, we have to remember that section 481 is in place to support and build the industry and create talent.  Without international players coming to Ireland, we would not have that ability.  The EU Commission recognises that Europe needs subsidies and the countries need to support local producers in order to attract production which allows them build on the indigenous industry.</p><p>We are competing with very strong US-based production entities.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we must remain competitive in order to maintain the industry which is at the heart of all of this.  If we did not have section 481, essentially, we would not have an industry.  It is very important to make that point, alongside the question of section 481 subsidising foreign productions because when a producer is looking at where he or she is going to produce animation, a live action film or a TV series, he or she will look at tax credits that are currently available right across the globe.  If we did not have the tax credit, essentially, we would not have an industry here.  That is the first point about the international studios either shooting or producing animation here.</p><p>In terms of producing IP, and the indigenous companies producing their own content and retaining some rights, it is extremely challenging to do that whether it is animation or live action.  If one is going to finance your own production, the budget can range from &euro;1.5 million right up to &euro;15 million or &euro;16 million - that would be spent locally - in order to finance it one might go to international broadcasters to get licence fees - there are multiple ways of financing it - but there would always be a gap in the production.  There is simply no way an Irish company could produce that content without having section 481 in place, so it does also come back to the indigenous industry here in that regard.  Despite the fact that there are international broadcasters attached to it, the point I want to make is that they are not going to fully finance the full cost of the production via a licence agreement.</p></speech>

I know Deputy Farrell mentioned it in her opening remarks.  Animation Ireland represented Ireland at Expo 2020 in Dubai this year.  We were at the Ireland pavilion.  We had three days of Irish animation being exhibited over there, both at the Al Wasl dome and on site.  It was a fantastic event to be at in terms of the projection of Irish soft power and Irish stories.  We were very much front and centre of the Ireland offering at Expo.  There were more than 200 countries there.  It is difficult to put a price or value on that.  Even when we go to markets and festivals, a significant amount of people come up to the Ireland stand and inquire about the projects that they have seen.  They want to visit and come and work in Ireland because of that.  It is a worthwhile exercise to try and put a value on that.  I do not have those figures to hand but it would definitely be something worth doing.</p></speech>

We have been waiting to have this conversation for a long time.  I am grateful that the witnesses have shown up in such numbers.  Clearly, it is an indication of how seriously they take the issue.  I hope I am not misrepresenting him, but Deputy Boyd Barrett has been particularly exercised in simple terms on the broader issue of pay and conditions, in particular for those who are considered to be lower down the food chain.  The witnesses have spoken about the issue in general terms.  To some extent, it is at the heart of why the witnesses are here, so I will spend a little bit of time on the issue.  I have eight and three quarter minutes left, so I will give the witnesses time to respond until we have five minutes left and then I might raise my hand again.

It is a key tenet of section 481 but it is a core issue for the industry.  If I can, I might reflect back to 2019 when Screen Producers Ireland, the ICTU-affiliated union group and SIPTU requested the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to conduct an audit of the sector.  I understand it carried out very broad consultation and it came up with four recommendations.  I will not go into the audit in great detail, but I will give the committee an update on it.  One of the recommendations was the importance of the guild structure.  We can see today that there is a very well organised and strategically focused set of guilds.  We work very closely with the guilds.  Similarly, they are developing competency frameworks.  We welcome the development of competency frameworks for the guilds.  The simplest description of the competency frameworks is a journey map for one's development through one's career at the various grades in the guilds.  That was the first element and it is being delivered on and that continues to be the case.</p> <p>  The second area concerns HR and the development of HR capacity within the producer communities.  Screen Producers Ireland has placed an enormous emphasis on sectoral development.  We have a dedicated role within the company for sectoral development.  We run detailed HR development programmes for members and we work in collaboration with Screen Ireland, previously Screen Skills Ireland, on the delivery of those.  We continue to focus on the area.  It is not a destination; it is a constant journey.</p> <p>  The third recommendation that was made was in the space of industrial relations, IR.  It placed significant importance of the industrial agreements.  In 2019-----</p></speech>

In that structure we have minimum rates set out for trainees.  SIPTU has a preproduction meeting at the start of every production when we go through all of the plans for the job.  We organise a meeting every month with SIPTU and the representatives from each of those departments.  Each department has a guild and its representatives come along to the meeting and they can discuss any issues that they might have.  That is the communication channel that is there.  We all recognise that the best way to learn in film is to be on the floor.  It is not something that one can learn in a classroom.  I was a trainee myself in the camera department.  That is the only way to learn the trade.</p></speech>

When we formed the guilds, we needed a new agreement.  We approached SIPTU and, between it and SPI, we now have a new agreement.  It is working quite well.  The guilds structure we have maintains communication among crew members.  I am a crew member, as is Mr. Keeley.  Communication is maintained between all the productions that are happening.  If an industrial relations issue arises on a production, it is dealt with very quickly.  A crew member can come to us, and we can go to SIPTU.  We are in our infancy but the system is working.</p></speech>

I have two minutes after all that.  I am sorry this is such short, sharp stuff.  If SGI is in its infancy, as Mr. Holohan says, I would certainly be interested in being kept abreast of how it develops and in the committee having a monitoring brief regarding it.  I am serious about that.</p> <p>  I am aware that the expenditure of companies in Ireland as a result of productions was &euro;500 million last year.  That is phenomenal.  I am old enough to remember the closure of Ardmore and the devastating effect.  Walking along a very narrow coast road in Achill last year, I came to a bend and saw a stop-start traffic system.  I was trying to figure out why it was needed and noticed there were guys thatching the cottage roof.  It was part of the film set for "The Banshees of Inisherin", which has just won a major award.</p></speech>

Two thatchers were employed.  The Chair talked about the cultural dividend.  To me, that was one of the obvious ones.  My late mother was from west Kerry, which is still attracting tourists as a result of "Ryan&rsquo;s Daughter", which was made 50 years ago.  I do not know whether Deputy Boyd Barrett will be unhappy with bits and pieces of this yet, but he is right to raise workplace conditions.</p> <p>  I see a world that has opened up for filmmakers, who are young but not exclusively so, actors and everybody else associated with the industry.  My eldest brother was in "Excalibur".  Everybody remembers working as an extra on the set.  The industry has developed well beyond that now.  That guilds of professionals and trades in the film industry have been established is telling.  Section 481 seems to have been critical in this regard.  That is essentially what the delegates are saying.  The industry would not and could not have survived without it.  Without it, we would not be making movies here.</p> <p>  There are other cultural dividends, some of which I am not so happy about.  I am not happy with the impact on Skellig Michael.  I have seen the impact of "Star Wars" on little villages and in Dingle.  It is a question of skills, whereby young people can leave school, get training and know they can have employment in the film sector in Ireland.  It simply was not a reality heretofore; it was very nebulous.</p> <p>  Those are some of the points I wanted to make.  I have two questions.  Is there any potential in the film industry arising from Brexit, because Ireland, along with Malta in the European Union, is an English-speaking country?</p></speech>

Projects can extend for multiple years.  They can take from a year to three or four years.  There is good career progression within that.  There are training plans in place under section 481.  Animation Ireland is the lead organisation for the National Talent Academy for Animation.  Within that academy, we are bridging the gap between college and the industry, making people industry-ready.  We also provide mentoring at all levels, and master classes are being provided.  We are running animation fairs around the country.  Our first was in Athlone.  We are trying to bring people into the sector from non-traditional places.  My colleague Ms Cornally has some statistics on training.</p></speech>

I was just trying to ask whether there was anything specific for us to consider from an animation perspective.  As Mr. McCabe outlined, the industry itself tends to be much more longer term in its commitment to employment because the production schedule is longer.  Owing to the scale, there is a greater ability to focus on the longer-term sustainability of the business investing in learning and development.  Anecdotal evidence indicates one of our members invests 9,000 hours per year in learning and development across all levels of staff and spends about &euro;150,000.  Bearing in mind the individual studios and, as Mr. McCabe mentioned, the establishment of the talent academy that Animation Ireland is leading, we wanted to ask whether members had any specific concerns about the terms and conditions of employment in the animation sector.</p></speech>

This has been really useful and very respectful to the committee.  I might have some more questions later given that the delegates have turned up in such numbers.  I am seeking a brief and to join some dots.  I found our discussion thus far quite reassuring, aside from the obvious exciting pieces that we cannot really develop here and the enthusiasm for what the delegates do.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions on animation.  Our job is to assess whether section 481 is delivering what it is supposed to deliver.  From what I see of the animation industry, it is.  They are companies, full-time jobs and industry development.  The industry is supposed to be developing and growing and creating companies of scale and career opportunities.  That is not to say it is perfect, because I have heard a few stories about particular companies, but it is obvious that there are jobs and an industry.  My questions, therefore, are directed at the live-action sector, where I do not see the jobs.  The credit is supposed to be strictly dependent on creating jobs.  You either create quality employment and training or you do not, and you either contribute to culture or you do not.  In fact, the European rules on this are very clear.  You should not get state aid if you are not doing these things.</p> <p>  I want the film industry to get state aid but do not understand the contrast.  I do not understand how the animation sector can create jobs and companies of scale and how theatres such as the Abbey, Gate and Project can create jobs and careers when given public money while the live-action sector does not.  To put it bluntly, the testimony we heard last week from the Irish Film Workers&rsquo; Association was that every time a production ends, the clock goes back to zero from the point of view of the employee.  In other words, an employee who has worked for successive designated activity companies, DACs, does not have an employer because that employer was his or her last DAC, which is now gone.  Therefore, an employee starts from scratch.  Even if he or she has worked for 20 DACs over 25 years, he or she effectively starts from scratch, meaning no recognition whatsoever of his or her service in the industry.  There is no comeback if, for example, employees are blacklisted, as they say they are.  Many of those who raised concerns about the industry with members of this committee in 2018  have not worked in the industry since.</p><p>Some of the witnesses present know that they have not worked in the industry again even though they were never formally dismissed and there was no process through which they were dismissed.  They just do not get to work again.  I am not here to advocate on individual cases, but I see nothing in how the industry is structured to prevent that from happening.  How does the industry prevent it?<br/><br/>I am confused by the Screen Guilds of Ireland.  I understand it is a private limited company with a CEO and it says that it represents 2,500 workers.  According to the Department's analysis, we only have 2,500 people in the industry and, unlike in animation, only a few of them have full-time jobs, so it is not clear to me how the Screen Guilds of Ireland can represent people when they do not have jobs and it is a private company that I understand is wholly funded by Screen Ireland.  I am confused about that.  Who, then, does SIPTU represent?  There is also the Irish Film Workers Association, although there are not many film workers left in the industry because they do not get jobs anymore.  I do not understand how this works.  Are people right in saying that the clock goes back to zero each time?  Will the witnesses explain the process involved in someone getting a job on an Irish film?  Who does the person go to?  Who decides whether he or she gets employed?<br/><br/>Members of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, get section 481 relief under the explicit requirement that it creates quality employment and training, yet Ms Elaine Geraghty, SPI's former chairperson, told the Labour Court:</p><blockquote>	I will give further evidence before the Court that there is no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment can be said to have existed between the parties hereto.  This is on the basis of the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in this sector, including the operation of Section 481 Relief. </blockquote><p>There were similar testimonies from representatives of some of the large recipients of section 481 relief.  The people who are getting this relief are saying that they have no employees and could not possibly have any, yet they are explicitly given the relief on the basis that they are creating quality employment and training.  This is a contradiction and I would like it explained.</p></speech>

I am delighted that the crews are present to explain the situation from their point of view.</p> <p>  To give a snapshot, I produced three projects in 2021, two of which were regional while the third was in Dublin and Wicklow.  They were two films and a TV drama.  We were lucky enough to get the regional uplift to the tax credit for a film called "Joyride" in Kerry and a TV production called "North Sea Connection" in Galway.  Those projects would not have happened in the regions without the regional uplift.</p> <p>  As part of the regional uplift, it is important that skills, investment and training be taken on.  In some ways, what the Deputy is saying points to a wild west, but it is not like that.  It is heavily regulated.  People have to understand that this is a project-based industry.  We cannot offer continuous employment to crew members.  For one thing, they do not want it because they enjoy the fact that they go from project to project and have a choice.  The industry is also booming and going through a period of intense growth.  Since it is so busy, we cannot get the crews back.  For example, if I wanted to get the same crew for the three projects in Kerry, Galway and Dublin-Wicklow, I could not.  I would love to work with the same people over and over again because we establish great working relationships, but they have moved on to the next-----</p></speech>

There is an employment relationship between the DAC and the employee.  The nature of that employment is defined by the contract.  As Ms O'Sullivan stated, this is a project-based industry and, in large part, the contract is a fixed-term contract.  For various reasons, this is the global norm, including in Ireland.  It is also a career choice.  Speaking as someone who has worked in the creative industries for more than 25 years, and as I imagine some of those present will want to testify, one aspires to work on numerous creative projects.  The concept that one producer company will move between doing a large-scale creative period piece to a small indigenous project to another project is infeasible.  The committee has heard testimony that there would be an aspiration towards permanent employment.</p></speech>

Everyone present will testify to that.</p> <p>  My next point is important because what we are debating is section 481.  Section 481 provides the Government and the taxpayer with an even greater assurance of a high level of compliance.  The DAC is a requirement of section 481 and is exactly what it says on the tin, that being, a designated activity company.  It is for one purpose only.  It provides everyone with transparency and auditability in terms of how the spend happens.  It also exists for up to 12 months after the completion of the project.  Any issue that arises for an employee &ndash; in our experience, this does not occur regularly &ndash; can be dealt with within those confines.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised an important point and I have been pleased to clarify it.

We want to see sustainable, good jobs in a vibrant industry.  Production companies will make section 481 applications.  The designated activity company, DAC, is a special purpose vehicle where the money can be put.  It deals with the ins and outs and all the operations relating to a film.  I am always interested in the rules and regulations regarding how that works out.  All the obligations and costs end up in that.  Eventually, the DAC is put to one side and disappears, for want of a better term.  A question about this came up.  Actors spoke about how they have to sign over their intellectual property, IP.  Who owns the intellectual property after that?  Will someone address the ins and outs in case I have missed anything about how it works and the relationship between the production company and DAC with regard to drawing down the money?</p></speech>

The tax credit is paid to the producer company, which is an ongoing company.  Revenue places great importance on this, because as far as it is concerned, it wants to deal with people it knows and who it is satisfied will stay around for the purposes of continuing compliance with their obligations under section 481.  An equally important matter for both Revenue and business as a whole is the separate special purpose vehicle which is established for each project.  The establishment of special purpose vehicles for each project is a practice which dates to long before section 481 was established.  It was always the case, and still is the case in most other jurisdictions, that for each different project, the financiers and other people involved in the production of a feature film or television drama series want a separate vehicle for each project, because that is the kind of transparency and accountability that the financiers want.  The Revenue Commissioners see the value of that transparency and accountability from having a single company producing the project, so that all the eligible expenditure goes through that production and is seen to be properly spent.  Revenue is happy to look at dealing with eligible expenditure.</p> <p>  I will come back to the separate question about rights ownership.  This depends on the different types of projects which people are undertaking.  In the case of indigenous projects which are produced by indigenous producers, the copyright and distribution rights of the project vest in the producer company.  I will clarify that it is important that the producer company owns all the rights from all the contributors to the project.  That includes all the actors, the director, the writer, the set designer and the costume designer.  Everybody must assign all their rights to the producer company because if it does not own all the rights, the producer company cannot distribute the film.  If the broadcaster, distributor or cinema in Paris is told that one of the people involved in the production has not assigned his or her rights to the project, the cinema owner in Paris will not want to screen the film because the person who owns those rights could come and stop the screening of that film.  The structure of the industry involves all rights from all contributors to the production having to vest in the production company.</p></speech>

An agreement was entered into in 2016 in respect of television drama enters.  There was an agreement in 2019 in respect of docudrama actors.  An agreement was entered into by Screen Producers Ireland and Irish Equity in 2021 in respect of feature film actors.  These agreements included provisions which allowed the actors to receive shares of downstream revenue from the exploitation of television dramas, films and docudramas.  These agreements were all entered in good faith by Screen Producers Ireland and Irish Equity.

Some of that has come from workers, crew members and Irish Equity.  They do not believe that they are represented in the bodies that are here or by Screen Ireland, which will attend.  Whether that is right or wrong, that is the belief.</p> <p>  I will follow up on an issue that Deputy Boyd Barrett dealt with.  There was an accusation of blacklisting.  It is easy to see that if the head of department, HOD, does not ring people, then they are not in play.  We will not be able to determine here whether that happens or not.  There was an accusation of there being a move away from using experienced staff to having far more trainees.  I accept that there will always be trainees since people need to be trained, but at this point, people believe that they are being blacklisted.  They would call it a race to the bottom.</p> <p>  We are under time pressure here.  I am sorry if I am being a bit short.</p></speech>

My understanding of blacklisting is that somebody is in some way discriminated against on the basis of their union membership.  As we sit here today, we are showing the committee the great progress we have made in reaching agreements across five unions.  We are also saying that the last Irish Equity agreement, which, in fact, we co-signed, was negotiated and entered into in good faith and was operational for over a month before Irish Equity exited.  What I will say is that despite the fact it should be the producers who are aggrieved by that, we are sitting here today asking that, potentially, one of the outcomes of this committee would be to encourage Irish Equity to come back to the negotiating table and reach an agreement.  This actually fulfils a lot of what its issues were in terms of dealing with the copyright directive, in our opinion.  That would be the opinion of the missives attached in explanation of the copyright directive.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a very important point in regard to trainees.  Not just in our industry but across industry, we are seeking to encourage trainees to join.</p></speech>

SGI will also speak to this.  As part of the industry test, it is around identifying a head of department or a suitably qualified individual who will work with the trainee, be it through mentorship, shadowing or whatever, in order to develop their career.  The industry should stand proudly over the fact that it is bringing in trainees.  We would encourage that even more, if I can use this platform to say so.  It is a fantastic and vibrant industry.  We would absolutely aspire to sustainable careers and I would 100% agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p> <p>  Any suggestion that a trainee is replacing somebody who is deeply experienced is, again, probably not for me to refute, but I imagine that SGI is in a good position to speak to the Deputy on that.  We would welcome the idea of the growth of trainees.  How else are we to achieve the great aspirations that have been set out in the audiovisual action plan?</p></speech>

I work as a location manager and I am a head of department.  On my recent job which just wrapped two weeks ago, I had three trainees.  There were up to five at one stage.  On the job previous to that, we had two.  On the job I did this time last year - the job that Deputy Lahart came across - I would have had at one stage maybe five trainees.  They are all different.  Some of them might be available to do my next job, which is great, and some are not and they bounce on to another job.</p> <p>  When those trainees come to work on the film I am working on, or to work in my department, we monitor their progress and we teach them the skills because we want to hang on to them.  We need them.  I need those trainees to develop into location assistants and to then become assistant location managers.</p></speech>

I have been in this industry for 25 years.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked how people get a job.  I got a job as a trainee.  I knocked on a door and asked could I have a job on a film set, and that is what I got.  People acquire the skills and they move up through the grades.  There has always been training on the set from the crew: you teach your crew the skills that you have, and that is how it progresses.  In 2018, when skills development came into section 481, it was fantastic for us because, finally, the crew were recognised and the skills development progress was recognised as a requirement.  We want trainees to come into the industry.  I do not want them to have it as hard as I did and, although I am not playing the violin, there have been tough years in the past, when people could not get work and they would be hoping the phone would ring, but it would ring.  People do go from job to job.  I and the people who work with me want to work on different types of films.  I want to work on big budget international movies and I want to work on indigenous Irish productions; I have worked on both and that is how I made my career.  For the trainees that come into my department, that is how I train them up, and they then move on and work for another location manager.  Maybe the next time they come around in my direction, they will be a location assistant because they will have acquired those skills and moved on.</p></speech>

In terms of the model we are working with here, and speaking on behalf of Animation Ireland, we also work with actors for voice work.  In our model, where we are co-producing all of the time with partners across Europe in my case, and others with other international partners, we are in a position where we have to negotiate a buyout because, otherwise, as Mr. Hickey alluded to, no distributor will sell a film and no distributor will screen it.  I want to make the point that, in that context, that buyout fee is higher than a daily fee, so it is compensated for upfront as opposed to back-end, where, frankly, the actor may never get anything.</p></speech>

If there are two words which are repeated over and over throughout the whole copyright directive, they are &ldquo;collective bargaining&rdquo;.  The copyright directive is there to protect authors and performers.  We want to conclude collective bargaining agreements as the very best way of looking after remuneration for authors and performers.  If there is a takeaway from all of this, we would love to recommend that much greater effort be put into the encouragement and incentivisation of collective bargaining.  We would very much welcome that.</p></speech>

I will then open it to a second round.  We must finish for the next session, which is at 7.30 p.m.</p> <p>  I want to use my short time to talk about regional uplift, its future and the view of each representative group on that.  I will start with SGI because I am trying to get a sense with regard to the workers and the guilds.  We have not heard from Mr. Keeley.  He has my dream job, which is model building.  I might offer to swap as I would love that job.  I want to get a sense of how that works in terms of trainees and people on set who are providing particular skills.  The impression from the outside is that people travel to particular projects.  I am interested in the guilds approach to regional uplift and how important it is to SGI.  Is that of any importance to it?  I will then ask everybody else to come in.</p></speech>

I get a script and I break it down by the locations, and then I scout and source the locations.  We then secure all of the contracts and the permits, and then they make the film.  It sounds easy but it is not.  To have the whole country available as a location is the reason a lot of international production is coming here.  To have it all available to us would be fantastic and that is why the regional uplift is so important.  When we had that, it did promote filming in the regions.  I worked on a couple of films in the regions.  I would hire local trainees and it is part of regional uplift that we have to hire local trainees.  They would go around to each department, such as my department, and ask what we need, and I would, for example, ask for two trainees, if possible.  Those trainees would work with us.</p> <p>  We can see there is a willingness in the regions.  There are crew in the regions who want to work and they do not necessarily want to come to Dublin or Wicklow.</p><p>They should not have to come to Dublin or Wicklow; it should be nationwide.  It is going to take time to build up that crew base.  To make a film in the regions, there is a cost involved because the crew will be based in Wicklow and they will have to be brought over.  There might also be some local trainees or other grades.  Galway, for example, would have more crew elements available than, perhaps, Donegal, which is nonetheless a great place to film.  It is going to take a longer period to build up that crew base but it could be done if there were the regional uplift.  It would make the industry nationwide and take the pressure off Dublin and Wicklow being the main production hubs.</p></speech>

Sometimes, if a development is happening locally, as I know in the case of building developments, for example, there will often be a local employment clause that sets out what "local" means.  What does "local" mean in this context?</p></speech>

Normally, the word is put out and CVs come into the production office, and all the departments get those CVs.  Pretty much everyone who applies gets a job.  Last summer, we worked on Inishmore and Achill and a couple of those trainees made the move and came to Dublin, which was great because there is work here and they are working.  Nevertheless, I wish there were also work in the regions.</p></speech>

There is a want in the regions to work in the film industry.  I do not come from Dublin and I moved to Dublin to work in the film industry.

There is activity in the regions in the animation sector, as I mentioned in our opening statement, and the uplift was really beneficial, with people getting into it.  It is not quite fit for purpose, however.  The Chairman mentioned Donegal.  The 45 km rule is a little restrictive for animation at times because it is a highly technical industry that needs people with skills.  Sometimes it was difficult to find people within the 45 km, so we had asked for that to be extended to, perhaps, 75 km.  If somebody is working in Mayo, Leitrim or Donegal, it just geography.</p></speech>

Of our 42 members, seven are in Northern Ireland, while of the remainder, there are probably about 20 in Dublin and 15 in the regions.

Some of the other areas are smaller, such as Roscommon and even Cork, which is surprisingly small for a city.  In Kilkenny and Galway, there is an awful lot of activity and that draws in other people as well.</p></speech>

The intent of the scheme was so important that it was probably too short and, obviously, it was badly impacted by the fact that Covid emerged in the middle of it.   The full aspirations of the scheme were probably not reached and it is our contention it should be extended at the higher level.  Realistically, it is a declining base from 5% and the costs everyone is aware of, which Mr. Holohan mentioned, are very real.</p> <p>  While we represent the indigenous industry, we are cognisant that a vibrant indigenous industry is also represented in the regions.  We represent more than 170 members and they are not all Dublin based.  Ours is an all-island membership.  The regional uplift is critical to the development of that regional base.  One group I would like to speak to is na baill at&aacute; ag cruth&uacute; i nGaeilge.  We represent Irish language producers as well.  We have all referenced the films of the year, &ldquo;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;Arracht&rdquo; and &ldquo;R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank&rdquo;.  It is such a vibrant, rich part of our achieving the cultural aims of section 481 and the ability to support that work in the regions.</p> <p>  Tying those two things together, the aspirations were fantastic but an entire ecosystem probably cannot be developed in five years with a declining base of percentage, so we should revisit that.  Is there an opportunity for Ireland Inc. to support unique aspects of our culture, namely, our Irish language and our Irish regional identity.</p></speech>

There is the TG4-Ard&aacute;n fund, for example, and the studio bases that are being built in the regions, with some of them already existing and more planned.  We want our member in Donegal, The Bothy, to produce work and we want all that regional work to be supported.  We also want to allow metro-centric producers, such as in Dublin, Cork and Wicklow, to bring work to the regions, but it needs an all-agency, multifaceted, mid-to-long-term strategy.</p></speech>

Having listened to the debate last week, I felt that needed to be mentioned.</p> <p>  Our guests talked about young people in the industry and their training.  How specifically does section 481 revolve around that?</p></speech>

Mr. McCabe referred to the national talent academies.  We are also part of those.  It is again quite a broad strategy of attracting trainees into this sector across the different disciplines both above and below the line and then assisting them to create.  For example, the work of the competency framework is defining the career path that one might take in any given grade.  As for the training, the mentorship and the shadowing that are required, I believe - and I think this was referred to in one of the opening statements - that the next generation of that is a view to work towards accreditation within the sector.  That would be the journey of trainees.  Ultimately, if we are putting all that effort into attracting people into the sector, it has to be a very sustainable, attractive place to work.</p></speech>

More recently, we have had diversity, equality and inclusion added to that skills plan.  You have to go through all those checks and balances, and there is very rigorous compliance to be achieved when you do that.  Then it is so important to continue the regional uplift and the regional trainees who were required for that.  Deputy Ryan asked about trainees staying in the industry.  They are not necessarily in a position to move to Dublin-Wicklow to work.  If we want to sustain the industry nationwide and keep the trainees in the industry, it is really important that the regional uplift is there.  The two projects I have produced in Kerry and Galway would have happened in Dublin-Wicklow if it were not for the uplift, not because we wanted them to happen in Dublin-Wicklow but because we would just not have been able to afford to make them in Kerry or Galway.  We were very fortunate because both those projects were based and set in those places and we would have had to cheat them in-----</p></speech>

Take one recent project we looked at.  The production schedule is really long.  It is a four-and-a-half-year production schedule.  We have 20 trainees on the project but they are all at different stages.  There are trainees basically coming in as interns.  They are learning as with a first job.</p></speech>

Then there are people who are part of that training programme and who are moving into a director, art director or episodic director role for the first time.  They are moving into new positions and being mentored.  As part of tracking their performance and seeing how they are getting on and what their challenges are, they will meet not only with their mentor but also with the HR function to have an open discussion as to what their challenges are and how they are getting on, getting feedback from the mentorship.  It is not just introductory roles, which this does include, but also roles right along the entire career path.  That all forms part of the training programme for section 481.  It is a requirement.</p></speech>

In respect of productions between two countries - for example, in Britain - how is relief work on a practical level, and how does it compare with similar relief work in other countries?</p></speech>

That is one of the reasons why it is really important that section 481 remains in place.  If there were no section 481, virtually all production activity that currently takes place in Ireland would move elsewhere.  For example, in Northern Ireland there is a tax credit which is fully available and which would be availed of if there were no tax credit for all production in Ireland.  We have to live in this very competitive international economy.  It also has to be said that there is great co-operation and co-production between the various countries.  We have co-production treaties for the whole of Europe on the one hand and, on the other, co-production treaties with individual territories, Canada being a good example of a country with which we have a very strong co-production treaty.  There is enormous co-operation between the countries but also a certain amount of competition between the countries in respect of the locations of productions.  One has to be at one's absolute highest efficiency, with the best skills available, in order to attract the production activity here.</p></speech>

What is his opinion of the regional uplift that was introduced in July 2019?  Has it worked, notwithstanding Covid?  In his opinion, do changes need to be made to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#L01600"><p>The regional uplift has decreased to 2% going into 2023.  My experience is as a location manager.  I worked in the regions during the time the regional uplift was there and I worked there when we all went back to work just after Covid, and I think it worked.  I think it brought production to the regions.  I think it was maybe Ms Kirby who said this.  I would like to see it come back.  Everyone needs to sit down and discuss what to do.  It needs to be a seven-year plan, almost.  What we want is an industry in the regions.  For that to happen we would want crew in the regions because what is holding us back from shooting in the regions at the moment is the lack of available crew.  We have to bring the crew over, and there is a big cost involved in that.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg.  If we bring in a regional uplift or some kind of incentive to shoot in the regions, the crew will develop in the regions.  It will start with trainees.  To use my department as an example, those trainee location staff will become, after a couple of years, location assistants and, a couple of years after that, maybe six years down the line, assistant location managers.  There you go.  Then there should be beneath them location assistants and location trainees as well.  That is across all the departments that work on a film.  When you see the credits of a film, that is us.  That is all those departments.</p> <p>  The uplift worked.  I wish it would come back.  That is just me being selfish as a location manager.  I would prefer to work there more often, but I think that the people in the regions who want a career in this industry deserve it.</p></speech>

They want the intellectual property.  The witnesses are saying it has to be signed over to the producer companies, and that is the standing company, so it has the intellectual property and, presumably, then benefits from the royalties from that.  Maybe the witnesses could clarify that point.  However, these companies do not want the employees.  They are left with the DAC.</p></speech>

We want to work with the actors, the dancers, the stunt people and whoever else is involved.  What we would like to do is make sure that there is an organised collective bargaining system in place in line with the copyright directive.</p> <p>  The copyright directive was introduced last November and it is very new.  We are all trying to work our way through to make it work.  It entitles authors and performers to fair and proportionate remuneration.  We are committed to doing that but it is important that we have everybody working with us.  We urge the committee to encourage collective bargaining.</p></speech>

That goes on with A, B, C, D.  It is the same producer company employing the same people but, because the DAC is now gone, that producer can say that they are not his or her employees.</p></speech>

It is a project-based industry in every jurisdiction of the world at this stage.  It is true that each time somebody is employed, he or she is employed in connection with a project.  The project has a fixed period of time.  It may be only six weeks for a feature film, it may be six months for a season of a television drama series and it may be two or three years for an animation television series, but there is always in the end a project-based approach to this industry.  That is fundamental to how the industry is structured.</p> <p>  In terms of recognition of the work people do, they are recognised through each of the projects they work on.  As the Deputy will know, every person involved in the project, the production of a film or a television series is given a credit at the end of the production.  That is the credit acknowledgement of the work that has been achieved in relation to those people who are working in the industry.  It is important.  People get work on the basis of the projects they have worked on.</p></speech>

If someone is to point out certain issues in pay and condition, one is not necessarily in a very strong position.</p> <p>  I welcome what has been said about collective bargaining agreements and getting a deal that everyone can live it.  We need a system that will deliver for that.</p> <p>  We have that problem that there are a number of crew and actors who do not believe they are equal players in this.  I do not know how we will provide them with a fora and a system that provides them with a decent level of representation but that looks like what we need to at least get us to the next step.</p> <p>  In fairness, the other question I was going to ask has been dealt with to a degree.  How do these working conditions and the contracts that we have spoken about previously compare with those in Britain, France or wherever?</p></speech>

It is a moveable industry.  People work from both areas and, by and large, all the remuneration is comparable between one jurisdiction and the other.</p> <p>  One last point, the collective bargaining agreements provide for dispute resolution mechanisms in relation to anything that may go wrong between a worker and an employer in the film and television production sector.  The vital aspect of the new shooting crew agreement, which was re-concluded in 2020, and the construction agreement, which was concluded in 2022, provide for dispute resolution mechanism for employees.  It is really important to us that those dispute resolution mechanisms are in place to protect employees in the context of any dispute they may have with their employer.</p></speech>

The references that are being made here relate to a small proportion of people.  A lot of work has gone into the communicating with crew and all other stakeholders.  There are so many systems in place and the guilds are there as a representative body to help everybody and make sure that things are done in a fair way.  I am not sure that it is representative of a small number of people when we have never had such a busy time in film over the past few years.  We all recognise there are always issues in every industry with employers and employees but the channels of communication here are open.  At no point is anybody ever in a situation where he or she does not have somewhere to go.  We have our website.  Anybody who works in film in any capacity is welcome to call me and we can help them with any issues they might have.  I would very much refute the blacklisting allegations.  It is not something that I have come across.  It is important to say that that is a small minority of people and it is not representative of the people we deal with.</p></speech>

We need better channels across the board so that we can have this communication and can put some of these issues to bed.  All we want to see is a vibrant film industry that produces good films, good television and good animation and provides people with good jobs, which they will need to sustain the industry anyway.</p></speech>

There is a suggestion that there are no real jobs.  I have heard the likes of that bandied about.  I ask the committee to visit us.  We will show the committee around and the members can meet the people who are working on the ground and can talk to them.</p> <p>  I did not get a chance to answer some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions properly, such as how one gets a job and where the guilds come from.  Briefly, in 2018, a large number of crew felt we did not have a voice.  There was a voice being heard but we felt that we did not have a voice.  I felt I did not.  We are film crew, we are good at getting organised and we got organised.  We organised ourselves into guilds really quickly.  The locations guild was the first guild.  It is probably ten years old.  Other crew took our lead and formed guilds.  Then we decided we should have a representative body - Screen Guilds Ireland - and that is where we come from.</p><p>We are ambitious.  We have looked for funding and got it from Screen Ireland, but we are also looking further afield.  That will get bigger.</p><p> I think there is some confusion.  We are all for quality employment.  We want it and it is a part of section 481 that we get it but there seems to be confusion between quality employment and permanent employment.  Most of us, myself included, want to work in a freelance industry.  That is why I got into it.  It is a creative industry and it is freelance.  I want to go from job to job.  I do not want to be tied to one production company and to only do the work that it does.  I want to be able to move around.  To have a career in this industry, how do you get a job?  You go in as a trainee and get to know people.  You make contacts and find out who is on the next job.  People tell you who is on the job, and to ring this guy and so on.  That is what happens.  It sounds like a clich&eacute; but film crew are like a family.  We help each other out.  We tell each other what jobs are coming in and what jobs need people.  I hope that answers some of the question.  The committee should come out and meet us on set and can ask us anything it wants.</p></speech>

On the question of using trainees, it would be impossible for us to crew up any production with just trainees.  There is a defined academic path into animation.  There are many animation courses on the island of Ireland.  We take those people.  Some go directly into the industry and some we have to put through bridging courses and give them some additional training.  There is a recognised pathway into the animation sector.</p></speech>

In my professional career in the creative industries, I have spent a great deal of time advocating and believing in the creative industries' proposition for Ireland Inc.  The film sector and the Irish audiovisual sector has such a key role to play in that.   There is something that we have not touched on, so I wish to acknowledge what we have all experienced in the last number of years.  This sector stayed open.  It very quickly pivoted, galvanised and stayed open.  It educated, informed and entertained.  It gave us a bit of solace.  I want to publicly recognise all those who were on the front line of that.  That is part of the representation here today.  I am very grateful for the opportunity.  I believe very firmly in the proposition of the creative industries in Ireland Inc.  It has been my passion.  We have an ability to deliver on great ambition.  A figure of &euro;4 billion was mentioned before.  We would welcome that level of commitment.  I guarantee that if we had that level of commitment, the sector would deliver.</p></speech>

I thank them for being with us this evening.  This follows on from the session we just had with three other groups.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, if evidence is being given remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, witnesses may not benefit from such a level of immunity.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise, or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or an official outside the Houses, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Finnegan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Screen Ireland is the national agency for the Irish film, TV drama, animation, documentary, shorts and visual effects industry.  The agency works closely with industry stakeholders and creative teams to fund and assist Irish projects from early stage development through to production, distribution, marketing and exhibition.  Screen Ireland is responsible for promoting the expression of national Irish culture on screen and developing skills across the sector.</p> <p>  In recent years, there has been extensive growth in both local and international production.  From 2019 to 2021, local Irish feature film activity increased by 52% and local TV drama production spend increased by 40%.  Irish animation also demonstrated a further increase in 2021, following a decade of rapid growth that resulted in record-breaking production levels. Last year, Screen Ireland-funded projects earned over 35 major international award nominations, including Academy Award, Emmy and BAFTA nominations.</p><p><font color="#00201F">Screen Ireland has a dual remit and is also responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland in the form of international production in line with the Government&rsquo;s audiovisual action plan ambition to make Ireland a global centre of excellence for production.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> Ireland is a recognised leader globally in animation with approximately 2,500 people currently employed across 42 studios.  Ireland has also become a world-class visual effects hub for large-scale projects.  Screen Ireland welcomed the opportunity to showcase this sector's work on a trade mission to Los Angeles with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> National Irish-language cinema has also been redefined in recent years.  In the middle of an intensely difficult time for cinemas and the cinema-going experience, an Irish-language film broke domestic box office records, reaching a diverse audience across many different generations.  It created a cultural sensation at home and abroad and is now the Irish entry for the Academy Awards.  As a result of the cine4 scheme and section 481, we now have more Irish-language feature films being produced than ever before, ensuring that Irish filmmakers&rsquo; voices can be heard as Gaeilge as well as in English.  The tax incentive for film and television production has been part of public policy in Ireland for more than three decades and we have provided a written submission with further detail on the importance of the credit to the sector.  It exists to stimulate and support the local indigenous industry and it also attracts high-end international production to Ireland.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> Section 481 supports live-action film and TV production, animation production, creative documentary, post-production and visual effects, supporting both creative endeavour and employment across all these sectors.  The credit is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  In March 2019, Screen Ireland was asked by the Department to take on a new role to develop and then oversee a new process for tracking training and skills development opportunities on projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  This was a new departure for the agency, providing an opportunity for Screen Ireland to introduce a more structured approach to work-based learning and skills tracking, making Ireland the first country in the world to link such a formal skills tracking process to a tax credit.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Gareth Lee, who is head of skills and professional development, to take the committee through some of this work.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Lee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#O00200"><p>Since the introduction of the new system, Screen Ireland has assessed more than 160 skills development plans and tracked more than 1,700 skills participants across section 481 productions.  As well as the skills development aspect of the plan, producers are also encouraged to introduce both sustainability initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives on their productions.  This has seen significant positive change within the sector.<br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  The value of the section 481 skills process to Ireland's film production sector is significant.  It ensures that formality and structure is given to training.  It also gives reliable front-line data on the key skills shortages and gaps that are being experienced on the ground.  This, in turn, allows the sector to ensure that there is a pipeline of skilled talent to support both local and incoming production in a sustainable way.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  In 2022, Screen Ireland, in collaboration with Screen Guilds of Ireland, launched a new competency framework that captures all of the skills, knowledge and competencies for in excess of 80 crew roles across 17 different departments.  This resource enhances the section 481 skills tracking process, opens up access and career opportunities within the sector and supports third-level institutions and training providers with more targeted and relevant curriculum development.  The next evolution is the development of a certification-accreditation model for work-based learning.  Screen Ireland has started working closely with third-level partners and industry on this.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  To improve workplace culture, Screen Ireland has developed two new online, self-led training programmes on bullying and harassment and unconscious bias that those working on section 481 productions will be requested to complete.  These new programmes are also included as part of Safe To Create, a new collaborative programme aiming to provide safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the wider arts and creative sectors.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  Screen Ireland works closely with industry stakeholders and is dedicated to doing everything possible to ensure fair opportunities for all.  Before the end of the year, the agency will launch a new crew and services database for the sector that will help increase visibility of employment opportunities and access points for all to the industry.  Everyone working in the industry and any new entrants will be able to self-register on the database and indicate if they are available and seeking work.  Producers and companies will also be able to register on the site, search for crew and advertise opportunities centrally.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  As evidenced above, a huge amount of positive work on skills and workforce development has happened in the screen sector in Ireland in recent years.  This progress has either been directly related to section 481 or inspired by the section 481 skills requirement.  Screen Ireland is proud of the work to date and the progress that has been made.  We are keen to see even further progress in the years to come.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F">  We thank the committee for its work on the film credit and look forward to answering any questions the members might have.</font></p></speech>

We have heard those calls for a number of years now.  Mr. Lee and the skills team have spent a long time investing in it and trying to build it out as a resource.  We feel that not only will it represent crew but it will also represent facilities and services.  It will be a full directory for the industry.  To my knowledge, the industry has never before had something this comprehensive.  What we like about it is that we see it as a tool for the industry itself.  We want to ensure that the industry is as open and inclusive as possible, and that it gives fair opportunities for employment to everyone.  As a State agency, we play no role in the employment relationship but we felt this would be a valuable tool to enable any individual to self-register.  If a local or international production company is looking for crew, this resource would be available to them and allow them to connect with people.  We hope the database will launch in the next few weeks.  It is a pilot programme.</p></speech>

The film credit is given to create employment and training.  From what I gather, which was more or less confirmed by Mr. Hickey during the committee's earlier session, the DAC is the employer.  DACs only exist for the period of the production and approximately a year thereafter.</p></speech>

We did not have time to drill into it further but Mr. Hickey said we need the DAC system as an accountancy tool for investors and to provide transparency about what happens financially on a particular production.</p><p>I put it to the witnesses that it absolutely runs counter to the purpose of section 481 if the producer company that is a self-standing ongoing company can say it is not the employer of the people who worked on that film, even though that company set up the DAC, owns the DAC, but yet can disown responsibility for the people who work on the DAC.</p></speech>

It makes the application to the Department, receives approval and the tax credit.  That tax credit is then passed down from the producer company to the DAC.  The DAC is the company that employs the cast and crew and secures the location and all the necessary rights.  There is a commissioning relationship between the producer company and the DAC.  The delivered film passes back from the DAC to the producer company.  My understanding is that the DAC is the company that employs the crew.  It concludes the employment contracts and is responsible for the employment relationships, as per legislation, between that company and the crew.  I suppose it is a function of section 481 that there is a DAC in the structure.  I know that reference was made to the fact that the DAC ensures there is transparency, which it does, by the way.  It is also a structure of financing.</p></speech>

I understand that, and I understand the rationale of the DAC as an accountancy and financial tool.  If a section 481 tax credit is given for quality, employment and training, the basic requirement for an industry and employment is that we know who the employer is and we know who the employee is.  The problem is we do not.  The DAC exists purely for the duration of the production and for one year afterwards.  The DAC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company, for want of a better phrase, which is the recipient of the section 481 tax credit.</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make was that as the Deputy has probably gathered from the previous sessions, film production is a pretty expensive business.  Section 481 is just a part of it.  With any projects of scale, and when I say "scale" I am really talking about projects of a value of more than &euro;2 million, there needs to be other financing and banking in terms of ensuring the cash flows work within the production.  Banks will often lend against contracts and pre-sales and often provide gap financing.</p></speech>

I am getting back to the issue of employment and training.  Once the DAC ceases to exist, who does the employee on a film production have recourse to as their employer?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the employment relationship exists between the DAC and those who are hired on that particular production.  The DAC then stays in place for 12 months for compliance and transparency.  If any issues arise, they can be addressed in that time period.  Often, the crew members are going from one production with one employer to another production with a different employer.  That is where that-----</p></speech>

By the time the case reaches the court, the employer no longer exists, even though the company that got section 481 tax credit for that production on which the employee worked still exists, and that company says it has no relationship with the employee, even though the DAC was 100% owned by that company.  To me, that is a problem because it means the employees and the trainees do not have an employer they can go back to once the DAC is gone.  Therefore, all of the legislation those companies are required to sign up to is meaningless.  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 is meaningless if the only legal employer an employee ever had only existed for a year and a half or less, for example, six months.  Do the witnesses know what I mean?  I just do not understand how the workers or the trainees can have any kind of rights, continuity or recognition of their service if their employer disappears after a period, even though their actual employer that got the money clearly still exists, but says it is not their employer.</p></speech>

That is a fact; they cannot.  I have one last question, and I know I am out of time.  Taking just one of the roles in the film that was mentioned, we had a witness who said they were a production manager.  How many people have qualified and been accredited as production managers through the skills training structures that have been set up?</p></speech>

It is a requirement around training and skills development.  It is not linked to a specific role, and it is not specifically about trainees.  As some of the witnesses explained in the previous session, the approach we have taken to it is very much holistic.  It is about capturing skills development across productions at all levels.  As an industry, we need to make sure we are developing people at all levels.  It is very much Government and European policy to address lifelong learning and continuing professional development within the industry.  In terms of how the system works, at the outset of a production, a producer will engage with crew and a skills development officer to develop a skills plan.  That skills plan will outline the skills that will be developed across a production.  That could include learning on the job, courses, shadowing, mentoring and skills development at the different levels I mentioned.  Our role is to approve that plan if we feel it is approvable or to go back to the producer to request changes.</p> <p>  Once in place and approved, our role is to oversee the delivery of that across the production.  We engage with the skills participants, as they are called, during that process.  We do set visits and so on.  At the end of the process, there is a compliance stage where we look and verify that the skills that have been developed across that project have been signed off and captured.  Our role is not around what level that person might get hired at on the next job.  That is obviously something for the employer and the individual.  That is their remit.  Our remit is to ensure skills are being tracked on production and they are being developed in that formal structured way.  It is important to say skills have always been developed on production.  That is why we have the fantastic crews we have in Ireland and we do the fantastic work we do.  What this system has put in place is a more formal structure around it.</p><p>One of the great things that was referenced in the last session and is important is the development of this competency framework, which captures all the skills, knowledge and competencies for every role across 17 departments.  Our plan, as a next step, is to look at certification for work-based learning.  We are engaging with third level providers around developing certification, be it micro-credentials or whatever, that will give people certificates for the work that they do and the skills that are tracked on production.  That is kind of the next step.  Again, that is not us being involved in the employment relationship; it is just us putting resources and processes in place to help with that, which is where the certification would come into play eventually.</p></speech>

It was clearly out of some conversations that happened at this committee.  It is working very well.  It is the first time in the world, I think, but certainly in Europe, that we are linking the tax credit to skills development.  In fact, many European countries are coming to us now, looking at the value of what was created and are quite eager to replicate it.  As Mr. Lee said, we developed the competency framework, which will go into a deeper level of linking the skills within the framework to the skills development plan, the further tracking and then compliance.</p></speech>

In respect of the industry development test, a post project compliance report must be submitted to Screen Ireland with a final version submitted within six months following production completion.  Companies are also required to provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission decisions as well.  If a producer does not comply with these requirements, any amount of the relief already claimed may be recoverable with interest.  Can the witnesses provide an example of a production company failing the industry development test and application for the section 481 relief?</p></speech>

Usually with these, it is quite common that there would be ones that fail in terms of receiving relief.  That is fair if that is a question more so for the Department and we will put that in.</p> <p>  The witnesses are probably also aware of claims made at this committee with regard to blacklisting workers.  We have been hearing from workers that they feel that they have been blacklisted by production companies etc.  Do the witnesses have any comment on that specific statement?</p></speech>

The crew and services database is part of what we were speaking about in that regard in providing a tool for industry to give as open and fair access points and opportunities of employment for all in the industry.</p></speech>

I am asking specifically about the blacklisting that some people have mentioned.  When we are looking at this particular tax credit, that is something that has arisen in previous committees, so it is more specifically on that.  Is Ms Finnegan saying that she does not feel she can comment on that?</p></speech>

The feedback that we get from across all the stakeholders that we engage with is that the industry is thriving.  Despite the pandemic, last year was a record-breaking year for the sector - it generated &euro;500 million in production spend.  We are hearing very positive feedback generally from across the sector and about employment levels as well.  It is an industry that is maturing and scaling.  Ensuring that there is open access for all feels like the appropriate role for us to play in that so that anybody who has experience has an opportunity to display that experience and be able to respond to employment opportunities within the sector.  We hope that this database will help provide that.</p></speech>

As people who work around the industry, if they have not been concerns that have been highlighted with Screen Ireland before - I would imagine that it is perhaps coming out of this committee - that is something that we would very strongly say needs to be looked at from what we have heard from witnesses.  It is obviously extremely concerning, if that is the case.  However, it fair enough if Ms Finnegan is saying that at this moment that is not necessarily something she will exactly comment on.  I would then perhaps urge that Screen Ireland looks at it at a later point.</p> <p>  I just also wanted to note something that was said by Irish Equity last week.  It noted that all performers and creatives are or should be protected by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the European copyright directive, which among other things, enshrined the right to proportionate remuneration for the ongoing financial rewards that derive from their performance.  It stated that this is not an explicit requirement under section 481.  Can our witnesses comment on this with their understanding of requirements under section 481 and whether it is a stipulation for receipt of such relief?</p></speech>

Again, we do not administer the tax credit, but I can speak from the Screen Ireland perspective on this.  The European copyright directive and copyright in general is a very complex area.  From our understanding, it requires very careful consideration.  As an agency, over the past 12 months or so, we have met with each of the stakeholders across the sector to try to understand the different views and where there might be challenges around the implementation of the directive.</p> <p>  We welcome the European copyright directive and its full implementation, but we believe it requires the industry to come together.  Therefore, we proposed to the sector an informal working group around this.  We have been seeking an independent chair because we, as an agency, are also investors within content.  We wanted to make sure that we could better understand some of the complexities around it.  We are actively looking at including the European copyright directive in our own contract provisions along with all of the other legislation that we have requirements around.  We hope that we get full engagement from across the sector, which we believe we will, to work through where views may not fully align on certain aspects of it.</p></speech>

That obviously accepts on some level that there is an issue and we need to bring that to a head as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I ask about the remit of Screen Ireland, including but beyond its involvement regarding section 481.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, Screen Ireland has a dual remit.  They are both equally important in finding a fine balance between both areas of responsibility.</p><p> Screen Ireland is responsible for the expression of national Irish culture on screen.  We work with a production and development team to invest in projects.  We support projects literally through every stage of the process.  There is our version of research and development where one develops an idea for a film, a television drama, an animation or whatever.  We probably have between 80 and 100 projects in active development within the agency.  That supports Irish talent to come in and develop work in this area, which we do in a variety of different ways.  Production companies and producers come in with their ideas.  Throughout the pandemic we worked really hard as a team to ensure that we supported opportunities for other creative talent as well.  We have run a number of different programmes.  For example, one programme is called The Voice and it supports Irish directors.  The Screen Directors Guild of Ireland came to us with the idea for this fantastic programme as it allows directors funding so they can go off and develop their own ideas.  We are seeing some of those ideas come through now.  Initially, this was a Covid-19 support measure but we are seeing it now coming through the production lane  We have a number of different programmes, including one called Spotlight for writers.</p></speech>

Across the board, Screen Ireland has a responsibility to ensure the industry is supported.  The agency fits itself in where ideas can be developed and that obviously means dealing with all of the relevant stakeholders.  On some level, people view the agency as a general representative group of the film industry.</p></speech>

On some level, that fits in with what Mr. Hickey spoke about earlier having not only a collective bargaining agreement but a system that can deliver that, which is what I think we are missing.

In particular, through the pandemic we worked directly with creatives across the board.  We support crew.  We have worked with the Screen Guilds of Ireland to develop crew hubs around the country to respond to the increased demand for crew because of the growth in the industry.</p></speech>

We have received feedback, particularly at high points of production.  By that I mean there is a huge demand for crew during the summer months in Ireland.  We have received feedback that there is an oversubscription and people cannot find enough crew.  That is why we launched crew hubs to bring more people into the industry.  Mr. Lee can speak to the training piece and the work that we do there.</p></speech>

So it is about new entrants and trainees but it is also about upskilling and progression because one needs people to move up in order to have an industry.  So that is very much our approach.</p> <p>  As the witnesses in the previous session have stated, it is important that we bring new people in and grow the industry.  We should be very supportive of that and we are.  We also need to ensure that we upskill those who are in more senior positions and so on, and we do that through our work around section 481.  We do a whole host of other things in the skills department around continuous professional development and so on.</p> <p>  As the witnesses in the previous session said, I agree, I do not think that there is an imbalance.  Certainly with skills, we see a balance between the upskilling of people who are in the industry already and new entrants coming in.  We are keen to grow the industry so we should not deter new entrants and trainees from coming in as well.</p></speech>

We seem to have an issue with a number of people.  I cannot determine how big a number that is but it seems to be significant and it is people who have worked in the industry for years.  The way the industry operates, as you move from project to project, creates a certain level of difficulty.  I have no wish to make headlines but there seems to be a pre-1913-type set-up whereby it is almost that you show up and then the employer takes you on.  That is just the nature of project-to-project circumstances and we must discover ways to fix that part.  I do not know whether we need a forum or a greater level of representation, even as I have said about Screen Ireland, of some of these people.  Can we do that?</p></speech>

However, I believe we need the piece where we can have representation in order that people's views can be aired and we can find a structure that works a bit better.

Even over the past few years it seems that there has been huge progress made in the industry in terms of having a crew agreement in place now.  Such an agreement provides stability not only here in Ireland but when looking for international productions to come to Ireland.  It is great to be able to communicate that there are stable agreements in place.</p> <p>  My understand is that the second agreement is the construction agreement.  I suppose that any issues of pay and conditions would be dealt with through those agreements.  Our view on that is that we would welcome all parties coming together and trying to get those agreements in place across all areas.  As we look at our counterparts across Europe, we see that these agreements are in place.</p><p>Again, there are dispute resolution mechanisms within those agreements.  As the industry is maturing, we see that growth.  The growth from 2019 to 2021 was huge.  It was a 40% increase in that time despite it being the second year of a pandemic.  The sooner we can get to that point, across any areas where there are concerns, that is the method by which, typically, the industry deals with pay and conditions.  That should be fair and proportionate-----</p></speech>

It is about the work that is done on due diligence in the context of section 481.  A while ago we had a production that was up and running and that subsequently fell on its backside.  I would have thought there would have been an element of due diligence that needed to be done to ensure that funding was in place before anyone thought about providing State money for the production.

It is incredibly important to Screen Ireland that the growth the industry is experiencing is nationwide and across the country.  The regional uplift was a very effective intervention at the time but we feel it did not fully meet its policy objective to build a permanent pool of talent outside the hub of Dublin-Wicklow.  We have had a very strong, positive working relationship with the Department of Finance and, in particular, with the Department with responsibility for culture in the context of trying to bring the industry together and understand what might be the next intervention that might be slightly more precisely targeted.</p></speech>

That is fair enough, but the regionality aspect brings a bit more complexity to the issue.  Judging whether the mechanism works or not during a pandemic is complex.  I am not saying Screen Ireland is writing it off, but is it appropriate to draw a line under the uplift as a mechanism in that context or should we give it another go?</p></speech>

What we felt about the regional uplift, which is now in its dying days as we go into the 2%, is that it was a fantastic initiative for pushing production out of Dublin and Wicklow and developing the production base around the country.  A further issue arose which is that it was initially linked to a state aid map.  That map has just changed again this year for next year so it is questionable, even if it had not tapered off, how valuable it could be.  It was going to be rather messy and chaotic as to what was going to be included and excluded.</p></speech>

When the original EU approval came through, it was linked to a state aid regional map.  Unfortunately, that excluded Cork.  It just so happens that we always have a lot of production which favours going to Cork.  That state aid map has changed so of course the change----</p></speech>

As a result, for film production, it was going to become a bit more difficult.

Were the regional uplift to continue at 5% we are now well-structured to capitalise on that.  One of the things we have launched in recent years is a number of talent academies around the country that are in place to potentially support the uplift, were it to continue.  We have also developed very strong collaborative links with third-level providers around the country as well.  If it were to continue we would be in a very good place to capitalise on all that.</p></speech>

We definitely need to have more clarity and answers.  That said, I am going to move on.</p> <p>  I have two questions I am going to go through consecutively because of the time constraints.  Ms Finnegan's referred to the increase in the number of Irish language productions.  How important is section 481 in this regard?  Also, do we know what percentage of productions are in the Irish language and what the figure was prior to section 481?</p> <p>  The other question is a brief one.  Screen Ireland has taken on the role of developing and overseeing a new process for tracking, training and skills development opportunities on section 481 and its funded projects, which is a requirement of the tax credit.  How is this work going and what challenges has Screen Ireland faced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Finnegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022101200002#T00100"><p>Section 481 has been critical to funding Irish language film.  There has been a resurgence, which people have also described as a new dawn, in Irish language cinema.  The work that has been generated is incredible.  When we talk about cultural dividend we see projects such as "An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in", "Arracht" which came before it and which we believe is the first time the famine was ever depicted on screen in that way, and "R&oacute;ise &amp;amp; Frank", which is a third project that has come through.  We believe that section 481 is absolutely critical to that.  It was also part of the scheme called Cine4, which was a partnership between TG4, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and Screen Ireland.  It has really shown the creative talent that exists there and the impact it can have.  To see a film generate Ireland on screen the way it did, and to show that it can get huge audiences across multiple generations, is something very rare.  There are very young people going to see it but also up through the generations.  To see the critical response and the reviews across the UK, and it is to be released in the US, and ultimately to see how it fares in awards is huge.  Section 481 is highly important to that process.</p></speech>

As Ms McGrane referred to earlier, Ireland is the first country in the world to link such a structured skills tracking process to the tax credit.  We are the first country in the world to develop a competency framework for crew within the sector.  We are doing extremely pioneering work as Ms McGrane mentioned.  Other territories have come to talk to us to see the work that we are doing and in particular with the competency framework.  We have had lots of inquiries about that.  As for challenges, because we are doing pioneering work we are, to a certain extent, learning as we go.  It is evolving.  That has always been our approach, namely, how can we evolve and enhance the process to make sure it is working the best it can and to make sure it is as inclusive as possible.  We are always enhancing and we are open to enhancing that.</p></speech>

We are always looking to enhance.  The challenge is we do not necessarily have a template to copy.  Other sectors have things in place but there are aspects of our sector that we must address through the work that we do.  There are no other screen sectors internationally to copy.  That pioneering side of it is probably the most challenging bit.</p></speech>

We went out to tender and commissioned a report by Olsberg, international entertainment industry consultants that work globally, to assess both the cultural dividend and the industry development value of section 481.  It was a much more complicated undertaking than we had anticipated because cultural value manifests itself in a variety of ways, many of which can be quite hard to quantify.  We hope to have that report imminently to share with the committee.  One of the aspects I found very interesting in the report is a key finding around the Irish language.  They applied a framework to assess cultural value across intrinsic, institutional and instrumental values.  Within one of those instrumental values they talk about how it works to encourage, promote and preserve the Irish language.  They surveyed a number of individuals across the Irish public.  Respondents under the age of 35 were more likely to say that Irish screen content encouraged people to be proud of the Irish language and made them want to learn the Irish language or speak it more frequently.  The report also went on to comment that projects made in the Irish language have an especially important cultural and educational role in helping to engage people of all ages and especially learners.  We thought that was a very interesting takeaway from the report.</p></speech>

There was no dispute about that.  I would like to see more money going in, not less.  The big question that I feel is unanswered comes back to this issue of work being project by project.  At the end of the day it comes back to that notion.  It is a mantra I hear repeated.  I question it, to be honest.  Of course it is project to project.  So are plays.  The plays that go on in the Abbey Theatre, are project to project.  Just about every form of artistic endeavour is project to project at a certain level.  There seems to be a unique conclusion drawn with regard to live-action film that because it is project by project, nobody can have a job.  In every other area where work is project to project, people have jobs.  Uniquely in live-action film nobody can have a job.  I do not accept that, to be blunt about it.  It involves two groups of people.  From the point of view of the actors, I perceive we are saying "We know that because of the nature of acting we cannot have a permanent job but we want the full remuneration for our performance.  That is what we want but we are not getting it."  That is what Equity is telling us.  Then there is the crew.  There is an idea that the crew are in the same position as the actors but there are different requirements.  It is different.  There is an idea that one must get rid of set painters, stagehands, drivers or prop makers every time a project is finished with absolutely no security for them getting onto the next production.  It must be remembered that much of this is funded with public money, which is in fact their money and taxpayers' money.  Both groups emphasised that this is taxpayers' money.  I just do not accept that.  I do not see why it is necessary, based on the assertion that it is project to project.  It is not the case anywhere else.  This also relates to the question of trainees.  I get that things have moved on; it is partly because some of those groups have come in here and raised these issues that things have moved on.  If I understand it correctly, while Screen Ireland is assessing that there may be some training going on in film production, we do not know if those trainees will be employed on the next production by that same film producer.  Am I right in saying that?  Also, there is no accreditation for their training.  Unlike an apprentice carpenter or bricklayer there is no point at which we can say they are qualified in a particular occupation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the project to project idea creates that power differential issue that we need to deal with, whether it is the actors or the crew.  If we could get around that piece we could deal with the collective bargaining issues and some form of representation, in whatever forum that it needs to be, so we can bridge that gap and that power differential.  Perhaps there could be a database or whatever, so there is a recording of all of those people involved and maybe it would have their skill set, an element of their CV, and who is working where, and that sort of detail.  Then we could track the training across the board by having that information.</p><p>That also provides us with an overview of the industry that taxpayers' money is going into.  Then we can get the best bang for our buck, for all of us.</p></speech>

On a site, there are often different crew requirements for different projects.  A massive large-scale sci-fi production will require certain crew, whereas a location-based romantic comedy, for want of a better example, would have a very different requirement.  That is our understanding from talking to the screen guilds that represent thousands of crew.  Even within this report there is an element about quality employment.  Olsberg has applied a framework to look at what constitutes quality employment in terms of meaningful work.  Over 50% of people within the sector have been working in it for more than ten years.  That would suggest there is a form of stability there.  The ability to go from project to project with different employers each time is part of the nature of the industry we are in.  I know that sounds repetitive.  With regard to pay and conditions, it is through industry agreements that that dynamic is managed appropriately.  Everybody, hopefully, comes out of those agreements with fair and proportionate remuneration and feels they work well.  Where there are disputes, there is a mechanism within those agreements to address those.</p></speech>

The Supplementary Estimate is required in respect of a number of subheads across the Vote.  Additional funding is required principally to meet the cost pressures occurring due to the extraordinary demands placed on my Department in the discharge of its role in the humanitarian response to the Ukraine crisis and in relation to its response to the exponential growth in the numbers of international protection applicants arriving in the State over the course of 2022.</p> <p>  The primary driver for an additional provision is the cost of accommodation for new arrivals from Ukraine.  Almost 53,000 beneficiaries of temporary protection have arrived in Ireland since March, of whom 41,500 have sought accommodation.  The expected full year cost in 2022 for Ukraine accommodation and related costs is &euro;593.2 million.  I remind the committee that there was no provision for Ukraine spending in the 2022 Vote for my Department as, of course, the entire crisis was unforeseen.  The committee is also aware that the costs associated with the Ukraine crisis, the largest element of this Supplementary Estimate, are unprecedented.  The Government has committed to continue to provide safe shelter for those fleeing the war in Ukraine.  As a result these costs have to be borne by the State and, in particular, by the Department's Vote.</p> <p>  Other areas of the Vote are also experiencing significant pressure.  The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, provides accommodation and associated services to international protection applicants.  This is a demand-led process and the additional funding required in 2022 is due to the cost of accommodation for the increased number of new international protection arrivals.  The IPAS budget for 2022 was based on 7,244 applicants accommodated at the start of the year and an expected additional 4,500 to arrive in 2022.  In fact, however, more than 10,000 people have arrived in Ireland to 25 September, more than double the numbers anticipated for the full year.  As a result, the additional provision being sought for international protection is &euro;102.9 million.  These two areas respectively account for &euro;696 million of the total Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  There are much smaller requirements for the delivery of services across a number of other areas in the Vote, including Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and early learning and childcare as well as other smaller areas of the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Tusla is expected to have an overspend of &euro;16.2 million due to cost pressures arising on non-pay elements of its expenditure, mainly relating to the provision of residential care and costs associated with the extension of the Building Momentum agreement.</p> <p>  Early learning and childcare is experiencing a higher than expected uptake of both the early childhood care and education scheme and the access and inclusion model, AIM, programmes.  Applications for the national childcare scheme, a relatively new scheme, have also increased beyond expectations.  These factors combined result in an overspend of &euro;27.2 million across the early years subheads.</p> <p>  Smaller amounts are required for other elements of the Department's Vote.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland requires an additional &euro;600,000 driven by expenditure arising in preparation for the enactment and implementation of the Birth Information and Tracing Act.  The Office of Ombudsman for Children is experiencing increased pay costs and requires an additional &euro;200,000.  The Magdalen fund has a shortfall of &euro;300,000 arising from increased claims.  The Irish Youth Justice Service requires an additional &euro;400,000 and the National Disability Authority requires an additional &euro;100,000 to meet costs associated with the extension of Building Momentum agreement.</p> <p>  Savings of &euro;35.2 million across other areas of my Department's Vote have been found to help meet the overruns.  As a result, the Supplementary Estimate required for my Department is &euro;719.4 million.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate for the Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth Vote to the committee and I am happy to address any questions members may have.  As they can see I have brought pretty much the entire Department with me just in case.</p></speech>

I apologise because I did not think I would make it to the meeting.  I am watching D&aacute;il proceedings because I am due to speak there shortly.  More than anything else I want to acknowledge the work the Department has done in response to the Ukrainian crisis.  It is unprecedented.  We could not have planned for this situation last year before it happened.  The response from the Department and from the workers in the Department has been very good.  This needs to be acknowledged and I want the Minister to pass it on to the Department and anybody else delivering the response.  I am happy to see that Ireland is playing its part in the humanitarian response.  It is important for us as a nation to be able to roll out the welcome mat for people coming into the country, especially those with trauma and in crisis and fleeing a war situation.</p> <p>  Not everything is perfect and I am glad the situation in Killarney was resolved.  If it has not been I would like the Minister to let me know.  One of the biggest challenges we have is people coming here who have lost their homes and sometimes family members.  They come over to a new situation and they find themselves in a community.  After a period of time they become embedded in the community and put down roots.  I was listening to the radio earlier and I heard a lady who went to college in her community but all of a sudden there was a threat of her being moved to a different community at the other end of the country.  I would like to see measures in place whereby this approach cannot be taken.</p><p> There is an overspend for Tusla of &euro;16.2 million, much of which relates to the provision of residential care.  The CEO of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, appeared before the joint committee yesterday and there was discussion on what seems to be an increase in the number of children accessing bespoke temporary accommodation, such as bed and breakfast establishments, hotels, holiday chalets and so on.  Does that account for any part of the increase in Tusla's expenditure?</p><p> Will the Minister elaborate on the &euro;35.2 million in savings across certain areas, which may alleviate some of the cost overruns elsewhere?  From where did those savings come?  I am concerned that when savings are made, certain services that were in place might not be delivered as well as they were in the previous year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022101200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I very much appreciate his acknowledgement of the work the Department has done on the response to the war in Ukraine.  It has been done by the staff, not by me, from the assistant secretaries, one of whom is here today, all the way to clerical officers in Citywest working to help people move around the country.  Amazing work has been done by the officials in my Department, and, in addition, we have had people seconded in from other Departments and agencies.  I appreciate the Deputy's recognition of the phenomenal work that is being undertaken.</p> <p>  Regarding the situation in Killarney, none of the Ukrainian families or individuals in that hotel will be moved from the town.  They will be provided with alternative accommodation in Killarney.  We have identified one hotel and are looking to find accommodation for some of the larger families that cannot be accommodated there.  What happened in Killarney is an indication of the pressures and difficulties associated with having to accommodate so many people within a short period.  That applies to people coming from Ukraine and also the people in the international protection process.  Numbers arriving from Ukraine have more than doubled in the past month, from 700 a week at the start of September to 1,500 last week.  That is very much a consequence of the renewed targeting of civilian infrastructure by Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>  The numbers of international protection applicants remain very high as well.  As I have said on a number of occasions, we find it particularly hard to source accommodation for international protection applicants.  In Killarney, we had a situation where there was a hotel that could accommodate such applicants.  The reason the Department sought to move international applicants there is that, three weeks ago, as the Deputy will recall, we were not able to provide accommodation for them over a five-day period and people were being turned away.  I want to avoid that situation recurring.  Much as I would like to, I cannot make a guarantee that we will not have to ask people to move in the future.  Sometimes, people have to move if hotels do not renew contracts.  In this instance, however, there was a particular situation whereby the need to secure accommodation for international protection applicants was significant.  Through working with local representatives and others, we were able to secure significant alternative accommodation.</p> <p>  Killarney's profile as a major tourist town made it more likely than elsewhere to have another big hotel to step in.  The same may not be likely to happen in every other place.  We will try to avoid situations like that.  I am acutely aware that this situation would have been traumatising for families but I am also acutely aware of the need to avoid, as much as possible, a situation where we cannot offer accommodation.  The Department's most basic aim is to provide accommodation and meals to people.  That is the core part of our role in responding to humanitarian crises.</p> <p>  Regarding Tusla, the Deputy is absolutely right that the vast majority of the overspend relates to those extremely complex cases in which not only the location of accommodation must be bespoke but the support apparatus of support staff, social workers and social care staff has to be put in to deal with the particular difficulties these young people are experiencing and the range of needs they have.  Sometimes, due to wider issues in terms of security, risk of flight and the like, there may have to be multiple teams supporting one individual.  These are very complex cases that always fall back on Tusla because it is ultimately responsible for young people in such situations.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, Tusla has brought forward or is in the process of bringing forward a number of papers on alternative care.  Mr. Gloster spoke about that yesterday and one of those reports is on residential care.  Tusla is looking to strengthen the State and community and voluntary element of residential care with a view to being able to rely less on private residential care.  Complex cases often end up in private residential care but the most complex cases always come back on the State and those are the cases in which very significant sums have to be invested to provide and protect these young people with particularly complex needs.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the saving of &euro;35 million.  The biggest saving was &euro;14 million in the context of the transition from the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for early years providers.  When the EWSS ended this year.  Before core funding kicked in, we had a bespoke scheme in place to support childcare providers.  The EWSS was originally meant to end in January.  We had budgeted for the transitional scheme to go from January until the end of August.  In fact, the EWSS did not stop until the end of April, which meant there was more money allocated for our scheme than was needed for the months in which it ran.  That was the biggest element of saving.</p> <p>  The next biggest element of saving was on pay relating to posts within the Department's staff complement that we were not able to fill.  There was also a saving on the response to the mother and baby and county home institutions, arising primarily from the fact the Tuam agency is only now being established, whereas we had budgeted for its establishment earlier this year.  We got Government approval two weeks ago to establish it but there was a &euro;3 million allocation for its operation this year that will not now be met.</p></speech>

We received responses from 20 of them and have met with the management in all those cases.  There is a wide range of issues in schools, as the Minister knows, but I was reminded while he was speaking of one of the issues that was raised.  What conversations or interactions does he have with the Department of Education around school places for either Ukrainian nationals or international protection applicants?  What seems to be happening is that schools located closest to the hotels and centres where people are placed are inundated with applications.  People have been walking to them and looking for places for their children.  In other parts of my constituency, the schools have had no such applications.  There seems to be an <i>ad hoc</i>kind of arrangement whereby people fleeing here from Ukraine or elsewhere and seeking international protection are having to find school places for their children themselves, without support from the Department of Education.  In fairness to the people we met in the various schools, they were more than willing to help as many children as possible, if they have the resources, and do their bit in a humanitarian crisis.  What engagement has the Minister had with the Department of Education on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022101200002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  On the higher level, when we are opening new accommodation either for Ukrainians or international protection applicants, we engage with the Department of Education and let it know people will be moving into the area in question.  The Department now has a sophisticated scheme for identifying the areas in which there is pressure on school places.  We engage with it on that and it can flag the issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy probably is focusing more on the micro level of individual schools.  As part of the Ukraine response, the regional education and languages teams have been working very closely with schools to try to ensure Ukrainians are linked in with local schools.  That has been working very successfully.  Allocations for integration officers for this year are set out in the White Paper.</p><p>My Department has an allocation for the employment of integration officers in every local authority throughout the country.  That is an area where the integration officers could provide an important link between people in international protection or Ukraine and State agencies and schools, as well as engaging with educational welfare officers and the like.  We also have a budget to increase supports for NGOs in terms of the White Paper and reaching out to international protection applicants.  I am very focused on education supports, knowing that probably one of the best ways to integrate children and, indeed, their parents into their new communities is to build up those linkages at schools.  We will be looking to roll that out further.</p><p> Like the Deputy, I try to meet with schools in my area.  A number of schools across a wide part of Dublin 15 were providing great support to students who were in emergency international protection.  When that hotel was not available anymore and they moved out, the schools were looking to try to facilitate buses to continue to link people in.  Schools do amazing work in terms of supporting both Ukrainians and international protection applicants.  There are some bespoke measures in place from the Department of Education and we are looking to build further in terms of, particularly, the area of international protection applicants.</p></speech>

One of the biggest direct provision centres is in my area in Clondalkin.  It is there a long time and the families are part of our community at this stage.  They play on the local football team and go to school with my kids and other children in the area.</p> <p>  One of the biggest issues we have is people who have the right to remain but cannot exit direct provision.  For example, people in homeless hubs will get key workers in and people to help them exit that.  Do people in direct provision who have the right to remain get those housing supports and people to help them through the housing assistance payment, HAP, or homeless HAP situation, whatever it might be?</p></speech>

We provide those supports.  We have a staff member from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, seconded to our Department who works as a key worker for people in international protection to assist them in moving on.  We would be looking to increase that level of support and perhaps get more support and more people working on these cases to support people to move on.  We all know the incredible pressure on the housing market right now.  Obviously, someone who has status is entitled to HAP and go on the social housing list.  However, we also know, particularly in terms of the housing list, the time spent is key there.  The statutory supports are there in terms of finances, but there are personnel supports as well, which we are hoping to grow.</p></speech>

I just had a couple of people on to me in the past couple of days who are in direct provision and are struggling to find a way out.  I do not know if they have had that support.  When I asked them, they had not got it.</p></speech>

I have one last issue to raise.  Can the Minister open the intercultural centre in Clondalkin for me?  I spoke to that employee.  In fairness, I spoke South Dublin County Partnership and it indicated that it looks like it will be opening the door soon.  If the Minister&rsquo;s Department can put any pressure to have it open, that would very welcome as well.</p></speech>

I actually have a question tabled about this tomorrow.  On the domestic violence services, is there any breakdown of where exactly that is going?  How will that work?  The Department of Justice is supposed to be taking it all under one umbrella, which is welcome and it is good to have it in one area.  The Department of Justice is probably a good fit for it.  What impact will that have on the Minister&rsquo;s Department?  The refuges are still being funded by Tusla.  Will that be the plan going forward?  Is there any more information?</p> <p>  Out of interest, I had never seen the Magdalen fund referenced.  Perhaps I just missed it before.  Has there been some new interest in that?  Is that partly because of all of the discussions on mother and baby institutions, redress and the Birth Information and Tracing Act?  Has that brought up perhaps other things that has led people to start looking into that scheme?  That is more just kind of an interest question.</p></speech>

This will take probably about 18 months to two years to establish.  Once that is done, policy but also front-line services will be directly the responsibility of that and the role Tusla currently plays in funding refuge services will move out of Tusla and to this agency fully.  In the interim, because this will all fall within the Department of Justice&rsquo;s remit, it is now responsible for that part of Tusla&rsquo;s Vote.  My Department is responsible for the vast majority of Tusla&rsquo;s Vote.  The education welfare service is run by the Department of Education and it gets the money for that.  Now, the Department of Justice gets the money for that part of Tusla that does domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, response.  I got a significant increase last year, but it is the Department of Justice&rsquo;s role now.  I am afraid I do not have the detailed figures for the Department of Justice on me right now.</p></speech>

In the medium term, it will actually come out of Tusla and into this new agency.  The Magdalen fund was also originally in the Department of Justice.  When the first transfer of functions happened in October 2020, it moved over to this Department.  The Ombudsman looked at the original Magdalen scheme and made a report on that, which broadened out access to the scheme somewhat.  It is primarily on the basis of more people being in contact with the Magdalen scheme and applying to it that the original estimate we had in this year&rsquo;s budget has been exceeded.  We are just looking to make sure we have the sufficient amount.</p></speech>

There was even much media focus and everything on it.  It is good we keep awareness up and keep whatever funding we can definitively in there so that people know they have support services and everything.</p> <p>  Does the Minister want to make any closing remarks?</p></speech>

The Minister is before the committee to discuss: the Cork Life Centre and the Review of Out-of-School Education Provision report; progress made in implementing the recommendations in the joint committee reports entitled, School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health, and Leaving Certificate Reform: The need for a new Senior Cycle; teaching provision to include teacher shortages, Teaching Council registration, teacher diversity and primary teachers' fluency in Irish; and proposals to expand the physical and digital library services in schools.</p> <p>  The format will be that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot to ask questions and for the Minister to respond.  As the Minister is probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.

As we meet here I am deeply conscious, as I know the committee members are, of the recent terrible tragedy in Donegal.  Words cannot describe the immensity of the loss that has been felt, and will continue to be felt, by the community of Creeslough and by all those who have lost a family member or a loved one.  These are incredibly difficult days for those affected and they remain in our thoughts and in our hearts.  As the Minister for Education, I would like to offer my sympathy to all the families who have lost a loved one and the school communities who are mourning the loss of a much loved pupil.</p> <p>  I would also like to acknowledge the role which every school in the area has played in supporting their students, families and staff through this event, which none of them could ever have envisaged.  Schools are central to their communities and I know that each one of these schools has shown remarkable strength, compassion and support for their school communities.  I thank them for all they have done, all they are doing and all they will do in the days, months and, indeed, years ahead.  I know that the Chair and committee members will join with me in sending solidarity and support.</p> <p>  The committee has indicated that it would like to discuss a range of issues in today's session, each of which I will briefly address.  In regard to the senior cycle redevelopment, the committee will be aware that at the end of March, I announced an ambitious programme for the reimagined senior cycle which has the best interests of students at its core.  In the education system, we must always serve the interests of the students.  In respect of the senior cycle, it is evident that while the present system has many advantages, there is a clear need for change.  At the most basic level, the current leaving certificate does not recognise, develop or, indeed, celebrate the very diverse talents that our students have.</p> <p>  As the committee is undoubtedly aware, a very significant body of work was undertaken over the course of four years by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in conjunction with bodies such as the OECD and the education stakeholders.  This has very much informed the programme of reform which is now under way.  I want to thank the committee for its valuable and wide-ranging report in respect of the senior cycle which, indeed, aligns with the work that has commenced in the Department.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge the excellent work of the Cork Life Centre and the dedication of the director and his team in providing a vital pathway for young people who have encountered difficulties completing mainstream education.  I visited the centre in June and had the privilege of meeting with staff, students and parents.  I saw all of their invaluable work first hand.</p> <p>  The review of out-of-school education provision has now moved to a working group, chaired by former City of Dublin ETB CEO, Jacinta Stewart.  This working group will work with stakeholders to develop a sustainable pathway for the alternative education sector, one which reflects the value and importance of the sector.  The level of funding currently provided to Cork Life Centre will continue until such time as the recommendations of the report are implemented.</p> <p>  The committee has also flagged the issue of bullying in schools.  I agree that further work is needed in the area of bullying prevention and this is why I have established a steering committee to review the 2013 action plan on bullying.  The review is taking account of the significant developments and relevant research since the current action plan was published in 2013.  I have been advised that the steering committee aims to have its work completed by the end of November and I look forward to receiving its recommendations.</p> <p>  Regarding teacher supply, a number of important actions have been taken including more than 3,400 primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers this year and the expansion of the primary substitution teacher supply panels.  One hundred and seventy teachers are expected to graduate from upskilling programmes in Spanish, maths and physics this year.  It is expected that more than 300 teachers will graduate in 2023 and third and fourth year students can now register with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  Job sharing and career break arrangements have been relaxed for the current school year and the Department is in ongoing engagement with school management bodies on possible further measures.</p> <p>  The Department has undertaken numerous initiatives to make teaching attainable to those from diverse backgrounds.  In particular, the Teaching Transforms campaign is promoting the teaching profession using radio, video and social media and is supported by a dedicated web page.  The campaign highlights the importance of diversity in the classroom and it has featured student teachers from backgrounds that are traditionally under-represented in teaching.</p> <p>  In respect of school libraries, the &euro;20 million grant funding provided earlier this year gives access to more and better reading opportunities for children and young adults across all school-going ages and reading abilities.  In order to assist schools in spending their grant funding, the Department has collaborated with the public library service to provide specific, tailored support measures and resources.  The development of a new literacy, numeracy and digital strategy is under way.  This seeks to further enhance the literacy and numeracy skills of our learners.  The development is underpinned by extensive research and consultation.  The consultation will include engagement with relevant stakeholders, including Libraries Ireland, the Library Association of Ireland and JCSP libraries.  The new strategy will be published in early 2023.</p> <p>  As I said at the outset, significant work is being done right across the Department and the school sector generally.  At budget time, I was proud to have secured ground-breaking investments in our education system, furthering the work of recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting the achievement of all our students.  The introduction of a new scheme to provide free books for all students in primary school has been a priority of mine since taking office and signifies a new chapter in Irish primary education.</p><p>This permanent initiative, benefiting more than 540,000 students, will greatly reduce the burden on families and reflects the importance the Government places on education for all children.  For the third consecutive year, I have lowered the staffing schedule for schools, bringing it to an historic low of 23:1 in primary schools.  Since 2021, we have also invested in an enhanced summer programme.  I am delighted to have secured a further &euro;20 million in funding to maintain the availability of this programme for all our schools.  It has been enormously valuable to students and continues to grow in popularity and in impact.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I are intent on ensuring that it is further developed.  The progress we are making for all students and right across the sector will continue into 2023 and beyond.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on the free books scheme.  For me, it was one of the highlights of budget 2023.</p> <p>  I will bring up a few issues with regard to what the Minister mentioned.  The Minister is looking at senior cycle redevelopment, which is positive.  However, what we are all being asked, including by many of my past pupils, is whether there is any indicative date for the junior certificate results yet.  I know a lot of this is beyond our control but is there any indicative date yet as to when they might be out?</p></speech>

That was important and the right thing to do.  We also had to provide students with an opportunity to appeal results where they wished to do so, as we do every year.  As a result of a landmark legal ruling some years ago, the traditional format whereby junior cycle results were released prior to appeals decisions had to be changed, which it was in 2019.  In 2019, the results came out sometime in October.  This year, in light of the two sittings and the challenges associated with attracting sufficient numbers of correctors, the State Examinations Commission advised that it would not be in a position to give a more definitive time frame with regard to junior cycle results until the appeals were out of the way and had been catered for.  The results of those appeals issued last Friday.  The State Examinations Commission has advised that, following its consideration and analysis of what it has available to it this week, a formal announcement will be made next week.  I acknowledge the frustration of students.  I know they are eager to get their results.  Unprecedented opportunities were provided this year.  The State Examinations Commission is working hard on this and will make a definitive date available next week.</p></speech>

That is positive news.  The students want to see the fruits of their labour.  They want to celebrate their results.  I have had a lot of contact from students who have gone straight into fifth year and who need to decide whether to sit certain subjects at higher or ordinary level.  That will be determined by how they got on in the junior certificate.</p> <p>  With regard to how the Minister is looking at overhauling senior cycle, it would also be really worthwhile to look at junior certificate redevelopment.  The one thing that has always led to a higher benchmark being reached in the languages is the oral examinations, particularly at leaving certificate.  It brings up the results in Irish and French.  Would the Minister consider bringing in such an examination at junior certificate level?  It would lift the standard a little bit.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, an almost entirely new junior cycle curriculum has been made available.  Only recently, the entire cohort of subjects at junior cycle level was provided for.  There is a body of work to be done in reviewing how the junior cycle is working.  That review is ongoing.  We will await its outcome.</p></speech>

What are the Minister's views as to how this can be congruent with keeping standards in Irish language teaching up to scratch?  Perhaps there is an opportunity here.  When I graduated from Mary Immaculate College, we had 12 subjects to teach.  I can still rattle them off: maths, English, Irish, history, geography, science, drama, music, PE, art, SPHE and religion.  Every month, we had to tick those boxes in the cuntas m&iacute;os&uacute;il.  It is a hell of a workload for any teacher to get his or her head around.  Whether we like it or not, we end up specialising in a few subjects and really hone our skills in those areas.  Is there scope to do as other countries have and introduce subject-specific teachers in certain areas?  These would teach the general curriculum but also specialise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics , STEM, the Irish language, the arts or something like that.  This could give the Irish language a big lift.</p></speech>

The policy statement on initial teacher training will be published before the end of the year.  We are consistently looking at ways to continue to support teachers in delivery.  The Deputy made specific reference to languages and how best to deliver language education.  This involves upskilling, continuing professional development and the primary curriculum framework to be published in 2023.  All of the different reviews and publications give us scope to look at everything.  There is a great richness in the primary school system.</p></speech>

In their five years of training, garda&iacute; go on the beat.  In the same way, nurses go on the wards and teachers go on teaching practice.  The teaching practice stint could be a lot longer.  It could involve not just shadowing a teacher in the classroom environment but being let off for a full term at the end.  This would really help teachers.  The best way to learn is to be on your feet, teaching a class of kids with the chalkboard or whiteboard behind you.  That is where you learn best.  It would be great if the colleges of education, which already provide for teaching practice, could elongate the final placement and allow students to teach the real curriculum day to day, rather than always teaching to a fixed lesson plan.  That would also alleviate some of the current staffing challenges.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that.  I also acknowledge the benefit of practical experience in the classroom, which I know from my own experience.  We have seen the manner in which students have come on board with us, particularly during the Covid pandemic.  I further acknowledge our summer provision programme, in the delivery of which many young students play an intrinsic part.  We are moving towards providing the maximum opportunity for children to avail of the expertise of trainee staff who are coming on board.  There are opportunities in this area.</p></speech>

It is an issue I have been raising since she took office so I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss it with her here today.  It relates to teacher training and has not received the attention it deserves.  The Minister stated that 3,400 primary and post-primary teachers will qualify this year.  Is that the total number from public colleges only or the overall total including private-sector colleges?  That is my first question.</p><p>I cannot understand why successive Governments have maintained these caps when there is clearly a need and a demand, as we often discuss here.  Alarmingly, the only other course that is capped in the same way is nursing.  Just this year, the same private college has moved into that space and begun providing undergraduate nursing courses for those who can afford to pay &euro;8,000 a year.  The crux of the problem here is that it relates to whether a student can afford to be a teacher or a nurse, given the only place students can access is a private college.  Whether by mistake or design, the cap on primary teacher training has allowed for the steady transfer of the training of primary school teachers from the public to the private sector, and it is privatisation by stealth.  Moreover, the public colleges are champing at the bit to deliver the in-demand courses but they are unable to do that.</p><p> My understanding is that the Minister can set the intake cap in November for the following academic year, but has she yet set the annual intake for the next academic year?  Each student, regardless of the college attended, represents a future primary school teacher and is important to our education system and our workforce.  Private colleges can provide a very good service and are run by dedicated staff but, as I said, all students in the private sector have to pay about &euro;6,000 in additional fees.  Students who meet the academic criteria should have the right to attend college if they wish and our public institutes should have the right to offer those courses.  Will the Minister abolish the cap and allow all students who would prefer to do so to study at a publicly owned college?</p></speech>

In fact, we have seen year-on-year increases in the number of applicants via the Central Applications Office, CAO, and that is a positive.  At post-primary level, there has been an increase of almost 17%, with an increase of just short of 10% across the board.</p> <p>   I do not have any control over private colleges, as the Deputy will appreciate.  That is a private enterprise-----</p></speech>

If the intention is to control the supply but if she cannot control the supply from private colleges, how can she do that?</p> <p>  There are specific questions regarding the report.  This year, of the 3,400 teachers, how many have come from public colleges and how many from the private sector?</p></speech>

They are specialised questions.  Of the 3,400 we have available, in light of the increased uptake we see year on year via the CAO, we are satisfied that we have sufficiency.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that for primary schools, the demographics are falling year on year.  As for influence over the private sector, that is the same as the private sector in any field for which we might make provision.</p></speech>

My point is that if 3,400 is the number and if many people who are suitably qualified cannot get the points that would enable them to become teachers, the price, on top of all the other costs, is going to be a barrier.  The only way they can train to be a teacher is by taking a private course.  I am concerned about the commodification of education, full stop, and about it being used as a commodity, but students who would make very good teachers cannot train because they might not be able to afford a private course.  Will the Minister examine that?</p></speech>

That plan involves engagement with a variety of partners and educational stakeholders, not least in respect of demand and supply.  The higher education institutions, HEIs, are involved in that action plan.  We take great confidence from the fact that, via the CAO, insofar as teaching is a first option, we have seen an increase in the number of applications into the teaching world, and that is a positive.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from, but it is not possible for us to control private providers across any spectrum.  That is the nature of the private sector.</p></speech>

The first issue I raise relates to the leaving certificate reform that was announced last March, which she referred to in her opening statement.  She will be aware that one of the proposals is that leaving certificate paper one for Irish and English will be dealt with at the end of fifth year.  Some recognition has been given to the idea this could disadvantage boys because of the perceived failure of boys to mature as fast as girls when they are at the age of 16 or 17 and coming into taking their leaving certificate.  Is that an issue on which the Minister has engaged?  Is she concerned about it or does she think sitting these papers at the end of fifth year will not disadvantage any group?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#C01100"><p>One of the key factors in senior cycle reform has come from extensive engagement with many partners in education and specific voices in education, most especially those of students themselves, and they have been clear about the need to spread the assessment load.  They have been very articulate in that respect.  Equally, many of the senior cycle programmes, such as the leaving certificate applied programme, currently have assessment at the end of fifth year.  This gives students the opportunity to feel that not all of their achievement will depend on only one day and one moment in time in the month of June.  Moreover, internationally, there are many examples of exams being taken over a two-year stage and that is right and proper.</p> <p>  It is for all these reasons and more that we will move ahead with holding the paper one exams at the end of fifth year.  Doing so is very much student centred and seeks to ensure that well-being, which is a significant consideration for this committee, will be embedded into the experience of students and give them the opportunity to showcase their best talents.</p></speech>

She may not have concerns about this and I suppose she cannot please every aspect, but she might confirm that that is not preventing her from proceeding with her reform.</p></speech>

In the main, anybody looking at this will say affording students an opportunity to spread the assessment load over two years will benefit them.  As I said, this is already embedded in the leaving certificate applied and it is very much an opportunity for students to avoid feeling all of the burden of responsibility at a single moment in June, so I am very confident about it.</p></speech>

The scheme will take a burden away from parents and guardians.  It also will ensure that no student is limited by an absence of textbooks.  We have between now and next September to work this through this scheme.  It was always my preference that the scheme would be introduced in schools and worked through with the partners in education, thus providing an opportunity for all of the expertise that is already in place to be availed of.  For example, we have a significant book rental scheme in place at primary level that is availed of by more than 97% of schools.  There is considerable expertise already in schools.  This scheme will be worked through with schools.  The scheme is a groundbreaking move in education, as well as a positive move for students and their families.</p></speech>

My first question seeks to build on what was said by Deputy O'Callaghan.  I agree in principle with the idea of students being assessed in fifth yea,r but some reservations have been expressed about the modality of the approach that has been taken regarding paper 1.</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide a comprehensive policy for the Irish language from pre-primary level to teacher education for all schools.  Where does that policy stand and how is it being progressed?</p></speech>

The centres, which is how we refer to them, are out-of-school providers.  This means that they are not within the general and traditional experience of schooling.  I know that the issue raised by the Deputy is one that is particularly important and pertinent to the Cork Life Centre and, indeed, many other centres.  It is for this reason that we are undertaking a full review.  All of the issues, including terms and conditions, will be looked at as part of the review.</p></speech>

That is a key matter.  The funding is welcome.  Co-operation hours do provide a service.  Ultimately, however, anyone teaching in an institution like the centre - and a person may view teaching as a vocation and be very committed to the institution - is entitled to consider what that to which I refer is going to mean for them and their pension in the long term.  Institutions like the Cork Life Centre are going to struggle to hold on to staff.  That is a fact.  We have to crack that issue and we have not done so.  I welcome the progress that has been made, but we still have not cracked the problem.</p></speech>

We now have an implementation group, a chair has been appointed and there is considerable representation on the group.</p> <p>  Co-operation hours apply in other centres.  Traditionally, it has been the case where staff are employed under the terms and conditions that are aligned with the arrangements that are in place but take regard of where the setting of education happens to be.  Notwithstanding that, this aspect will form a significant part of the work of the implementation group.</p></speech>

It will probably not surprise her that I am going to start with the Cork Life Centre.  I raised it with her in a Topical Issue debate last week and, along with Deputy Colm Burke, I asked her an oral parliamentary question on it yesterday.  I did not catch all of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's contribution.  When I started off my teaching journey in 2013 and 2014, I was a part-time teacher without a contract of indefinite duration, CID, without certainty and unable to get a mortgage from a bank or a car loan.  While I appreciate this review process and implementation team are working away behind the scenes, all of these reviews take time, unfortunately.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire alluded to, every year spent on this review and on implementation is another year in which Don O'Leary and others in the Cork Life Centre may potentially lose a much-needed maths teacher.  If we are honest about it, that teacher might get a better offer from a mainstream school, and that offer would include pension entitlements, increments and all of those other things qualified registered teachers are entitled to.  I reiterate the urgency of this matter.  I was talking to Mr. O'Leary earlier today and, whether we like it or not, the centre is likely to lose teachers to mainstream settings again next year.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire alluded to, this is a vocation for many in the centre.  Many people are giving up the prospect of furthering their own careers because they believe in what the Cork Life Centre does, in its work and in Mr. O'Leary.  There is a great atmosphere and team ethos, as the Minister will have experienced when she met those at the centre before the summer.  I again stress the urgency involved.  I hope this implementation report will be carried out expediently and as quickly as possible.  I urge the Minister to ensure it is.</p> <p>  My second point relates to teacher shortages.  I have a very specific ask.  Last year, a number of steps were eventually taken to ensure schools could get substitute teachers.  One such step made a considerable difference for second level schools in particular.  This was allowing existing teachers who chose to do so to work in excess of their 22 contracted hours.  That facility was probably the single most important step the Minister took last year to ensure cover in second level schools.  Before this meeting, I was in contact with the principal of a school I used to work in to see what the lie of the land was within her school.  Of a staff of 83 teachers, 27 were absent today with illness with nine of these cases relating to Covid.  That is still a fairly significant number, representing more than 10% of staff.  This principal spends two or three hours of each day begging people to come in to substitute that morning, the following day or at some other time during the week.  These are hours she should be spending running a school, especially when the solution was there last year and is probably still within her staff room.  Is the Minister looking into this?  Will she reconsider reintroducing those steps, particularly for second level schools, including allowing teachers to work more than 22 hours?</p></speech>

That will very much be the focus.  The review will cover many of the issues Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and O'Sullivan and many others have raised with me at different times.  I acknowledge the considerable progress being made in the Cork Life Centre through the &euro;177,500 and 6,000 co-operation hours, which is effectively the same as making 8.5 full-time posts available.  We are driving forward with that review and with implementation.</p> <p>  On the teacher supply issue the Deputy referenced, as he himself said, many initiatives were put in place last year.  These included enhancing the teacher supply or substitution panels, which we have done again this year.  There are also more than 3,400 teachers coming on stream this year along with 1,300 third and fourth year students.  We are also taking additional measures with regard to job sharing.  The rules in this regard are being relaxed to allow teachers to work the hours that suit them.  Rules in respect of career breaks are also being relaxed.  The measure the Deputy is especially keen on, which allowed existing teachers working a shorter timetable to make themselves available, is the third and final measure.  I am looking at that and will review it to see whether it can be reintroduced.  However, we have already made the announcements with regard to career breaks and job sharing.  I am currently looking at the final measure.</p></speech>

There are seven schools in which I used to teach and I guarantee the picture would be very similar in each.  There are 10% of teachers absent due to Covid in one particular school.  There were also many other absences.  When the answer is within the four walls of the staff room, we need to get on with it and make that decision.  I appreciate the Minister looking at it.  I imagine that, as we go further into the year, the call and clamour for it will grow.</p> <p>  I have a parting comment, rather than a question, on the Cork Life Centre.  I fully acknowledge the difficulty of the task because there are so many of these institutions and centres throughout the country and, if we are honest about it, they are all different.  However, the Minister knows why the situation in the centre is so pressing.  I do not want to raise it here but there is an issue and time is pertinent.  As I have said, I hope it can be done as expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1657" speakername="Eileen Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#E00400"><p>I know Deputies have already raised the issue of the Cork Life Centre but I have one question and would appreciate an answer.  What is the commitment of the Minister and Department to the centre?  We have seen the Ombudsman's report on the importance of the education centre and we have listened to the views of young people.  That is my question on the Cork Life Centre.</p> <p>  My other question is on teacher diversity.  Of course, we have got better over the years but how do we encourage children from marginalised communities, including disabled people and Traveller young people, to go into teaching as a profession?  What special measures are being put in place?</p> <p>  Has the Department of Education considered this committee's recommendation with regard to the Barnardos Friendship Group and the Roots of Empathy programme in primary schools?  Has any more consideration been given to that?  As someone from the Traveller community, I know the real issues on the ground that are impacting on young Traveller children and children from ethnic minority groups when it comes to bullying and mental health.  We are aware that &euro;5 million was drawn down.  That is a step in the right direction with regard to counselling and supports in primary schools.  Is this only for some of our primary schools or will it be for all of our schools?  Is it targeted at the most vulnerable children in society?  We have to be very realistic and acknowledge that you are more likely to face bullying if you are overweight, from the Traveller community, a black or brown person or a refugee.  It is really important we look at those special measures within our schools.  I have asked some direct questions and would appreciate it if I could get some direct answers.</p></speech>

Again, there is significant funding of &euro;177,500 going from the Department directly to Cork Life Centre and 6,000 co-operation hours between ourselves and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, which in turn is leading to 8.5 full-time staff as well.  I had the opportunity to meet representatives from the Cork Life Centre and was very impressed by the work they, and indeed all of the other centres, do.  I absolutely recognise there must be opportunities for different types of models of education provision, and it is for that reason the review of out-of-school education provision is so important.  We are looking to find a mechanism going forward to protect the sustainability of these centres.  That work is ongoing and I assure the committee there is an absolute commitment from the Department to ensure sustainability of this type of education provision will be secured going forward.</p><p> In terms of diversity and teacher diversity, the Department of Education has undertaken numerous initiatives to make teaching attainable for people from a variety of diverse backgrounds.  Increasing diversity in initial teacher education was a key focus of the third national access plan.  As part of the plan, funding in excess of &euro;5.4 million was made available through the programme for the access to higher education, PATH, programme which supports access.  Equally, the Department of Education continues to support the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science which recently announced the fourth national access plan last August or September, and there is the teaching transforms campaign which promotes the teaching profession.  I understand and see the great work being done and the importance being placed on students being able to identify with those who stand in front of them in a classroom, specifically in terms of Roots of Empathy.  I acknowledge the work of the current steering group where a significant body of work is being led by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim.  It is an entire review of the 2013 action plan on bullying for our schools.  As part of that there has been engagement with many different providers, including Barnardos, whose representatives made presentations to the anti-bullying steering committee.  There has been very specific engagement and consultation as well.</p></speech>

There has been specific engagement with children and young people from all different backgrounds, including very specifically children from Traveller and Roma backgrounds.  These engagements are feeding into the process of the steering group and an impressive body of work has already been done.  This committee has fed very proactively into this body of work through the anti-bullying steering group, of which Ms Maria Joyce from the National Traveller Women's Forum is also a member.  I am very keen this body of work will be inclusive of all children and all backgrounds and the publication of the final report is imminent in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>

The very significant and welcome changes that happened in the budget should be acknowledged.  I know colleagues have talked about the free school books initiative and some of the investment in special education needs to acknowledged, but something we do not talk about enough, because it has been banged on about enough around this table, is the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level to the lowest level ever.  This needs to be recognised.</p> <p>  One of the other areas the Minster looked to address was around school buses.  She came in for some unfair criticism from this committee on a previous occasion.  Will the Minister give committee members an update on the planned review of the school transport scheme and where the overall review of the scheme is at?  More people have obviously taken up bus tickets this year than ever before, but we would like to be in a situation where we can guarantee them to every student.</p> <p>  I support the Minister on the leaving certificate reform initiative and the fact that there is a student representative on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, shows how her approach has been student-centred.  Will the Minister provide an update on the roll-out of the two new subjects?  Both climate and sustainability and also theatre, drama and film studies, are very welcome subjects.</p> <p>  Reflecting on Deputy Cathal Crowe's question about specialisations in primary school with regard to teaching, one of the areas he did not mention was the modern language initiative which was pulled back a number of years ago.  Is there any intention in future of looking at rolling out modern European languages at primary school level?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.558" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#F00500"><p>The school transport review is a significant and important body of work.  Nobody appreciates it more than me, coming from an area that is very dependent on the access provided by school transport.  The review is a body of work that has been comprehensive in terms of its consultation.  There have been thousands of engagements with students, parents, guardians, those using the service and, probably even more important, those not using the service.  There have been engagements with providers, those in the general community and those who have an expertise in the area.  It is a significant body of work, and we are moving apace with it and looking to complete it as quickly as possible.  I will be honest and say it has been impacted by some of the issues faced within the Department and in wider society, whether those be Covid-19 or the particular challenges at present in terms of securing places and transport for Ukrainian families.  Everything impacts on everything else but it is my absolute determination that we will move as quickly as we can with the publication of that report.</p> <p>  In terms of the leaving certificate subjects specifically, significant work has already been achieved on the two subjects, which are drama, film and theatre studies, which I know is very close to the Senator's heart, and, equally close, the climate action sustainable development.  The background papers have been prepared.  I am a firm believer in the importance of the public consultation that is ongoing at the minute and which will close at the end of this month.  The subject development group has already been convened and the meetings have commenced.  There is a significant body of work on those subjects.</p></speech>

On modern languages, we had a very successful roll-out of the modern language sampler in our primary schools last year, which has proved very positive and attractive to schools, and a large number of schools, in excess of 700, if I recall correctly, sought to take it up.  The beauty of it is that there was a whole diversity of languages used, with up to 17 different languages being provided for in those schools.  I am intent on ensuring this will be progressed further, and if it proves itself to be successful as a pilot, we will look to extend it.</p></speech>

Is it her hope to extend the free books scheme to second level schools if budgetary considerations allow?  That will be a matter for others but the scheme is something that would be beneficial.</p></speech>

The &euro;50 million investment to secure it for primary level was a significant investment, but a good one.  It is my intention and ambition to embed this at primary school level and then the next obvious step would be to move it to post-primary.  It was important to start the scheme at the beginning of the education experience, so we are beginning with primary, but it is my ambition, where at all possible and subject to budgetary constraints, as the Senator put it so well, that we will be able to secure it at post-primary in future budgets.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for her kind words for the families in Donegal at the start of her opening statement.  They are very much appreciated.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware that school transport has been a major issue for me, particularly in the east Galway area.  I suppose my question, if the Minister does not mind, and apologies if she has answered it already, is, what is the number of tickets that have been issued to date?  Do we have a total number for that?</p> <p>  I have been dealing with the Galway regional manager and there are significant challenges with capacity.  It is going out to an internal panel.  How will we make it more attractive for those contractors to provide those services?  There is &euro;10 million extra in the fuel allowance.  Is there anything else around that?  Has the Minister any other comments around this?</p> <p>  The Minister has been doing a lot of work.  A budget has been allocated, which is appreciated, but even today I am dealing with mothers under immense stress who still have no acknowledgement or communication about the potential timeline for when they may see a ticket under the concessionary side of it.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that it is an issue that is quite important to me in my area.</p> <p>  In terms of the items in the Minister's opening statement around the senior cycle reform, what does she see for this September?  There were a number of initiatives that the Minister took last September.</p> <p>  On the elements here tackling bullying, the Minister mentioned she will be looking at the expert report that is coming in, but also the recommendations of our own committee's report on tackling bullying.</p> <p>  On the number of teachers that have been allocated, it is fantastic to see the reduction of the teacher-pupil ratio at national level.</p> <p>  I also welcome the &euro;20 million fund for the school libraries.  On the school books, the Minister mentioned 540,000 students.  I wanted to ask whether that is the total number of students at primary school level.  It is merely to clarify that is all the students who are receiving that.</p> <p>  I refer to some of the questions that we had here in relation to the State Examinations Commission.  It was around the leaving certificate reform, where students would be sitting paper 1 in English at the end of fifth year.  There was a little concern around that.  The committee here has a recommendation about undertaking some of those assignments across both fifth year and leaving certificate year.</p> <p>  The final question here is in relation to the digital library service.  Is it possible for additional schools to join this service or is it at maximum capacity?  It would be good to have the Minister's comments on that, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#G01000"><p>In terms of the school transport, I appreciate the difficulties that this poses for many.  In the first instance, it is important to say that the waiving of school transport fees was in respect of those who met the criteria.  Everybody knows the criteria now.  Perhaps not knowing it in advance, the criteria is 3.2 km from one's nearest primary school and 4.8 km from one's nearest or next nearest post-primary school.  Those who met that criteria are being satisfied and provided for.</p> <p>  There has always been an issue of concessionaries.  For example, in previous years where there was additional capacity, concessionary tickets were provided for.  That is also happening this year.  There is a 27% or 28% increase in the number of concessionaries who are gaining tickets this year - an 18% increase in those who were eligible in the first instance.</p> <p>  At this point, 126,000 tickets have been issued.  That, at this point, compares to 103,000 tickets last year.  Additional funding, as the Senator will be aware, has been secured in the budget where we are now looking to satisfy those who were in receipt of concessionary tickets last year, who applied on time and where there is capacity.  We are working through that, notwithstanding that in some areas I will absolutely concede there are difficulties, either in obtaining buses or bus drivers.  Some areas are more challenged than others.  I appreciate that, from the Senator's point of view as well.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard.  Those who met the criteria have been successful and there has been a 28% increase in those who were concessionaries who gained a ticket compared to previous years.</p> <p>  In terms of some of the other areas the Senator raised in terms of senior cycle, we are progressing some of the elements that we already see of senior cycle in operation, for example, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP.  Heretofore, students had to avail of certain types of subjects very much in the business sphere to be eligible to avail of LCVP.  That criterion no longer is provided for.  It is open to all students to access it.</p> <p>  Equally, the leaving certificate applied programme and the leaving certificate established, or the traditional leaving certificate programme, stood independent of each other.  I can see, and many here will be aware, that it had opportunities to impact negatively on career choices for students.  From this year, students who are studying leaving certificate applied had the option of taking, for example, mathematics from the leaving certificate established programme.</p> <p>  Other work I referenced earlier includes the development work that is already in the public consultation around the development of the two new subjects, film, theatre and drama and climate action and business.  That is out there for public consultation to conclude at the end of the month.</p> <p>  On the network schools programme, there has been some significant interest from some schools.  We are taking the opportunity to promote it to all schools or for there to be a more formal promotion of that for schools that might wish to avail of it.</p> <p>  Of course, we are looking at other elements, also imbedded in senior cycle.  Aspects would be the orals, music at Easter time, that is, outside of school time, and a review on how it operated last year with a view to seeing how we can imbed that going forward.</p> <p>  In terms of bullying, I acknowledge the work of Dr. Noel Purdy, as I said initially, who is chairing the steering group.  He is of Stranmillis University College, Antrim.  I acknowledge that this review of the 2013 action plan is a significant one.  I acknowledge the impressive and significant body of work that this committee has done.  It is intrinsic to the work of the steering committee.  In fact, a presentation was made to the steering committee on all of the work and the issues that this committee identified.  Equally, the membership of the steering group is significant.  It includes Professor James O'Higgins Norman, who holds the UNESCO chair at DCU.</p> <p>  I do not wish in any way to prejudice the outcome of the steering committee but, for example, one of the key issues that Senator Dolan raised was around the roll-out of the FUSE programme.</p></speech>

That is all I can say to the Senator at this point.</p> <p>  There has been considerable consultation as part of the steering group as well.  I had the opportunity to attend some of those consultations, particularly with the young people.  They were uplifting, informative and inclusive.  There were children of all backgrounds: children from a special education background, children with a Traveller or Roma background, and children from mainstream schools.  There was the richest of engagement.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the manner in which the information was provided by the students was expert.  There was engagement also with international experts.  The work is ongoing.  I look forward to its outcome.  I acknowledge that the committee's work here is very much intrinsic to it.</p> <p>  In terms of the State Examinations Commission and the leaving certificate reform in paper 1 in terms of English and Irish at the end of fifth year, as I referenced earlier, the singular impetus for that is embedding student well-being into the experience of senior cycle.  Students have been exercised and engaged around the topic of spreading the assessment load for them.  We already see it operate at leaving certificate applied level where there are opportunities in fifth year.  It is for that reason that we are looking at paper 1 being made available to students at the end of fifth year.  A body of work in making that operational is under way.  It is very much student-centred and student well-being-centred.</p></speech>

Will she elaborate on the expansion of the primary substitute teacher supply panels?  What will be the increase?</p> <p>  On leaving certificate reform, there is concern about the moving of paper 1 to the end of fifth year in both Irish and English.  I met representatives of Conradh na Gaeilge in September and there was concern that students may not be fully prepared at the end of fifth year.  Many students go to the Gaeltacht during the summer of fifth year and that stands to them when they come to sit both papers 1 and 2 in Irish.  I was certainly one of those students a long time ago and I benefited from the time I spent in the Gaeltacht when it came to sitting papers 1 and 2 in sixth year.</p> <p>  How much consultation has the Minister had with teachers and pupils and organisations such as Conradh na Gaeilge in respect of the Irish exam and the change in that regard, and what are her views on the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#H00200"><p>Regarding the primary substitution panels, I think 610 posts have been provided for and 151 panels are in operation at present.  As I said throughout the previous two years, where a specific issue is identified in an area in regard to capacity and the need to provide for more, we are open to engagement on that.  Some areas, from a geographical point of view, can be more challenging than others but every step of the way over the past two years we have sought to increase the number of both posts and panels.  We are open to doing that on an ongoing basis as the need might arise.</p> <p>  On the senior cycle, I do not wish to repeat myself but I think there has been great clarity from all sides regarding the need for senior cycle reform.  People have been unequivocal in that regard.  One of the singular issues identified by students themselves - at the end of the day, senior cycle reform must be student centred - related to spreading the assessment load.  In other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, or in our leaving certificate applied, there are opportunities for students to experience the spread of assessment load at the end of fifth year.  On the specific issues the Deputy raised with regard to Conradh na Gaeilge, my Department and officials meet that organisation on an ongoing basis and will do so specifically in respect of the issues it wishes to highlight in this context.</p> <p>  It is not sustainable for students to feel that everything depends on how they will perform on just one day.  The opportunity for them to take a certain portion of the exam at the end of fifth year will lessen the weight placed on them.  As I said, we have seen this work well both in other jurisdictions and in some of the other offerings we have at senior cycle.  The change is student centred and will allow students to showcase their talents and skills equally over two years, rather than feel the pressure of one exam at the end of sixth year.</p></speech>

Students who may want to go to the Gaeltacht in the summer of fifth year will be put at a disadvantage because, obviously, they will not have had time to do their stint in the Gaeltacht, which stands to them when they come to sit paper 1 in the leaving certificate as it stands.  I understand the principle and rationale of spreading out the assessment but I am concerned it will have the unintended consequence of stretching the stress associated with assessment over a longer period.  Moreover, students will need to be prepared more quickly and that could cause difficulty and challenges for teachers as well as students.</p></speech>

Obviously, they will be supported by any additional trips students might wish to take to the Gaeltacht or by the work they do in school.</p> <p>  I fully accept the Deputy's bona fides and the points she is raising but students have been clear that having to face everything on one day is an extraordinary burden and pressure.  Having the opportunity to do it over two years will lessen that burden.  As I said, we have seen this as best practice in other jurisdictions, where it works well, and in the leaving certificate applied.  It is intended to ensure that students will not feel the high stakes of everything depending on one moment in June.  Those stakes are far too high for them.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate from conversation in general society, there is a consistent understanding that far too much pressure is placed on our senior cycle students in June.  It is a very hyped-up exam and there is so much discussion and conversation about it.  Students deserve a more structured and even approach over two years.  It will give them a better opportunity and more accommodation to showcase their talents.  The motivation is students' well-being and a student-centred approach.</p></speech>

Every one of them was high class but they came from various backgrounds.  Every child and student has various levels of confidence and various ways in which they are able to express themselves independently or otherwise in, to borrow a phrase of the Minister's a moment ago, showcasing their talents and skills.  Perhaps some of these students are unable to do that in the larger school setting, but they were able to find their confidence and showcase their talents and skills when they were part of Cork Life Centre.</p><p>I would not like to see anything happen to Cork Life Centre and many other centres across the country.  I know this is a big challenge for the Minister and her Department.  Do we see more facilities such as Cork Life Centre mushrooming across the country?  Is that the answer?  I am not the Minister or an official in the Department but I believe we must grasp the nettle and offer assistance.  These are fabulous students.  I listened to the Minister's reply in the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday evening.  I spoke to the staff members in the Cork Life Centre who gained qualifications to get where they are today.  Those people, like everybody else, aspire to being the brilliant people they are, having permanent and full-time jobs, being able to acquire a mortgage and a secure future for themselves and their families.</p><p> The committee visited Mountjoy Prison last week.  I was very impressed to see that the teaching staff there are in full-time employment for the 12 months of the year.  They are employed by the education and training board and are in the prison on a permanent basis.  They also get summer payment.  To become a teacher is a difficult road to take.  It is a difficult qualification to gain.  We are doing teachers down if they have to avail of social welfare for the summer months of the year.  If I were a teacher and had to avail of social welfare, I would not come back to the classroom as confident come September as I was when I left in May because I had to go on the dole.  It is hugely downgrading to someone who has a fantastic qualification.</p><p> When the Minister visited the Cork Life Centre, he gave a commitment to look into the fact that registered teachers were not being paid in the way that others were nationally and across other settings.  He asked for information to be sent to him and his Department.  I understand that was done immediately.  I further understand that the director of the Cork Life Centre stayed in touch with the social inclusion section of the Department over the summer months.  Nothing has happened.  It may be that the Minister and his officials are working on it but I would like to know where that matter stands at the moment, if the Minister could answer.</p></speech>

I want to say that the entire review of out-of-school educational provision is to ensure that places such as the Cork Life Centre and other centres have a sustainable future.  The major concern of Cork Life Centre relates to its sustainable future.  I acknowledge that the Department has not been found wanting in offering supports to Cork Life Centre, whether through the 6,000 co-operation hours or the &euro;177,500 that has been offered and all of that.</p> <p>  An issue around staff and their terms and conditions has been raised.  The terms and conditions of the staff are very much in line with arrangements which apply to settings outside the recognised school system.  That is the current situation.  The implementation group on foot of the review is chaired, as I said, by Ms Jacinta Stewart, former CEO of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  The implementation group will be looking at all aspects, including the issue that was specifically raised with me.  There is a body of work to be done in that regard.  As we referenced earlier, there are a number of different centres and different scenarios in operation in each of those centres.  There is a demand to find a common link and sustainability for all of them, going forward.</p> <p>  The Chairman made reference to the visit the committee made to Mountjoy Prison, which also benefits from co-operation hours.  I made the point earlier that many other centres benefit from co-operation hours.  I absolutely recognise that there can be situations where students are not being provided for within the mainstream and can be provided for in different settings.  I see that in the Cork Life Centre and other centres.  We now need to find a mechanism to make them sustainable, going forward.  That is the significant work being under taken by the implementation group.  It is already in place.  There is impressive representation on that implementation group, from the Children's Rights Alliance to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, Jigsaw, you name it.  This is a significant implementation group.  We are working towards the sustainability of the Cork Life Centre and others.</p></speech>

I am aware of what we, as a Department, have put into the Cork Life Centre which, in respect of the co-operation hours, would be equivalent to approximately 8.5 teaching posts.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Deputy mentioned 8.5 teaching posts because eight staff were lost to the Cork Life Centre this summer alone.  They were all senior staff.  All of them had worked there for a minimum of six years.  Some of them had worked there for 12 or 13 years.  There was an inevitability to the Cork Life Centre losing staff this summer.  The director had warned in advance that eight to 12 staff would be lost this summer.  With the cost-of-living crisis, there can be no expectation or presumption that teaching staff who are not paid properly, or not paid at all in some cases, will be retained.  It became clear during the earlier exchange that the Minister had with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that those staff are not in receipt of their increments.  There was an inevitability that economic circumstances would force people to leave.  Their departure has not involved a replacement of subjects and the Cork Life Centre has been able to maintain the curriculum.  However, the loss of those staff represents a considerable loss of experience.  For an education centre that works on a model of relationships between staff and young people, to lose eight staff is a big blow.  It is a blow the centre will face again next year unless a solution to this issue can be found between now and then.  How long does the Minister foresee the review taking?  How long will it take to roll out the proposals?  How long will the Cork Life Centre have to put up with a situation where it loses staff every summer, which puts it in an impossible position due to the Department's failure to act?</p></speech>

I want to be very clear.  The supports provided to the Cork Life Centre have not changed.  In fact, they have increased considerably since I became Minister.</p><p>A figure of &euro;177,500 was provided directly, and 6,000 co-operation hours were provided between the Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science which, again, is equivalent to 8.5 full-time posts.  We have not, therefore, changed the resource.  In fact, we have increased it in the past two years and it remains in place this year, as it did last year.  That is a significant investment from the Department, notwithstanding the challenges faced by Cork Life Centre.  I want to acknowledge that.</p><p> In terms of the review and now the implementation group, we are seeking to do all we can to make Cork Life Centre and other centres sustainable.  That is what Cork Life Centre wants and, indeed, what we all want, recognising that there is a place for out-of-school education provision to meet the needs of students who might require it.</p><p> As I said previously, the implementation group is ongoing.  The review has been completed and the implementation group is now doing its body of work.  There is a significant body of work to get through.  As I referenced earlier, there is significant representation on that group.  It is chaired by the ex-CEO of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.

The Minister mentioned on numerous occasions in the discussion the &euro;177,500 and the co-operation hours equivalent to 8.5 full-time posts.  Does the Minister think that is nearly enough?  Could she answer that for me briefly?</p></speech>

It is for that reason the review has been undertaken and that we now have an implementation group.  I want to ensure that these centres are sustainable.  The review is not just about Cork Life Centre; it is about all the centres.  There must be equality in terms of what we implement. The implementation group is charged with ensuring the sustainability of all these centres going forward.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the staff.  The staff are employed under the terms and conditions in line with arrangements that apply to settings outside the recognised school system.  I appreciate that is not working for all staff.  Therefore, that will be part of the implementation group.</p></speech>

It is very clear that the resources that have been put at the disposal of Cork Life Centre are not nearly enough.  What speaks to that more clearly than anything that has been said in the committee today, with respect, is the fact that eight staff were lost from Cork Life Centre, which does such vital work in Cork city and beyond.  That is eight staff in one summer alone.  Clearly, the measures that are in place fall well short.  This is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed with far greater urgency.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Before I call the next speaker, I will comment along the same train of thought.  Are there many centres similar to Cork Life Centre across the country?  I am not sure of any of them.  Do they have the same challenges as Cork Life Centre in losing staff?  I am following a thread from Deputies Barry, P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The centre lost staff at a specific time when they had - I will not say experience; I should not use that word - a great relationship with some of the students.  Is this a challenge many other similar centres to Cork Life Centre are having?</p> <p>  These are students who, and I say this genuinely, just do not fit into the larger classrooms.  I was a Minister myself so I know this is a huge challenge, absolutely.  I acknowledge that.  The question is about how the Minister fixes this.  It comes down to financial resources.  Money fixes a huge number of things.  I know the Minister cannot create an expectation that she can make schools mushroom across the country but the ones that are there are doing a fantastic job.  Is the Minister having similar challenges where there are similar centres?  How many students do they have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#K00600"><p>In general, there are a number of centres spread across the country.  They are not all the same.  They are all quite different and yet, they are similar in that they cater for students outside of mainstream education.  They are all doing different things.  The key commonality among them, though, in my experience, is sustainability in how they can continue to survive and provide the services they are providing.  It is complex and difficult.  That does not mean to say we cannot and should not tackle it, however, and we are doing so.</p> <p>  The first step was the review.  The next step after the review is the implementation.  We have put together a significant implementation group, which has already begun its work.  We will move apace.  I absolutely appreciate the urgency that is attached to this.  We have been consistent in our support to Cork Life Centre.  We have increased our support to the centre over the past two years, notwithstanding the difficulty it continues to have.  It is my absolute ambition that we will conclude this as quickly as we possible can.  The implementation group has just begun its work but we will move it as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

I listened to everything the Minister had to say about Cork Life Centre so I will not ask her to comment further.  Having visited the place and met students and their teachers, however, it struck me, and continues to strike me, how particularly unfair it seems.  When we have teachers who are giving a very targeted, specific and necessary service to students in their care, which is in no way to detract from the huge contributions of teachers in more mainstream settings, it seems so unfair that there would be a disincentive to remaining in such a centre of learning because of the relative disadvantage of continuing if the advantage is to be had elsewhere in terms of progression at salary level and so on.  It is, therefore, definitely an issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about the free school books at primary level, which I welcome.  Is there any chance she can say a little bit more about how she intends to go about consultations?  Obviously, even good change can be a little bit frightening and daunting for some.  There are retailers, small retailers and book publishers, which I have been dealing with myself lately.  It is legitimate for them to be concerned and to ask what this means for their livelihoods and employees and so on.  If the Minister can say anything about the timescale of the consultations she plans to have, or whether it is her intention, broadly speaking, to continue to ensure that those who are participating in the sector will not be forced out or disadvantaged by the new arrangements that proposed, that would be helpful.</p> <p>  I spoke recently to somebody who was repurposing a building in the hope of providing accommodation for Ukrainian families in that area, which struck me as being a very legitimate endeavour.  This person was concerned, however, and inquired and wondered about whether there would be school places in the area for Ukrainian students, particularly in terms of those who have not yet come to the country.  Is there anything the Minister can tell us in that regard?  Are there specific challenges?  Are there challenges in particular places as opposed to others?  Can the Minister shed any light on the challenges, of which there are many, faced by the Government in this particular area?</p> <p>  The Minister will know that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is conducting a consultation about relationship and sexuality consultation, RSC.  I have heard from many parents who are concerned about aspects of the proposed new curriculum.  They worry, in general, that the curriculum is tending to get a bit political, to say the least.  There is concern, for example, about the proposal to talk about the influence of or teach about pornography.  Some of them wonder why the State is teaching about it when it is doing so little to tackle access to and promotion of pornography.  It is something that could be gotten right but it could be gotten very wrong as well.</p> <p>  This intersects with questions of the characteristic spirit of schools and the values of parents, who are the primary educators.  Is the Minister able to reassure us that there will continue to be respect for the diversity of schools and school characteristics, and for the concerns of parents, in the context of these proposed changes to the curriculum?</p> <p>  In the context of paper 1 as Gaeilge, and B&eacute;arla being possibly taken after year 1, what are the other areas in which we could see the lightening of the leaving certificate load?</p><p>What are the earlier opportunities?  Does it have to be the essay?  Might there be filiocht studied in year one and prose in bliain a d&oacute;?  I am not just talking about Irish; are there aspects of chemistry or mathematics curriculum that could be dealt with in that staggered way?  Is the Department looking at that?  Where might the early changes be? </p><p> I believe politics and society is a subject that is increasingly popular at second level.  It would be remiss of me not to ask the Minister if she would encourage students, teachers and parents to take up the opportunity to participate in the new Oireachtas essay competition that I launched in recent weeks with the support of the Ceann Comhairle and others.  I would be delighted for an endorsement of that competition in this forum and an encouragement to everyone to get involved.  I would also be grateful if those Teachta&iacute; or Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; who have received a text or email today would also notify the schools and stakeholders in their spheres of influence in their localities.</p></speech>

I absolutely accept that and understand its importance.  We have done considerable work with the review and we are doing even more work with the implementation group.  My sole objective is to ensure that centres such as the Cork Life Centre and others are sustainable into the future.  I know the importance of ensuring that children and young people are catered for in a setting that will meet their needs.  We are intent on doing that work.</p> <p>  On the availability of free books at primary level, there is investment of over &euro;50 million which is significant.  It will lessen the load placed on parents and guardians but also ensure that every child will have an equal opportunity and access to text books and everything else.  On the Senator's concerns about local retailers, there is already excellent work ongoing in our schools around the book rental scheme we have.  Invariably the book rental scheme is operated in co-operation with the local retailer, the book shop or whatever.  Schools will have the absolute freedom to determine how they will operate the roll-out of the free book scheme.  Many will have already built up relationships with their local providers and may well seek to continuing with that relationship.  That will not be prevented or inhibited by the Department.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>   On school places in the area for new children and young people who may come in, we are very fortunate that we have capacity in our school system.  I will be honest that we have greater capacity in some areas than others and we make that clear.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has responsibility for providing accommodation.  We seek to work with the Department where we have capacity in our schools.  We are fortunate that we do have enough capacity in our schools in various places, notwithstanding that it might be more challenging in some areas than others.  However, in general, there is capacity available.</p> <p>  On the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and the review of SPHE and RSE syllabus, the third national strategy on the need to promote and cultivate a society of zero tolerance for gender and sexual-based violence was launched recently.  We are absolutely committed to ensuring that there is zero tolerance around this.  It is very important that our students are educated appropriately and have the appropriate tools to know how to manage this world of information that comes before them today, particularly that is available to them automatically on their phones.  It is uncensored and unsupervised.  It is very important that we have skill sets in our schools to provide for students in that respect.  The Senator mentioned what is being taught and how.  We are ensuring that there will be an opportunity for our staff to take up postgraduate studies, the costs of which will be covered by the Department, to ensure that they will be sufficiently trained up in the area of SPHE and RSE and also ensuring that by providing this expertise that will in turn be made available to our students but also ensure the importance of the subject is emphasised in our schools.  It is important that our students have information and that it is the right information imparted to them by professionals who are experienced in the area.  It is not, and never will be appropriate that they will have access to this information.</p></speech>

I want to reassure Senator Mullen that everyone in Mayo heard him on Midwest Radio the other day.  I heard it being discussed in households and heard parents encouraging their students to apply for it.  I think that it is a really good idea.</p> <p>  I want to return again to the cap.  If you cap at 1,200 for masters and we have a figure who qualified last year of 3,400, then we are 2,200 places short from the public schools plus any who would have been dissuaded or could not afford to take up the places in the private colleges.  Will the Minister look at abolishing the cap to allow all students who would prefer to study at a public college to train to be a teacher to do so?</p></speech>

I am just establishing that.  We engage on an ongoing basis with all the stakeholders regarding demand and supply to ensure that we have an appropriate supply in place.  That includes the higher education institute, HEI, providers.  We also have a teacher supply action plan which is informed by the work of all of our stakeholders and partners in education.  The private providers are responding as they are entitled to, as in whatever sector of society.  We do have 3,400 teachers coming on stream.  It is a significant body.  The demographics tell us the requirement at primary level is actually coming down rather than going up.  I appreciate the Deputy has a particular interest in this.  We look at everything with our teacher supply action plan.  We engage on an ongoing basis with all the education providers and partners in education and we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

I raised the matter of the Life Centre last night in the D&aacute;il.  I know the MInsiter gave an explanation here.  I fully understand that the Department and ETB are involved and that it is a complex issue.  It is somethign on which we need to work out a compromise.  I gave the example last night of my own experience of being on a board of management and being chair of a board of management of a facility in Blackpool back in the 1990s.  I remember when I went in as chairperson, we had facilities that were totally inadequate for 50 young people.  I remember spending &euro;85,000 without having a tosser in the bank to upgrade it and to make sure we had the appropriate facilities.</p><p>That facility is working well.  Many of the children, like the people in the Cork Life Centre, have dropped out of school.  Many, although not all, but quite a number of them in the Blackpool centre<font color="#444444"></font>would have been referred by the garda&iacute; for minor offences.  In fairness to the community garda&iacute;, they worked closely on getting them back into the education system.  I gave the example of the project on Blackpool, which was done for me and for the board by Don O'Leary from the Cork Life Centre when he was doing his masters.  We looked at the children who left us five years earlier and where they were now.  More than 70% were in full-time employment.  It was also interesting to find that, for a huge number of those children, the employment history of their parents would not have been great, so we were breaking a whole trend that was there and helping them.  Likewise with the Cork Life Centre, there is a mixture of children there who do not fit into the formal education setting.  When someone drops out of school, it can be very difficult for parents.  I have also done a lot of work with people who are doing home-school teaching, providing tuition at home, and it is always challenging when a child drops out of school.  In fairness to the Cork Life Centre, it has done a huge amount of work over the last 15 to 20 years that is has been there.<br/><br/>The question now is about how we get it into a structure that is acceptable to the Department and the ETB while at the same time it continues to have an independence to work and do things that are not necessarily within the formal education setting.  The question is about that compromise.  A compromise can be arrived at, but it is important that everyone is brought along, including the ETB, the Department and the people on the front line running this facility.  I know the whole thing has been examined and the research has been done on it, but the next step is to bring the people who have been involved in running the centre to date into that equation and to convince them that they have an independence that does not restrict or in any way infringe on the work they are doing and the success they have in that work.  They have lost, I think, eight teachers since June.  Each of them had an average of six years' experience.  There is a huge challenge there now.  A number of people who went to work there on voluntary basis are now teachers in the formal education setting, so there is training for the students and the people in the educational sector.  How can we progress it?  It has come up as Topical Issue matter and as an oral question last night and it is being discussed again now, but we need to try to move it forward.  Does the Minister see a way where we can bring everyone on board in regard to the changes required to give it the financial support it needs?</p></speech>

As he said, he has engaged with me previously in a Topical Issues matter, oral questions, etc.  There is a huge commitment from this committee.  It is my objective to ensure that centres like Cork Life Centre are sustainable and that there is a very clear pathway forward for them.  I understand, from my own experience, that the formal education setting satisfies the vast majority of students, although not all, and that every student is valuable.  We need to find the maximum opportunity for every student to be happy, content and to learn in an environment that suits them.  We have a number of education centres, similar to, but not entirely the same as Cork Life Centre.  That is why the body of work around the review was undertaken.  That has been completed; we are now on to the next stage, which is the implementation group.  That group has just been formalised and has just begun its work.</p> <p>  I have already informed the committee that it is being chaired by the former CEO of Dublin City ETB, Ms Jacinta Stewart.  There is a wide realm of experience sitting on that implementation group, including the Children's Rights Alliance, Jigsaw, representatives from justice, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  There is a considerable body of expertise there.  The objective is to ensure that we find a pathway forward to make these centres sustainable.  I understand all of the points that have been raised in terms of staffing and the issues around staffing.  The reason those issues are there around staffing is that staff are employed under terms and conditions in line with arrangements which apply to the settings in which they teach.  This particular setting is outside the recognised school system.  That is an issue for them.  That will be considered as part of the implementation group and we will seek to find a pathway forward.</p> <p>  I have met with Cork Life Centre, as the Deputy is aware, and I know the value of the work they are doing.  I have increased the Department's financial to them commitment over the last two years; it is now at a record high of &euro;177,500 and there is a record high of 6,000 co-operation hours, which equates to the 8.5 full-time staff being made available.  I have not changed that commitment this year, so that same level of staffing and funding is available to them.  We need to find a way forward.  I know everybody sitting around this committee and I know the Chair is also very invested in this, as is everyone else who sits here.  I am doing all I can using the vehicle of the implementation group to find a solution or a viable way forward for all of the centres, including Cork Life Centre.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, I appreciate that Cork Life Centre had specifically asked for certain clarifications.  That was done and published.  There has been considerable consultation.  The next step is the implementation.  There will be opportunities as we go forward.  Irrespective of the formula that will be employed, there is a shared agenda to make this work and to make it viable and sustainable.  It is not without its challenges.

I thank also the Minister and officials at the Department.  The DEIS programme and rollout are fantastic to see.  One in four schools is in the programme.  A secondary school in Ballinasloe, County Galway, was one of the schools in Galway to join and it recently received investment for a classroom.  It is phenomenal.</p> <p>  One of my earlier questions was about DEIS access and the digital library for the junior certificate schools programme.  There are audiobooks available and it is offered free to staff and students in DEIS schools.  From what I understand from the committee, we have had correspondence about this from Ms Kathleen Moran, the senior librarian, concerning some of the new schools that have been added into DEIS and the digital library service.  The Minister may be able to answer this query.  It mentions that the response entailed that a review of the junior certificate schools programme is under way.  While the review is ongoing, no new applications are being accepted from schools for entering into the junior certificate schools programme or the digital library service.</p><p>Has this come from the Department and if so, at what level?  Was it for circulation to school principals?  Can the Minister outline the terms of the review and advise whether a timeline is in place?  A number of reviews are ongoing in the Department.  Does the Minister have a list of the reviews?  We are obviously familiar with the review of school transport but perhaps she could give the committee a summary of the reviews if she has it, or perhaps she can send it to the committee.  It is wonderful that so many schools are availing of the DEIS programme.  This was one of the other elements that is a fantastic addition.  Is access a challenge at the moment for schools?</p></speech>

We have now seen the single largest investment in the DEIS programme of &euro;17 million and it will be &euro;32 million next year.  This has allowed the biggest number of schools ever to enter the DEIS programme and it means that one in four students is attending a DEIS programme supported school.  That is as we want it.  I am aware of the digital library services referred to by the Senator.  Our literacy and numeracy strategy is the impetus for that and a significant body of work has been achieved in the implementation of the strategy that was first put in place in 2011 and reviewed in 2017. The Senator asked about reviews.  We are now in the process of putting a new digital strategy in place and that will be in place by 2023.</p> <p>  I will speak about the advantage of libraries, numeracy, literacy and so on across a whole range of different fields.  Our students consistently feature highly on international reading and literacy studies, the predictive early assessment: reading language, PEARLs as they are called.  Irish children rate among the best in Europe and, indeed, in the OECD.  That is significant.  </p> <p>  We have had &euro;20 million investment in libraries for books and other types of equipment that foster a culture of literacy in our schools.  The Senator is correct that an ongoing review is being carried out of the junior cycle and will be completed shortly.  As part of the implementation of the junior cycle, it was agreed with all stakeholders that time would be allowed for the review and it will be completed as quickly as possible.  We are seeking to offer to supports to schools that are not in the DEIS programme.  The Senator outlined some of the supports that are available to them.  The next body of work within the Department is to look at schools outside the DEIS programme that are still in need of support.  I know, as does everybody here, that children are attending schools that are not in the DEIS programme but still need supports.</p> <p>  Significant funding was made available in the budget to look at measures around inclusion such as home-school community liaisons, HSCLs, the school-completion programme, SCP, and other initiatives.</p></speech>

I am happy to specifically look at the digital library service again to see what opportunities we have.  It is correct that it is tied up in reviews, but I will look at it to see what scope we have.</p></speech>

It is a fantastic service.  To be honest, I loved reading and I must admit I would love to go back to school now although I do not know how I would fit everything in.  I do not get time to read anything now.</p> <p>  The My Open Library initiative of the local authorities is a fantastic initiative.  It is being rolled out, for example, in Ballinasloe, where a people can access a library with their cards.  The library is right beside the DEIS level one school, the primary school, in Ballinasloe.  It is important that teachers and staff can get access to this.  It would, therefore, be appreciated if the Minister could review it, particularly for the additional schools entering the DEIS programme.  The HSCL supports, the school completion programme, the hot meals and school meals are important for children who are experiencing challenges and books may not be coming into their homes.</p></speech>

Terrific links have been established between our schools and the library service and, in fact, we have invited schools to liaise with the library service about types and suitability of books under the &euro;20 million allocation.  I also acknowledge the manner in which many libraries work directly with schools to provide whatever might be on the syllabus and the types of books, including for extra-curricular reading, required.  I have been a beneficiary of that.  They demonstrate terrific leadership and collaboration with the schools and we would like to grow and nurture that going forward as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#N01000"><p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response to my earlier questions.  When my time came to an end, she was in the middle of talking about the concerns I raised about how some parents I encounter who worry the curriculum is getting a bit political - I might even say a bit "woke" in places - or at least there are moves afoot to push values in schools that might or might not sit well with the characteristic spirit of the schools.  The worry is that the State needs to acknowledge more clearly and in a more up front way that education is a partnership between schools and patrons.  The Education Act clearly recognises the responsibility of patrons for characteristic spirit.  The Constitution clearly established the State is in the position of supporting parents in how they educate their children.  When issues like pornography come over the horizon, everyone will agree it is important that the right information is communicated and that staff who are talking about these topics should be offered training.  However at the end of the day, a school that has an ethos that sees pornography as clearly immoral will probably have a different approach to teaching that topic than a school with more libertarian values.  It will alleviate a lot of concern if the Minister were to say, the curriculum is the curriculum but it is viewed through the lens of the characteristic spirit of a school which is chosen freely by parents and that diversity exists.  We talk a lot about diversity in one way, but we, or at least the State, does not talk about diversity much when it comes to respecting that there are different types of school, different types of parent and different types of characteristic spirit.  As the curriculum becomes more demanding, we must balance this with respect for the characteristic spirit of schools.  Any reassurance that the Minister can give on that score would be welcome.</p></speech>

We are aware that many of our students are gaining access to information, as I said previously, that is not supervised or appropriate and is not monitored.  They are gaining that access via their mobile phones and other sources.  It is important that students are equipped to face the challenges of the world in which they live and that they get the appropriate information from individuals who are appropriately trained.  Hence, as I said, we are rolling out the postgraduate opportunity for staff with costs covered by the Department.  It is equally important to say that students need to have that information.</p> <p>  As regards how we will proceed going forward, a public consultation process is open until 18 October 2022.  I have invited everyone, and I take the opportunity to reiterate this, to express their thoughts, views and opinions on what we are about and what needs to be achieved for young people.  When that is all received, we will take on board all the thoughts, opinions and shades of opinions and expertise.  I absolutely accept there is no monopoly of wisdom on anything and we will take that on board.</p> <p>  However, fundamentally I want to be clear that students must have information for the world in which they live.  They must receive it properly and the curriculum must provide for that.  As to how we will do it, I respect the ongoing public consultation process and I am asking people to engage in it.  We have until 18 October which is next week.</p></speech>

I have not heard anybody talk about not providing information but there is a concern that information can be slanted very easily and that could happen within the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, as well.  Whatever about consultation, which is important, at the end of the day, the Constitution and the law refer to the role of schools and their right to promote their characteristic spirit.  In the event of a clash, it would be healthy if the Government was clear in acknowledging that characteristic spirit is not an irrelevant concept here.</p></speech>

I invite people to share their thoughts and opinions.  However, I am equally clear in saying to Senator Mullen that there will be a syllabus formulated from the public consultation process and out of what we know students need to have access to in terms of information.  Schools will be obliged to follow the syllabus and to follow the curriculum.  However, as I said, I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the thoughts and views people will have and how and in what way it will be implemented.  I would rather that the fuller consultation conclude on 18 October.  We will then do the necessary body of work, bearing in mind all the thoughts and opinions that have been expressed.  That is how I express it at this point.  I thank Senator Mullen.</p></speech>

She will be glad to hear we will then be finished.  The committee welcomes the Minister's announcement of more than &euro;5 million for the pilot programme of counselling supports for primary schools.  I know it was a recommendation in the committee's report, School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health, although when the Minister announces something else, we look for even more.  That is the normal thing.  I know this is for primary schools-----</p></speech>

Will it be in the next budget?  It is an excellent initiative and it was raised with the committee by a number of groups and organisations during our deliberations.  I know this is another cost but in the long term, there might also be a saving here and that it might be possible to identify some of the issues that might be going on in a child's life, whether in their personal life, at home or elsewhere.  I would be interested to hear the Minister comment on that.</p></speech>

I was very keen to progress it and conscious that this type of support is not available in primary schools at present.  This &euro;5 million gives us this opportunity and we have begun the work as to how it will be rolled out and how we will work it through and pilot it in primary schools with an opportunity to roll it out even further.  There will be great learnings from how we do it.  There are services currently available at post-primary level, notwithstanding what the Chair said in terms of this type of provision.  From the learnings we will have at primary level, there will be opportunities to go beyond that.  In the first instance, we will roll this out, evaluate it and see what opportunities there are going forward.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chair that this is a necessary and timely provision for our primary schools, and it is not before its time.  Coming out of Covid-19, we are conscious of the additional little stresses and strains that are placed on children and on schools and how best we can support them.  This is the beginning of providing specific counselling supports at primary level and we will evaluate and learn from it and see what the potential is going forward in future budgets.</p></speech>

Can the Minister indicate when the action plan review will be published or where she and her Department are on that?</p></speech>

On the review of the 2013 action plan, the steering group, as the Chair is aware, is being led by Dr. Noel Purdey of Stranmillis University College in Antrim.  There has been considerable consultation around this.  As I did initially, I wish to acknowledge the enormous body of work it has done.  There was a presentation on the thoughts and recommendations and the body of work the committee did before the steering committee.  It is a very significant body of people who have expertise in the area, including Professor James O'Higgins-Norman, who, as the committee will know, holds the UNESCO chair at DCU.  We looked for expertise from abroad, including from Professor Peter Smith.  We consulted children and young people from all different backgrounds.  There is terrific work being done.  It is now evaluating the consultation process and seeking to do all it can to advance that in the shortest time possible.  I do not want to lead the Chair astray and say it will be in a certain number of weeks or months but we are working towards having this in place in the shortest timeframe possible, before the end of the year.  That is our expectation.  It would be remiss of me to give a specific date because I want to respect the fact that it is working through this.</p> <p>  There was an enormous amount of consultation around this.  There were thousands of consultations with parents, students, school staff and so on.  It is a very impressive body of work.  It is working through it and we are looking to have the final report as quickly as we possibly can.</p></speech>

I have a very quick question on the review of school transport.  I have put down a parliamentary question on the additional funding the Minister got in the budget for school transport, but have not seen the reply yet.  Will that mean additional places for students who do not have tickets at the moment and who are looking for tickets or will it be used to take on additional drivers or put on additional routes?  When will the review be completed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101200002#O01800"><p>As Senator Dolan said, we seem to have loads of reviews but they are all positive because they are all bodies of work that really need to be done.</p> <p>  In terms of school transport, this committee knows well, as I know, the importance of ensuring we have maximum number of access points for students.  There is a huge body of work here, similar to anti-bullying.  There were thousands of engagements with parents, students and guardians who currently avail of the service and from those who do not avail of the service, from bus and transport providers and a whole variety of individuals.  That is currently being worked through.  I want to be honest and say the work of that particular group has been impacted by Covid-19 and most especially by issues in Ukraine and the additional demands placed on this particular section within the Department.  We are continuing to work through it and will work as speedily as we can.</p> <p>  On the additional funding, this time last year approximately 103,000 tickets were made available to those who met the criteria.  Again, there was a lot of conversation around the criteria.  The waiving of the school transport fees was for those who met the eligibility criteria.  Last year that would have been 103,000 but this year 126,000 students are availing of that because they met the criteria.  There is an issue, as the Chair said, around those who are concessionary.  The concessionary issue has always been with us and in previous years when there were extra seats available, people got a ticket even though they did not meet the criteria.  They got a ticket because there were a spare seats on the bus.  This year there has been a 28% increase in the number of concessionaries who have gotten tickets.  They do not meet the criteria but there are extra seats available, so they got a seat.  There was an 18% increase in those who were eligible and who got tickets.  I am very conscious that there are those who were concessionaries and in receipt of concessionary tickets previously.  That has been a major cause of concern here and for everybody.  Those who were in receipt of tickets and who applied on time are the students we are now seeking to accommodate on foot of the additional funding that has been made available in the budget.</p><p>Again, I wish to be honest.  There are issues around sourcing additional buses or drivers but we are working through them.  The first priority is those in receipt of concessionary tickets last year who applied on time.</p></speech>

Is it the Minister's responsibility or that of the Minister for Transport?  The Government is looking for people to work longer and is changing the old age pension criteria to that end.  Some of these people aged 70 are fresher than some drivers who are 50.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue about which I feel strongly concerns co-educational schools in the country.  Some students want to go to either a boys' school or a girls' school but are being forced to go to a co-educational school because it is in their catchment area.  I know this is a challenge as it involves additional costs for the Department and school transport but it should be included in the review.  I know family members who did not want to go to the school in their catchment area because it was a co-educational school.  They wanted to go to a girls' school.  We must respect that.</p></speech>

Martin.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome H.E. Mr. Qirjako Qirko, the ambassador of Albania, and H.E. Mr. Vanja Filipovic, the ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I apologise for the pronunciation.  I am sure I was disastrous.  I find people have difficulty pronouncing my name as well, so they will be able to return the favour.  Both ambassadors are based in London as they are also ambassadors to Britain.  I thank them for travelling specifically for this engagement.  We will discuss with our guests today the topic of EU enlargement and the western Balkans. </p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Again, the ambassadors are very welcome and we will get this meeting under way.  I call on H.E. Mr. Qirko to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am honoured and privileged to be here today.  I would like to express the gratitude of my President, my Government and my Parliament to all political parties in Ireland for the continuous and unconditional support this country, this Parliament and this Government is giving to the ambitions and to our dream to one day join the European Union.  I repeat that, from the beginning of this process, Ireland has been the country which has unconditionally supported our ambition to join the European Union.</p> <p>  I would like to say a few words about the situation in the western Balkans.  The Balkans are known for being problematic and, historically, there have been problems in the relations between countries, in particular with the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, the last war in Europe before the Ukraine war.  In the past 20 years, however, there has been new development.  The so-called Berlin process has helped and assisted countries to join together and to seek common interests.  I would like to give an example.  Traditionally and historically, the relationship between Albania and Serbia has not been very good, and for 64 years we did not have any exchange of visits between the leaders of our two countries.  However, last year, even in the framework of the Covid restrictions, the leaders of the western Balkans, including the leaders of Albania and Serbia, have met each other ten times.  We are in discussions to prepare ourselves so that, one day, we can join the European Union.  At present, Albania, Serbia and North Macedonia are part of what is called the Open Balkan process.  We believe that, through this process, we will prepare ourselves in the model of the Benelux countries, and we hope that other countries of the western Balkans will soon join this initiative.</p> <p>  In the meantime, Albania is trying its best to do its homework.  Four years ago, we started a big reform of the judiciary.  Referring to the different pools, the judicial system was the most corrupted at that time.  With the assistance of the European Union, we undertook a huge constitutional reform.  A commission has been set up to check the wealth of magistrates and, after four years of this process, more than 50% of the magistrates have not passed this vetting.  The first step is that we have kicked them out from the judicial system and the next step is that there will be an investigation against them about their unjustified wealth.</p> <p>  It has been explained to me that I have five minutes for a short presentation and that I should then be ready for any questions.</p></speech>

Please continue.</p></speech>

From January of this year, Albania is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.  We are working very closely together with our allies, specifically against Russian aggression against Ukraine.  We have initiated three resolutions together with the UK and Ireland, which have joined the resolutions.  We are glad that, for the first time, more than 154 countries supported these resolutions against the aggression, which is a huge achievement for all democratic countries.  From 2008, Albania has also been a member of NATO.  We are doing our best to fulfil our obligations in NATO and we are very active.<br/><br/>Historically, Albania has been an open door to everyone who is in need.  From the time of the Ottoman Empire, Albanians have been ruled by their own laws.  We were part of the Ottoman Empire for 500 years but we have been ruled by our own laws, which are called <i>kanun</i>.  In this <i>kanun</i>, which is a kind of legislation adopted only by the Albanians, there is a specific institution called <i>besa</i>.  What does <i>besa</i>mean?  When I give <i>besa</i>to someone, and this person might be a foreigner or even an enemy, I will protect with my life his life and the life of his family.  Because of that, for example, the number of Jewish people in Albania after the Second World War was ten times higher than it had been before the war, and the Jews were protected by the majority of the population, and the majority of the population are Muslim.  We are now offering shelter and support to more than 2,000 Afghani people who left their country after the Taliban came to power.<br/><br/>We are also supporting more than 3,000 Mojahedin, the real opposition of Iran.  Because of that protection that we are giving to the Mojahedin, the real opposition of Iran, in July my country was attacked and suffered a cyberattack initiated by Iran.  Unfortunately, 95% of the services in my country operate through a mobile platform, e-Albania, and this system was shut down because of this intervention and cyberattack by four Iranian state companies.  The Microsoft experts who we invited to investigate this case identified these four companies.  In any case, it is a price that we are ready to pay because we think it is the right thing to do to protect people who are under attack from the Iranian regime.<br/><br/>In a few words, that is what I have to say in general about my country.  I hope to be able to answer any questions.</p></speech>

That is a sufficiently comprehensive introduction.  When we move to questions and answers, we will see what other useful information we can find as we deal with the whole issue of accession.  I call H.E. Mr. Vanja Filipovic to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Vanja Filipovic" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101200002#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today.  First, allow me to express sincere condolences at the tragic loss of life in County Donegal and to wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.  Also, let me express the gratitude for the active and supportive engagement of Ireland in the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the past decades, in the multilateral fora and in the contribution to peacekeeping missions in our country, as well as the strong support to our European integration efforts.</p> <p>  I am addressing the committee at a very peculiar moment for my country and the region.  On 2 October, we held general elections in a peaceful manner.</p><p>As we await the election results for various levels of government, we can already say with certainty that our collective Head of State, the three-member Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, will feature two members who come from civic, non-nationalist, multi-ethnic political parties.  That is a first for our country and attests to the wish of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina to vote in a truly democratic matter, across ethnic lines.<br/><br/>The elections have come after a period of increased political turbulence including attempts at a<i></i>de facto secession of a part of our country; creation of entity institutions parallel to those at the state level; threats of a unilateral territorial recomposition that would produce a so-called third entity; attempts to withhold budgetary means to conduct the general elections; a political hold-up in appointments of judges to the state and entity constitutional courts, etc.  All this was followed or, indeed, supported by divisive rhetoric from leading public figures that has bordered frequently on hate speech.  Some of these issues have been addressed, at least temporarily, by the calm institutional response of domestic agencies as well as increasingly robust activities of the international community, which still holds important instruments of oversight over the civilian and military implementation of the Dayton peace agreement.<br/><br/>The EU-led peacekeeping mission EUFOR-Althea was bolstered by additional troops and armour earlier this year, addressing the acute security threat in the announcement of the creation of parallel entity institutions, including entity armed forces and security and intelligence agencies.  On the civilian side, former High Representative Valentin Inzko had imposed changes to the criminal law, making genocide denial and glorification of war criminals a criminal act.  The current High Representative, Mr. Christian Schmidt, imposed adoption of a state budget, paving the way for general elections to take place earlier this month.<br/><br/>Our recent domestic challenges must be viewed, however, in a broader, regional and international context.  Destructive domestic politics are but an echo of international designs and aspirations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Bosnia and Herzegovina that are rooted in the causes of the 1992-95 war.  Such politics, which seek to divide our country or to exert complete influence over its governing, were dormant for a period when the broader international context was not receptive to them.  That same period saw the greatest institutional achievements and progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The progress was so impressive that there were serious plans to close the Office of the High Representative and to draw down completely the international military presence.  Unfortunately, such designs were severely premature, and the spectre of destructive, divisive politics returned with a vengeance.  This stagnation created an opportunity for outside players - Russia, to be specific - to exert their malign influence to sow further instability in the region by stoking the nationalist flames and irredentist ideas, thus opening another crisis spot with which the West must contend.  Their true designs were laid bare in an act of unprovoked and brutal aggression against Ukraine.  It would be foolhardy to think they would shy away from opening another so-called hot conflict on European soil to advance their interests.<br/><br/>In such a challenging domestic and international environment it has become increasingly difficult for our country and, dare I say, the whole western Balkans region to progress on the EU path.  The overall movement of the region has been slow, inconsistent and fraught with new challenges.  This situation has had a doubly negative effect: a decreasing allure of EU membership to both citizens and politicians as well as an opening to alternative international offers of political, economic and military association and co-operation.<br/><br/>For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the EU Commission's <i>avis</i>from May 2019, containing 14 priority areas for reform, has been seen as the most important document since the signing of the Dayton peace agreement.  It defined for a country a moment of political and historic crossroads.  Our country has three options now.<br/><br/>The first option is for Bosnia and Herzegovina to pursue reforms in 14 key areas and measures not only to speed up its EU accession process but also to transform the society into a liberal democratic state of equal citizens protected by the rule of law.  Implementation of the 14 priorities would set our country irreversibly on the European path and would ensure that each individual has equal rights and opportunities, regardless of his or her ethnicity, religion, race or other identity.<br/><br/>The second option is to keep the <i>status quo</i>.  I believe that the committee is aware of the current situation, which can be best described as stagnating, frustrating and unbearable for ordinary people.  It is unbearable because our institutions are kept dysfunctional and the citizens are subjected to rhetoric aimed at raising ethnic tensions.  Divisive rhetoric serves to disguise incompetence and corruption leading to a massive exodus of young people.  It is not surprising that such rhetoric only increased after the Commission's 14 priorities opinion in 2019.  Certain political elements pay lip service to the EU-led reform agenda but actively work to subvert it, thus keeping the <i>status quo</i>.  Russia has always been one of the most vociferous supporters of the <i>status quo</i>exactly because it preserved the so-called frozen conflict, acting as an international supporter of those domestic actors who wish for the same.  Russia's brinkmanship in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be seen clearly at the UN Security Council, where yearly extension of the EUFOR-Althea mission is due next month.  Russia may veto the extension unless it secures certain concessions.  That must not be allowed.  International military presence is an absolutely priority.  In case of a Russian veto, there are already present legal arrangements for foreign troops to remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina under either a EUFOR or a NATO umbrella.<br/><br/>The third option for our country is to regress further, which could lead to renewed conflict.  Whether that will happen will depend on whether our country will have continued with the institutional deepening of the ethnic divide, that is, whether ethnic divisions will be further enshrined in the constitutional and legal framework.  The current framework is already dominated by an ethnocentric approach based on the concept of so-called constitutive peoples.  It is a concept that continues to produce political strife and institutional dysfunctionality.  It is also a discriminatory legal framework, as confirmed by several rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.  Further deepening of ethnic divisions through the legal framework, especially with regard to election law, may temporarily satisfy a few political appetites threatening chaos but will provide for greater instability and dysfunctionality in the long term and will permanently close the EU door to our country.<br/><br/>I hope that Ireland and the EU will resist the siren song of providing more concessions to those seeking to extend the <i>status quo</i>through institutionalised ethnic sectarianism and will help Bosnia and Herzegovina transform into a vibrant democratic, pluralistic society that lives by the same norms and values as every EU member state.  That is the only path to permanent peace, stability and prosperity for our country, region and broader EU neighbourhood.</p></speech>

Our Chair, Deputy McHugh, is from that part of the world, so it is obvious why he is not here.  That is why he sent his apologies.</p> <p>  As I said, when we deal with the Balkans in general, we all know we sometimes put very simply what is quite a complicated history.  In both witnesses' opening statements I think there is an element of hope but with major caveats and worries.</p> <p>  I now open the floor to our side.  I ask Deputy Haughey to start with his questions.</p></speech>

We really appreciate it.  I assure them that our proceedings are being broadcast, so their contributions are being witnessed by many more people than are here this morning.</p> <p>  Ireland supports European Union enlargement as a general principle, as was said.  We believe in enlargement.  When we joined the EU, in 1973, it was transformative for our country.  We have not looked back since and we do not want to pull up the ladder and let nobody else in.  We think it is good for the EU and would be good for the witnesses' nation states to be in the EU.  The witnesses outlined some of the histories of their countries.  As the Chairman said, they are complicated and long histories and are why the countries are where they are today.  Enlargement, as regards the western Balkans, would be so important from a strategic point of view as well as from the point of security and defence.  I think the witnesses touched on that in their contributions.</p> <p>  As for President Macron's European Political Community, I assume that both witnesses' countries were represented at its meeting which took place last week.  What are their thoughts on that forum and that initiative?  Do they think it is a good initiative?  Is it a further stepping stone to full EU membership, from their point of view?  That is my first question.</p><p>My second question is about what assistance the EU has, in the ambassadors' opinion, given to their nation states to date, whether monetary or other types of assistance.  I will have one or two more questions after the ambassadors reply.</p></speech>

My country supported President Macron's initiative.  There has been a delay in the process of the integration of the western Balkans.  There has been a concern in all countries of the western Balkans because we thought we had been left or even forgotten but this initiative makes us part of the discussion.  Taking into consideration what is happening in Ukraine, being part of a family and being at the table is important.  All western-oriented countries will talk and discuss the concerns of the moment.  In principle, my Government supports this and the prime minister has been active in the process and was at the meeting on 6 October.</p></speech>

I believe the results were encouraging.  They showed that we need to think of new ways of holding discussions that are more appropriate for the challenges that we face as European nations, regardless of whether we are EU members, EU aspirants or outside the framework completely.  Bosnia and Herzegovina appreciates the opportunity to participate and is encouraged by what took place.  EU assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina has been very generous.  There has been much finance for various projects for everything from the reform of institutions and their functionality to infrastructural projects and various initiatives.  We have benefited in many ways from the generous assistance.  We look forward to continuing that type of co-operation.  During the crisis with the floods in 2014 and during the Covid-19 outbreak, there was generous additional assistance to our country.</p></speech>

What is the support for membership of the EU among the citizens of their countries?  Is there strong support for membership of the EU?  Is it uniform across both countries?  I suspect it is not, based on the different groups that make up their societies, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Will the witnesses address the support for EU accession?  Will they go into more detail about the reforms that they are implementing?  I know the Albanian ambassador mentioned the reform of the judiciary, which is significant.  Will they address the reforms in each area covered by the Copenhagen criteria, how they are proceeding and how far the countries are from reaching and implementing those goals set by the EU?</p></speech>

I do not know who the 5% who do not support it are.  The polls show that that is the current level of support among the population.  Regarding the reforms, the biggest reform in my country has been to fight corruption.  The best way to fight corruption, considering the experience of EU countries, is to avoid any contact.  In any tender or competition, such as in road construction, any company that would like to apply to bid must do everything through computers or mobile communications.  There is no direct contact.  Nobody knows what the offer is.  The reaction has been very positive.  As I mentioned, the judiciary has been the most corrupt institution.  Around 60% of magistrates have not passed this specific vetting process.  We are facing a problem in my country because some youngsters are leaving the country because of the opportunity they find in other countries.</p> <p>  We have many positive things.  One is the education of the people.  The standard of Albanian schools in general is very good, so it is easy for young people to be integrated in countries that they are trying to reach.  With the reforms that my government is implementing, we think that they will come back soon.  Tourism is one area that is developing fast.  This year, the number of tourists who visited my country was 20% higher than in 2018, which was the best year that we had.  Approximately 6 million tourists visited my country this year.  There have been huge investments in this area.</p></speech>

It is a thing that everybody more or less agrees on.  There is a high level of unanimity in that regard although trends show a slight decline over time, as people start to perceive EU membership as untenable or far away.  We have not seen much movement over time.  As I said in my opening statement, it has been beset by new problems and challenges, both domestically and internationally.  That applies to the mood of the citizens with regard to membership.<br/><br/>Regarding reforms that we are undertaking, since the European Commission's <i>avis</i>in 2019, we have been tasked to work on 14 priority reform areas.</p><p>The latest progress report will, unfortunately, not show that we have moved forward much in a majority of those areas.  As already stated, our institutions were blocked for long periods, whereas political parties used the option they have, guaranteed under the Dayton peace agreement, of simply not attending in good faith to the functioning of the Parliament, the state government, etc.  That way, no progress could be made.  That is one of the unfortunate effects of the Dayton peace agreement that allows this type of activity to go unimpeded for long periods of time, resulting in the stagnation of the reform agenda.</p></speech>

Are there obstacles at European Council level to fast-tracking Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina's applications?  I know the witnesses will be diplomatic but I am trying to ask who is not supporting Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina's applications at European Council level.  If the witnesses do not want to answer that question directly, that is fine.  Apart from what Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can do domestically in their reforms and so forth, is there a bigger agenda at European Council level which is negative as far as the applications of the two countries are concerned?  I know the witnesses will answer that question diplomatically and as best they can.</p></speech>

We have to prepare ourselves for the next steps.  We have been continually reforming for more than 31 years in my country, and the aim is just that one day we will join the European Union.  Now more than ever it is important to speed up the process because everyone who knows the history of the western Balkans knows the specific interests that the so called third parties, Russia and China, have in the region.  Considering Russia specifically, it is in the Russian strategy to delay or avoid the membership of the western Balkan countries in NATO or the EU.  That is why the right answer for the Russian ambitions in this region would be for the EU to accept the western Balkan countries as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The goal for Bosnia and Herzegovina is not just to become a member but to reform itself into a functional, fully democratic and pluralistic society.  The process is important, therefore, not just the end state, for our sake.  Russia and its partners on the ground have been working hard to slow this down.  Unfortunately, it has a large arsenal of tools at its disposal, including institutional tools within our legal and constitutional framework, to obstruct that process, reverting back to the Dayton peace agreement.  We needed the peace agreement to stop the war but the Dayton constitution - and this has already been established by numerous rulings of the European Court of Human Rights - is not compatible with EU values.  We have to reform it and get from the Dayton constitution era into the Brussels era.  Political forces that enjoy power thanks to the status quo will keep resisting that and they have the support of Russia.  The EU as a whole remains open, to a varying degree from country to country, but everybody agrees that the values and norms of the EU must be met, which is what we are trying to achieve.  We require active assistance on that path.</p></speech>

We are serious about Ireland's support for accession.  We have all seen the benefits that the European Union has provided in this State, even in the positive role it has played in our peace process.  We can all accept that in the changed world we are in the European Union, on some level, is the body that represents hope and democracy, while stating that it would still have its issues.  If we also want the European Union to be a bastion for rights and democracy we also have to ensure - and this is down to domestic Governments - that we deal with the issues of poverty that we all have.  When you can offer people a better life, you can then protect against what people might term as the sort of politics that is espoused by the likes of Marine Le Pen and others throughout Europe.</p> <p>  The worlds has completely changed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Initially, we had a number of meetings with representatives of the Ukrainians, Moldovans and Georgians.  Delegations and individuals visited all three countries as a follow-up.  The charg&eacute; d'affaires of North Macedonia was before the committee also, and we will have further meetings with representatives from Montenegro and Serbia.  There are other interactions, whether it is at the level of the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, or anything else.  We have found that there are those in the western Balkans who believe they were hard done by in the sense that there was an awful lot of talk about accession but that there was no real movement towards it.  People would put it that there were rule-of-law issues within the European Union and that there was an element within the European Union that had basically decided we would get our house in order and not look at anybody else until that was dealt with, which was unfair.  The positive points I have heard from the witnesses is that with all the caveats and the wrong roads that have been taken, there is now a route marked through.  It is necessary that the European Union sets a high bar for the issues with the judiciary, corruption and anything else because we all want to live in a better Europe.  Those are necessary conditions to facilitate that</p> <p>  The witnesses have already gone into some of the questions I intended to go into.  As has been stated, we are living in a different world.  The witnesses both spoke about the tools that are available to other players.  We are in the age of asymmetrical warfare, including hybrid and cyberwarfare.  There was mention of Albania's relationship with Iran but I would like to get into a bit more detail on the Russian and Chinese plays.  I understand that China will be putting a significant amount of money into infrastructure in countries across the entire Balkan area, even into some countries that are within the European Union.  Some of that may be positive on some level, but I ask for a little detail on it.</p></speech>

That means that from Russia in the last 30 years we did not have any investment and we did not accept Russian offers because we know how the Russians act.  We have this experience because we had a close relationship with them until 1961.  The old dream of Khrushchev at that time was to build the biggest submarine base in my country but thank God we broke the relationship with the Soviet Union in 1961 and this dream was broken also.</p><p>Russia's focus always remains in the western Balkans.  That is why we are being very careful with all the kinds of economic offers they are giving.  The same with the Chinese.  They act in a different way because they know the position of my government, of all my governments in the past 21 years, but in the meantime they are trying to act, communicate and do business with private companies.  Five years ago, they bought a Canadian oil company and for the moment the company is called Bankers Petroleum.  It used to be a Canadian company and now it is in Chinese hands.  They act in accordance with Albania's law and respect everything, but we are very careful with any offer coming from these two countries because we know the experience of the Chinese loans in Montenegro which were given to build a highway.  We learn from the bad experience of others.</p></speech>

Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an exception.  Chinese companies are very interested and are in fact involved in building several large infrastructural projects.  The money or loans were probably the easiest to get and deals were done to fast-track these construction projects, which included a thermal power plant.  Another project was in the works but it appears to have failed.  The one notable change in Chinese diplomatic behaviour was in November last year at the discussion about extending the EUFOR peacekeeping mission, when China abstained, for the first time I believe, along with Russia.  Before then, it was supportive of Russia every year, so that could be a sign of things to come or a change in positions.  We will see.  Our western Balkan countries are not alone in getting this type of economic approach from China.  Chinese companies have built large infrastructural projects in EU countries as well.  They have just completed construction of a major bridge in Croatia.  They are looking for competitive openings and are usually found in places and on projects where European companies and funds are harder to get, more expensive or less competitive in different spheres.  This is something that should be on our minds if we want to contend with it. </p></speech>

As far as Russia is concerned, the influence has been there for years.  We have been concerned about it.  It comes in different forms sometimes related to economic or energy policy.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a huge importer of gas but all the gas we import is Russian and comes through a single pipeline that goes through Serbia and so on.  That is one important leverage.  There is also cultural and historical leverage that Russia employs, especially with part of the population.  Russia also acts as a sort of diplomatic cover and sponsor to their politics.  Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on genocide in Srebrenica, which won it some favours in certain circles.  It is easy to recognise that its interest lies in the whole of the western Balkan area, Bosnia included, whose process of further integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions will be impeded by all means necessary.  Russia has been partly successful in some places.  It still has assets on the ground it can use to stir up troubles where it can.  As I said, if things had gone differently in Ukraine, who knows what the scenario security-wise would have been in Bosnia and the Balkans.  This is something the international community and western countries are more attuned to now.  Bosnia and Herzegovina now receives more robust assistance from NATO and we are now pursuing NATO candidacy membership as well.  It has been our foreign policy goal for a number of years.  This is something that more and more people are attuned to, but it does not mean the threat has been resolved.  It is still there.</p></speech>

Obviously, nowhere suffered more than Bosnia and Herzegovina when Yugoslavia broke apart.  On some level, probably in a surface knowledge-type scenario, we are all aware of the various ethnic divisions. The ambassador has spoken about what he sees as hopeful signs following the recent election.  If there is a move towards what we would all like to see as regards accession, with Bosnia also changing within that, how worried is Ambassador Filipovic with regard to relationships internally?  If we talk about Republika Srpska, then the relationships with Croatia, with Serbia in particular, and again with the Russian play are significant.  My notion of Bosnia and Herzegovina is that there are various areas that are disputed and probably people within these areas who on some level look to becoming part of Serbia, Croatia or some other place.  I am not sure if the ambassador can detail every piece of that but perhaps he can go into whatever he can.</p></speech>

One myth we need to keep busting is that somehow our country has been the site of centuries-old ethnic hatred and so on.  We lived in peace, co-existence and with intermixing for centuries.  The war that broke out in 1992 was not the war between the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  That war was imported from outside with designs to destroy the newly independent, sovereign, internationally recognised nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Some of those designs are still present and actors use political means within the country with outside support to continue pursuing them.  As I said in my statement, there was a long period of time, for about ten years, when those designs were kept clamped down and the country was able not only to reconcile internally but to build strong institutions.  As a member of the UN Security Council, Bosnia and Herzegovina was involved daily in making difficult global decisions.  It functioned like clockwork, perfectly in sync and was able to rise to those challenges.  Unfortunately since that time, the international context and the approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina has changed, which has allowed these nationalist populist voices to resurface and build their entire political agenda on pursuing, overtly or covertly, their wartime goals.  They found international sponsors, both regionally and internationally, to do that.  That is what we have to contend with.  Most of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in peace and in harmony with one another.  They want to focus on jobs, careers, economy, education etc., but they are unable to do so because we keep being hammered by these voices that say people cannot live together or that the country is a failed state etc.</p><p>This is what we are contending with.  We need a little bit more assistance to refocus and to isolate those divisive voices and give a chance to ordinary people and their representatives to move the country forward.</p></speech>

We are in a world where there is not only the regular play of politics one would have had traditionally but also online platforms.  Not only are we open to cyberattack, we have facilities that are very easily weaponised by state and non-state actors to push confrontational politics, which can make that worse.  That is a particular worry we have.</p> <p>  We had a meeting of the Joint Committees on Justice and European Union Affairs with Commissioner Jourov&aacute; with regard to the rule of law recommendations given to us, one piece of which is about ensuring the electoral system within all states.  We all know the dangers that have existed and the allegations made, whether it is the election in America or Brexit.  It is to protect ourselves from those situations and undue influence.  Mr. Filipovic has already spoken about the fact he has very many players who, in the best-case scenarios, are looking for stagnation but where the worst-case scenarios would mean putting themselves back to a place to which nobody wants to go.</p> <p>  The big question is what we, as a committee, can do and, more importantly, what the European Union can do to make sure there is a crystal-clear route map.  What are the necessary supports Mr. Qirko and Mr. Filipovic would wish for that they may not be getting at present?</p></speech>

After 31 years, we are more or less knocking at the door.  Sometimes we are listening from the other side and other times not.  We need a speeded-up process.  The western Balkans are not a problem.  They are very much welcome for what they represent, not only geographically because, from all points of view, the western Balkans are part of Europe.  We wish to become so as soon as possible.  That is why the support of the committee is so important to us and why we appreciate it.  We always say we are very much grateful for its unconditional support because we have not always got this.  We have some recent examples such as the delay in the case of North Macedonia.</p> <p>  It is time to avoid any small interests and to see the future of the western Balkans because its prosperity and integration are also important for the security of the European Union.  Albania is one of the few countries in the world that shares borders with other Albanians.  In the north west, 10% of the population in Montenegro is Albanian, 95% of people are Albanian in Kosovo and, a little bit further down, 31% of people in North Macedonia are Albanian.  However, what is important is that wherever they live, Albanians are very much focused on Euro-Atlantic integration of their own countries.  We are not looking for a bigger Albania, as is sometimes mentioned, because we think the only way we can realise our dreams is to be a part of the European Union and avoid borders.  Sometimes in the Balkans the borders and fences are not political ones.  We are neighbours but we do not know each other because the politics have been like this.</p> <p>  I am very glad these kinds of negative perceptions of the past are now vanishing.  I am very glad that in the past five years I have seen people with Serbian plates visiting my country on vacation.  That is why co-operation, the opening of the borders and improvement of our economy is important.  The history is there, but if we make our western Balkan economies complementary to each other, we will improve the lives of our people.  If people have better lives, sometimes they forget about the negative past history.  Our focus is on how to improve the lives of our people.</p> <p>  EU integration is the only way and the only objective we all have together.  This is a good chance because it has never been like this.  There are, of course, still problems such as relations between Kosovo and Serbia and some problems in Bosnia.  However, the most important thing is that everywhere in the western Balkans, elected democratic governments are focusing on EU integration.</p></speech>

Ireland, as a member of the EU, has an important role to play in the formulation of the policy and the approach to enlargement.  The EU enlargement to western Balkan states is the only path to permanent stability, peace and prosperity of the region, and it will have a positive effect on overall European security and prosperity.  That much is now clear to everybody.  For too long this part of the world has been seen as kind of a soft European underbelly, and everybody now more or less agrees that the question needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are looking forward to a faster and more robust approach with the EU, but one thing we expect most is for the EU to play a role that echoes and reflects its own values.  For too many years, we have seen the willingness of the EU negotiators and envoys to come up with fast solutions to emerging problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to respond to crises with political expediency rather than with thought-out, long-term solutions.  This was often reflected as giving concessions to those who blocked the reform processes, threatened peace and security, or threatened to dissolve institutional advancements that had been made so far.  Every time concessions were made, it only backfired.  Those who created problems came back with even bigger demands.  I am afraid we are looking at one of those scenarios again, especially with regard to the so-called electoral law reform, which is a big political issue that has been on our books for many years.  It has been on the books because of the verdicts of the European Court of Human Rights and institutional discrimination that was determined to be ingrained in our constitution and the electoral law.</p> <p>  Instead of working at removing existing discrimination to make us more in line with EU values and norms, there are attempts to circumvent addressing those specific issues to address other issues within the country, especially with regard to some of the incumbent nationalist parties and their state sponsors from the neighbourhood.  The EU must take a principled stand against that.  If it cannot enforce or at least follow its own rules in the candidate or aspirant countries, the process of reform is unlikely to happen.</p></speech>

We must all undertake considerations we never had to before.  We are in a much-changed world, and we all accept that our interconnectivity and reliance on each other is greater than we previously believed.  Short-term fixes for political expediency are not going to cut it.  In fairness, I recognise from what both ambassadors said that this accession process is viewed from the perspective of improving economies and people's lives.  I refer to ensuring we do not get caught up in some of the traditional difficulties that have occurred.  I accept, however, that this is not going to be a straightforward conversation.</p> <p>  Rather than me hogging the meeting, which I am good at, I call Senator Martin.  I will probably come back in later with a question concerning candidate countries following up on their obligations.</p></speech>

Ireland's time in Europe has been part of a time of coming together and resisting the forces, of which there are many, that would like to break us up.  Russia's war in Ukraine, that horrendous war which Putin started, has amplified the need for Europe to be a more united family.  I understand the need for the Copenhagen criteria, and we do need certain ground rules, but this process has been unacceptably and painstakingly slow for so many candidate countries.</p> <p>  Regarding a potential way forward, is there a new opportunity in this regard in the context of the European Political Community, EPC, which was originally President Macron's brain wave?  Last week, more than 40 European countries came together in Prague, the Czech capital, as part of an EPC meeting to discuss advancing security and energy co-operation.  Representatives from every country were there, except Russia and Belarus, and it was correct that they were excluded.  Is there an opportunity to develop this new organisation?  I ask the ambassadors to tell us about the feedback in their respective countries regarding this new initiative, which included the British Prime Minister and the Prime Ministers of the ambassadors' countries.  I think we could develop this organisation and that this would help to break down barriers and help countries to make friends.  It would show this is achievable.  Let us not get hung up on the Copenhagen criteria and placing them as an unfair and impossible obstacle to accession for some many countries that are reaching out to be part of the European family.  Now is the time when we can review this situation in a more accessible, equitable and fair way.  I ask the ambassadors, therefore, to give us their views on President Macron's historic initiative, in the context of the first meeting of the new organisation last week.</p></speech>

As we mentioned, President Macron's initiative is an opportunity.  It is an opportunity to gather all the countries that share, more or less, the same values and orientation.  We will have to wait and see what will happen next.  Albania, however, was really glad of the initiative, and my Prime Minister gave a specific contribution regarding the idea of President Macron.  There were member states at the table in Prague that shared the same values and faced the same challenges.  In front of us was Russia, and on the other side of the table were 40 countries that are at different economic levels and at different stages of developing democratic standards but that have the same orientation.  This was the best message conveyed by that table.  In future, certainly, for us as countries in the western Balkans, this is an opportunity to be at the same table with the countries with which we share the same vision and opinions and face the same challenges.</p></speech>

In that regard, it is very good to have this initiative.  Everybody came back with a positive view.  This new organisation does not, though, substitute for the need and goal of my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, to meet the Copenhagen criteria, not because that process is there but because we need it and we want to reform our country and to make it a vibrant, democratic and rule-of-law state, with a vibrant and open market economy.  We wish to uphold the values of the Copenhagen criteria and meet them for ourselves and not just as something we must achieve to become a member state in time.  We need to undertake this reform for ourselves and for the benefit of our citizens.  The new forum is a good initiative to facilitate discussion and it reflects the new reality, but it does not fully substitute for what already exists.</p></speech>

Equally, however, both ambassadors stated that their countries accept and want to meet the Copenhagen criteria and the specific 14 reforms to be undertaken in that regard.  I refer to what is on their to-do lists and the general timeline in being able to satisfy these requirements.</p> <p>  Given the circumstances we are in, and the ambassadors mentioned this point earlier, where energy security meets the cost-of-living energy price crisis, what engagement have Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina had with the EU?  I ask this question because the EU is trying to deal with its own issues.  These are different depending on the member state, and whether we are referring to Germany, Ireland, etc., but, collectively, we are considering block-buying oil and liquid natural gas.  Everything is up for grabs now.  We understand that in the long term, the real movement must be towards renewables.  We will not, though, be able to do all that in time for this winter.  We also do not want to give any sort of win to the Russians now.  We do not want to restore to them what they are losing in the field through being able to deliver an economic knock to the rest of the western world.</p></speech>

It will be the same for my country.  The energy production system in Albania is 100% based on hydroelectricity.  This is a pure source of energy and allows us to fulfil 75% of our demands with our own source of power.  The other 25% of the required energy is always imported.

We are, however, very much influenced by market prices for the imported 25% of our energy requirements.  We have been trying to diversify in this regard in the last four years.  Albania has more than 250 days with sunshine, so there has been major investment in solar energy.  There is still a demand, however.  From this perspective, the request of my Prime Minister, even at that Prague meeting, was that the western Balkans should not be forgotten, as happened during Covid-19.  The effects are the same, and we are trying and doing our best to co-operate.  We are increasing the capacity through the trans Adriatic pipeline, which runs from Azerbaijan to Italy.  From this perspective, we will try to increase the influx of gas coming from this source, as well as to try to fill-----</p></speech>

We started the process four years ago by adopting one of the toughest systems for the Judiciary.  In reference to what the EU experts say, maybe the Albanian model will be taken as an example for some European countries facing the same problem with corruption in the judicial system.  It is a good step forward and a positive model.</p></speech>

For the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina the cost of living and energy is the number one issue.  We are not exporters of electric power.  We are not huge consumers of gas but a large portion of imported gas is used in Sarajevo, for example, for public heating.  If that supply were to be cut off, it would have a major impact.  Therefore, the Albanian Government is trying to mitigate some of these things through various approaches both domestically, in the policy of trying to reduce some of the costs, and internationally, in trying to diversify the energy source.</p> <p>  As to a timeline on the accession to the EU, it is hard to make any sort of prediction.  It basically depends on our domestic and political arena.  We have just held elections and new governments will be formed at various levels, such as at state level, entity levels and cantonal levels.</p></speech>

We know who the three future members of the presidency will be.  The remaining results are more or less mixed.  Many incumbent parties will remain in power.  Some smaller changes may happen on a cantonal level, but the overall make-up will not be much different from the one before.  It was very important, at least symbolically, to see two members of the presidency come from multi-ethnic parties, which was the first time this happened.</p> <p>  It is difficult to make a prediction because in the past we had parliament walk-outs and obstructions, which  were used as tools of political blackmail.  In order for some parties to receive certain concessions, they would block the passage of legislation and even block the appointment of judges and use whatever political means they had to get what they were after.  If they are able to continue in the same manner, the forecast will not very good.  What is encouraging is the new energy felt from Brussels, with more interest in integration and moving things on.</p></speech>

We are told there are approximately 700 Albanians and 230 Bosnians living in Ireland.  They are very welcome here.  I am delighted we have very good diplomatic relations between our countries.

Those are the latest figures we have, they are from the 2016 census, and I have a feeling they are going in one happy direction in which citizens from the ambassadors' country enrich our country and I would love to see more of them reside in Ireland.  This is a welcoming home and I am a big believer not only in tolerance - that is a given - but in celebrating and embracing the huge richness of diversity and how we can learn from one another.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for their presentations.  On behalf of us all, I can safely say that the ambassadors know where Ireland stands on this, but we must do our best to focus.  I am sure they have heard all the nice words in the past but we must, in real, measured terms, tangibly advance a cause of unification in Europe that is so obvious to us.  Let us hope that we can adhere to the criteria, which I respect, but it should not take two years.</p></speech>

In the 1990s they found home and shelter in this beautiful country.  They found the very warm support of people like Mr. Coonan, who I recognised as a great friend of our country, working with our diaspora here.  They are very well integrated and are enjoying their lives here.  They have found understanding and support on so many levels.  This is also thanks to Government policies in this regard.

The number of Albanians in Ireland has increased to about 2,000.  We have worked very closely with Irish authorities to avoid even illegal immigration.  Why are people from my country interested to come to Ireland?  It is because nobody feels like a foreigner or an outsider in this country.  It is welcoming.  There are no racist prejudices here.  I do not want to justify someone trying to come here illegally.</p><p> For this specific meeting I would like to thank the committee again.  I repeat that Albania is always grateful to this country for its continuous unconditional support.  I know that I have repeated this three times, but it is important because Ireland may be the only country or one of very countries in the European Union that have reacted so positively to our ambition.</p></speech>

They were anxious to come here today to see the Oireachtas and how we function, which is a great thing for the school.  They are now attending the Model School in Kilkenny College.  They will be going on a tour of the Seanad and D&aacute;il afterwards, which I hope they will enjoy.  I thank them for coming along today to see democracy in action and to see our Oireachtas members working.  I acknowledge the very fine work they did in their magazine.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>  We will move on to the opening statement.  See the important things in life?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I am happy to have this opportunity to discuss issues related to the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  The role and status of Ministers with regard to Departments and their responsibility to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are set out in Article 28 of the Constitution and are further elaborated in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.</p> <p>  The 1924 Act has two distinct functions.  First, it provides a legal basis for the Civil Service, outlining the structure and organisation of central administration while also defining ministerial responsibility.  Second, the Act established the Departments of State, their remits and distributed the associated public activities.  The Act also provides that the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, appoint the principal officer of each Department, which is now known as the Secretary General.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance was assigned the function of prescribing the terms and conditions of appointments for civil servants under section 2(3) of the Minister and Secretaries Act.  Most recently, these functions were transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the formation of my Department in 2011.</p> <p>  Under section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions such as the regulation and control of the Civil Service, the classification, reclassification, numbers and remuneration of civil servants and the fixing of the terms and conditions and conditions governing the promotion of civil servants.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act 1997 provides a statutory basis for the management structure of the Civil Service.  This Act assigns to Secretaries General certain functions, which include managing the Department, implementing Government policies appropriate to the Department, delivering outputs as determined by the Minister of the Government having charge of the Department and providing advice to the Minister.  The Public Service Management Act also obliges Secretaries General to prepare a strategy statement setting out the key objectives, outputs and strategies of the Department.  It is important to note that the provisions of the Public Service Management Act 1997 do not change the core policy responsibility of Ministers, who remain responsible for the functions of the Department under the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also assigns responsibility for using resources so as to meet the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 with regard to the regularity and propriety of public expenditure as well as to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  This relates to the role of Accounting Officer.  The Secretary General of a Department acts as Accounting Officer and is accountable to the Oireachtas for the use of the Department&rsquo;s resources.  Secretaries General, in their Accounting Officer capacity, are answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts which, in turn, reports to the D&aacute;il in respect of its stewardship of public funds.  The Accounting Officer system means that while accountable as Secretary General to the Minister for managing the Department and for the other duties under the Public Service Management Act, the Accounting Officer is also answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for regularity, propriety and value for money.</p> <p>  The Public Service Management Act also provides a formal structure for assigning authority and accountability within the Civil Service.  Officers within Departments who are assigned functions are accountable to the Secretary General.  The framework of assignments for each Department to principal officer level is published annually.  The Public Service Management Act also gives the Secretary General responsibility for managing all matters relating to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of staff below the grade of principal or its equivalent in the Civil Service.  Generally, the management of staff is assigned to the line manager, who is responsible for making civil servants aware of acceptable standards of attendance and conduct and for dealing with shortcomings promptly and fairly.</p> <p>  With regard to work performance, there are systems to support performance management.  The performance of civil servants up to and including the grade of principal is managed under the performance management and development system, PMDS.  There is a separate process of performance management, namely, the leadership evaluation and development system for senior grades in the Civil Service above the level of principal officer.  Finally, for Secretary General level, there is an annual performance review process in place intended to support the performance of Secretaries General.  On a more general point, I would note that Secretaries General are also employees and are covered by most of the existing employment and other legislation.</p> <p>  From an international perspective, even among countries with relatively similar systems, there does not seem to be a comprehensive solution that can be applied to issues of accountability in a categorical way.  I would draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the ongoing work of the OECD in this regard, however, building on its Recommendation on Public Service Leadership and Capability report.</p> <p>  Overall, there are a range of complex and interlinking responsibilities associated with the role of Secretary General.  They are accountable to Ministers for certain functions and to the Oireachtas for others.  They are appointed by, and accountable to, the Government.  I am very interested in hearing the committee's views on these issues and welcome members' ongoing input.</p></speech>

I have quite a number of questions to get my head around certain aspects.</p><p>My first question relates to the capacity in which Mr. Moloney is speaking in front of this committee today.  The reason I ask is because the particular circular on guidelines for civil servants appearing before or providing information to Oireachtas committees states:</p> <blockquote> 	The following should be borne in mind by civil servants in contacts with these committees:<br /><br />- a civil servant who appears before, or provides information to, an Oireachtas Committee does so on behalf of his Minister who, as a corporation sole, is legally responsible for the official acts of his civil servants. </blockquote> <p>Will Mr. Moloney comment on that?</p></speech>

Yes, absolutely.  That is correct.  In my capacity in front of this committee, I am acting as Secretary General of the Department on behalf of the Minister.  Therefore, in that capacity, for example, there are certain constraints on what I can and cannot comment on.  I cannot comment on the merits and demerits of Government policy.</p><p>I speak largely on behalf of the Minister.  There have been some amendments to the Oireachtas inquiries Acts that permit me to discuss what advice has been offered in certain circumstances but, again, not in the context of commenting on the merits and demerits of policy.</p></speech>

For my own understanding, is it correct that Mr. Moloney will be speaking on behalf of the Minister, rather than in a personal capacity, when he is in front of a committee?</p></speech>

It is important for me to understand how these things work.  Will he start by explaining the Carltona doctrine?  I have to say that name in my head before I say it out loud.  Will he say initially what the doctrine is and then whether there are limitations on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#B00500"><p>The Carltona doctrine is basically the idea that a civil servant may carry out actions on behalf of the Minister, acting in the place of the latter.  The Minister is a corporation sole and the Department as a whole performs functions on his or her behalf.  That does not require any act of express delegation; it is simply a way and means of carrying out the business of the Minister and the Department.  It is sometimes set out specifically in legislation, sometimes by precedent, that certain functions cannot be carried out except by the Minister.  Certain orders, for example, can only be signed by him or her.  Broadly, however, in the day-to-day running of the Department, the Carltona doctrine, in effect, represents this idea of a corporation sole, whereby the officials of a Department are acting on behalf of the Minister in what they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#B00600"><p>I was looking at a recent submission to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  As we know, civilian control over the military is a core principle of democracy.  This submission expressed concerns about the overreliance by the Department of Defence on the Carltona doctrine as a means of exercising control and said this overuse needed scrutinising.  I am not commenting on that but it is something I have noted.  As far as Mr. Moloney is aware, has there ever been an external review carried out to see how well the doctrine is performing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#B00700"><p>I am not aware of an external review of it.  A lot of the time when we look at accountability issues in the Civil Service, it is centred around the exercise of the discretion within the Carltona doctrine and the relevant and appropriate division of responsibilities between Ministers and Secretaries General.  The role of Departments and Ministers is set up under the Constitution and provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.</p> <p>  Part of what the 1997 Act did was to try to provide further clarification around some separation of those responsibilities within the overall context of the delegation of authority, notwithstanding the Carltona principle.  What the Act really tried to do was to separate the day-to-day issues of running a Department, move them away from being a direct responsibility of the Minister and make them more the responsibility of the Secretary General.  While the Minister would retain policy responsibility, he or she would not necessarily be dragged into the minutiae of day-to-day issues.  That is the thinking behind the Public Service Management Act.</p></speech>

They have tended to relate to different issues.</p></speech>

Has there ever been any kind of review or even any concerns expressed as to whether agency loss could arise from the use of the doctrine?  I am interested to know whether it has had that kind of impact or has led to any encroachment on the control of policy function.</p></speech>

That report looked at the interaction between Ministers and Secretaries General, the operation of the different roles and how accountability and performance could be strengthened.  It looked at a wide variety of relevant issues that would come up in this context.  As far as I know, the Carltona principle itself has not come under particular focus.</p></speech>

It was designed as well to minimise agency loss.  The idea is that the principal, that is, the Minister, has his or her policy administered by the agent, that is, the Secretary General.  However, in an extreme situation, say, where an agent was not happy or found the Minister's decisions and policy changes were undesirable and decided to sabotage them, what avenues are open to Ministers if they feel something like that has happened?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is an ongoing conversation between Ministers and their Secretaries General in regard to issues and the delivery of the statement of strategy and the business plan for Departments.  There is a structure there, introduced in the 1997 Act, to allow a conversation, a setting of objectives and a review of those objectives.  If specific issues arise whereby the Minister feels action has been taken without authority, the process allows him to raise those issues.  In terms of the Deputy's net point, the Civil Service Regulation Acts make the Government the appropriate authority for Secretaries General because the latter are appointed by the Government.  If an issue were to be escalated, it would be escalated to the level of Government.</p></speech>

The context is the Civil Service disciplinary code, which begins with the issuing of a level 1 verbal warning, followed by a written warning, a level 3 written warning, extension of the period of validity of the warning, deferral of an increment, debarment from competitions and promotions, withdrawal of concessions, reassignment to a different location or duties and withdrawal of allowances.  Those are all measures the Minister can take prior to going to the Government.  There are elements of the Civil Service disciplinary code that do not apply to Secretaries General.</p><p>Because of their appointment by the Government, they do not apply by statute.  Those elements are lower-rate remuneration, reduction to a lower grade and suspension without pay.  Those are not available to the Minister in respect of a Secretary General.  The final level of sanction is dismissal, which would be a matter for the Government. </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Moloney for that.  Sometimes with these things there are so many different circulars etc. that it can be a bit confusing.  As for the sanctions the Minister can do at that level, say the ones Mr. Moloney read out - barring the ones that cannot be given to a Secretary General - have they been done in the past?  I am not asking him to comment on names or anything like that but out of interest, is that something that Mr. Moloney is aware has occurred?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00300"><p>I am not aware of it but then I would not be part of that.  That would be like any other employee-employer disciplinary process.  It would, by and large, be considered confidential to the people involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.764" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00400"><p>Of course.  In terms of the ministerial-senior official relationship, does Mr. Moloney think that the concepts of accountability and responsibility and the differences between them are well clarified?  Does he think that is clearly laid out or does he think there needs to be further clarification?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.765" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00500"><p>It is quite complex because there are those different blocks of legislation.  There is the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Public Service Management Act and the Civil Service Regulation Act.  Then of course there are the responsibilities of the Accounting Officer, which operate almost as a separate pillar.  The role is therefore a complex one.  It is capable of causing some confusion, particularly in terms of the interaction between the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Public Service Management Act.  At a general level, Secretaries General are responsible for running their Department but a Minister of the Government might be forgiven for thinking that they were able to take decisions in relation to the day-to-day operation of a Department.  The two Acts need to come together in that context.  There is a level of complexity involved and that is something that we can always review.  The international experience is that these same issues are grappled with.  The OECD material underlines the idea that these issues are grappled with across many jurisdictions.  Greater clarity is always possible but specific functions are set out in the different items of legislation.  It is in the implementation of those functions that there is sometimes the potential for misunderstanding what is or is not allowable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.766" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00600"><p>Ministers are held accountable by the D&aacute;il.  They are selected by the D&aacute;il and they can be deselected by it.  The concept of responsibility implies a direct personal involvement in a decision or an action with accompanying credit or blame.  The Carltona doctrine then allows many actions to be taken in the name of the Minister, some of which I imagine they may be completely unaware of, given everything that happens in a Department.  There could be a situation where the Minister would have to go before the D&aacute;il or a committee like this one and can be held accountable in that way.  Would it be fair to say that this could result in a situation where if things go right, even if it is because of the officials, that the Minister can get credit for that?  By the same score, if things go wrong, and again the Minister might be unaware of this, could the Minister be held responsible in the same sense because of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.767" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00700"><p>There are big differences between the level of political accountability and scrutiny in terms of the Oireachtas and electorate compared to the administrative accountability, which is more in the nature of a different employment relationship and a more standard employment type of relationship.  Fundamentally, Ministers are responsible for the operation of their Departments under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That overall level of responsibility is quite comprehensive and places quite a deal of accountability and responsibility on them.  The ideal operation of the Public Service Management Act was to in some ways try to lighten that load by referring to the Secretaries General.  It does that by saying that if something very basic goes wrong in the operation of a Department, for example, if somebody trips on the stairs, then it is not the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  This is the day-to-day operation of the Department.  The challenge, then, is where that line is drawn.  When does it become the responsibility of the Minister and when is it that of the Secretary General?  I do not think that there will be a one-size-fits-all.  That is where the OECD talks about building up a relationship of trust and an open dialogue between the administrative and political levels in order that there can be a shared understanding of where the responsibilities lie.  I think the principles are sound in their own way.  It is right that the Secretaries General are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their Department.  It is probably in many cases an unreasonable burden to expect a Minister to account for that.  On the other hand, there is political responsibility under the Constitution and under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  A similar thing happens within the Departments.  I spoke in my opening statement about the framework of responsibilities.  I can delegate the responsibility within my Department down to principal officer level through a framework of assignments.  Even as I delegate responsibility in particular areas, however, I remain responsible as Secretary General for those areas.  There is that balance because you are the head of the Department, political or administrative, so you retain some responsibility for what goes on there.</p></speech>

We discussed the idea that there could be a need for clarification and that things could be looked at to make matters a bit clearer.  Has there ever been consideration given to amending the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the Public Service Management Act whereby the relationship could be clarified in relation to all those issues we were speaking about?  Is Mr. Moloney is aware that there has ever been a look to do that in a serious and comprehensive manner?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.769" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101200002#C00900"><p>It is part of the current conversation.  The committee produced a report earlier this year in relation to certain senior pay issues.  The Minister set up an independent review panel that will look at many relevant issues.  It is chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and is on senior pay and remuneration.</p> <p>  The interaction between the kinds of accountability issues that the Deputy raises, the method and the ways and means by which senior civil servants are appointed and remunerated are an interlinked set of issues.  To substantively restructure them would require a root-and-branch look at the three blocks of legislation, namely, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Public Service Management Act and the Civil Service Regulation Act.  Those are the three blocks of legislation that determine the different pieces of that.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to how the three come together.  That is a set of issues that we are looking at.  We have not made proposals at this stage.  At this stage, we will probably await the finalisation of the independent review panel to do so but we are aware of the conversations that have gone on before committees and we are aware of the issues that have been raised in relation to it.  We are happy to consider that and in due course to bring forward proposals to the Minister in relation to them.  The only issue is that it would be quite a significant exercise.  The reality is that the Ministers and Secretaries Act and the constitutional provisions are fairly fundamental building blocks for how governmental authority is structured.  Moving to amend that in any significant way would potentially make a very fundamental difference.  </p></speech>

There has not been a huge amount of academic research done on this interesting topic and it might merit research.</p> <p>  The traditional system of accountability is that civil servants are accountable to their superiors and, ultimately, to the Minister and then the Minister is accountable to the D&aacute;il and obviously to the Taoiseach.  Has that changed in recent years?  Are there other bodies to whom civil servants are accountable now? </p></speech>

A lot of the legislation that sets out the accountability has been unchanged for quite a while and some of it dates back quite far.  The one change that I could identify relates to the level of accountability, this idea of the appropriate authority as being the person who can impose the most severe of sanctions.  That used to be only the Minister and a Department and now for a principal officer it is the Secretary General and for a principal officer and the Assistant Secretary it is the Minister, with the Government being the appropriate authority only for the Secretary General.  There has been some slight change in that.  In terms of the line management responsibility for the day-to-day performance management regarding the Accounting Officer role, those are very well established roles.</p></speech>

It is very much so.  Across the range of our activities, since the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was established there has been a range of legislation which is really about openness and accountability of Government, including whistleblowing, lobbying, freedom of information, the establishment of an ombudsman and the extension of his remit.  All of those things are things that civil servants engage with on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>

The one place that has been identified as, potentially, giving rise to a conflict has always between the role of Secretary General and the role of Accounting Officer.  When the Mullarkey Report, which dates back to the early 2000s, looked at that issue it suggested a process that could be adopted if a conflict arose between a Secretary General and what he or she perceived to be his or her role as Accounting Officer.  Other than that, given that our job is to advise on policy and then implement the policy, I would not think that those conflicts would arise.</p></speech>

Obviously media is more fluid than it was and there is greater attention paid to various public conversations.  Freedom of information has supported a huge increase in the amount of information that is available to a broader variety of people and that has given rise to discussions that are possible now that would not have been possible 20 years ago.  Those discussions have, increasingly, involved what advice that civil servants have or have not offered.  So that has become part of the general discussion and, in many ways, that is a sign of increased openness and transparency.  It is probably a risk that needs to be managed about confusing the roles of civil servants, who are there to implement policy, and Governments, which are there to make it.  In the main, we are aware of and seek to manage that risk.</p></speech>

If one looks at how political controversy can develop, people can gain access to advice, through the freedom of information process, that gets into the public domain, the Minister then says, "I am following the advice that I was given", the advice is then questioned and at that stage civil servants do, it seems to me, end up at the centre of the public issue.  Is that good or bad?  Is it something that we must go along with as a fact of life?</p></speech>

I am conscious that if we were having this discussion here, and we probably would not have this discussion here 40 or 50 years ago, but 40 or 50 years ago I would have thought that very few senior civil servants would have been publicly well known whereas now quite a few of them are.

Even if one looks over at what is happening in the United Kingdom now there seems to be an acceptance that when a new political regime comes in that they may want to change civil servants.

That is not part of the legislative and administrative context in which senior public servants are appointed.  They are appointed for the Government by the Government for a seven-year term, which is traditionally extended by three years.  Those are the parameters within which we work so that is obviously not tied into an electoral cycle or change of Government.  The expectation is that we will impartially and objectively advise on and implement Government policy regardless.</p></speech>

It related to the disciplinary options open to a Minister and written warnings.  I fully accept that I may have picked up Mr. Moloney incorrectly.  If I did, he should please tell me.  At the beginning of this conversation, he said that when he was in front of committees, with the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts, he was the voice of the Minister.  He said he almost has a dual reporting function, reporting on the one hand to the Minister and on the other hand to the Oireachtas.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

Implementing the policies of the Minister in the Department is a Secretary General role.  I report to the Minister, and the appropriate authority is the Government.  With regard to the Accounting Officer function, which entails a separate body of legislation, I report in a personal capacity.  I cannot delegate that function.  It is separate from my duty in respect of the Minister.  I report to the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Comptroller and Auditor General audits.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Moloney subject to two separate disciplinary systems?  I refer to actions such as written warnings and the removal of allowances.  Are there two parallel systems?</p></speech>

Accountability to the Oireachtas is structured such that the Comptroller and Auditor General produces a value-for-money report or audit report.  I get questioned on that at an appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee then reports to the D&aacute;il on it.  That is the process.  There is not really a Civil Service disciplinary process associated with that.</p></speech>

The Civil Service disciplinary code sets out a multistage process.  The reality of an issue that would arise between the head of a Department, namely, a Secretary General, and the Minister is very different.  One could think about it as being the same as a conflict between a chief executive officer and a board.  It is a more complex issue than other disciplinary issues within an organisation.  The way in which the Government would seek to discharge its powers in relation to this as the appropriate authority would really depend on the case and its circumstances.  The Mullarkey report considered in passing whether a more structured approach would be beneficial and more or less came down against it in the sense that the benefits would not outweigh-----</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that there are some limitations and constraints concerning what the Government is allowed to do in such cases.  There is, of course, the constitutional right to fair procedure.  There are employment laws that may be relevant, although not all employment law applies to Secretaries General.  There is the need for process.  Given the seniority involved and the circumstances, it would probably require a bespoke response.</p></speech>

That is probably the correct term to use.</p> <p>  Mr. Moloney referred to the Rafter report and the Mulcahy report.  The accountability of Secretaries General was reviewed in 2002 by a working group.  The report pointed out the potential of bringing Secretaries General within the remit of the existing disciplinary process, a move that would require legislation.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of any legislation in that regard that is to be introduced or that is even being drafted?</p></speech>

First, there was legislation in 2005 that effectively expanded the remit of the disciplinary process we have been talking about to Secretaries General.  That was the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act.  It effectively brought Secretaries General into the net.  The extent to which they are in the net is limited in the way I discussed with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell because the nature of the appointment by the Government precludes certain of the steps.  We are currently examining the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act in terms of how we see disciplinary matters working broadly within the Civil Service.  I do not believe we specifically intend for it to address Secretaries General at this point.</p></speech>

Let me refer to other jurisdictions, as referred to by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  In the United States, for example, Ministers can dismiss senior officials within the limits set down by a certain law that is in place.  In Canada, the Prime Minister appoints those in the two most senior levels of officials and has the power to remove or dismiss them.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of whether this was ever considered in any of the reviews of the legislation or in respect of potential legislative changes that are needed?</p></speech>

The Mullarkey report was a couple of years later.  There was also the Rafter report, which I discussed with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  All of these things do arise.  In effect, the arrangements remain as set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, the Civil Service Regulation Act 1924 and subsequent measures.  The decision, as expressed in legislation, is that the appropriate authority is the Government.  In other jurisdictions, it can be the Prime Minister or equivalent of the Minister for Finance.  In our neighbouring jurisdiction, as I understand it from recent events, it is the Cabinet Secretary.  There are different models; it is just that the OECD work does not necessarily point to one ideal solution.  The legislative model we have used this as I have described.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is considering amending and consolidating Acts that date back to the mid-1940s.  I refer to really historical Acts.  In Mr. Moloney's experience, does he believe there is a better way to do this?  Does he believe the current system is working?  If we have had so many reports, reviews and amendments of various Acts, is the arrangement fit for purpose at this point?</p></speech>

As I said, there does not appear to be an obvious right answer in terms of the OECD, legislation and so on.  What the OECD points to as the solution is more in the nature of culture and values and of a co-operative arrangement and relationship of trust between the heads of the Civil Service and their respective Ministers and the Government as a whole.</p><p>It is very hard to create a policy or legislative solution that tries to bridge any gap there.</p></speech>

I appreciate his coming in.  Along with many Deputies and Senators, I am certainly interested in this topic from the point of view of improving the system.  There is no other motive behind it.  The opening statement refers to the 1924 Act.  Under section 17 of the 1956 Act, as amended, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for a range of functions including: the regulation and control of the Civil Service; classification and reclassification; numbers; remuneration of civil servants; and fixing the terms and conditions.  That might be the case at a very senior management level, but the workings behind that are carried out by the officials.  In general, the officials in each Department would recommend the range of responsibilities and functions.  The classification and reclassification would be a matter for negotiation with the unions.  The conditions governing the promotion of civil servants are part of the normal process within a company or business.  The general level of activity on all of these issues is part and parcel of everyday stuff in the Civil Service.  The Minister would act in those areas on instruction or recommendation from his or her Secretary General.  Is that not generally how it functions?</p></speech>

Any of those day-to-day decisions are taken within a policy and legislative context.  In effect regulations inform recruitment, promotion, the Civil Service disciplinary process, bullying and harassment legislation.  There is a significant policy context within which any day-to-day decision is made.  Of course, the Minister is fundamental to setting in place that policy context.  Once that happens, the day-to-day operation of that is taken forward on his or her behalf by civil servants or public servants.</p></speech>

Many other strands come together to work in the interest of the Department.  That is the only point I am making on that.</p> <p>  Is there a need for a Secretary General and a Department that would be in control of the overall performance of Secretaries General?  Therefore, there would be a boss, one Secretary General, who would deal with complaints and other stuff that normally arises in the management of a big entity like the State because that is not the case today.  A Secretary General appeared before this committee and explained that there really is no boss because each Department is structured in such a way that the boss is the Secretary General or the Minister, depending on what is going on.  However, there is no layer above Secretaries General to pull them in line should they depart for any reason.</p></speech>

The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 makes the Minister for Finance responsible for the Civil Service.  That has changed a few times.  It became the Minister for the Public Service at one point, back to the Minister for Finance and now it is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act is fundamental to the Chairman's question because it places the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as the person politically responsible for the regulation and control of all the Civil Service and all that flows from that.</p> <p>  We also need to bear in mind the point about the appropriate authority.  The Government is the appropriate authority for the Secretaries General.  That is also set out in the Civil Service Regulation Act.  The statutory provisions we have there set out a large and significant role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, but there is also a role for the Government as a whole.  One of the changes made since 1924 is exactly the one the Chairman mentioned, which is that the responsibility for employing people is no longer a central responsibility but is now within the remit of individual Departments.  A set of responsibilities goes up from individual Departments to Ministers and then, of course, Government has a collective responsibility.  I suppose that is-----</p></speech>

In his position looking back, can he ever remember a Secretary General who was fired for any reason?  Was anyone ever sacked, even down through the various lower levels of the Civil Service?

Over the past ten years, was anyone ever sacked from the Civil Service?</p></speech>

There definitely people are whose employment has been terminated.  It is not the objective of the Civil Service disciplinary code or the performance management process to sack people.  The objective is to work with them and to make sure they are fit for purpose but there are severe breaches of trust.  There have been issues.  The most obvious thing to think about would be theft.  If someone was found guilty of a criminal offence, or misused their position in some way, these are very severe things for which people have faced termination.</p></speech>

As for some of these reports on protecting taxpayers' money and getting greater efficiency in terms of the spend, I will not say they have been ignored because somebody obviously has read them but in terms of the extent of change demanded, very little change is seen in the mechanisms there to guard loss of money or efficiency.  There are many examples over the years.  How much input does a Minister have into those reports?  In Mr. Moloney's case, it a question of the reports being read and that is the extent of it?  I have not seen any major change in my time here on the Committee of Public Accounts or other committees that would lead me to believe there was a mechanism in place that fully looked at these reports with a view to making the changes that might be necessary.</p></speech>

The Department says whether it accepts, does not accept or partially accepts the recommendation and gives some indication of what action will be taken.  There is quite detailed consideration and the final part of the process is a minute signed on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which is put to him for approval.</p></speech>

Going back to the second page in Mr. Moloney's submission, the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees are said to examine various aspects of a Department's work, make recommendations to either the line committee of the Department, or in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts, to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which would then send these to the relevant Department, which comes back with the recommendations or a rebuttal of the points that were made.  The Committee of Public Accounts then gets a minute on that, as the Secretary General noted.  I have read many of those reports and have looked at the recommendations.  Very few recommendations are taken on board by the Department, in spite of the fact that a considerable amount of money could have been wasted.  Procurement or administration of one kind or another could have gone wrong and it just goes on like that.  It seems to be a process with lip service to the Committee of Public Accounts but no real analysis of what is required, or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not forcing the Department at fault to question itself enough to bring about the necessary reform so that the issue will not arise again.</p></speech>

From where I sit, I would say there has been significant structural and behavioural change in the last decade.  That is not to say there cannot be more and there are not other issues that need to be progressed further.  Certainly the recommendations to the Committee for Public Accounts are taken very seriously.  There is a reluctance to not accept them.</p></speech>

There is a huge volume of recommendations made through various reports, that have, by and large, been ignored.  I have often asked this committee how many recommendations through all of the reports were made and how many of those were actually accepted.  It would be a very worthwhile piece of work to do to find out.  It tells you a lot about Departments if you take the time, as I do, to see how it all functions.  My interest is not to catch anyone out but to understand why the Committee of Public Accounts is still in business.  The overriding desire should be to put it out of business because we have such an efficient operation that very little will happen.  I see the waste and very little scrutiny in terms of the public accounts side of the work at local government level.  Even though there might be local audit committees, they do not function in the way I would expect them to function from a business perspective.  I can name many outstanding pieces of work of complaint that just rest there.  There is a resistance either within local government or the broader Civil Service to having one master audit committee that is a Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with local government and with every other aspect of government.  There is a resistance to that.  I wonder about the resistance to change right across the different Departments.  Changes are happening slowly but in terms of the vast amounts of money Departments are now spending, there should be a far greater drive at that level to get the necessary change and to drive it down through the Civil Service structure itself.</p></speech>

They take the recommendations very seriously and are very reluctant to not accept them.  Constant improvement is what we all seek and I am not suggesting this is not possible.  The Civil Service now is not recognisable from that of ten to 20 years ago.  We have a National Shared Services Office, we have increasing ICT-----</p></speech>

I see a huge effort being made in businesses big and small to ensure IT and reporting are up to scratch and that change can happen immediately.  You just have to take the HSE, the Department of Finance and you find there is little or no IT infrastructure there to record the necessary financial reports and outputs from all of the various sections.  That would not happen in business and if it did, that business would not be in business for very long.  I do not see that type of real step change being made in big Departments and that really concerns me.  Before I go away from that, I have one more comment on the reports that come through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and are channelled to the different Departments, with the minute then being channelled back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>Would it be a worthwhile exercise to look at the various reports from the Committee of Public Accounts going to the various different Departments and do an exercise to find out how many recommendations were accepted, how many were totally rejected and how many were partially acted on?  That would be a worthwhile exercise and would give some sort of insight into how it all operates.</p><p> Will Mr. Moloney explain the recruitment process at senior level?  That is a public process.  It is a process that tries to attract others within the Civil Service to come forward.  There is a public end of it to try and get people from the private sector in.  How many private sector people have been employed within the Civil Service in the past ten years at that level?</p></speech>

One would often see people who worked previously for the HSE or previously for a Department and they are given a job to review something or other or to create a report on some issue or other.  Does the Civil Service reach beyond that?  Are there independent bodies out there that can be used to give a greater indication to the public that there is a drive here for greater transparency?  I am not questioning the credentials of these people.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are appointed by the relevant Minister or Government or both to the position.  That is a question of trying to look around and see who is available with an expertise in any particular area.  For State bodies, we have a State bodies appointments process now.  There is a greater degree of transparency, hosted by the PAS, in relation to that.  However, we are a relatively small country.  By the time one is looking for something, a relatively particular piece of expertise and independence in that, there generally are not a large number of experts available.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, it is difficult to measure yourself against other countries.  What we normally do is look to the OECD or other international organisations that undertake comparisons of how countries operate in particular ways.  It is often difficult to see into the detail of that, for instance, other countries, other cultures, other systems.</p></speech>

Our ranking on the traditional public service values indicator, that is, on independence, freedom from bribery and corruption, transparency of liability and administrative fairness, has been well above the EU average with Ireland ranking sixth of the EU 28 in this indicator in 2020.  To the extent that there are data, in terms of these surveys which are only surveys, the data are positive about the operation and the integrity of our civil administration.  That is not to say that there are not ideas there that we could bring in and use, and we engage with the OECD and others in relation to that.</p></speech>

I refer to the outsourcing of parts of the work of a Department or an agency where, let us say, citizens information or some other organisation like that is created.  Is that happening widely now in the organisation where there is a certain shedding of different responsibilities and they are being farmed out with new agencies being created?  The big example would be the Department and the HSE.  It can come down to much smaller agencies.  Is that a big change in the organisation?</p></speech>

If one is thinking about our new agencies being created, the Oireachtas created two new agencies.  It has created one, in terms of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and will, if it has not already, create a media commission.  They are two areas where it is felt that is the best way of delivering on the ambitions in those areas.</p><p>There has been great growth in both of those areas in the Irish context with the offshore renewable ambitions for the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and the prevalence of particular types of companies in the Irish industrial landscape for the media commission.  Those are two areas where new agencies are being created.</p><p> In other areas, the administration of some services can be achieved through partial outsourcing but that only happens where the existing administration is incapable of fulfilling what needs to be done.  Overall, we address different challenges in different ways.  We have changed organisational arrangements and used different ways of delivery over time.  Obviously Revenue is an example.  The Chairman earlier mentioned ICT and I agree that the future of the Civil Service and public service requires a shift towards ICT.  That is reflected in the Civil Service renewal plan.  There is an idea for 24-7 public service delivery by 2030 and that sort of thing, and there are EU targets in that regard.  We are mindful of those issues.  We are open-minded about how to deliver on some of those issues.</p></speech>

IT is essential to do that.  In such a case, does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get involved by telling the line Department we are not getting anywhere, we need greater transparency and accountability in respect of where the money is going and how we can improve on the structures and the big-spending Department does not have the appropriate IT systems.  Those systems might be too old and do not speak to each other.  Would the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get involved in that type of action with a Department?  Does it conduct a critical analysis of these big Departments in respect of how they are controlling everything?</p></speech>

It provides advice and a resource to Departments that want to achieve ICT transformation.  It has relationships with the chief information officers in most Departments.  There is a network of people who share best practice and link in with each other.  We would have traditionally taken an active role in trying to support those types of projects.  The Chairman earlier mentioned the HSE IT and financial management system.  We have become involved in groups trying to push that forward.  We facilitate to the extent we can from the centre of those projects.  However, at the end of the day, the organisations themselves must deliver.</p></speech>

Considering the amount of money the HSE spends, is it not essential for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to demand the type of IT infrastructure that would give the managers in the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the necessary information?  I attended a trade fair when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce.  There are companies that excel in that area around the world and yet we do not seem to be able to get to grips with the provision of technological advancement to an extent that would allow us to say it is all working.</p> <p>  I attended the opening of a wing in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  It has single rooms and state-of-the-art technology which tells the medical professionals everything about the patients.  We need to get to the point where we are getting all of the information from the likes of the HSE or any big-spending Department.  What is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard.  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform get annoyed with Departments that do not deliver with the efficiency or speed it would expect, given the money they are controlling?  Surely Accounting Officers across the board would want to have those systems in place so they could stand over whatever happened, what went wrong and right, and so on.  Mr. Moloney can tell me I am wrong if I am, but it seems that certain bodies within the Civil Service are very slow and we do not achieve levels of efficiency as quickly as we should.  If there was a single manager for all these Departments, I would be asking him or her what is going on in the Department and why is something not happening.  Those managers could be moved on if they were unable to deliver.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerned about the weaknesses around the financial reporting that is now necessary in respect of these big sums of money?</p></speech>

The Department has a large and active interest in the development of appropriate ICT, both financial and broader, across the Civil Service and public service.  It is the only way to effectively deliver cost-effective and impactful services.  That is very much at the core of the Civil Service renewal strategy, which we are driving.  We have a digital leaders group, which is chaired by the Government chief information officer, whose office is a division of our Department.  We play an active role in encouraging and exchanging best practice.  In respect of finances, we support different ICT projects.  However, it comes back to the reality we spoke about earlier in respect of where responsibility lies and who the decision-makers are.  The decision-makers, as is set out in different pieces of legislation, are either the Department or the agency involved.  We cajole, oversee, encourage, support where we can, and provide advice, networks and best practice.  Our role is in that sphere.</p></speech>

In big organisations, one sometimes has to take steps to make sure the organisation is moving in the desired direction.  It sometimes takes an intervention far greater than just cajoling.  I would have thought there would be competition among civil servants to make their Departments the key players or the models to follow.  I do not get the impression that is the case.</p> <p>  I am trying to examine the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would have thought its role would be far more authoritative and that it would if not dictate, force through the agenda of change and technological transformation in each area.  I do not see the same pace of change everywhere.  I would have thought the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would insist on that pace of change so that those different Departments and agencies were reporting on all fronts, including financial and administrative, and in respect their governance role, which is also important.  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

That is absolutely right.  We are central to driving forward transformation in ICT.  That is fundamental to the Civil Service renewal plan.  It is one of the key roles of the Government chief information officer.  The point I made was that the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the Departments remains fundamentally a matter for the Minister, Secretary General or Accounting Officer of individual Departments.</p></speech>

I ask members joining on MS Teams to mute their microphones when not making a contribution and to use the raise hand function to indicate.  All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protection against the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Today we are considering the implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality generally.  I warmly welcome the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and thank him for giving his time to join the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  We are conscious of the demands on his time and are grateful to him for attending.  I also welcome the officials accompanying the Taoiseach, Ms Elizabeth Canavan, assistant secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mr. Barry Vaughan, principal officer at the Department of the Taoiseach, and Ms Jane Anne Duffy, principal officer at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable. </p> <p>  Before I invite the Taoiseach to give his opening statement, I note we have been working on the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality for the past few months.  We are grateful to the citizens for all of the work they put in and to Dr. Catherine Day and her team for chairing the assembly.  Our work is focused on the practical implementation of the recommendations.  We will hold a number of public hearings over the next two to three weeks and will then hold private meetings to deliberate on our final report which we hope to present to the Taoiseach and the Government by the start of December.</p> <p>  I now invite the Taoiseach to give his opening statement before opening the floor to members for questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation and am delighted to take up the opportunity.</p> <p>  Gender equality is a key priority for this Government and if we are to make meaningful advances in gender equality, it will require a broad and inclusive approach.  The catalyst for inviting me today is of course the admirable work carried out by the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality and the subsequent report and associated recommendations on this issue, guided by the excellent chairing of Dr. Catherine Day, whom I would like to acknowledge and thank.</p> <p>  The report is a comprehensive assessment of the issues at play in considering gender equality across multiple domains including constitutional change; care; social protection; leadership in politics, public life and the workplace; norms, stereotypes and education; pay and workplace conditions; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; and gender equality in law and policy.  As the committee is aware, these are all complex areas and I will not be able to cover all relevant developments in each of them, but I will highlight some of the advances that have been made in specific issues of concern.</p> <p>  One important issue the citizens' assembly report called attention to is the need to facilitate women to participate and assume leadership positions in politics, public life and the workplace.  It is incumbent on the Government, and indeed all of us in politics, within our parties or groups, to do our utmost to ensure women do not face unnecessary barriers to their full participation.  In negotiating and agreeing the current programme for Government, this was an important issue for all three parties.  In the programme for Government, we pledged, among other things, to empower local authorities to encourage improved gender and ethnic mix in local elections; require local authorities to be more flexible with meeting times and to use remote working technologies and flexible work practices to support councillors with parenting or caring responsibilities, including childcare, and reduce travel times and absences from work; and examine further mechanisms informed by international best practice to encourage political parties to select more women for the 2024 local elections.  As we approach the half way point in this Government&rsquo;s mandate we are making good progress in this area.</p> <p>  The Government has published the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to transpose the remaining elements of the EU work-life balance directive including a right to request flexible working within the terms of the directive and an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes.  This legislation will also fulfil a long-standing Government commitment to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts to two years.</p> <p>  In addition, earlier this year, the Government gave approval to draft a general scheme to grant an entitlement of maternity leave to councillors.  The scheme offers the choice to appoint an individual as a temporary substitute in the place of a councillor who takes a period of maternity-related absence or is absent due to illness.  We know female councillors have felt pressure to turn up to important votes or debates, when they needed to be at home caring for a new baby.  It is not credible maternity leave if you cannot fully switch off from your work.</p> <p>  An extension in July this year has brought the entitlement to parent's leave and benefit to seven weeks for each eligible parent to be taken within the first two years of a child&rsquo;s life or adoptive placement.  The Government has also committed to introducing domestic violence leave.  This leave will create a valuable support for victims of domestic violence to take the time they need to access supports and to maintain their employment.</p> <p>  Another initiative we have brought forward, which has good potential in terms of building capacity and encouraging more women into public life, is the All Island Women&rsquo;s Forum established with the support of the shared island unit I established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  I want to acknowledge and thank the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland for its active support in making that happen and in making it the catalyst I am certain it can be.  Indeed, it has also been an important partner in our work on improving female participation in the 2024 local elections and in our free contraception initiative.</p> <p>  Another important area addressed within the citizens&rsquo; assembly report was on childcare and workers in the sector; more specifically, making the former more affordable and improving the terms and conditions of the latter.  Four years ago, annual State investment in early learning and childcare stood at &euro;485 million.</p><p>Just three weeks ago, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, announced that budget 2023 would allocate &euro;1.025 billion to early learning and childcare.</p><p> The fact that the target of spending &euro;1 billion on this area by 2028 was exceeded five years ahead of schedule is a demonstration, I hope, of the value this Government places on early learning and childcare and a recognition of the benefits it confers to children and their families, society and the economy.</p><p> On 15 September 2022, the first ever employment regulation orders for the early years services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the early years services sector.  The orders are supported by our core funding scheme, which commenced on 15 September this year and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freezing parental fees.  It is estimated that almost three quarters of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the employment regulation orders, with the wages of half of all employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more and the wages of 20% of employees expected to rise by 20% or more.  It is interesting that those involved in social partnership and the social partners see the development of the employment regulation orders as one of the most significant things to happen in recent times in respect of childcare, in particular, and standards of conditions in childcare.</p><p> While no single one of these initiatives will deal with all the issues, cumulatively they amount to tangible and meaningful progress.  As the committee knows, another important aspect of the citizens&rsquo; assembly was examining the gender equality principle in law and policy.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is currently undertaking a review of the equality Acts.  This review aims to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combating discrimination and promoting equality.  I know the committee has been actively engaged on the citizens&rsquo; assembly recommendations for constitutional change.  This is a complex area and the position paper developed by this committee as part of its interim report is very welcome and will help to inform the development of Government proposals in partnership with the Oireachtas.  I know the specific proposals are being considered by the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, at present and all the various complexities notwithstanding the Government is committed to holding a referendum on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</p><p> This Government is also genuinely committed to advancing measures that assist in developing and promoting gender equality through the kinds of measures and reforms I have mentioned in this brief statement.  There is much more to talk about in the wide-ranging citizens&rsquo; assembly report and I hope that we can explore some of the issues more fully now in our discussion.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p></speech>

Thank you for the opening statement.  A number of colleagues have already indicated and I see many more.  In order to facilitate everyone getting in in the time available, exchanges will be limited to six minutes per question and answer.  I ask everyone to adhere to that.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach commit to holding a referendum on Article 41, but the committee recommended in its interim report that a referendum be held in 2023, next year, to give effect to recommendations Nos. 1 to 3.  Colleagues may wish to explore that issue further with him.  We will certainly be returning to it in our final report.</p> <p>  The colleagues who indicated first were Deputy Cronin, Senator Warfield and Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  After that, I will call Deputies Hourigan, Cannon, Carroll MacNeill, McAuliffe and Clarke.</p></speech>

I welcome the Taoiseach to our committee.  The Taoiseach's Department is responsible for the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence implementation plan.  That is a whole-of-government approach across Secretaries General and there is meant to be a dedicated secretariat in the Taoiseach's Department.  Last week, we raised the proof aspect of domestic violence leave with IBEC and SIPTU.  Is the Taoiseach in favour of it?  If he is not, why did the Minister responsible for equality, Deputy O'Gorman, have in his report that employers should retain the request for reasonable proof?  Who defines "reasonable"?  What defines "proof"?  How do you define a psychological injury?  Is it two points for a bruise or four points for breaking the skin?  I feel sick even talking like that because it is sick that we would expect a woman or man who has suffered domestic violence to provide proof for the paltry five days that is being proposed.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach is over a Government that is dealing with legacy issues on how this State has treated women.  It brings us back to the dark days when women had to suffer extra social scrutiny about whether they could be trusted or not.  I am deeply uncomfortable with the proof aspect.  I will be talking on the work-life balance Bill this afternoon and I know this has not made it into the Bill.  I believe it is the Minister's intention to introduce it on Committee Stage.  I hope that after the reaction IBEC got last week, that will not happen.  I would like the Taoiseach's comments on that matter.</p></speech>

We want to arrive at conclusions that are in the best interests of women, particularly in the application of this.  It is not the intention to require proof.  As I said to the Deputy's colleague yesterday in the D&aacute;il, when a woman or man comes forward to an employer in respect of seeking domestic violence leave, it is not a cross-examination they require; it is consideration, help, assistance and the provision of the leave.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will be tendering for expert advice to come forward to create templates and provide guidance for employers on how to deal with this.  This is about culture and people being properly equipped to deal with situations like this, which will emerge.  It is groundbreaking that we are bringing in domestic violence leave.  It is the first time any Government has ever done this.  That in itself is a positive; that is the way I would approach this.  It is not the Government's view that the victim would be required to provide proof of domestic violence when availing of the leave.  I cannot be clearer than that.  I discussed this with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth before this meeting.</p></speech>

Are we now going to ask universities in receipt of public funds to reduce their ten-day domestic violence leave to five days?</p></speech>

It was the Minister, Deputy Harris, I think, who took the initiative in respect of the third level sector regarding the ten-day leave.  These matters are kept under review.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth looked internationally at how this has worked out in different jurisdictions.  The average sought in Australia was three days, as it turned out.  As I said, this is the first time this measure has been introduced.  It is important we get it through and I have no doubt we will do so.  The facility will always be there to extend that, as it is for various provisions.  It is open to employers and State employers to go beyond the five days as part of the policy of any given employer.  That is what has happened in the third level sector.</p></speech>

It is essentially Government policy, given that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has written to all universities asking them to introduce ten days paid leave for victims and survivors of domestic abuse.  The main universities have agreed to that.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill in 2018 that had ten days statutory leave.  Statutory leave in the North of Ireland is ten days leave.  It was initiated by Green Party MLAs and that is now law in the North.  Surely we should harmonise our all-island policy and introduce ten days leave in legislation, as the Taoiseach's party proposed in 2018.</p></speech>

We are providing in law for a statutory minimum domestic violence leave of five days.  There is a two-year review in the legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has gone ahead already in terms of third level and said ten days.  It is open to employers to go beyond the statutory minimum.  As I say, when this goes into the Oireachtas, the Minister will take on board the views of Members of the Oireachtas and we will take it from there.</p> <p>  It is a good measure to bring this in.  The international evidence is showing, as I said, so far, in terms of what the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have looked at, that three days was the norm in Australia.  Five days is being provided as a statutory minimum in legislation.</p> <p>  There will be a need for cultural changes.  We can see that in some of the submissions that have been made and that have been referenced, in terms of the IBEC submission etc., and that of the Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, and others.  Clearly, there needs to be further work done in terms of the broader issue and in ensuring that this is brought through in all sectors and accelerated without any resistance, opposition or misguided ideas around it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will appreciate there is some frustration among women and people who have been campaigning for this referendum to take place at the delays that have faced that referendum.  We have provided the Taoiseach with an interim report for the purpose of getting on with the matter as quickly as possible.  Can the Taoiseach give us a commitment that it will come to Cabinet in the coming weeks and that we can have a referendum in 2023, as the committee's interim report called for?</p></speech>

I put this out there, as I spoke to the Chair beforehand.  My experience of the eighth amendment is that the Oireachtas committee looked at that specific recommendation from a citizens' assembly, amended it to a certain extent within the committee, did not have unanimity in the committee, but a majority of the committee was able to vote positively for the formula of words that eventually became the proposition that was put to the people and one had a degree of Oireachtas support around it.</p> <p>  My preference would be that one would have as great a degree of Oireachtas consensus as possible around the wording on this.  That could be achieved through this committee because I understand the committee has some further work.  I have looked at the interim report and that tells me it is complex.  Personally, the more simply we keep it, the better.  From a constitutional perspective, we must be mindful of existing jurisprudence on these issues.  There are two fundamental ways of evolving a constitution: through judicial interpretation, which has been one of the more radical features of the Constitution since 1937, which is understated but which has been the great revolution in terms of evolving constitutional rights; and amendment by the people in the form of a referendum.  My understanding is the committee's work may be completed by the end of the year.  Therefore, if the committee can bring a definitive conclusion and certainty from a constitutional perspective to the proposals, the Government would be anxious to progress this in 2023.</p> <p>  I am reluctant to give a specific timeline.  There are a number of elements to this.  We must get it right, but also we must give time to the Referendum Commission.  Historically, the Referendum Commission gets annoyed when it is shoehorned into a particular narrow timeframe.  It has obligations, in terms of timelines in presenting the proposals and giving full information to the people.  That is the only qualification I would put in.</p> <p>  I would be anxious to get on with it as quickly as we possibly can.  Various Oireachtas committees have looked at this in the past and it has not been proceeded with.</p></speech>

Others will pick up on that.</p> <p>  It is not a question, but a comment.  I commend the Taoiseach on the important interventions he has made around transgender rights and empathy for trans folks.  I welcome those.  I thank the Taoiseach for them.  I remind the Taoiseach that trans citizens and residents still travel abroad, for instance, to Poland, for healthcare and our 16 and 17-year-olds are still waiting for recognition.</p></speech>

It was a unique time because it was during the pandemic.  Much of the work took place online.  We have heard from some of those who were involved in it and that gave a good footing for this committee.</p> <p>  Something that surprised many people was the amount of references there are to care in this Citizens' Assembly report and in the recommendations.  Prior to the pandemic, people would not have recognised that importance of well-being, possibly to the extent that this Citizens' Assembly did.</p> <p>  It is important to point out in relation to recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive, that this is a different referendum from the referendums that were being spoken about previously and it is not a case that people have been waiting for this referendum and now we have to get on with it.  Previously, it was removing reference to the place of a woman in the home whereas now it is about putting into the Constitution a reference to the importance of care work.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that.  The Green Party was probably the only party that did not want to see the reference removed in its entirety, but wanted it changed to be something that was more reflective of the caring nature and value of the work done by women and men and those of all genders in the home and changed to be something which did not leave all of the caring responsibilities with one particular gender.</p> <p>  The other point that I wanted to raise with the Taoiseach is the question of leadership, which we have discussed in detail in this committee and had excellent witnesses before us.  With quotas, we have not seen a change in the numbers of women being elected.  I have a deep concern that some of the parties are not putting women into electable seats sometimes and we need to call on political parties to do more.  It is not enough that we have, as we will have, a necessity to have 40% women on the ticket if we only return half of that into the D&aacute;il.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>  On my position, I am chair of my party.  We are looking to get women, but we also need to make sure that it is not only putting women down on paper but dealing with what it takes to get women over the line.  One suggestion was that we look perhaps at something like what the Taoiseach had done, which was to put in mainly women when it came to the Taoiseach's nominees for the Seanad.  That really shifted the balance in the Seanad.  We now have 40% women in the Seanad.  It means that we bring up many issues that relate to women's lives that probably do not come up in the D&aacute;il to the same extent.  Let us be innovative about it but let us also push back on the political parties to do more to get women over the line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.933" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#C00700"><p>I would make two points.  On the constitutional point, I accept the general view that it cannot be simple deletion and that part of the amendment should involve care.</p><p>The devil is in the detail and the balance between the constitutional, the Executive and the Parliament and what functions fall to Parliament and to the Executive to develop and implement.  I recall being involved in the Disability Acts in the 2000s and the EPSEN Acts as a Minister for Health.  I would have been an advocate on the rights side of it.  In terms of what constituted even a disability, for example, healthcare people said it could go to the hip or it could go to what we might consider normal health stuff.  If we put something into the Constitution, all sorts of interpretations can flow and there can be unintended consequences.  That is why the work the committee is doing is important in terms of how it is defined.  Policy issues should be for the Executive and the Oireachtas.  There has to be a written constitutional framework to govern people's basic rights.  It will be challenging to get a formula of words that embraces care but I think it is possible.  The committee has already done good work on that in its interim report.</p><p> On politics and the electoral issue, as a party leader I would be very close to this having overseen two local elections and two general elections.  Gender quotas were useful and effective in national elections because at national level each party will look at a five, four or three seat constituency and will say it has the prospect of two here or one here and winning the seat becomes a dominant issue and a primary consideration.  What that means is one could restrict candidates and one might run one or two candidates.  It becomes very difficult and challenging.  However, it worked because we were able to say to the national executive and to the party at large that we wanted to get 30% and we will do it come what may.  That meant adding women who may not have gotten through local conventions.</p><p> It is totally different at local elections if I am honest.  I do not think the quota is as critical at local elections.  There are more fundamental issues.  We need to look more broadly at other barriers to entry into politics, particularly for women but for men also.  We set up the Markievicz commission and brought academics in to chair it and they went through the literature and the four Cs, namely, cash, confidence, childcare and culture.  I have said to the chambers of commerce over the last number of years and when I met them as an opposition leader.  I do not think the whole of society is focused on politics.  What do I mean by that?  If somebody working in an industry - it could be pharmaceutical or financial services - put their hand up and said they wanted to be a candidate and to go forward for the city or county council, how would the employer look at that?  Is it a career limiting move?  I suspect it is.  Most party leaders and most HQ organisers will say the panel from which you choose candidates is narrowing all the time.  Once most people get out of secondary school or college, they go to work and not all can come out of that work world, so to speak, and go into politics.  That is a cultural thing we need to turn around.  That is my sense of it.  I meet many young people in the youth wings of political parties.  They are all enthusiastic and turn up to conferences and everything else.  They graduate, get the qualification and go to work in some firm.  I get the sense it is a career limiting move if they say that they want to become a councillor.</p><p> There are other issues.  I outlined some of the moves we have made on maternity leave and all of that.  The salary improvements will help.   That gives people an option in some instances to opt in full time and to remain at home.  That salary issue is important, and could perhaps be enhanced in the future at local government level.  The timing of meetings and basic things like that are also important.  When I started in local government, we met at 7.30 p.m., which everybody could make.  It was brought forward to 5.30 p.m., which I could still make because I was a teacher.  The committee meetings were in the afternoon, which not everybody could make.  We have to be more flexible around that.  There are lots of issues that are deterring people from going into local politics and we probably need to take a fresher look at it.  I would support any measures we could bring in that would make the choice easier for people.  I find that sometimes one is persuading someone that it will not be as bad as they think it is.</p></speech>

I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach pick up on the programme for Government because something we have been trying to do is flag certain issues that align with the work of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality.  I want to use my time to draw his attention to two areas in the programme for Government, which pertain to what we are dealing with at the committee, namely, the section on anti-poverty and social inclusion measures.  The first is something I raised with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when he came to the committee and is around gender and equality budgeting.  I know the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance have done excellent work on well-being budgeting which encapsulates gender equality budgeting.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has also looked at gender budgeting.  However, in every budget we are hoping to see a fully tested and gender equality budgeted budget, if that makes sense.  We want to see every measure and every policy put forward with sufficient data.  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and other Ministers who have appeared before us have said is that they will come to Cabinet with those details but sometimes that detail is not within the public sphere.  What is the development in terms of well-being budgets and gender budgeting and making all that information fundamentally a part of budget decision-making and making it legible not just to people in Leinster House but to NGOs which I know would find that incredibly useful?  I know it is difficult sometimes in Ireland to get one's hands on enough disaggregated data to make it meaningful in terms of decision-making.</p> <p>  My second question is also on that section and is borne out of some of the discussions around the referendum where we talked a lot about how it interacts with the rights of children and how we recognise marriage and those kind of things.  In the programme for Government, we have committed to reform our child maintenance system and address key issues such as calculation, facilitation and enforcement.  I know many parents, in particular lone parents, find it difficult to chase maintenance.  It is an ongoing issue that the women's caucus has called out.  Since we have committed to it in the programme for Government, what are the developments on child maintenance?</p></speech>

We have been developing the well-being framework which has been an intense piece of work and I take the Deputy's point about making it legible.  The late Bobby Kennedy spoke much more eloquently about well-being than we are at the moment, and that is no offence to how we are putting all of the documentation together.  It is a very significant bit of work but he described it as needing a set of measurements that measure.  He said that GDP "... measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile".  Then he went through education, children and so forth.  That is what our well-being budgeting is about.  It should be possible.  If I am honest, part of the issue since this Government came into power has been a degree of responding to the major crises of the day - Covid-19 and now the war in Ukraine and the consequential impact of that on energy and the cost of living - in terms of budgets, capital allocations and so forth.</p><p>That has impacted to a degree on doing the body of work that is required and which the Deputy is talking about in respect of the gender inequality budget, as well as having the proper metrics that people can relate to and measure as opposed to generalities and language.  I do not know whether the Committee on Budgetary Oversight has had any focus on that front-----</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is exactly right.  Covid threw up such a dynamic situation that data got parked for a little while because we were looking at situations that were just so extreme.  It was very difficult to parse the numbers on that level.  One issue is that the performance indicators from Departments present a particular challenge.  They have to be contextualised within gender equality and social inclusion.  We do not want to be constantly changing them because a performance indicator that changes every year is meaningless.  It is tricky.  I take that point completely.  We do not want constant change but they need to be contextualised in the right way.</p></speech>

In some areas, such as social protection, we know now what measures will help with combating poverty.  People can argue whether we do that rightly or wrongly or to the extent that we should but we have a fair idea of what types of payments can deal with consistent poverty or the prevention or avoidance of consistent poverty.  I will go back to the Ministers to see if we can get that template in place for the next budget.  I would have to go back to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the maintenance issue.  That has always been a continuing issue when it comes to successfully enabling people to get maintenance, enforce maintenance and make sure people fulfil their responsibilities.</p></speech>

If I were to point to one policy decision or piece of work that would be really meaningful for those families, it would be the removal of the pressure and responsibility on lone parents to look for maintenance.  We should have a system that is more reliant on the State and the State should take some responsibility for supporting the parent and making sure they have legal access and reasonable access to that income.</p></speech>

I would agree with that and I will work with the Deputy on the mechanisms by which we can do that.  There is change happening in the family court system and even with the new family court building.  I am determined to get those changes through.  The Deputy is correct about removing the pressure from the individual.  It should be more systemic.  When decisions are made in the courts, they should be followed through on and there should be an oversight mechanism that makes sure a person fulfils the obligations as determined by the courts.</p></speech>

I will raise two quick points.  One of them was already covered by Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  I refer to the issue of women in politics and creating a more family-friendly political environment.  Gender quotas have worked to a certain extent.  However, as both the Taoiseach and the Senator acknowledged, we also need to look at how we frame the workplace that the politician ultimately enters into, be that at local or national level.  We have an awful lot of work to do in this area and we need to lead by example.  To be frank, these Houses are far from family friendly with the sitting hours that form part of a typical day here.  We often run up to midnight on a Wednesday.  There are many representatives who sit in these Houses who do not get to see their families for two or three nights a week.  Those who do are very fortunate.  From conversations with them, they find that is conducive to them having a long and productive career in politics.  For those for whom it is difficult, particularly those who travel from the furthest reaches of the western seaboard, it is and will remain a challenge.</p> <p>  Getting down to local level, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, how local government works and the timing of meetings can erect significant barriers in the way of both parents becoming involved in politics at local government level.  I agree that we need to take a serious look at the salaries we pay our local government representatives.  The hours they commit to that work during the day and late into the evening and the commitment they give to their constituents are very significant and I do not think they are adequately rewarded for that commitment.  As the Taoiseach alluded to, we should perhaps move to a point where somebody can consider it a full-time career rather than a part-time one.  That is exactly the route other countries that have been successful in this area have gone down.  I would encourage the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Department to look in that direction.</p> <p>  The other point I want to make is on the area of remote working.  We had the greatest social experiment of our generation foisted upon us during lockdown.  We essentially said to thousands of civil servants to lock the doors on their offices, leave their offices, go home and try to do their work from their homes.  Not alone did they try to do their work, they succeeded in becoming ever more productive and ever more supportive of the people they aim to serve across the whole of our Civil Service.  The Department of Social Protection and Revenue, particularly during lockdown when everybody was working from home, did extraordinary work and proved categorically that they can be as productive and as effective in that remote work setting as they were previously.  It would be a crying shame if there were not significant learnings from that social experiment that was foisted upon us.  The Civil Service and local government should lead by example in the area of remote working.  Those of us in the political realm, who work in partnership with civil servants, need to lead by example.  In the Taoiseach's own Department, which has an oversight role for all of the Civil Service, has any research been done into productivity during lockdown and that enforced remote working period?  It went on for the guts of a year and a half to two years in some instances.  Is there work ongoing right now to ensure we can be ever more flexible in the future in how we support civil servants working remotely?  I think they have proven conclusively that they can do it.  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about quality of life.  This could be a hugely positive move in enhancing the quality of life of our civil servants.  It is something we need to seriously look at.  It would be a crying shame if we reverted to the Ireland of old, the pre-pandemic and pre remote working Ireland.  That is something we need to focus on in the next two to three years.</p></speech>

We should have a legislative day but the politics of it do not allow for that because people want the argy-bargy every day.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is looking at me.  People want Leaders' Questions and the Order of Business.  In a previous Government, back when I was a backbench Deputy in the late 1990s, we did a legislative day on a Friday.  It was civilised.  We got legislation through more expeditiously and in a better way.  People want to be in their constituencies on a Thursday and so we get into this Tuesday to Thursday thing.  I do not think it can be done in two and a half days, if I am honest.  That is my view.  It is a minority view but I genuinely do not believe we can do the work of the national Legislature in two and a half or three days.  Some might say it is more than that as there are committees.  I am not saying this in a disparaging way.  I understand there is committee work and so on.  It is a fundamental challenge that we have to be everywhere.  What Covid taught me as a politician, for the first year and a bit, is that we were almost exclusively focused on policy.  We got online calls and emails but the Friday nights were free and we were not at functions on Saturday nights.  It was quite an interesting year and a half for politicians.</p></speech>

As we return now, that is being dragged left, right and centre.  It is full on again.</p><p>Some of us love that engagement with people and so on.  I like that kind of politics.  I know what I signed up for, so to speak, so I do not complain about it.  That said, it is very challenging and frightens people away from coming into politics.  The point is that we need to take greater charge of how we organise our weeks and so on.  To be fair, a lot of progress has been made.  The situation was far worse in respect of late nights and so on in the past.  The voting situation has been reformed effectively and the voting block works well.</p><p> There have been international assessments of productivity with remote working.  It depends on the type of job but there has been an increase in productivity in some areas.  Other workplaces need person-to-person engagement.  Politics needs person-to-person engagement through meetings and so on.  The Civil Service was quite proactive on remote working and still maintains it.  I think we will end up in a hybrid situation.  My personal view is that young people need to be in the workplace for certain times of the week.  That is required for people who are starting out in a job from a mentoring perspective.  It gives them the opportunity to engage with people and learn the ropes.  We have all done that.  The negative side of the pandemic for Leinster House was that the newly elected Deputies and Senators met nobody in their first year and had none of the normal engagements with people that we all had when we were first elected and which we found very useful.  A senior politician would tell a newly elected politician how things work.  There is a balance to be struck and I think we will end up in a hybrid scenario where people will be in the workplace for a good part of the week and will then be in a position to work remotely at home or from another location on other days.  Training will require people on the job.  It all depends on the type of work and the nature of the workplace.  Some of the international research is already showing productivity gains from remote working in some sectors.</p></speech>

There are demands to be everywhere.  Everyone's event is, naturally, the most important to them but I would like to put my kid to bed some nights of the week.  Choices have to be made and it is very difficult.  We must talk positively about politics before we can attract more people but we cannot be dishonest about the realities of the pressures involved and how little politicians see their children, no matter how they structure things.  In my view, it is almost better to be in the Chamber at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday because it means I have the flexibility to do a collection from school at 4 p.m. on a Monday.  I do not necessarily agree that a 9 p.m. to 5 p.m. arrangement works as well as possible.</p> <p>  I have proposed a Bill, which the Government supported on Second Stage, addressing the potential for remote and proxy voting for Deputies in certain circumstances.  It would give an option during maternity and paternity leave.  There are many male Members of Parliament whose partners have had babies in recent years.  There is no real reason for a Member to be in the Houses at 10 p.m. on a Wednesday for the first six months of a child's life.  That Member could be at home supporting his partner as he or she looks after the small child.  That is one of the Bills we are considering at this committee.  I want to flag that as part of the proposed referendums.</p> <p>  In respect of the broader cultural piece, I want to pick up on what my colleague, Deputy Hourigan, said about gender budgeting and considerations.  Much of this committee's consideration relates to cultural changes and the differences in care and the additional responsibilities that fall to particular Members and the additional difficulties they face.  A group of parents were before the Joint Committee on Autism recently.  The five or six guests of the committee were all women.  This Government has extended considerably the eligibility for carer's allowance.  Those are the sorts of practical things the Government can do to try to help.  Deputy Hourigan spoke about maintenance.  There are women from every walk of life and across every demographic in my constituency who have experienced divorce, desertion or domestic violence.  These things can happen to anybody.  There are critical junctures in people's lives.  Perhaps they have had a child with a significant care need, or they have a maintenance problem or need to sort out a new life after a situation of domestic violence.  Universal measures are important in that regard.  A universal approach is required.  That would, for example, include the removal of the means test for supports in situations of domestic violence.  Easy access to maintenance is required.  These are just additional things that the people affected must do.  We have also talked about effecting cultural change in the corporate sphere where men and women are looking for flexible working.  That should be the norm.  These are all cultural changes.  The universal measures are important.</p> <p>  The free books scheme was fantastic for everybody concerned.  However, even in my constituency, that will not apply to fee-paying schools.  I know of a number of women in that situation who would benefit from a universal approach.  Those sorts of schemes should apply to everybody and not only some people.</p> <p>  How can we use the body of work this committee has undertaken in seeking to win a referendum, whenever that happens?  How can we use that dialogue politically to try to effect the cultural changes that are going to be crucial for effecting long-term change for women and men?</p></speech>

A vote would not be called on a Friday, amendments would not be put and so on.  The Deputy is absolutely correct about having flexibility on a Monday.  One positive about politics is that one has a degree of autonomy over one's working day, to a certain degree.  That is a benefit.  One can move things around and balance them.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the universality of certain payments that deal with particularly difficult situations that women or families can find themselves facing.  People are sometimes ahead of politicians and the political system, and I think that is the case in respect of these issues.  Societal change has already happened.  I might be wrong but I believe a referendum would pass but one cannot take that for granted.  We have to work hard to get it right.  We must prepare the ground and comprehensively inform people in advance of a referendum.  Preparation and the provision of information is key.</p> <p>  I think people are moving ahead faster than politicians in respect of cultural changes around gender budgeting.   I attended Christ the King Girls' Secondary School on Monday.  The students themselves showed leadership and I got to see cultural change in front of me.  That change has been led by the principal, in a way.  The students introduced me to the school and guided me in.  The students spoke.  They are involved in international organisations.  One or two of them are involved with the UN.  They want to be involved in society.  The mission of the school is for citizens to contribute to the world.  That shift is happening and we are sometimes delayed in reflecting it in legislation, the Constitution and our budgeting systems.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the carer's allowance.  We have improved it but-----</p></speech>

To be fair, someone has to watch public expenditure within any governmental system.  That is the role.  However, we need to look at the situation in the round.  That goes to the Deputy's point about universality of access to maintenance, child benefit and so on.  Child benefit was always universal but that approach was questioned.   When times got tough, people questioned that universality and asked should it continue.  We have always held the line on the universality of child benefit but sometimes it does not get the provision it should because people want to target other areas.  The argument has been made that because it is universal, it will cost a certain amount and that money could be used elsewhere.  Does the Deputy get my point?</p></speech>

It is too tempting for us to continue talking about gender, democracy and our electoral system because it is a subject where we have direct experience.  I certainly agree with the Taoiseach that quotas alone at local level will not necessarily produce the benefit we want.  We have been quite successful at achieving good gender balance in some councils and a strict quota could lead to the perverse situation where you would have to increase the number of males contesting, which over two terms might reduce the capacity we are trying to build.  I know my party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party on Dublin City Council all have majority female representatives, which is fantastic.  Some of them are first-time councillors and you would like to them develop their experience over time, so we need to be very careful with quotas.  There are definitely other benefits such as maternity leave and the increase in pay.</p><p> The other area referenced by the Taoiseach is the constitutional amendment.  The committee has not spent all its time talking about the constitutional amendment.  We have spent far more of our time talking about the other recommendations.  The Taoiseach suggested a collaborative approach.  Has he sought the Attorney General's view on it?  As for us drafting wording and so on, is there a method whereby we can receive some of the directions from the Attorney General that might help inform our final wording?  That would be useful.  I have two more questions but I might let the Taoiseach come in on that one.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.968" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#G00200"><p>Regarding gender, democracy and participation, workload is an issue.  This is why I mentioned the issue of pay and conditions because increasingly, councillors have an enormous amount of work to do at local level from planning to housing and very often, the councillor is the first point of call in terms of representations on these issues.  At county council level in particular, the geographic terrain in some rural areas that councillors have to cover has become larger since the changes of 2014 and county councillors have an enormous workload, which militates against women becoming involved to that degree.  Less travelling to meetings is something that could be encouraged.  Travelling to meetings is something people bring upon themselves and is not healthy or good.  The workload in larger areas has become enormous while in cities, there is more intense engagement regarding a range of issues.  That is a factor we need to work on.</p> <p>  Regarding the constitutional issue, the role of the Attorney General is to advise the Government, not the Oireachtas, but equally a proposal or at least the formula around a proposal needs to be on the table before you could ask the Attorney General or people with a constitutional legal bent who could advise or give their recommendations.  I would have thought the policy aspect of it is key.  I acknowledge the committee is doing further work on this but it has a lot of other things to do as well.  There are two pathways here.  One is for the committee to continue and finish its report while the other is that we ask a specific all-party committee to focus on this very narrow area of the Constitution and come up with a formula of words.  This is something I will leave to the committee to consider.  Alternatively, the Government could come forward with its wording.  If the Government comes forward with its wording in isolation, it cannot take into account the wording that may come from this committee.  That will still have to go back to the Oireachtas, which may make it easier for people to say they do not like the Government's wording and want to add this and that and then we are back to square one again, as in trying to resolve it.  The Government can go to the people with a wording but the more consensus we can build up around the wording the better.  Does that make sense?  Either this committee finishes it, and it will finish its report anyway by December, or we just get a very sharp time-bound group that looks at the actual wording, possibly even taking wording from this committee.  It really needs a constitutional legal lens as well to get it right, as far as possible.  We can never guard against unintended consequences, because jurisprudence will lead us in a certain direction anyway.  </p></speech>

Certainly the issue of parents of children with a disability and their access to school places has been a key discussion.  Where does the Taoiseach stand on this?  We have made some moves in terms of helping to secure the rights of children with disabilities, particularly those with autism, and access to school places.  Schools are reluctant to do that.  We would like to see this significantly improve.  Where does the Taoiseach stand on that?  My next question concerns a publicly funded network of domestic violence refuges, about which we have had some discussions.</p></speech>

That competes with other rights in terms of autonomy of the school but where the State is funding schools to the degree that it does, the broad principle of the State is inclusivity.  When I was Minister for Education and Science from 1997 to 2000, we had very little difficulty in transforming the special education system in terms of primary schools coming forward to create special classes and take children with special needs into mainstream schools and employing SNAs.  To be fair, if that obligation is on schools, we must then provide the resources and we are doing that.  The obligation should be there and legislation has changed and is changing to reflect that but resources must follow that in terms of the broad spectrum of needs but also different types.  There is no one size fits all.  It is at post-primary level that it has become particularly challenging with autism.  We have established new schools in the past two years.  About three to four special schools have been established.  That is where I see that.  There are other issues on the health side that are separate but must be dealt with in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme and its limitations so far.</p> <p>  Regarding refuge places, as part of its overall strategy, the Government's objective is to provide that everyone who needs a refuge space would get one.  I think we are up to 141.  I am still working with the Department of Justice regarding the timeline for providing the places.  When we get the agency set up, I believe it should drive the provision of refuge spaces with the proper optimum model.  Historically, the model has been localised and bottom-up, which is okay to a degree, but we do need standards and high quality, which we have achieved in many other areas of public life.  We have improved schools and healthcare settings, including primary care settings, dramatically so there is no reason why we cannot have a high-quality spec for refuge spaces and centres for families.  The strategy commits to doubling the figure to over 280 over the next five years.  I would like to see as much as we can do.  Some of that is back loaded.  I would like to see whether there are mechanisms we can work with local authorities to bring some of that forward faster.  </p></speech>

However, this annoyance pales into insignificance compared to the annoyance and frustration felt by women outside and inside this building.  We have been speaking about Article 41.2 for longer than I have been alive.  It was the biggest single policy issue at the time the Constitution was being drafted so this is not a new issue.  I agree with the Taoiseach, however, that it is complex and there are a number of different aspects to it.  Simplicity may very well be the answer.</p><p>However, given the complexity and length of time for which this has been going on, would the Taoiseach consider a cross-departmental document similar to that containing the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence or something similar to a Housing for All pathway that would lay down key performance indicators and give a documented progression rate in achieving the recommendations made by the citizens' assembly.  We need more than statements in the D&aacute;il on this matter.  We have had statements on the citizens' assembly recommendations last year.  What we now need to see is documented, transparent progress.  It is not good enough that when we finish this work, Members of the Oireachtas will be reliant on parliamentary questions to seek an update.  That is not transparency.  Any member of the public should be able to get access to the information.  The commitment is in the programme for Government and has been in other programmes, but we need to provide accountability, timelines and clear deliverables when it comes to gender equality.  Citizens deserve no less than that.</p><p> I have a second question for the Taoiseach.  It relates to the citizens' assembly model.  Earlier this year, Professor David Farrell warned that the high-profile successes of the repeal and marriage equality referendums disguise the fact that many recommendations of previous assemblies have been ignored, rejected or left to gather dust, thus wasting time and effort, not least that of citizens' assembly members, and wasting public funding for very little return.  He describes the evolved assembly model as sub-optimal, very top-down, very managerial, tightly controlled by civil servants and a Government-appointed chair, running the risk of stifling innovation.  Does the Taoiseach share Professor Farrell's concern regarding State stifling of citizens' assembly recommendations and the failure to advance those within a meaningful timeframe?</p></speech>

I have been involved with various referendums.  Referendum commissions are given a job to do and need time to do it.  When I am asked for a specific timeline, I want to make sure it allows the commission time to do its work comprehensively and in an informed way.  I do not want it alleged that a commission was just put together at short notice and did not have time to do its work properly.  That is all I am saying.  It is something we should all agree with.  If we want constitutional change, we should do it properly.  The first stage is to settle on wording.  We do not have wording right now.  We have disagreement on that.  "Disagreement" might be too strong a word but we are trying to work towards agreement.</p></speech>

It falls to the Oireachtas to make decisions.  The Oireachtas committee worked on the eighth amendment, for example.  It did not stick to the letter of what the citizens' assembly prescribed.  Not every member of the committee voted for it.  Some were against, some abstained and some voted in favour of changed or amended wording.  It got through eventually and was passed.  Some recommendations have been taken on board.  Not all are.  It has to be clear that very often what the citizens' assembly achieves is a very good articulation of the ideas and a teasing out of the issues, but it can never be the view that whatever the citizens' assembly recommends has to be, de facto, implemented by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Members are elected by people as well, and they have different views, as we know.  People will want to do things differently.  That is the balance we want to get right.  I would engage on Professor Farrell's point that the model is too managerial.  I believe he was involved with the original models.  There was criticism in certain quarters of this House of what I would call wrong allegations in respect of the thing being managed and choreographed and so on.  </p> <p>  We will always consider ways of improving the model, but we are at the cutting edge in Europe.  Very few are doing this in Europe to the same degree as us in terms of our model of participatory democracy.</p></speech>

I agree with the statement the Taoiseach made on people often being ahead of the system and the politics.  The reason I ask my question is that if there is not a clear response to those who participated in the Citizens' Assembly, particularly the one conducted during the Covid pandemic, which was a very difficult time, it may undermine the very basis of the assembly and make it difficult to get people to partake in it.</p></speech>

Also, this committee represents a response.  There is a degree to which we want this Oireachtas committee to come back to the Executive and the full plenary gathering and say this is how we think this should be implemented.  That is what I thought the objective of setting up this committee was.</p></speech>

We are committed to producing our final report on 1 December and, without pre-empting our work, to consider further the options we have already put forward for wording constitutional change.  This is so we might provide the Government and the Oireachtas with a clearer and more precise plan for the holding of a referendum, which we would like to see next year, to give effect to citizens' assembly recommendations Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive.  The exchanges we have had today with the Taoiseach on this have been very helpful.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  Two more members wish to contribute, and also a non-member, who I did promise we would try to facilitate.  I ask Senators Higgins and Doherty to keep their remarks within three minutes, if they can, so the Taoiseach will have time to respond, perhaps to both together.</p></speech>

I have very specific questions.  I welcome the Taoiseach to the committee.  In his opening statement, he specifically mentioned committing to holding a referendum on Article 41.2 of Bunreacht na &Eacute;ireann but, as he will be aware, the recommendations of the citizens' assembly relate not only to Article 41.2 but also, crucially, Article 41.3 and Article 41 more widely.  Therefore, it is not solely a matter of Article 41.2.  There is not much ambiguity in relation to Article 41.2 on care.  Any time a question has been put to the public on this, they always came back looking for gender-neutral recognition of care.  There is very much a close alignment with the options this committee has put forward so far.  This requires action.  I am concerned that while the Taoiseach mentioned Article 41.2, we have not had any discussion of Article 41.3, specifically the fact that the latter, as it stands-----</p></speech>

It is all Article 41.3.  I apologise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.998" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022101200002#H02300"><p>On Article 41.3, the specific aspect I want to focus on is the recommendation on the family.  Under Article 41.3 at the moment, the definition of "the Family" really only entails the marital family.</p><p>That has a very real impact.  We have spoken about lone parents where 25% of all the families in Ireland are single-parent households.  That is 25% of all our families who are not recognised as families by the Constitution.  We have also heard very detailed testimony from a number of witnesses about the impact that has personally with identity and also in policy areas, including social protection policy.  We heard of one very interesting court case this weekend that involved a widower whose partner of more than 20 years had died.  They had three children in their teens.  The judge described them as a loving family in the sense of which family is generally understood in our society but the man was judged not be entitled to the widower's contributory pension because the purpose of that widower's contributory pension was defined by the judge as supporting and promoting the marriage contract.  There are couples, therefore, of 20 years living together and their families are not considered to be a priority in the same way that marriage is.  Marriage is considered to be a greater priority than them.  It is similar for lone parent families.  These policies have real impacts.  We talk about consequences and unintended consequences.  There are consequences now from how our Constitution is framed.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that in his intention to hold a referendum, the Taoiseach is also committed to those provisions in Article 41.3 around recognising all families and including, of course, the marital family?</p></speech>

I fully accept that for a long time the definition of marriage was too restrictive in the context of the understanding of that article.  Many legal people might have a different perspective legally on that but I am very clear that the family is a very broad concept as far as I am concerned.  I look at it in the broadest way.  I am very committed to changing that.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, where we are now is the method by which we arrive at a proposal to go before the people.  I understand that this committee has done an interim report and that there is to be a fuller report.  I have put forward the idea that we need to do something more specific on these three.  I referred to the three areas in my contribution earlier, but not in the formal speech, and that we would deal with these areas as identified by this committee.  The committee has already come forward with proposed amendments to them.  The Senator has said that they may need further work.  It is just a methodology by which we do this now.  I favour achieving as great a consensus as we possibly can, although there will not be unanimity on this, before it comes to the Executive.  Then we will go to the people with the wording.</p></speech>

To be honest, there is very wide agreement in this committee but the information we do not have is on the questions or concerns that the Government has, including from the Attorney General and others.  This is why we have constitutional experts who are coming to meet with the committee and who have spoken to us.  We have legal experts on the committee.  The key point is that we do not want a situation where we give a specific wording, the Government then says that there is a technical problem from the Attorney General's perspective with this one wording, and then it all gets kicked to touch again.  This is why we have given options.  It is not because there is disagreement within the committee.  There was a very strong collective general direction of travel from this committee.  We have been trying to anticipate what concerns the Taoiseach might have but we have not had any input from the Government around what it is considering.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Referendum Commission.  The other part of the policy is ensuring that our social protection policies and other revenue policies are reviewed for the consequences of the referendum and are prepared for advance in a constructive and positive way.</p></speech>

I was on the Order of Business in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the amount of work that this Government and the previous Government have already done to address what we have been talking about for what feels like generations.  Eaten bread is soon forgotten, as they say, and we are concentrating on all of the things that are still left to do.  The difficulty I have is that we are literally talking ourselves to death.  I do not mean to be disrespectful when I say that but I feel aghast when the Taoiseach says that he is going to set up another little commission to talk about the wording.  I was at the Cabinet table when we came to the last wording.  When we went out to open consultation this is why that had to be scrapped and why the Government had to establish a commission.  We are going around in circles.  The list of things that we need to change by law in order to change the culture of Irish society - not political society but Irish society - to make it equal for men and women keeps getting longer.  Because those voices are minority voices they always end up at the end of a list.  For argument's sake, we talk about gender-proofing budgets yet the automatic enrolment heads of legislation that were published this week continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap that exists for society today.  This is a brand new scheme that has been around since S&eacute;amus Brennan's days in its making.  We announced it this week and it continues to perpetuate the gender pension gap.  There are parents of incapacitated children who are born to women and men who are probably in their 20s or 30s.  They are abandoned by the State because the woman must give up work to mind her child, and we give the husband a tax credit that is so miserable instead of recognising the value of the care that they give.  The contribution to the family and society that such carers give should be rewarded or at least acknowledged by the State.  We do not even give them credits for their pensions.  They do not exist in the State any more.  We talk about valuing care yet we pay carer's allowance as an income support and not as valuing care.  It is mostly women who do it.  If a husband is lucky enough to earn over the threshold then the carer is expected to just carry on herself and the State does not value the care.  We expect the wheels of those families to keep on turning.  All of these things perpetuate the culture where we feel that we are always last in the queue.  Women, care and family life is always last in the queue.  We deserve timelines.</p> <p>  I genuinely believe in the citizens' assembly, which was a group of women and men who came along to establish a report for us on all of the ills they think need to be fixed, and to fix it.  We are here now and it is going to take nine months to talk about those ills again.  We deserve timelines.  It is not acceptable for us to say or for the next Government to say that we will get to these things.  I would love to see the referendum happening next year but that is only a tiny part.  It is also about all of the other small incremental pieces that go to form the culture of how we value women and value the equality of opportunity between women and men in this country.  It might be a hard thing to do but I beg the Taoiseach to put in timelines or to allow us to put timelines in.</p></speech>

The role of this Oireachtas committee is to consider the citizens' assembly report on gender equality and bring forward recommendations for Government to bring forward and implement.  That is where we are.  The final report will be published on 1 December.  I would like to see a referendum in 2023.  I am always cautious of setting a date and someone coming back on the date and saying that we promised we would have a referendum.  I have been through this before.  Referendums have been lost through bad preparation, people not being informed properly and people thinking that the wool was being pulled over their eyes.  The most dangerous referendums are sometimes those where all the parties are for the issue.  Recently, I was reminded of that, but I do not know who brought it up.  Tommie Gorman wrote an autobiography recently, which referenced former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, when the Nice referendum went down.  His press secretary rang Tommie to say that he had something interesting to say.  He was in the Government that promoted the referendum.  He announced that it was a very healthy thing that the people of Ireland had voted against all the political parties, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Farmers' Association, which was true Charlie McCreevy style.  He said that was a healthy thing in a democracy.  The point is that the referendum was lost and we had to go and have a second referendum in the overall scheme of things.  My only point is that preparation is important, and I ask the committee to take that in good faith.</p></speech>

Once an allegation is made that a referendum commission is not allowed to do its job, that increases suspicion about what they are at and what the elite are at by putting a referendum on citizens when it has not been fully explained, and whether they are covering something up.  That is my point.</p> <p>  We have improved the credits as well in terms of home care credits, tax reliefs, the carer's allowance and so on.  Finally, on that overall point, &euro;11 billion was allocated in the last budget in a cost-of-living package.  Even that did not enable us to do everything.  Obviously, it was a once-off package.  Childcare is getting there.  It is a very difficult area because of the multiplicity of providers and how it began in the first instance.  It did not begin like our primary school system did.  There are private, community and State providers.  However, it is getting there over time.  As I have said, we have gone from providing &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;1 billion in funding.  We need to do more in terms of almost getting to a stage where money is not a barrier to accessing childcare.  Even with the improvements we have made, we need to do more, but I think we are getting there.  In politics we want to be everywhere, but sometimes we need to say that we will deal with one issue, such as childcare, over the next two or three years.  That is how to respond to citizens' assembly recommendations.  We might not cover everything optimally but do we deal with the childcare issue once and for all?  In the past two years we have taken steps towards that.  I think the employment regulation order was very important.  I think that having terms and conditions in childcare for workers is vital to retain people and to create a career in childcare for workers.</p> <p>  I do not know if I am permitted to respond to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's points.</p></speech>

To enable the committee to consider this matter, I am pleased to welcome from the HSE, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain, national clinical director for integrated care, and Dr. Derval Igoe, specialist in public health medicine.  I am informed that Dr. Ciaran Bannan, consultant in infectious diseases at St. James's Hospital, will be filling in for Dr. Catherine Fleming, consultant in infectious diseases and co-lead on the infectious diseases clinical programme.  I also welcome from the HSE, Dr. Ciaran Browne, national crisis management team lead for monkeypox, and Professor Fiona Lyons, medical director, clinical lead, sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.</p><p>I welcome everyone to the meeting.   All those in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p><p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p>   I invite Dr. Siobh&aacute;n N&iacute; Bhriain to make her opening remarks on behalf of the HSE.</p></speech>

I thank the Joint Committee on Health for its invitation to discuss long Covid and monkeypox.  The Chairman has already mentioned who I am joined by.  I send Professor Fleming's apologies and thank Dr. Bannon for joining us at short notice.  I will talk first about long Covid.  The HSE launched its interim model of care for long Covid in September 2021.  The model provides a framework for the provision of supports and services for those experiencing prolonged symptoms of Covid-19.  The model is being implemented in a phased approach with each hospital group having access to both a post-acute and long-Covid service.  This will deliver eight post-acute Covid clinics and six long-Covid clinics around the country.  The following sites have post-acute Covid clinics: Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown; St. James's University Hospital; Tallaght University Hospital; Cork University Hospital; University Hospital Limerick; University Hospital Galway; and Letterkenny University Hospital.  Long-Covid clinics are established in Beaumont University Hospital; St. James's University Hospital; St. Vincent's University Hospital; Cork University Hospital; University Hospital Limerick; and Galway University Hospital.  Both Tallaght University Hospital and St. James's University Hospital are operating combined post-acute and long-Covid clinics.  Some of these clinics have been established in response to local population needs using existing resources and capacity.  The HSE is working closely with each of the hospital sites to expand the existing clinics, where needed, to provide a full range of care.  The HSE is also examining how existing services in the community can support those with post-Covid or long-Covid symptoms.  The number of people that are affected with acute Covid and long Covid remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10% to 20% of Covid-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.  An epidemiological survey is being planned to provide insight and understanding into the prevalence of long Covid in the Irish population and risk factors for developing long Covid.  It will also help to forecast future demand for services and will inform the direction of the model of care.  The HSE has commissioned HIQA to review the evidence regarding long Covid, including models of care in other jurisdictions.  This, along with additional research that will be conducted by the HSE, will inform the development of services and a review of the current interim model of care.</p> <p>  I will now move on to monkeypox.  Monkeypox virus is found naturally in certain African countries.  Prior to May 2022, monkeypox infection was rarely seen outside those endemic countries.  Infection with the virus responsible for the current outbreak manifests as a mild illness and most people recover within weeks.  However, it can occasionally cause severe complications, including death.  Severe illness is more likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system, pregnant people and children.  Following reports of cases of monkeypox infection in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Europe, a multisectoral, public health-led national incident management team was established to prepare for cases being identified in Ireland.  This was the first time chains of transmission were reported in Europe without known epidemiological links to endemic countries in Africa.  The HSE rapidly put in place laboratory diagnostic capacity; clinical patient assessment capacity; transport pathways; clinical and public health guidance documents; and channels for sourcing vaccine and anti-viral medication.  Patient information resources and a communication campaign to ensure that individuals with suspected or confirmed monkeypox infection had timely access to the appropriate information and assessment were also put in place to ensure that the public and the workforce responding to monkeypox were protected.  Contact tracing guidance was also developed, including the offer of post-exposure vaccination to close contacts deemed at significant risk of an infection.  Mobile vaccination teams were deployed to administer vaccines to close contacts in the community.</p> <p>  In Ireland, the first case of monkeypox infection was confirmed on 27 May 2022.  Since then, 194 cases have been identified, with 11 hospitalised.  Cases are predominantly male and the mean age is 35.  In July, the current global outbreak of monkeypox infection was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO.  The HSE focus is the roll-out of primary prevention vaccination to individuals likely to benefit most, in line with national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC recommendations.  There are estimates that between 6,000 to 13,000 people will benefit from primary prevention vaccination.  The HSE has commenced vaccinations of high-priority groups.  In the context of limited vaccine availability, the chief clinical officer established a clinical advisory group to advise on the prioritisation categories for vaccination.  Working with the Department of Health, to date over 2,000 vials of monkeypox vaccination have been secured.  In August, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, advised that countries could administer the vaccine intradermally.  This increases our ability to provide vaccination to identified priority groups.  The HSE has provided primary vaccination to more than 300 people and post-exposure vaccinations to 160 people.  On Monday, 17 October, the HSE will commence offering vaccinations through 11 designated centres across the country.  Individuals will be asked to self-identify their risk for infection and, where they deem appropriate, to self-book a vaccine appointment.  The aim is to complete vaccinations for high-priority groups between now and December.  Two doses of monkeypox vaccinations are administered at least 28 days apart.  The Department of Health and the HSE continue to procure additional vaccine stocks and are hopeful that further stocks will become available.</p> <p>  Communication to gay and bisexual men who have sex with men remains a critical part of our response, working in close relation with community organisations.  Community partners developed an extensive communication campaign including washroom posters across Ireland; social media advertising; online and print advertisements in the LGBTQ+ press; video content to include monkeypox testing care; and a number of public and community leader meetings with members of the national crisis management team.  The HSE has also funded HIV Ireland to provide a counselling and psychological support service for those affected.  This concludes my opening statement.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Administration of medication can be under the skin or into a muscle.  Generally, if you can give it intradermally, you can get more doses.  I will ask one of my colleagues, Professor Lyons, to comment on that.</p></speech>

If anyone has ever had a Mantoux test for tuberculosis in the past, they may remember.  It is like a little bee sting.  As we do not use Mantoux testing any more, the skills for doing intradermal administration are not as widespread within the health service as they were previously, because they are not used that often.  The EMA advised that it would give us the opportunity, in the context of limited supply of vaccine, to administer vaccine to more people.  We gained the possibility of administering vaccine to more people, as opposed to giving it under the skin.  Subcutaneous administration involves a small needle under the skin, usually up in the arm.  Intradermally is in the forearm, in the volar aspect of the forearm, in between the layers of the skin.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain for coming before the committee this morning.</p> <p>  I am a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, community and am involved with our group in the Oireachtas as well.  I welcome a number of points, including that the category of people who will be vaccinated will be broadened, as well as the intradermal route of administration.</p> <p>  I am disappointed with the overall reaction of the HSE and the Department of Health to this crisis for a number of reasons.  First, the roll-out of the primary prevention vaccination has been far too slow.  Second, I do not see any evidence we have increased our availability of supply.  Compared to other European countries, we lag behind in supply.  I have three questions about the decision to start on 17 October 2022.  Why wait until that date to begin?  I raised a Commencement matter in the Seanad with the Minister on 20 September.  I received almost the same reply today as I did then regarding what we are doing as a country.  We do not seem to have increased the supply.  Can Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain answer the point first and then explain the start date of 17 October?  As regards the risk group, has the HSE considered using the pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, list for example?</p></speech>

Regarding primary prevention and communicating risk, this disease has been overwhelmingly within the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men, gbMSM, community.  We have worked hard from the beginning to work in partnership with gbMSM representatives, including the Gay Health Network, GHN, and the MPOWER programme.  Initially the focus was awareness of this disease, the symptoms and the need to present early for treatment.  The next step focused not only providing treatment for the patients, in terms of care, but also identifying others who may be at risk having been exposed to them and providing post-exposure vaccination.  That has been happening for quite a while.</p> <p>  More recently the focus is not only on awareness of the disease but also on some changes in behaviour that people might make to reduce their personal risk of infection pending vaccination.  Quite a systematic campaign was outlined in the opening statement, using a variety of media channels, outreach in venues etc. employing an approach adopted from America which is like a traffic light approach that indicates behaviours according to higher or lower risk in order for people to be able to avoid certain behaviours that might put them at increased risk.  That has been rolled out comprehensively within the community.</p> <p>  The second part is pre-exposure prophylactic vaccination that is now the focus of the vaccination programme.  There are two focuses: the post-exposure vaccination which started as soon as was possible when we first got cases in Ireland and we are now planning for the roll-out of the pre-exposure vaccination.  It has been taken in a couple of phases.  First, we focused on people with a history of early infectious syphilis, identified them quickly and tried to vaccinate them and now we have widened the criteria.  With regard to-----</p></speech>

The group we are calling 1B comprises those who are determined to be at highest risk of exposure.  They are defined as non-monogamous gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men who self-report one or more of the following: bacterial sexually transmitted infection or primary genital herpes within the past six months; sex in a sex-on-premises venue such as a sauna, dark room, sex club etc. within the past six months; a person who has had group sex within the past six months; or a person who has had three or more sexual partners in the past three months.  People can self-refer if they feel they have had those exposures and therefore are at high risk of exposure to the disease.</p></speech>

We are putting the capacity in place both through our sexual health services and our community vaccination centres.  The three sexual health services in Dublin are in the Mater, St. Vincent's hospital and St. James's Hospital.  The CVCs include those in Croke Park, Citywest, Wexford, Portlaoise, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  There will be 11 centres nationally.</p> <p>  In respect of the supply issue, at the start of this, the HSE working with the Department of Health tried to secure as much stock as we could.  We immediately procured 660 vials of the vaccine and then a further 1,400 arrived.  We were trying to procure stocks in the context of a global outbreak and many different jurisdictions were trying to procure stock at the same time.  The Department of Health and the EU did a lot of work to try to procure additional stock and we are hopeful it will arrive in the future.</p> <p>  When we commenced the first phase of vaccinating the early infectious syphilis group, the administration of the vaccine had to be done subcutaneously, which meant we used up the stock very quickly.  In late August when we were planning this, the intradermal application of the vaccine became available and that was an opportunity to spread the vaccine but it necessitated us stepping back and trying to plan.  Previous to that, we would not have been able to use the CVCs as much.  Hence we had done a lot of operational planning.  The Senator can appreciate administering a vaccine like this safely to a large cohort necessitates a huge amount of operational planning about how we will provide it, the information we will give out, how people will book and importantly, how the dose will be recorded because it is a two-dose regimen.  It is therefore important to track who has received the first dose and who has received the second dose.  We are as anxious as everyone to ensure we start vaccinating the community as quickly as possible and we have done a lot of work in partnership with them and to keep them updated on our plans.</p></speech>

My questions are quite specific so I do not wish everybody to answer them just the relevant person.  If it is Dr. Ni Bhriain, that is fine.  I am looking for information in the first instance.  Dr. Ni Bhriain stated that 194 cases of the monkeypox virus have been notified so far and that there have been 11 hospitalisations.  Is the position likely to have been understated?  Would it be the case that there may be some people who are infected and about whom the HSE may not have been notified?  Is it likely that number is at the lower end of how many are actually infected?</p></speech>

From the outset, Ireland adopted, very appropriately, an approach of having a sensitive case definition.  By that we mean that the criteria to have testing were set at a low bar in order to enable good, sensitive case ascertainment.  The case definition was set at a level that should allow us to identify people to come forward for testing.  I do not believe that the case definition has had an impact on our ability to have cases undiagnosed.   There is no denying that at the beginning of this outbreak some of the stuff seen on social media would have probably made it very scary for individuals to come forward.  There was some pretty nasty stuff put forward on social media.  We worked with our community colleagues in the context of getting a very robust communication plan out to the LGBTQ-----</p></speech>

What we are finding in Ireland is that the number of cases in August was higher than the number of cases in September.  We are on a slight downward trajectory.  That is similar to what has been found in the United States, in Canada and in Europe overall.  As to why that is happening, the view is that it is a combination of approaches.  It is a combination of vaccination and changes in behaviour.  If it is the case that there are smallish dense networks, people might have developed some natural immunity.  Those are the three theories as to why it is decreasing.  That is not to say that this will continue in the future.  Our understanding is that this is overwhelmingly within the gbMSM community.  If that continues within the community and there is no spread outside it - and there is no evidence of that - then we would not see cases in other populations.</p> <p>  In America they had the opportunity to look at people's behaviours systematically and they found that 50% of people had changed their behaviour as a result of monkeypox.  Behaviour change is also a factor.  If behaviour change is sustained, if the vaccination programme progresses and goes well and if the outbreak stays within the gbMSM community, I do not see a big escalation.</p></speech>

I the witnesses for coming in and for their presentation.  I echo points made earlier by the first speaker in relation to us being slow to gear up to meet the need in this area.  The first case here was identified in May.  A public health emergency was declared in July.  There was not a lot happening after July, publicly anyway, whatever about what was going on behind the scenes.  However, I welcome the information in the opening statement about people being able to self-identify as being at risk, the opening up of facilities and the apparent gearing up that is happening.  All of this is determined by availability of vaccines.   I was somewhat confused by Dr. Browne's comments regarding the possibility of getting three, four our five doses from a vial.  Why is there a variable in this regard?</p></speech>

There is not a guarantee of actually getting five out.  It is a fiddley thing is the best way to describe it.  The experience has been that people are mostly getting about four doses out per via,l but there are some circumstances where there were it may be three.  In some circumstances, it may be up to five.  It is literally that we are using a vial that was only ever meant to be for extracting one dose, dividing its contents into five and trying to get as many as possible out of it. That is why there is the range of around three to five.</p></speech>

I want to get back to the question of the number of doses that are available.  As I said, I welcome the fact that people can now self-identify their risk.  What happens then when the current availability runs out?  The HSE is saying it has 6,000 doses, at best, at the moment, and that the target is up to 13,000.  What happens then?  When does the HSE expect that to happen in the absence of additional doses being available?</p></speech>

When we will run out depends on what the uptake is like.  Based on a survey in which people in Ireland participated, there was an anticipated acceptance of offer of approximately 85%, which is a very high uptake rate.  Our experience thus far within people who have been invited forward for vaccines as opposed to self-booking for a vaccine is that it has not been that high.  It has been between 50% and 70%, varying over certain clinic times.</p> <p>  The acceptance rate in terms of how many people will accept the offer of vaccination is one thing that will determine how quickly we will run out of vaccines.  The important thing is to communicate.  As Dr. Igoe indicated, we have already seen a change in the trajectory of the numbers with the combined prevention health promotion and health protection approach that has been adopted and communicated to people who may be at risk of infection.  That will need to continue in the setting of limited access to vaccines.</p> <p>  Like with any outbreak response, the vaccines are not the only part of the response.  They are an important component of the response but not the only part of it.  Therefore, an important thing will be to support individuals, and this has been stated within the communications plan, who may be at risk and who do not have access to vaccines in mitigating their risk of acquiring-----</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy the figures.  There were approximately 626 cases in endemic countries this year.  It is perhaps important to say the deaths have been disproportionately in the endemic countries as opposed to the non-endemic countries, even as part of this outbreak this year.

What happened in May of this year was very unexpected in that there has been in recent years the sporadic imported case from somebody who was in a country where the disease occurs, and who maybe travelled to England or America and became ill and was then identified.  That had happened.  What was extraordinary this year was that, in May, people were identified with monkeypox who had no travel links to the country in which it occurred and where it does happen.  This was extraordinary in that it was not associated with a country that has occasionally gotten cases of monkeypox.</p></speech>

What possibly happened was that a person had a link to an endemic country and then, within a smallish population where there are quite a lot of links, a seeding event or several seeding events happened whereby that person was in touch with other people within that community who then became infected.  There were probably what we would call chains of transmission that were undetected at that time.  The second thing that was unusual in May of this year was that the clinical manifestation and severity of the disease was milder than what would have been recognised in Africa.</p></speech>

In what way does Dr. Igoe think stigma is a factors with regard to people coming forward and possibly getting the vaccine, in some cases, having perhaps been infected with monkeypox?  Is this a factor?  Obviously, this was a major factor during the 1980s and 1990s with regard to HIV, and still is, to a certain extent.  What kind of effect does that have?</p></speech>

Colleagues have been part of the response right form the very beginning, and are a key part of the response now in encouraging their peers to get vaccinated, and in knowing who should come forward now that this new phase has been announced.  We recognise nationally that there is a risk of stigma.  Indeed, it has also been recognised by the WHO and other colleagues internationally.  It is most important that we work together to avoid that.  We can avoid that by ensuring that the key population that is currently affected is fully part of the response, which I think it is, in fairness.</p></speech>

Generally, speaking, if a person has skin lesions they need to separate themselves from their household and sexual contacts until all the skin lesions have healed.  A bit like in the case of somebody who has chicken pox, until the lesions have healed, scabbed and the scabs have fallen off, they must isolate from household contacts during that time.  If a person has lesions on a part of the body that is covered, he or she may be able to come out of isolation when no new lesions are appearing, before everything has healed over.  If an individual has lesions on the face or hands that could come into contact with somebody in normal social interactions such as shaking hands or having a cup of coffee together, he or she must wait.  The point I am trying to make is that it is quite variable.  By the time some individuals have their diagnosis of monkeypox, they may be very close to resolution.  The range of symptoms that people present with is quite variable.  Some people may just have one lesion, whereas some individuals may have very extensive lesions involving many parts of their body.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that there is potentially quite a big stigma associated with having this infection for individuals in the gbMSM community.  In looking after people who are at home, we phone them.  In the beginning, we were phoning them every day to see how they were physically, and depending on how they were doing, we would phone them more frequently or less frequently.  What became apparent very early on was that they had quite a lot of psychosocial support needs as well.  That is why the HSE has funded psychosocial and psychological support for individuals who are experiencing monkeypox infection and the stigma or the social isolation associated with that.  Through the MPOWER programme, individuals can provide their phone number and they will be contacted to avail of the service which is now funded by the HSE and run by peers within the community.</p></speech>

That is why the isolation facility has been established, so that people can safely isolate in an appropriate setting to protect other individuals in their household from being infected.</p></speech>

It does not seem very clever to me not to be supporting people in every way that we can.  Financial barriers for people in precarious work is a major issue.  I want to get one more question in before my time runs out.  What funding package is in place for the next round of communications in which people will be asked to self-identify for vaccination?  Has the HSE received a new funding package for that?  It is a new strategy that the HSE is undertaking in asking people to self-identify for vaccination.</p></speech>

Surely it should be readily available and the HSE should be proactive as opposed to somewhat reactive?</p></speech>

Under Dr. Igoe, who chaired the incident management team, and subsequently under Mr. Browne's direction of the national crisis management team, the community has been involved from day one.  The WHO has acknowledged the efforts Ireland has made to ensure communication is sensitive and responsive.  As an example of that responsiveness, in the context of stigma and the concern about individuals coming forward for testing, one of the things we heard in feedback from the community, which we got because we have been so engaged with the community since the beginning of this, was that people were scared to come forward for testing.  In response, we got two doctors, one who speaks Brazilian Portuguese and one who speaks English, to make a video that went up on YouTube to debunk some of the myths that may have been out there among the community and inform individuals on what to expect.  The communication to the community has been very targeted, nuanced and responsive.  We have very much engaged in a collaborative team approach.</p> <p>  Dr. Igoe may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

There have been very strong relationships between public health, sexual health services and the relevant NGOs.  We communicate around sexual health issues on a regular basis.  When it came to communicating about monkeypox, it was not a question of starting from zero.  That is all I would add to what Professor Lyons said.</p></speech>

We have emphasised the importance of direct communication with the community, part of the purpose of which was to help reduce stigma.

This has involved getting feedback from the community around where the needs are, what the questions and fears are and trying to ensure we get messages out to people that debunk the myths and ensure individuals are not afraid to come forward for assessment and testing as they need it.  A really important part of the communication has been to get the message across that when people have an opportunity to self-book for vaccination, they will not be asked to declare their risks.  This will be a self-identification process and those risks will be captured nowhere.  That is a really important part of ensuring people do not feel stigmatised in this regard.</p> <p>  We have developed community well-being assessments and services and are providing care for individuals with monkeypox infection who are isolating at home.  The HSE-funded empower psychological supports provide individuals with a number to contact if they are experiencing a lot of distress, which is something that we all, as clinicians, have identified if we have been calling people over a weekend, say, to see how they are doing from a clinical perspective.  We have noticed they are struggling sometimes with the social isolation and perhaps some stigma they are experiencing by virtue of having the infection.  That is why the community and psychological supports were put in place for those individuals.</p> <p>  I have nothing further to add other than to reiterate our approach has been very nuanced, responsive and proactive.</p></speech>

People are in venues speaking to individuals where they are at and allaying their fears.  Using a variety of channels for communication within the community is important.</p></speech>

A link to information on monkeypox is one of the scrolling items on the homepage and if users click into it, they will find a variety of information sources about the infection, a list of symptoms people may experience, what vaccination involves and what may happen to individuals who are vaccinated.  If people are unwell and require emergency care, they need to call the emergency services.  If they think they may be at risk of infection, they should contact either their GP, who will refer them for testing, or, if they are already engaged with sexual health services, they should contact those services.  As has been seen thus far, many of the individuals who have been diagnosed with monkeypox infection already have an established relationship with one of the sexual health services.</p></speech>

We used available data we have in the system to get our estimate.  We used two different methods, both of which came up with a similar number.  The first method was looking at the current numbers of people who are on the medicine PrEP to prevent HIV infection.  We did not just take that number; we also looked at a potentially unmet need, which would include people who are waiting to get on that programme.  We identified 4,000 people who are on PrEP and an additional 30% who may have an unmet need, which gave us 5,120 people.  As well as that, we looked at people living with HIV who are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, gbMSM.  Based on some information we have on behavioural surveillance, involving self-reported bacterial infection in the previous 12 months, which was available from an Internet-based survey we were involved in, we identified another 28%  who reported such an infection.  However, we know from Internet-based surveys that one may get an overestimate of the situation, so we halved that number.  From that estimate, we came up with a number between 5,610 and 6,100, depending on whether or not we halved the number reporting bacterial infection via the Internet survey.</p></speech>

It is the number we anticipate will present.  Once the vaccination starts, we will know the number of people who actually come forward.  For now, we are working on an estimate.</p><p>We have two different ways to do that.  These are not perfect but they are the estimates that we have.</p><p> The second way was not to look at whether a person is either on treatment to prevent HIV or is living with HIV.  The second way is just looking at the gbMSM community who have reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the last year.</p></speech>

I would just say that GPs refer anybody who they think might have monkeypox to a sexual health service.  The numbers are usually notified.  It is a notifiable disease now, so we get all the numbers and they usually come from sexual health clinics.  GPs would not really be inputting the numbers reporting with sexually transmitted infection here.  It would not be our main way that we would get that information.</p></speech>

It is an important component of the response.  When a person is diagnosed with monkeypox then they are interviewed by public health.  They speak to the person and they identify sexual and other contacts who may be at risk of having been exposed to monkeypox.  Then there is specific advice and vaccination, where appropriate, or post-exposure vaccination for them.  This has been an active component right from the very beginning.  For each individual, their illness is treated, but also the contacts that they have identified are contacted by public health.  They are advised about the risk of exposure and of what they need to do.  If they have developed any symptoms, they are advised about them and about what they need to do.  They are also offered post-exposure vaccination to try to reduce the likelihood that they will develop monkeypox.  It is a very active component, and it needs to remain so.</p></speech>

However, again, there are people whose immune systems are down, pregnant women, children, etc.  Are there any long-term side effects in relation to it?</p></speech>

Scarring at the site of the skin lesions is something people report.  For individuals who have a large burden of scars on their faces, that can be difficult.  Scarring at the site of skin lesions is an issue.</p></speech>

That was really helpful.  The positive message is that the HSE is saying that it is on a downward spiral.  Hopefully, that will continue.  It is about people changing their behaviour.  That was the strong message that came out.  There are supports available.  With the vaccine and the increased use of it, we can hopefully deal with the crisis that exists.  There is a 45-bed isolation facility in place.  I think we have covered that.</p> <p>  We will now move onto the topic of long Covid.  I will kick off with questions from Senator Conway, who will have five minutes and I ask that he please try to keep to that.</p></speech>

I thank the HSE for that useful engagement earlier on.  Long Covid is a very serious issue.  I am sure the HSE will agree with me on that.  From looking through the statements, what concerns me are words to the effect that &ldquo;the HSE will deliver&rdquo; and &ldquo;we expect to expand the service&rdquo;.  Those phrases relate to the provision of services.  How many clinics are fully operational?</p></speech>

I raised this in the Seanad as a Commencement matter only approximately two or three weeks ago, and the reply that I got was very clear.  The phrases used were &ldquo;we plan to deliver&rdquo; and &ldquo;we expect to deliver&rdquo; and &ldquo;it is our intention to deliver&rdquo;.

I cannot for the life of me understand why this planning did not take place a year ago, because it was fairly clear in the early days of the pandemic that there were people who had lingering symptoms that were far beyond the period of ten days or two weeks.  I have engaged with people who have not yet gone back to work after two years because of Covid.  I engaged over the summer with a senior consultant who had to reduce his working hours because of the long-term effects of Covid.

There are significant numbers of people who are not right many weeks after infection.  We see a variety of symptoms, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, aches and pains and musculoskeletal.  In terms of our model of care, what we aim to offer, because we see such a variety of symptoms, is a one-stop shop for patients.   When patients present to one of the long Covid clinics, pretty much all of their needs be met under one roof.

The Senator asked about an operational clinic.  I would like to distinguish between a clinic that is up and running and a clinic that is appropriately staffed.  We are seeing patients although we may not have the full complement of staffing for a clinic.  I am more than happy to provide the Senator with the precise information.

Dr. John Lambert was before the committee some time ago.  He made the point that the research he has done, and others internationally have done, points to residual harm being caused by brain damage.  He suggested neurological factors were at play and said that should be the number one priority.  Is that built into the model of care at the moment?</p></speech>

As I said, of the 1,000 patients that I have seen, I would say that probably 20 of them need pulmonary support in the short term, but 1,000 of them needed neurological support.  I am not saying that there is not a need for cardiac and pulmonary physicians in some cases, I am saying that looking at the document [meaning the HSE plan], it states that tertiary-level care for neurorehabilitation is going to be part of the plan.  That should be prioritised as the number one issue. </blockquote> <p>Dr. Lambert's contention is that it is not being prioritised.</p></speech>

What that means is that we built it on the available evidence at the time.  We are now seeking additional evidence from HIQA and doing a study with our own health protection surveillance colleagues, looking at the epidemiology or the predicted numbers of people who may suffer from long Covid in an Irish context.  Our model of care is interim.  We will absolutely be updating that as more evidence becomes available.  I am meeting with Dr. Lambert next week to have further discussions in that regard.  We are very keen to develop-----</p></speech>

He said he found it difficult to get a meeting with the Minister and senior HSE officials.  My understanding is that he is running a long Covid clinic at the Mater hospital.  Is that right?

He seems to have expertise.  If I were in Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain's position, he would be somebody I would want to listen to and engage with.  There has been no shift or change in the model of care since September 2021 while the international research is evolving all the time.  It is evolving by the week, let alone how it has evolved since September 2021.  That is not good.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about immunocompromised patients, who are a very important cohort of people who have been largely forgotten.  I spoke to a blood cancer patient yesterday who said that she remains in the same situation we all entered when we went into lockdown in March 2020.  That is still her life at this time.  Many of those who contracted Covid also have long Covid.  I know there are issues around the Evusheld antibody drug.  What additional supports or plans are in place for patients who are immunocompromised?  What access is available to those antiviral and antibody medications such as Evusheld?  As Senator Conway said earlier, France and other countries seem to be well ahead of us and we seem to be well behind the curve.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

Evusheld is currently undergoing a health technology assessment, HTA.  It is still an investigational medication internationally.  The evidence in its favour does not yet fully support its use in this country.  It is undergoing that HTA and we expect the results of that in due course.  That has been advised by the medicines management programme.  There is a recently emerging body of evidence that it may not be so effective for patients who have more recent variants.  We are waiting for results before we subject our patients to medication that may cause other risks and damages.  I could not agree more with the Deputy that immunocompromised patients have had an enormously difficult time during the pandemic.</p></speech>

It may also be related to neurological issues at present.  To date, studies have not shown much in the way of structural abnormalities to the brain.

The fact that we are also not offering them care at a long Covid clinic seems out of step, certainly with the UK at least.

This is a very new infection.  We have experience with many other viruses such as glandular fever and the initial SARS outbreak, in which we saw a lot of post-infection sickness, malaise, tiredness and fatigue.  It is quite exciting that we have a specific diagnosis in a lot of individuals here.  We often see patients in clinics who have significant post-viral fatigue.  We primarily manage them holistically, try to get them on the road to recovery and support them in that.</p></speech>

We see patients with a constellation of symptoms.  A very wide variety of symptoms have been reported by patients to date.  Work has been done which shows that patients fall into particular clusters.  Many patients may be quite achy and have muscular pains while others will be tormented by brain fog and difficulties with memory, concentration and finding words.  Other patients have significant pulmonary issues either following admission to hospital or even without admission.  These symptoms fluctuate over time.  For some people, they will go away and be replaced by new symptoms.  For the most part, people will recover over time but that recovery is very difficult to anticipate.</p></speech>

I got Covid recently and I would not wish my worst enemy to constantly have those symptoms every day.  It is your worst nightmare.

It is obviously very serious because it affects people's mental health and overall well-being.

There is no evidence of a definitive treatment for the condition yet.  Dr. Bannan will say that some sort of supportive therapy works but there is no evidence for any definitive medication or any other particularly definitive treatment.  It is very important that we recognise other symptoms people might have, co-morbid symptoms such as anxiety or depression, and that those are treated appropriately.  However, internationally, there is not specific treatment for long Covid.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

It is about acknowledging patients' symptoms and that what they are going through is very important.  Early on in the pandemic, many patients felt they were being shut down and just told to get on with it.  It is really about acknowledging the condition and making sure that we are not missing anything else because patients may have heart failure that has been worsened by the Covid.  We are optimising underlying medical conditions, making sure that nothing new is emergent and supporting the patients on a path to recovery through holistic methods.</p></speech>

The field work for that is starting now.  The point of that is to determine the current health status of people who have been infected with Covid-19.  I can give the Deputy a much more detailed briefing on that and on our plan outside of this meeting but it is very hard to estimate.

This is complicated by the fact that we are seeing new variants, with which we are seeing different patterns of illness.  We also have to factor in the effect of vaccination and previous infection on the severity of disease in patients and on their subsequent recovery.</p></speech>

The advice we have had from our paediatric colleges, which we work very closely with, is that a very small number of children suffer from either post-viral illness or long Covid.  That said, the Deputy is right that we have all been approached by somebody whose child has been unwell but they are very small numbers from what we are of.</p></speech>

I want to follow on from Deputy Hourigan's question around children.  I am aware of a couple of cases.  I totally agree with what Deputy Gino Kenny said because I had it is as well and there is exhaustion as well as sickness.  If you had that exhaustion for a long time it really impacts you in every way and particularly your mental health.  For young people who suffer with long Covid it is not just about the loss of their health, which applies to everybody who has it, but their loss of time at school and the loss of their childhood, which is something they can never get back.  It takes a toll on their mental health.  I am concerned because we already know about the poor state of children's mental health services and the lack of help available for children.  I want to check whether our guests experienced any cases themselves or heard of any cases and if anything is being done at all about long Covid for children.</p></speech>

We have certainly been contacted by families of children and we advise them on the most appropriate direction of travel for them in their particular area and that particular child.  People of course contact us about that.  We have a national clinical adviser for children, Dr. Ciara Martin, and I keep in regular contact with her on how we manage it.  We are reviewing the evidence first.  The incidence of long Covid in children has been very small.  I have to be honest that the studies have also been very small, so it is difficult to extrapolate from that.  As I said to Deputy Hourigan and others, we are reliant on some of the information that comes to us from HIQA, which goes from newborns all the way up; there is no age limit.  We have heard of symptoms such as brain fog and other difficulties in children.  The clinical evidence we have - again I am reliant on my paediatric colleagues but I work closely with them - is children recover faster than adults and their symptoms tend to resolve quickly.  The Senator is right that we have experience of this in other areas, like glandular fever, as Dr. Bannan has mentioned.  Children and adolescents have prolonged symptoms from those conditions.  The recommended pathway developed by my clinical colleagues for children is that if they require specialist care after being seen by a general paediatrician, they can be referred on to the appropriate consultant - respiratory, cardiology and so on.</p></speech>

When we were developing the model of care we had much input from our colleagues in geriatric medicine.  That is my own specialty.  The Senator is probably aware of the development of the enhanced community care for older persons programme.  Many older people who have prolonged symptoms of Covid have other co-morbid conditions.  These could include respiratory disease, heart disease and frailty.  Those older people, especially those aged over 65 years, are far better dealt with in the enhanced community care geriatric programmes that have a multidisciplinary specialty team available to them, and we are rolling those out around the country.  The focus of those enhanced community care programmes for chronic disease in older persons is to provide an outreach-type service and to have it very widely available.  For most older people - and again I am speaking from my clinical background here - we generally advise referral to a geriatrician who would have a very wide scope of practice and be well able to manage the co-morbid conditions that may exist with long Covid.</p> <p>  I might ask Dr. Bannan about this.  Would it be fair to say we are not having a huge issue with persons aged over 65 years or 85 years presenting to the long Covid clinics, because we have the older persons clinic?</p></speech>

Most of those people have a sense of frustration.  They feel there is a lack of awareness of their situation.  Some are fairly critical of their GPs, that they are at a loss and do not really know what to do with these patients.  Medication has been provided that is unsuitable.  One person told me codeine was prescribed.  This person has had long Covid for the past two years.  It does not seem to be going away, and that person was concerned about the medication being recommended.  Another person with long Covid that I spoke to ended up getting clots on the lungs.  There was also an impact on the heart and muscle loss.  This person was told to avoid overexertion, because that could bring on a stroke or a heart attack.  We have, therefore, many people with different types of long Covid.  All of them are frustrated, though, by the lack of urgency.  In the context of some of the questions asked, it will have been heard that the clinics have been set up, but that they are not fully staffed.  This is one of the issues in this regard.</p><p> Another thing people were initially complaining about was that those with heart complaints were sent to heart specialists and those with lung complaints were sent to lung specialists, and the same happened with those with neurological complaints.  People were being sent to different specialists.  When Professor Jack Lambert appeared before the committee, he spoke about having a one-stop shop.  This would make sense, and I think this is what we are trying to do.  He was very complimentary of the British system which had brought all these elements together within a clinic setting.  The frustration expressed by Professor Lambert, and it is also expressed by other clinicians, concerns the fact that the British system has not developed from its initial positive start.  It has not learned from international practice since.  I refer again to the fact that we are still waiting on this report.  We do not know the extent of the challenge faced.</p><p> Is there more of a chance that people who have had Covid-19 multiple times will develop long Covid?  I know some people have had Covid-19 four times.  Is there more of a chance, therefore, of developing long Covid from having more infections?  The concern around other variants was mentioned.  For many of the people I spoke to, though, Omicron seemed to be the variant that had brought on long Covid in most cases where people had contacted me.  Some of the other variants are much milder, or, rather, the experience can be mild for one person, but strangely that does not necessarily mean the same thing will happen to another person.  Is there any evidence available in this regard?</p></speech>

He described some situations where people seem to have had some pretty horrific symptoms, including pain, if they require codeine.  I ask Dr. Bannan to comment on the evidence base for risk factors for developing long Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-12a.1439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Bannan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022101200002#N00300"><p>This is very much an evolving area.  The Omicron strain has only been with us for this year really and we do have people who have had multiple infections.  Ongoing research will help to determine whether subsequent infections pose a higher risk of contracting long Covid.  From what I have seen in the clinic to date, I feel that, for the majority of patients, subsequent episodes of Covid-19 tend to be milder than the initial symptoms and people often recover much faster than before.  It may be associated with a setback in their long Covid symptoms, but recovery is usually experienced quite quickly and those patients get back to their baseline faster.  This is, however, very much new evidence.  Time and ongoing experience will tell, from this perspective.</p></speech>

His wife and daughter have long Covid.  This is just one household.  The father-in-law ended up in ICU, but he does not have long Covid.  I presume there is some link in this regard.  Would it be unusual to have a case where a whole family has been impacted to some extent in this regard?  People are looking for answers.  Could this come down to the strain of the variant?</p></speech>

One thing we recognised early on in our clinic was that many of the pateints coming to us were not the patients who had gone through ICU.  Plenty of patients came back from the ICU some six to eight weeks later and told us they felt like new people and were 100% back to normal.  Other people then, who had mild Covid-19 infections, were hit hard by subsequent symptoms.  The severity of the initial infection, therefore, does not appear to be a major risk factor for the development of long Covid symptoms.  We are trying, as I said, to tease out what risk factors, be those genetic, gender or underlying conditions, are associated with the development of long Covid.  We know some of these already, and they include age, gender and underlying comorbidities.</p></speech>

An attempt was made to try to drain those clots, and this, in itself, had an impact.  This person is taking about 20 different tablets daily.  It is frightening that someone who did not experience any initial symptoms has now had their heart and lungs affected.  In this unusual situation, the experts here do not seem to be able to come up with solutions and people look abroad for expertise.  I get the sense that some countries are probably more advanced regarding this issue.  We are still trying to compile a report regarding symptoms and the number of people affected.  Other countries seem to be much more advanced.  People listening to us at home, and some may not be at the extreme end of this experience, will be hoping there will be a stream to cater for individuals in this situation.  We heard earlier there is no such stream for children.  As a layperson, I would imagine we would have had a stream for children if this condition is impacting them as well.  This is also probably a recommendation that will arise.</p> <p>  To return to what I said at the start, frustration seems to arise because many people impacted have been in this situation for two years and we are only now getting around to producing a report and to putting the clinic together.  This is the frustration I am trying to express.  It is not a criticism of the witnesses.  I understand the delays in respect of trying to recruit people, etc.  I am highlighting the frustration felt by the patients in this situation, in this limbo.  They are going to their GPs or trying to get to specialists, and so on, but they seem to be getting moved around.  Not only are they getting a sense that they are not being listened to, but no one seems to have the answers and these answers may not exist.</p></speech>

The single most important message we would like to get out as clinicians, as most of us here are, is that most people do recover over time.  This is the single most important message.  Several experts in long Covid and infectious diseases around the country have advised, including Dr. Bannan, that this is the single most important aspect.  A second point is that the small numbers of people with those specific symptoms, such as lung clotting, for example, would need a combination of specialist treatments from a haematology specialist and possibly a lung specialist.  We do have experts here who can provide this care.  Thankfully, these cases are rare, although we have heard of them, and specialist care is available.</p> <p>  It is important to return to the point regarding long Covid clinics being staffed by infectious diseases consultants.  Within hospital settings, if patients need care from another specialist, that is available.  These pathways are there.  If Dr. Bannan, for example, feels he needs the advice of a cardiologist or respiratory consultant, he will pick up the phone and say he is going to refer a patient.  We do, therefore, have these pathways within hospital settings for people with these complex, but rare, complications.</p></speech>

I suppose people are looking for that team, whether it be neurology, lungs or heart.  The team comes together and one gets a better sense of the care path for that individual.  That is what the ideal will be in the future.  I have probably talked enough.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right on this.  It is a matter of concern that with a condition that is so new, we are working to guidelines that are 13 months old.  I accept what was said on HIQA being commissioned to do a study.  There is a vast amount of research that has been done internationally.  What is the mechanism for learning from that research and adjusting the approach?  For example, what country has demonstrated best practice in relation to the treatment of long Covid?</p></speech>

In individual clinical practice, we are continually informed by best evidence.  Our interim model of care is to set up a service.  That does not change the fact that individual clinicians who are operating at the coalface will not use the best available evidence to treat somebody.  It is important that a model looks at what we are trying to do from a service-wide point of view, however, a clinical guideline will be continually looked at.  The clinical evidence-----</p></speech>

We are only two years into the disease.  From a pulmonary point of view, we have people who have scarring in their lungs as a result of ICU admissions and being on a ventilator for a prolonged period.

I have ongoing concerns about the approach that has been taken.  The other issue, of course, is capacity.  If somebody goes to a clinic and that person has a particular, say, heart problem or brain fog or whatever, there is a referral pathway.  That may well be the case, but they will join a waiting list to see a neurologist or a cardiologist.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

In theory, there is a referral pathway.  However, the reality for many people is that they will be left suffering from a long Covid condition for a very long time because of lack of capacity.  Presumably, it kind of three or four months post Covid before somebody goes to or is referred to a clinic.</p></speech>

We know that 1.6 million people in Ireland have had Covid.  That is just the diagnosed people, so it is presumably an underestimate.  Even if the percentage suffering from long Covid is small, we are still talking about very big numbers.  I do not have the confidence from what I am hearing today that there is the capacity there to address that issue.  Obviously, if there are waiting lists of five months, there is not an adequate capacity.</p> <p>  Dr. N&iacute; Bhriain said their funding is secured.  Is that secured for the existing service or is there is a stretch in that, if they have to gear up and recruit significant numbers of additional health professionals?</p></speech>

That certainly will not preclude us from making a business case if we need further services in the national service plan next year &ndash; absolutely not.

One of the major caveats of medicine is to first, do no harm.  Any new treatments will need to be in the context of a controlled clinical trial basis and we would be looking to collaborate internationally with organisations on that.

This is quite frustrating.  There is a huge amount of research ongoing and we are looking to determine what is responsible for the ongoing symptoms.</p></speech>

Her research is at the cutting edge of identifying, first the existence of neuro-cognitive disorder and then the management of it.  I have to go back to what Dr. Bannan said when he said no structural abnormalities, that refers to when one does a brain scan very frequently and there is nothing on the brain scan to say what exactly the problem is.  We think from emerging evidence that neuro-cognitive strategies are probably going to be the best in managing some of those symptoms.  This is very cutting edge and very early research and we are fortunate that the person we have is actually the most qualified person in the country for that post.  But it is very early stages in the management of that.</p></speech>

I think that people are saying there are key elements of the teams that are missing and maybe some need to be beefed up more than others.  The brain fog would not be unusual for anyone who comes out of a serious operation.  It is quite common in that sense.  The scary thing for a lot of people is that we all know someone in that situation.  The anecdotal evidence is that a lot of people seem to be suffering from it.  I know people who lost their sense of taste or smell and it has never really come back.  If you lose your sense of taste, it is a huge thing.</p> <p>  As for the other elements, the psychological fatigue, the number of people who are front-line workers who are now out sick, we are talking about people, some of whom have not been able to go back to work.  There is a huge cost involved to being sick in Ireland.  Are there any recommendations on medical card access?  Do the witnesses expect that to come out of the HIQA report on this issue?  If you are looking to avail of all this expertise, it is quite expensive and just being in hospital is quite expensive in Ireland.</p></speech>

The review we have commissioned is on what are existing models of care in other jurisdictions and how our models of care align with those models of care.  Consequently, it is very clinically oriented.  But the principle behind developing any of the services is that it is in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and that people are entitled to this access.  I would be going outside my area of expertise as a clinician to talk too much about other recommendations.  My job is very much focused on the clinical side.  We can certainly ask those questions for the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

Could we get figures as to how many dedicated staff there are in the long Covid-19 system from witnesses at some stage?  This is their homework.  Where they are based and how many we hope to see working in total?  Lastly, what is the clinical definition of long Covid that allows healthcare professionals to diagnose and refer people?  There is acute Covid-19 and long Covid-19.  Anecdotal evidence from some GPs is that they have difficulty as they are not familiar enough with it.  Our guests might also give additional information on how GPs are being kept abreast of developments in the field.  That also would be useful.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe might note the meeting is coming to an end.</p></speech>

I have two essential questions.  I had a meeting yesterday with Colette Cowan, chief executive of the University Limerick Hospitals Group.  I understand there will be some capacity-building in that hospital group in terms of long Covid-19 and treatment of same.  I hope the witnesses can give some detail on that if it is available.  The Chairman has just asked about quantifying long Covid and its symptoms.  As it is such a broad spectrum, has the HSE had much engagement with Medmark or other similar workplace health screening bodies?  I ask because it has been an issue for some people whose employer wanted to know how it was they cannot present back to work.  As Covid-19 manifests itself and is symptomatic in many different ways, has the HSE given clear guidance and does it have communication lines open?  I have just named one body but it could be any referral body like that.</p></speech>

That has been a particular challenge to recruit to.  There was initially a challenge in recruiting a general infectious diseases post there.  We were looking to recruit to that and to the specialist long Covid-19 clinic.  Talking to Ms Cowan and our colleagues, we are planning to run that service - I think through a newly-appointed person - but there is a plan to run it through the infectious diseases clinic while awaiting the appointment of the infectious specialist consultant in long Covid.</p></speech>

They certainly led the public response to Covid-19 but now a lot of people in the workplace find themselves being referred on to private health screening bodies.</p><p>It was important that we had very clear, centralised advice all the way through the pandemic.  It is important also that whatever information we have centrally in Ireland, or, indeed, from colleagues overseas, particularly in Europe, would be shared with any such body that would be screening employees returning to the workplace or remaining out of the workplace as the case may be.  It is a struggle for some people and it manifests itself in different ways.  It could be a sniffle for one person but it could floor another person for months and months.  This is the problem with long Covid.  Sometimes what cannot be seen is not always understood, measured or signed off on.  That is something that people are struggling with.</p></speech>
