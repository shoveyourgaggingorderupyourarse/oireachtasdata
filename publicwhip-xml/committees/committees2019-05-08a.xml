I thank them for making themselves available to the committee today.  We are meeting the representatives of the National Competitiveness Council to discuss its latest report that came out in April entitled Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  Our committee is beginning its scrutiny hearings for budget 2020 and we have already issued a call for pre-budget submissions.  It is extremely useful to hear evidence from groups like the National Competitiveness Council on the general economic position and current competitive challenges that face our economy. </p><p>Before I ask the delegation to make an opening statement, I draw witnesses' attention to the position of privilege which applies to all witnesses.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I again thank the delegation for attending and invite Professor Clinch to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Dr. Marie Bourke who is head of the council's secretariat and Mr. Manus O'Donnell who is an economist with the council's secretariat.  As the Chairman has said, we recently published the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2019 report that sets out how Ireland is performing on a cost-competitive basis relative to competitor jurisdictions.  A copy of the report has been circulated to the committee.  I look forward to discussing our report this afternoon.  I also intend referring to the research and recommendations to Government in the council's annual report entitled Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2018 that we published last December.</p> <p>  The National Competitiveness Council was established by Government in 1997 as part of the Partnership 2000 agreement.  The council reports to the Taoiseach and the Government through the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy.  We offer recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland's competitive position.</p> <p>  In accordance with the European Council recommendation of September 2016 on the establishment of national productivity boards by euro area countries, in March 2018  the Government designated the council as the body responsible for analysing developments and policies in the field of productivity and competitiveness in Ireland.  The council serves as an independent voice.  In an advisory capacity to Government, it offers recommendations on areas to improve competitiveness and productivity.  The council members serve in a voluntary capacity.  They are appointed by the Minister and drawn from civil society.  These members have an interest in and an understanding of the factors that affect competitiveness and what might improve them.   </p> <p>  The work of the council is underpinned by research and analysis providing an evidence base for its policy recommendations.  Each year, in accordance with our terms of reference, we publish a number of reports as follows: the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report is a statistical report that benchmarks key business costs and highlights areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors; Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard provides a comprehensive statistical assessment of Ireland's competitiveness performance, including a wider range of metrics and indicators other than costs; Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge uses the information generated in the reports to outline the main challenges to Irish competitiveness; and we produce a productivity statement that tracks the productivity performance of the Irish economy.  We also produce a series of short two or three-page competitiveness bulletins, submissions and other papers on specific competitiveness issues such as electricity, insurance, legal and rankings.  In the past the council has made submissions to the Action Plan for Jobs and, more recently, the plan called Future Jobs 2019. </p> <p>  Ireland's ability to compete in international trade and sell our goods and services abroad is a key determinant of our wages, living standards and ability to finance social services like health, social protection and education.  It allows our economy to be a successful member of the eurozone and withstand the shocks that are beyond our control.  Competitiveness is part of the DNA of sustainable jobs.  If we want to provide and sustain good, well-paid jobs for our citizens and ensure that these are sustainable then maintaining our competitive edge is crucial.</p> <p>  Competitiveness is a complex concept and results from many factors.  Along with labour-force participation, two of the principal factors determining competitiveness performance are productivity and cost-competitiveness.  In the medium term productivity improvement will be the primary driver of competitiveness, employment, wages, living standards and the financing of public services.</p><p> Costs are a key element of national competitiveness.  Maintaining cost competitiveness is critical to the overall competitiveness of firms based in Ireland and to maintain the virtuous circle between the cost of living, productivity growth and wage rates.  If costs in Ireland are too high relative to productivity, it damages Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and threatens jobs.  Irish businesses would find it more difficult to export and internationally mobile firms would be disincentivised from locating here.  Ultimately, prohibitive costs would make international trade and investment more expensive, reducing the economy&rsquo;s beneficial exposure to the international economy.  To be competitive, however, an economy does not need to be low-cost if it can find ways to boost productivity.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s overall economic performance indicates that we are continuing to maintain a strong competitiveness position.  The recovery has continued apace.  Economic growth is strong and unemployment is relatively low.  This is very good news.  However, as the economy continues to grow, ensuring our model is sustainable and balanced takes on even more significance.  The risks to Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity are increasing.  International economic uncertainty and the return to protectionist trade policies in certain key global economies, along with developments in US tax policy and an evolving international tax landscape, pose a threat to our future economic growth and stability.  Domestically, a fraction of firms provide the major part of Ireland&rsquo;s productivity performance, value added, exports and corporate tax receipts, disguising the majority of underperforming firms where productivity growth is stagnant or falling.  The narrow range of exporters, products and services exported, and the reliance on a small number of export markets, pose serious concerns.</p><p> The vulnerabilities in the fabric of the economy, coupled with the challenging global environment, endanger the hard-won medium-term sustainability of our economy.  It has never been more important in the economic life of our country that we recognise these vulnerabilities, and that government policy strengthens our productivity performance and competitiveness to secure Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity.</p><p> The council tracks the three main international competitiveness indicators for Ireland.  While Ireland still ranks highly in these indices, we have been falling down the rankings in recent years.  In the 2018 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook Report, Ireland is ranked 12th, a fall of six places on the 2017 rankings.  In addition, Ireland fell six places from 17th to 23rd in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report 2019.  Ireland is ranked 23rd out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report.</p><p> The council&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge report, published in December 2018, identifies a range of recommendations that address both immediate competitiveness issues, and more medium-term challenges aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity performance.  As in previous years, the council has sought to strike a balance between addressing issues that are well-known, housing, climate action and the availability of talent, with challenges that are emerging, such as traffic congestion, and the combined hidden costs of proposed regulation, for example the new water tariff regime, water abstraction, work-life balance and pension reform.  Three overarching themes are considered to address what I have just raised: ensuring the sustainability of the economic model; maintaining cost competitiveness; and narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest.  We may be able to talk about these later.</p><p> The council published the Cost of Doing Business in Ireland report on 12 April.  As mentioned, the report has two main aims: to flag any areas where business costs in Ireland are out-of-line with our international competitors; and to build the evidence base for the next competitiveness challenge document, which makes recommendations regarding those areas of policy emphasis to deal with competitiveness issues.  The report achieves this by benchmarking the costs of doing business in Ireland relative to international competitors using the latest available data on various cost indicators.  It is a statistical exercise.  The report describes the overall cost profile in Ireland as "high-cost, slowly increasing".  In 2018, prices in Ireland increased by 0.7%.  This was the slowest rate of inflation of all euro area economies, and it was the joint slowest rate of price increases in the EU.  Inflation was faster than in previous years, but still well below the price growth rate for the euro area as a whole and the UK.  Our low growth being below comparator countries is very welcome from a cost-competitiveness perspective.  However, we note that Ireland remains an expensive location.  So, while average prices are increasing slowly, they are doing so from a comparatively high base.  We need to avoid too much focus on averages.</p><p> The report identifies a number of emerging pressure points in our economy which have the potential to significantly erode our competitiveness further.  The major cost factors for Irish businesses are labour costs, the rental price of commercial property, interest rates and the continued increase in insurance costs.  Labour costs are broadly in line with the euro area average but above those in the UK.  They grew by 2.9% in 2018, four times faster than the rate of inflation.  Labour costs vary considerably between different sectors in Ireland.  The latest EUROSTAT data show that labour costs in certain sectors of our economy are also out of line with UK and euro area.  For example, labour costs in the utility sector are &euro;53 per hour in Ireland compared with &euro;37 per hour in the UK and &euro;48 per hour in the euro area.  In the ICT sector, labour costs are &euro;47 per hour in Ireland, &euro;35 per hour in the UK and &euro;41 per hour in the euro area.  In 2018 in most sectors of the economy labour costs were greater than, or equal to, those in the UK.  Hourly labour costs in Ireland grew by 6.1%, 4.5% and 4.3% in the ICT, construction and financial sectors, respectively, compared with 4.1%, 5.4% and 2.4% in the UK.</p><p> Residential property prices are now roughly where they were at the start of 2005.  The average rent in Dublin was &euro;1,527 in quarter 1 of 2018.  Rents have been growing since 2013 and have been increasing by over 5% per annum for the past four years.  Over the past year, there has also been a steady increase in commercial property prices and the cost of constructing office space.  In 2018, the construction cost per square metre of a prime office building in Dublin was $3,065, lower than in London but above that which applies in cities such as Amsterdam and Munich.  In the office rental market, in the past five years prices have increased by 15.9% in Dublin suburbs and by 16.5% in Galway.</p><p> In recent years, aggregate transport sector prices in Ireland have increased moderately.  In 2018, the average prices per litre of petrol and diesel were &euro;1.43 and &euro;1.34, respectively.  Over the course of 2018, petrol prices increased by 2.8% and the price of diesel increased by 4.6%.  Traffic has increased across the road network and traffic congestion in the cities has worsened as highlighted by the fact that 11% of all commuters spent an hour or more commuting to work in 2017, the most recent data available.  At the same time the congestion level in Dublin was higher than major European cities such as London, Paris and Brussels.  This is a form of hidden inflation which is not picked up in price indexes.</p><p> Utility prices have fallen due to the reduction in global oil prices.  Electricity prices in Ireland have fallen since the first half of 2014 but in the first six months of 2018 remained higher than the UK and euro area average.  Similarly, gas prices here have also fallen since the first six months of 2014.  However, the fall was lower than in the euro area and the UK, which points to a relative competitiveness loss.</p><p> Businesses in Ireland face higher interest rates than the average business in the euro area.  The cost of credit remains very high compared with the euro average.  In 2014, Irish companies faced a similar interest rate, 3%, to counterparts in Germany and France, whereas now the rate is higher for Irish companies at 3.3% and lower in those economies at 2%.  This means that Irish businesses face costs that are 65% higher than their EU counterparts.</p><p> The service sector continues to be the main source of upward price pressure, as it has continued to rise since early 2015.  The CSO services producer price index, which measures changes in the average level of prices charged by producers, shows that prices for a range of business services, such as freight transport, postal and courier activities, computer programming and consultancy, legal, accounting, advertising and market research services have been increasing in Ireland.  In the year to 2018, service producer prices increased by 3.1% in Ireland and were 7% higher relative to 2015.  In comparison, the corresponding figures for euro area were 1% and 1.8%.</p><p> The average tax rate for those earning the average income is low compared with other OECD countries.  However, the marginal rate for a person earning the average wage is the second highest marginal tax rate at 49% among the high-income OECD countries.  The council acknowledges the measure introduced in budget 2019 which raised the entry point for the higher rate of income tax from &euro;34,550 to &euro;35,300 for a single worker.  We must continue to reform our tax system and make it internationally competitive so that Ireland continues to attract highly qualified talent to these shores.</p><p> The Cost of Doing Business in Ireland 2019 report gathers information and provides a snapshot of the cost profile in Ireland.  It is a significant input into the subsequent analysis of policy implications and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, which are included in our report, Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge, published annually.  In the challenge report we published last December, these were addressed under the theme of maintaining cost competitiveness, along with other recommendations to address the challenges under the other two themes of: ensuring the sustainability of the economic model; and narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest.</p><p> Some of the key recommendations relating to cost competitiveness, included in the report, relate to: measures to address housing affordability through the intensified delivery of housing supply measures in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan; expediting the implementation of the recommendations from the cost of insurance working group; the need to develop sectoral-level data on water and waste; and the development of a more comprehensive and representative data set on the cost of legal services.</p><p> I acknowledge the Government's commitment to improving Ireland&rsquo;s productivity and competitiveness through various policies and initiatives including the actions to be progressed in 2019 in the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland initiative.</p><p>The council welcomes publication by the Government of the plan and believes it will be an important policy document in framing enterprise and economic policy in the years ahead.  The council will continue to advocate for competitiveness and productivity to be central pillars of economic policy.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members for affording the council the opportunity to meet them.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

The one issue about which I did not see much discussion is the cost of insurance.  It is raised in the media again today in the context of the cancellation of a major festival.  Does Professor Clinch have figures for the rising cost of insurance?  As I read somewhere in the report that the cost of insurance was decreasing, will he elaborate on the matter?  It is not the widely held view, particularly among businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Clinch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019050800002#H00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The cost of insurance has been a major issue for the National Competitiveness Council for a number of years.  In 2016 we were out of the blocks very early in saying there was a problem.  We produced a bulletin entitled, Action Required to Address Insurance Cost Competitiveness, in which we highlighted all of the main issues that we saw.  We made a series of recommendations in the report about assigning greater priority to improving insurance cost competitiveness and creating a comprehensive benchmark for insurance costs in order that we could see what was happening.  </p> <p>  The Deputy had asked about the data.  The bulletin argued that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, should be properly empowered to collect the required claims data in order that we could properly assess what was happening.  There was also mention of non-attendance for medicals.  We spoke much about the reform of the legal profession and how it could contribute to the reduction in insurance costs.  The cost of insurance working group was established afterwards.  We have since mentioned in our challenge reports the implementation of recommendations in the first phase in respect of motor, employer's and public liability insurance.  We have also made recommendations on some of the other reports that were produced at the same time.</p> <p>  In the case of motor insurance, Central Statistics Office, CSO, data suggest prices increased rapidly from 2015, peaking in quarter 3 of 2016.  They demonstrate that they have since dropped.  According to the most recent figures, the cost of motor insurance was 4% higher than in 2015.  Taken together, that represents a 32% increase since 2013, which is dramatic.  When compared with prices elsewhere in the European Union, prices in Ireland increased much faster from 2013 to their peak in 2016.  Therefore, the rate of price increases has been much greater than in other areas.</p> <p>  I can speak about a series of other recommendations if the committee so desires, but there is a difficulty.  It was not mentioned in our cost of doing business report because it was a statistical exercise and we use international data to compare costs here with those in our international competitors.  We use the best available data, but the problem is there are many data limitations with respect to insurance costs.  In the absence of official statistics we do not want to publish data that are not correct.  We only have that overall motor insurance picture.  We have set out a series of recommendations for how the data could be improved in order t hat we could make better judgments.  The anecdotes suggest insurance costs are a big problem.  We have certainly demonstrated that the cost of motor insurance has been a big problem which has only just started to top out.</p></speech>

I also mentioned vulnerability in the economy.  For the four and a half years I have been chairman of the council it has been pushing heavily on the productivity picture.  Originally we did not have data to demonstrate clearly the problem we had.  Approximately the top 10% of firms in Ireland account for 80% of the added value in manufacturing and 94% in services.  The top 15 commodities account for 90% of the total goods exported from Ireland.  The top 100 traders account for 80% of exports value, with 10% of firms accounting for 90% of productivity.  As I stated, we are flying on one big engine and must work strongly on the smaller engine.</p> <p>  In our challenge we place particular emphasis on narrowing the productivity gap between the best and the rest, which is our third theme.  We focus very heavily on the challenges facing small firms which are the least likely to be able to invest in the management talent they need to make good decisions.  They are also the least likely to be able to invest in having a good strategy and company training, which is incredibly important for productivity.  They are least likely to be able to invest in research and development.  There is also a hangover from the crisis as firms deleverage because they have run up large debts; it is arguable that they are not taking on enough debt to invest in the activities that would help them to develop.</p> <p>  We focus on the presence of the talent pipeline, in particular, and ensuring there can be such a pipeline in the higher and further education areas.  This concerns support for low-skilled workers who are at risk of displacement by changing technology to retrain and upskill through the apprenticeship system.  There is also a heavy focus on digital skills, as approximately half the population are not suitably equipped with digital skills.  That is a threat not only to our firms today but also to employment in the future.  It is a significant area of policy that we have emphasised for the Government.</p> <p>  There should be investment in infrastructure, an area in which we have lagged behind somewhat in comparison with other countries, although Project Ireland 2040 will result in much more infrastructure being built.  What is of concern in that respect is the very low level of productivity in the construction sector.  There are also delays and I am sure there will be mention of the national broadband plan.  The delay in bringing broadband to towns is particularly challenging for smaller companies.</p> <p>  We have made specific recommendations on top of the more general recommendations.  We have recommended that the Government produce a productivity action plan.  It has been referred to in the Future Jobs Ireland 2019 plan and we are very pleased that has been taken on board.  The plan should be developed further through the agencies in order to reduce our reliance on a small number of companies.  We have also recommended aligning Ireland's capital gains tax entrepreneur relief which is aimed at entrepreneurs running companies so as to extend the lifetime limit of &euro;1 million to &euro;10 million on gains made in disposing of business assets.  That would give smaller companies a greater fighting chance.  An implementation plan should be prepared to intensify business research and development activity and there should be regular reviews of the barriers and enablers to increase investment in what we call knowledge-based capital but what is essentially innovation and research and development.  We should also strengthen links between indigenous companies and multinationals.  We have seen a decline in the spillover of knowledge from very high-end companies to the following companies.</p><p>We are not the only country where this is happening but we are a highly globalised economy and because of that we are quite reliant on this small number of large companies.  There was always a reliance in the economy but we are very reliant upon a small number.  We have also asked to review the effectiveness of the global sourcing initiative.  This is the initiative that helps to introduce indigenous companies to those buyers from the multinational companies in order to create better and stronger linkages between our excellent multinational sector of large companies and our smaller companies.  Those are our main recommendations for areas where Government needs to enhance policy.</p></speech>

Childcare is a big one and the cost of childcare compared to our European counterparts is significantly higher.  Government after Government has said it is an issue we need to address but we never seem to address it.  How much of a barrier is it and what impact can it have on our competitiveness into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Clinch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019050800002#J00500"><p>There are many things that affect competitiveness but if we want to break it down there are two main drivers of competitiveness, namely labour force participation and productivity.  The Deputy has covered both in his question.  Childcare is something the council identified early.  Our contributions on childcare were reflected in the affordable childcare scheme that was then rolled out by Government.  It is essential, not only for productivity but also to create an equitable society and to create thriving and sustainable communities.  We have looked at the evidence around the importance of quality childcare for long lasting benefits for children, women, families, the economy and society at large so it is even bigger than the competitiveness story as the Deputy knows very well.  It is essentially a major indirect cost to business when people have to pay for it and it is leading to difficulties in attracting and retaining staff; to the loss of skilled labour in the economy; and, to people leaving the workforce because there is a lot of churn in the workforce.</p> <p>  Our data show that the average cost of childcare varies considerably across the regions and across the types of childcare used.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and Pobal data show that childcare costs are particularly high in Dublin, east Leinster and other urban areas, relative to the rest of the country.  The average hourly cost of childcare for a single child, depending on the type of childcare, is as follows: for a childminder in the family home it is &euro;6.13 per hour; for a childminder outside the home it is &euro;4.76 per hour; and, for centre-based care it is &euro;4.82 per hour.  The data also show that mothers facing higher childcare costs work fewer hours.  They may have a job but they will work fewer hours.  Also, a 10% increase in childcare costs is associated with 30 minutes less paid work by mothers per week.  The relationship can be seen very clearly there to answer the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  The high costs and limited accessibility of quality childcare are generally attributed to childhood poverty and lower female labour market participation rates.  For couples earning 167% of the average wage, Ireland is the second most expensive country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, for childcare-related expenses and for lone parents earning 67% of the average wage, Ireland is the most expensive OECD location so it is a significant effect on our competitiveness.</p> <p>  The single affordable childcare scheme was welcome in providing subsidies with the aim of replacing existing non-statutory childcare schemes and providing subsidies to parents of preschool children.  Those targeted subsidies are payable for children up to six months of age.  The continuation of a universal subsidy is to be payable for children between the age of six and 36 months.  The key point here is that there is a plan.  It needs to be rolled out and implemented as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We have had to develop a new measure of the economy, namely GNI* because of the distortions created by their predominance.  I put it to Professor Clinch that we need a "productivity*" measure of Irish productivity because we cannot rely in any shape or form on the productivity figures as they are so distorted.  I would like to hear Professor Clinch's comment on it.  Is any work being done on some kind of accurate measure of productivity that strips out the distorting effects of those companies and gives us a real measure of productivity?</p></speech>

We could have sat there thinking we look great when the numbers came out on our overall productivity level.  We are right up the top of the class in how good our performance is on labour productivity particularly.  To be fair to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, they were very supportive of us when we argued strongly to encourage the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to produce more detailed data that would allow us strip out multinationals.  It is not just multinationals however, we should say leading companies because for example, in the food sector and in pharma we have large, successful companies so it is not quite as simple as foreign versus domestic.  Let us say it is close to that but we give credit to some of the Irish companies.  We have stripped that out so that we can look at the figures on productivity and I will give the Deputy a couple of those.  Labour productivity in foreign dominated sectors grew by almost 140% between 2000 and 2014.  That is a 6.5% annual figure but when we look at the domestic and other sectors, it saw an increase in productivity of just 50% over the same period.  That is 140% compared to 50%.  What is even more disturbing now is that we are seeing declining or stagnant productivity in most of the non-leading companies.  As I said, what is seen is essentially 90% of our productivity performance driven by 10% of the firms.  We have the data to show the issue.  The question is how do we start to address that problem.</p></speech>

If research and development tax relief is taken as an example, the vast bulk of that is going to a tiny number of firms as against any real benefit to the domestic sector.  Would Professor Clinch agree with that?  How radical is the shift that we need on that?</p></speech>

My first response is not to switch off that engine until the other one is firing strongly.  That is how I would answer it in a colloquial sense.  Inward investment will always be a major part of our economic model and it has been hugely successful in importing productivity into Ireland.  It is the case that our productivity levels elsewhere in the economy among our domestic firms would be worse if we had not had the investment of those countries over the years and if those companies had not been provided with the incentives to do so.  They do not need to be mutually exclusive.  It will always be beneficial.  All of the research suggests that having a strong, innovation-intensive sector that is highly skilled not only provides a valuable sector to corporate taxes and so on in itself but it also results in spillovers to the other companies as people move back and forth between large companies and small companies.</p><p>Dell was an interesting example of a company that went out of business eventually and was probably at the lower-skilled end yet it produced some fantastic people who have gone on to set up other companies.  That sector is important, therefore, and it is important to support it.  Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct that the other sector also needs to be supported strongly in being able to use some of these incentives, such as tax credits, to invest in innovation, research and design, talent and in-company training.  There is much policy in this area, with Enterprise Ireland working hard to support that sector and send people on management training programmes to give them the types of information they need.  In the case of Brexit, for example, they can be helped to develop the types of supply chains that might help to protect them from Brexit and to open new markets.  There are many different schemes available to help them to do that.  The one area I consider difficult is the large proportion of employment which is provided by companies with two or three people and which might not even be internationally traded.  It is very hard to persuade those people, who work long hours to keep their business going, to take time off to think about their strategy, how they will retrain and so on.  As a council, we continually examine models from elsewhere to show what could be done in that area but it remains a challenge and there is no easy answer.</p></speech>

While that is a broad brush-stroke comment, we need a hell of a lot more money to be invested in our universities and we need to develop and tailor our education system, without making it a completely utilitarian education system because I do not like that either.  Much higher levels of investment in that regard are nonetheless part of the answer.</p> <p>  Professor Clinch suggested that prices have not risen a great deal, although he is slightly worried about labour cost increases.  To what extent does he believe that labour cost increases relate to particular costs that workers are incurring?  Notwithstanding Professor Clinch's more general comment that prices are not rising, he has identified high costs in particular areas.</p></speech>

Housing costs are off the charts.  Childcare has been identified and the professor pointed out that transport is another area where there has been a consistent rise in costs, which seems to go against any attempt to deal with climate change or congestion.  How does Professor Clinch expect those areas to be addressed?  Workers have no choice but to make pay demands if they cannot meet those costs.  In all those areas, it seems the market is just not capable of reducing those costs.  In housing, it is clear the market is not reducing costs and there is no sign it will do so in the near future.  I do not see how transport costs will fall if they are left to the market, while I do not see, realistically, how childcare costs will decrease.  Does Professor Clinch agree that is the case, and if so, what are we going to do about it?  Do we have to invest far higher levels of subsidy in these areas if we are to reduce those costs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Clinch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019050800002#K00500"><p>It is a good question.  I should be clear that while the overall price level is low, part of our job is to ensure we do not just consider averages, as in the case of productivity.  The main pinch points are in the areas of housing, traffic congestion, private transport, childcare and several others, which we have pointed out.  The Deputy is correct that an enormous current challenge for policy is how to reduce the cost of living, which is difficult because the Government does not have control over all prices and markets are at work.  The danger is that when one intervenes in the market and introduces subsidies, prices will be driven up further, meaning that the consumer will not benefit.  We should always be careful, therefore, about the intervention we make to ensure that will not happen.</p> <p>  To control prices, we have considered measures where the Government can make a difference.  It controls prices in areas such as water, postal services and road and rail transport.  There is some control in that regard and they are mainly administered prices.  There are also hidden areas of prices, such as in the planning system and so on, where the Government can make a difference.  We tend to examine matters such as what reduces efficiencies.  In the case of legal fees, for example, the evidence suggests that Ireland has higher prices relative to other jurisdictions.  We recommended that the Government examine conflict resolution systems in countries with a similar judicial system to find whether there are ways to speed up tasks in commercial disputes.  We have also recommended expediting the recommendations of the review of the administration of civil justice when it is released.</p> <p>  We spoke about insurance costs in 2016 and produced a bulletin on it.  Establishing the cost of insurance working group and subsequent ones will make a difference, although we are still waiting for more recommendations to emerge.  While access to credit is difficult, it is a big issue for business more than the consumer, although it is an issue for the consumer in respect of mortgages and loans.  A significant hangover of the financial crisis affects access to credit.  At one stage, access was difficult but now the cost of credit is much higher.  We have pushed the Government hard to increase the range of financing options for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and to create awareness of matters such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, whose credit guarantee scheme can help.  Ultimately, the only way to push prices down in areas such as housing is to increase the level of construction, of which Rebuilding Ireland is a major and important part.  The council would not go as far as to recommend directly whether there should be more State intervention, but we must always bear in mind that some of those models and experiences have not always worked so well.</p> <p>  Overall, the Deputy is correct.  As we have outlined repeatedly, to have a successful, sustainable economy, without such wage growth that it cannot be sustained in the economy, as happened in the run-up to the crisis, we must ensure that it is underpinned by productivity and keep the costs of living down.  The Deputy is correct that housing costs are one of the major factors in driving wage rates.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked but I will elaborate on them.  The various issues raised, analysed and scrutinised by the council to compare and contrast Ireland with international norms of taxation, transport and other issues are fine, and the council stated the economy is performing reasonably well, save for some labour cost worries.  That leads me to believe that the council is examining mainly large manufacturing industry and business.  As my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, indicated in an earlier question, the examples and representations we receive on the ground relate to SMEs in the main, that is, those in the service industry or selling their wares within their local economy and region.  I refer to hotels, bars and leisure centres.</p><p>The big issue for them is insurance.  Insurance is crippling small industries and putting them out of business.  I would have thought and expected that any reports about competitiveness in this country, carried out by any body, would have at its core major recommendations on insurance.  I am somewhat surprised that that is not the case.  I am aware that Professor Clinch has said that he provided a previous report that fed into the body that in turn made recommendations to the Government.  We are doing our best to help the Government by bringing forward relevant legislation to address that issue.  It has to be at the forefront of every report compiled by those who say they represent business.  Is there any part of the professor's role that deals directly with smaller businesses?  Does he carry out relevant and necessary research, including questionnaires and focus groups?  If not, why not?  That is the feedback we are getting, and we want the professor to respond to the concerns of that group.  It leads me to believe that there is an over-focus on one section of the economy while small indigenous businesses that are selling here are ignored.  That leapt out at me from this report.  Can the Professor respond, assuring us and those we represent that he is as committed to and as worried about the impact of the cost of insurance for people doing business?  It affects the industries I have mentioned, and the next phase will concern education and school facilities and festivals in towns and regions which communities depend upon to kickstart the tourist season, among other things.  </p></speech>

We are absolutely not focused solely on the large manufacturing or services companies trading here.  We have put out a lot of information about it.  We will make big mistakes if we just look at top line data.  We spend a lot of time looking at the micro data, but the problem is getting that data.  The cost of doing business report is a purely statistical report.  We have to be able to compare the data internationally, and we do not have that data so it is not included in the report.  We have representation from the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the Small Firms Association on our council.  We are a product of social partnership so there are an interesting variety of views around the table.  We manage to produce something sensible from the variety of views by following the data, and make sure that we only say things that are based on fact.  That makes it very difficult in areas where the data are poor.  However, I assure the Deputy that we were very early out of the blocks on the issue of insurance, and followed the information that was coming to us from the organisations on our board concerning insurance.  We produced a bulletin which has led to many changes.  We used the statistical report to then make recommendations in the Challenge report.  The data are poor; our principal recommendation is to get better data.  I urge everyone here to push the CSO for better data on insurance and legal services.  It is very hard to get.  It is hard for us to make the kind of points we want to make and the types of points the Deputy has made without having firm evidence.</p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right to say that there is plenty of personal experience of serious difficulties in obtaining insurance and the cost of that insurance when obtained.  I had an argument with my insurance company over motor insurance, in fact; I had to tell it what the data were and that it should have gone down rather than up.  Just because the average price seems to go down it does not mean that prices are increasing for people.  We have made many different recommendations around insurance.  In the December 2018 challenge report the main recommendations were to continue the implementation of the outstanding cost to employer and public liability insurance report recommendations, which address the issue of transparency in the insurance industry; to establish a standardised and internationally recognised approach to diagnose, treat and report on soft tissue injuries, as recommended by the Personal Injuries Commission, in order to improve transparency, comparability and efficiency of the personal injury claims system in Ireland; and to undertake more regular reviews of the book of quantum and provide a greater degree of granularity in terms of injury compensation data. </p> <p>  The Deputy has made a good point about the statistical report.  To address the issue he raised, we should probably include in our reports a box outlining what we were not able to report on and what we are concerned about.  It should be highlighted so that it is clear to interested parties that we are aware that this is an issue and that we are trying to get better data on it.  </p></speech>

I would argue that we have said more about it than most organisations, and spoke about it in early course.

We are hearing anecdotal evidence that one cannot get insurance in this country but that it can be got in the UK.  There is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that soft tissue injuries led to compensation awards five times more regularly here than in the UK.  However, we need more and more of that in order to put the insurance industry in the spotlight and leave it with no option but to play a fair game.  As things stand, it is a widely held opinion that the premiums requested are far from fair.</p></speech>

We are certainly in agreement on that.</p></speech>

Professor Clinch has said we are not doing too badly in overall price inflation.  However, we have marginal small increases in an embedded high-cost economy.  I do not know if this falls into something the National Competitiveness Council considers.  We went through a substantial bad period but have now come out of it and there is strong economic growth.  When comparing costs with other countries is there any explanation as to why, particularly in the hospitality and services sectors, we never seemed to address that high-cost economy structure that seems embedded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Clinch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019050800002#M00300"><p>It is a very good point.  Part of our job is to ensure people do not look at the inflation rate and say that it is fine; that they do not look at the productivity growth rate and say that it is fine; and that they do not look at the GDP growth rate and say that it is fine.  There is a lot happening underneath the hood.  The Chairman is quite right.  We might have a low inflation rate but we are coming from a high base.</p> <p>  It is always difficult in terms of how we operate.  There are so many things at work that underpin how an economy works, from particular sectoral and overall pay agreements through to us being a price taker in so many areas: our dependence on imported energy for example.  We are also a small economy so we do not get the economies of scale that other economies get.  There are also areas that are very difficult to compare.  We just had a great conversation about the importance of data.  It is very hard to compare, for example, administrative costs in the planning system because it is quite difficult to assess what they are.</p> <p>  One of Ireland's biggest challenges is in the boom-and-bust cycles we have had over the years.  As a highly globalised economy, we tend to have some large growth periods and then, as we saw recently, some significant downturns.  In the last downturn we saw a dramatic correction in costs.  Because of cyclical cost competitiveness adjustment the economy crashed and all of a sudden there was more supply of products, services, housing and property.  Prices were pushed down and we had a major competitiveness correction as well as some very beneficial external factors that were beyond our control.</p> <p>  We should also remember we had a very good capital stock as we came out of the crash.  Large investment in our roads and other infrastructure had happened in the run-up to the crisis.  Therefore when we emerged we were able to grow at a very fast rate yet not have price rises for a few years.  There may have been a failure to anticipate how quickly we would grow and how quickly we needed to invest in certain areas of the economy, particularly in capital spending which had taken a huge cut and is still well below our competitor countries even with the Project Ireland 2040 plan put in place.</p> <p>  Infrastructure spending and spending on innovation, research and development - in other words soft and hard infrastructure - are critical for providing productivity growth in areas where we cannot control prices and might be a price taker.  When it comes to economic policy a sustainable macro-environment is very important for competitiveness.  If there are big ups and downs in GDP growth and the performance in the economy, we will have big variations in the price level and essentially, as is happening now, we inevitably lose competitiveness as prices increase.  </p> <p>  The good news would be if essentially the economic growth rate slows but we do not, as we did previously, go beyond our productivity performance and find ourselves on an unsustainable path.  However, of course, it depends greatly on what happens internationally.</p></speech>

Maybe because of the economic size of our country or because of a number of factors coming together, many sectors in the Irish economy do not seem to realise the damage of high costs.  I cannot understand it within industry sectors.  It is interesting.  My background was primarily in the hospitality industry prior to becoming a Senator.  At one point prior to the crash, we priced ourselves out of entire sections of markets yet there now seems to be a willingness to go back to that pricing structure again.  It is not related to insurance or other factors.  It is an actual pricing structure in which people seem to think that as long as they can get X, they will charge X even if that means the industry suffers overall as a result.  Particularly in corporate hospitality, people lose the business if they are not price competitive with the UK and mainland Europe on a number of issues.  That is one sector.  A number of other sectors do not seem to be willing to look at the inbuilt higher costs.</p></speech>

One of the big lessons of the big boom-and-bust cycle we have just completed is that sustainability is the important word.  I mean that in a broader sense as opposed to environmental sustainability.  I mean it in the sense that we want to ensure the wages we are paying ourselves in the jobs we have at the moment are sustainable and not temporary.  It is really important that our cost base does not get out of hand.  If we are a high cost economy, we must have high productivity growth rates right across the economy and not just in certain areas with low productivity growth in other areas.</p> <p>  For example, we are embarking on an enormous investment in capital infrastructure yet we have very low productivity levels in the construction sector.  We also have a booming construction sector.  We need to try to square that circle of how much value for money we get from our capital investments.  It is a difficult time to be investing in capital although we need it in order to be able to grow without prices rising.  It is a very difficult thing to do.</p> <p>  It is important for the National Competitiveness Council to point these things out and make these contributions to the various Government frameworks such as the Action Plan for Jobs in the past and now the Future Jobs Ireland plan.  Our record shows that in the past five years we have been very clear in underlining the vulnerabilities we have on costs and productivity in particular.  We have also done considerable research on housing and rent affordability.  We developed an index allowing people to see how affordability in our cities compared with other cities; that did not exist previously.  In the end we produced a study to examine the affordability of Irish housing.</p> <p>  We came out strongly on childcare costs as we discussed.  We came out particularly early on legal services and on insurance.  We also raised the awareness of the high cost of credit and not just availability.  We have also got cost and competitiveness included in areas of Government policy where people might not have thought it was an important strand.  For example, competitiveness is one of the pillars in the White Paper on energy even though it had not been when it emerged in the first instance.</p><p>We also were involved in the implementation group of Food Wise 2025 and we called for competitiveness to be an important part of it.</p><p> On national infrastructure, we have heavily focused on coherence, co-ordinated delivery and monitoring of both the national planning framework and the Government's capital plan.  We need to properly assess how we prioritise investment and there needs to be a decision making process on how to change course if something changes.  If an enormous international economic recession comes along, we need to be able to ask if we are investing in the right areas or if we need to do something different.  Agility in decision making is critical.  In the national mitigation plan we have emphasised the need to competitiveness-proof the key areas of climate and energy.  Our emphasis on productivity was raised by two Deputies and has been taken on board by Government in its future jobs plan.  It is important to make sure the plan is effective and is delivered.</p></speech>

Before a bridge ever crossed the river, the monks ran a ferry.  Thomas Cromwell mentioned the weir in 1540 in his inventory for Henry VIII prior to the dissolution of the monasteries.  Centuries after the abbey was lost to history, the Scottish businessman John Anderson bought the old abbey lands in 1791, founded the modern town and built the weir that exists today.</p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has stated that the expressed ambition of his Department is "to increase participation and interest in sport, to improve standards of performance and to develop sports facilities at national, regional and local level, thereby contributing to healthier lifestyles and an improved overall quality of life, through a Departmental policy and resource framework in partnership with its Agencies, other Government Departments and the National Governing Bodies of Sport."  The reality, however, is that several events planned for 2019 have been cancelled and the very existence of several clubs is seriously threatened.  The Fermoy regatta will likely be cancelled for the first time in 80 years.  Two international triathlons face cancellation and Ireland's only Mark III wheelchair accessible boat cannot safely launch or dock, preventing people of varied levels of ability from appreciating our magnificent River Blackwater and its environs.  This is a clear breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p> <p>  Two issues arise at Fermoy weir, which is a listed protected structure and the property and responsibility of Cork County Council.  The first issue is the breach and collapse of the mill race weir wall in the past two years.  We believe that it resulted from and was directly caused by the flood works carried out by Lagan Construction - agent and servant of the Office of Public Works, OPW - and the OPW.  This work included an in-river road that was built abutting the weir and intensive pile-driving into the riverbed.  The second issue is the damaged fish passes.  No maintenance has been carried out on the weir or its fish passes since the 1960s.  Due to this neglect, the passes have deteriorated and fallen into such significant disrepair that they do not work adequately for fish migration.</p> <p>  Two years ago, a tree became lodged on this section of weir.  When it finally came loose, it took some of the weir cappings away with it.  Thousands of trees have come down the river in the past 200 years, but this particular tree is being blamed solely for the recent unprecedented damage.  During the flood works, the mill race weir wall was badly compromised as a result of intensive pile-driving and the building of an in-river road abutting the weir. The purpose of the in-river road was to facilitate the building of the new flood walls along O'Neill Crowley Quay.  Thousands of tonnes of stone and rock were dumped into the river to create the road.  Combined with the pile-driving, this would have had a major effect on the foundations and structure of the weir.  On 22 or 23 of January 2019, 30 m of the mill race weir wall collapsed.  That collapse occurred at the precise point where the in-river road was built and the pile-driving was carried out.  We predicted this collapse when the fallen tree carried away some of the wall cappings.  Last summer, our clubs offered to effect a temporary repair on the breach.  We were told by Cork County Council, acting on the advice of Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, that if we did so, we would face arrest and court proceedings.</p> <p>  The problem of Fermoy weir's damaged fish passes was highlighted in October 2003.  Since that year's summer was dry, the first rise in water levels only came in October, and when thousands of migrating salmon arrived at the weir, they could not migrate through the damaged fish passes.  In a futile effort to aid salmon passage, officials from the then Southern Regional Fisheries Board breached the north-western corner of the weir.  Local anglers and board officials netted salmon with landing nets and ferried some of these upriver.  The Central Fisheries Board and South West Regional Fisheries Board were lobbied to fix the fish passes.  An outlay of approximately &euro;60,000 would have repaired them at the time.</p> <p>  In 2004, an anonymous complaint was made to the EU that fish migration was hampered at Fermoy weir because of the damaged fish passes.  In 2008, what is now IFI proposed the building of a rock ramp pass structure to replace the weir, but the weir is a protected structure and locals protested that its removal could not be allowed.  River users noted that the lower rock ramp pass structure would cause upstream water levels to drop to a point that would threaten the existence of some of our clubs.  A fish bypass channel was then proposed, but we have never been given sight of any plan in that regard.  A major concern with any proposed new structure would be to ensure that historic water levels upriver were maintained.  During the flood works, Lagan Construction, under the instruction of IFI, drove piles into the side of the fish pass as a temporary repair measure to allow fish to get up the fish pass.</p> <p>  The Central Fisheries Board and IFI have failed to come up with a viable repair plan for the Fermoy weir over the past 20 years because the only real plan they had was to install a rock ramp pass.  This would have necessitated the removal of a protected structure, which the people of Fermoy opposed outright.</p></speech>

The most recent reads, &quot;The best thing that could happen is that the Weir be swept away ... We want to take away every weir in the country ... The bulldozers are ready to move in&quot;.  A quote from last week reads, &quot;We were never asked, nor did we ever stop a repair&quot;.  IFI is creating a smoke-screen for the Minister.  Fish stocks have been depleted by overfishing at sea against scientific advice.  This is further supported by a recent article in The Independent in the UK, which stated that wild salmon figures were way down in Scotland, blaming fish farming, drift netting and overfishing at sea as the main causes for river depletion.  On 30 April, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported IFI's CEO, Dr. Ciaran Byrne, as saying that the same factors were affecting populations in Ireland &ndash; mortality at sea, climate change including rising water temperatures, and sea lice arising from fish farming.</p><p>Dr. Byrne acknowledges that marine mortalities have reached 96%.  For every 100 salmon smolts leaving Irish rivers, up to 30 used to return to spawn.  In recent years that figure was "just three or four" and "this is at crisis point".  Official figures in Ireland for the River Blackwater put draft net fishing on average at 1,500 per annum, whereas unofficial figures are estimated at being significantly higher than this.  The claim that the weir should be removed because it has prevented salmon from migrating upriver can be totally discredited by the fact that the "official surplus for the Blackwater in 2018-19 is in excess of 7,200 fish, which is back up at 2008 levels".</p><p> We understand the proposal of a new fish bypass channel is being discussed and planned by the IFI and Cork County Council.  We, the stakeholders, have yet to see plans of this channel despite several requests and as a result, we have no idea of what is planned or what its effects will be on future water levels upriver.  We feel this new channel is unnecessary and is a waste of taxpayers' money.  After all of the above evidence, why is a weir that has functioned efficiently for over 200 years, all of a sudden, causing concern?  We say "Just repair it".</p><p> What is required as of now is that a repair of the weir needs to be carried out immediately without any further delay.  Stone cages or a water-filled boom, which is a water-balloon sausage, should be installed upriver from the bridge to restrict water flow through to the breach.  This could cost in the region of &euro;40,000 and will allow our clubs operate with some bit of normality next month.  It will also allow free passage of salmon, shad, eel and lamprey.  The disappearance of, and damage done to, the weir at O&rsquo;Neill Crowley Quay was, we believe, caused by Lagan Construction on behalf of the OPW.  Both of these bodies need to be compelled to repair and rebuild the weir.  Surely, they would have had an insurance bond for damage caused to the 200-year old protected weir after their works.  We suggest this be investigated immediately.</p><p> IFI is responsible for the free unhampered passage of migrating fish and it is their responsibility to ensure Cork County Council address the fish pass problems.  The damage to the Mill Race Weir wall and the damage to the fish passes, while two separate issues, need to be resolved simultaneously as part of a holistic repair of a 200 year old listed protected structure.  Nobody is confirming anything to us - it is all hearsay and rumour.

This is a serious issue which has bedevilled the community.  Has Cork County Council been in contact with the relevant Minister of State, Deputy English, about the proposal?  How is it progressing?  Is there a cost at design stage?  We need to see that happen.  I have spoken to the Minister and I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, has been there, as has the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Kyne.  Pa O'Driscoll has informed me that both Ministers of State have been in contact with many members.  A tender process must be engaged in for the awarding of the design stage and I hope we take it seriously, especially since it seems from the presentation that the regatta will not take place, which is a damning indictment of the situation.  The fish supply and the fish pass are also serious matters.  Are our guests in favour of temporary works being done?  I would be distressed and disappointed if IFI wanted to close every weir in the country, which is what the quotes attributed to that organisation suggest.  We do not agree that the weir should be swept away.  I hope that the funding can be provided through Cork County Council and we are here today because we are tired of obfuscation.  We want answers and we will support the witnesses who are here this afternoon.</p></speech>

It could be installed professionally for &euro;50,000 and could be used by Cork County Council's appointed contractors for the next number of years while they are carrying out repairs.  It was, however, ruled out of order when we proposed it last year and we were not afforded any meeting with the engineers of Cork County Council until as late as last Wednesday evening, when we were offered one.  I would suggest that was on foot of this petition.  We were told to be in Cork at 2.30 p.m. if we wanted a hearing but we could not attend because a number of people were out of the country and I was in Dublin.  After two years, the offer was too late.  The boom is the immediate answer for the people of Fermoy.  It will save the regatta and the fish will be able to migrate under it perfectly.</p> <p>  We are in favour of repairing the weir.  I have all the reports from O'Connor and Sons, who are the experts Cork County Council appointed in 2002, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2017 and 2018.  The last repair job was going to cost &euro;715,000 but, 12 months later, the figure is &euro;1.5 million.  The architect and design stages have gone out to tender but only one response came back, which was from O'Connor and was rejected because there was only one.  Maybe the price was too high, or even too low, but we were not told.  It has gone out for re-tendering and that is due back in two weeks' time, when we will have a better picture of the figures.  According to our councillors, the CEO of Cork County Council, Mr. Lucey, has said that when we have the figures, the council will pay half the amount.</p></speech>

We are not talking about repair or any other type of work.  We met the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, with Pa O'Driscoll in Fermoy a few weeks ago and he said he would look seriously at it with the relevant Minister of State, Deputy English, and the other Ministers to see if they could come up with the other half.  This is only for the design, however.  The river will be gone, the weir will be gone, our livelihoods will be gone and the clubs will be gone.  I spoke to a man who came from Fermoy 30 or 40 years ago and he said he could not believe it had been allowed to get to this point.</p><p>It is very unfair that we, who are doing all this as volunteers, are being given the runaround.</p></speech>

We met representatives of IFI with the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, in Fermoy last November and the repair was not even on the agenda.  IFI wants the repair job done and a brand new fish pass constructed inside what it calls the triangle field.  I am wondering why Cork County Council was asked to pay for a new fish pass when that is surely the job of IFI.  The council should only be paying for the repair and refurbishment of the existing weir, and I am sure it would be happy to do so.</p></speech>

If the fish pass is not going in, we are looking at a cost of between &euro;1 million and &euro;1.5 million.

The estimate was &euro;400,000.  We understand that the first tender - there was, as I stated, only one - came in higher.  As we understand it, that figure is now closer to &euro;525,000 plus VAT.  If I am calculating correctly, that gives a total of approximately &euro;650,000.  We do not know what is happening and how much of the cost relates to the new fish pass and how much to the repair.  We are asking Cork County Council that we be allowed to meet the architects and engineers in advance of any decision being made on how to proceed.  My understanding is that the council is being forced by IFI to put in a new fish pass which, in our view, is not required.</p></speech>

There is no need for what is proposed, which is like constructing a brand new building next door because the existing one might get overcrowded at some stage.  It does not make any sense.  Record numbers of salmon are going up the river, as we have proved.  The whole thing is a smoke-screen.  If only three out of 100 salmon are coming back in and all of them can get through, what is the problem?  If I said to the Deputy, a west of Ireland man, that all the clubs in Galway have to shut down because we are taking out Galway weir, there would be major upheaval in Galway city.</p></speech>

There is serious evidence to dispute that, however, including the statement from the CEO of IFI that only three to four out of every hundred salmon come back in.  The real problems are in the estuaries and fish farms and with fishing at sea.  To be blaming us and making us pay for the mistakes of others is totally wrong.  Mr. Lawton and I have been on the river all our lives and know it backwards.  We know the river is at its lowest level since the weir was built by John Anderson before 1800.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

The same boom will need to be used when the repair work is taking place, but the council will not even consider it.

I served on Cork County Council and was there at the time of the abolition of the town councils.  Cork County Council took over from the local town councils and municipal district councils but I do not think the council realised that when it took over the running of Fermoy Town Council, it assumed responsibility for the weir.  For a number of years there was a debate between the Department and the council to try to determine who was responsible for the weir.  It was deemed to be a unique responsibility, separate from the provision of water, housing and other services.</p> <p>  I recently met a retired fisheries official who spoke about the ongoing haggling over the Fermoy weir.  I told him that we were trying to reach an agreement on it and he said that money was allocated for it over the years but that it was a big problem getting all of the interested parties in Fermoy to agree.  It is a pity that the owner of the weir, Cork County Council, is not represented here today.  I am an Opposition Deputy but in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, he visited Fermoy at my request and that of other Members of this House.  He met Mr. Lawton and Mr. Kavanagh and other groups.  He urged people to put a package together and said that the Government would be in a position to make money available.  There are mechanisms available through which money can be drawn down, either by way of river basin funding or other initiatives.  Money can be drawn down.  The issue we have here is that this is being thrown around in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but until the local authority meets the Department officials, we are going nowhere.  Many of those here today know the history of this and know what is required but until Cork County Council sits down with departmental officials, even if they are officials from the Department of An Taoiseach, and finalises a plan, nothing will happen.  </p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh said that he is totally against the extension of the fish pass to the right.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I think that is clouding the whole issue.  As the Deputy's colleague said, is the figure &euro;4 million or &euro;4.5 million?  What figure are we talking about?</p></speech>

The figure was &euro;80,000 in 2010 but the figure is now rising.  Last year's repair estimate from O'Connor and Sons was &euro;700,000.  The weir is getting worse but IFI does not want to repair it.  It wants a brand new, super duper fish pass built but local fishermen disagree.  I am not a fisherman.  Mr. Lawton is a fisherman.  The local fishermen tell me that the fish will not go up this new fish pass.  One cannot force salmon up a new fish pass.</p></speech>

They are called eels.  I was asked a question by a scientist in Wales this morning and I told him that the eels were being eaten by otters.  We have three otters on the weir.  They are also being eaten by birds of prey, cormorants, which should be taken out.  They are taken out in the UK.  It is the otters and cormorants that are making sure that the eels do not get up river, not the weir.  We have plenty of shad and lamprey upriver.  We have an abundance of it and we have a surplus of 7,200 salmon upriver this year.  This has been confirmed.  Everything is rosy in the garden.  We just need to repair the weir.  Cork County Council needs to come before this committee.  If we did not have this petition route, we would have no power.  This would be done and dusted and the issue would be dead.  We have been fobbed off at every single opportunity.  We were delighted when the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, came to Fermoy but the minute he left the room, we were left with an IFI official, a civil servant speaking to other civil servants, who said that he did not blame them because they had to go home at 5 o'clock every evening.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

The weir deteriorates every day, as we speak.  Stones, rocks and other materials are disappearing off the weir because of the force of the water being funnelled down a narrow channel.  In terms of the fish passes, the neglect of the weir and the passes over the past 40 years is the major cause of the problems we now face in terms of fish trying to get up through the fish passes.  The passes are in such a state of disrepair that they are not viable for any fish migration anymore.</p></speech>

This is total negligence by Cork County Council and Fermoy Town Council over a number of years.  This is pure negligence.

We must break that deadlock.  If they want to build a fish pass afterwards and if the Oireachtas wants to pay for it, well and good.  I have no problem with that.  I will live with a new fish pass; it will be beautiful.</p></speech>

"Inland Fisheries Ireland are responsible for the free unhampered passage of migrating fish, it is their responsibility to ensure Cork County Council address the Fish Pass problems."  Does Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, have the authority to direct the county council, based on our guests' information?</p></speech>

Its responsibility is to the fish and the responsibility should lie with them to push Cork County Council on.  We have had meetings with IFI and we got bye-laws in at the bridge the past couple of years.  IFI has been helpful in that regard but we do not know what is happening when we are trying to get anything done.  That is where it lies.

The fish passes, groyne passes, pool passes and several other types of fish passes, including eel passes, will still be there on that weir.  They will all be newly replaced.  There will then be another, new fish pass.  It will work against it because water will have to be controlled going down the new fish pass and stopped coming down the old ones.</p></speech>

I want, on my own behalf, to welcome our guests and thank them for their extremely comprehensive report.  I know the work they have done on it.  We have had many arguments, even at Cork County Council level, that local knowledge means local experts.  Our guests are the local experts.  I have listened to the questions and debates here today and it sometimes feels as if the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  The front of somebody's head is talking to the back of someone else's.</p> <p>  Many figures have been bandied around, between the &euro;4.5 million and an estimated &euro;200 million.  Mental health is my other sphere where preventative and proactive measures are better than panic stations and reactive measures.  </p> <p>  I am interested in the water boom our guests are talking about.  I am well aware that there must be 12, 13 or 14 sub-aqua clubs.  It is not only Fermoy, it is the River Blackwater down as far as the Youghal estuary and there are many different businesses including sports, tourism and fishing.  I am well aware of the rowing clubs and so on and so forth.</p> <p>  A number of stakeholders have been mentioned and there is an amount of work that must be done.  I am nervous because once something is gone, it is gone.  This boom, if it can be put in, will bring the water level back up, will let everything continue as normal on one side of the river, at least temporarily, and will give the opportunity for everything to work the way it should.  Cork County Council, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Office of Public Works and the construction companies will all have to be brought in.  A solution is required.  That is what our guests are giving, albeit a temporary one.  Others are coming up with long-term solutions that will cost &euro;4 million or &euro;4.5 million.  I will be making a proposal to the committee members-----</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to meet, in session one, representatives of Women's Aid to discuss the organisation's Impact Report 2018, "Children let down by the system" and, in session two, representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance to discuss the organisation's Report Card 2019.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Margaret Martin, director of Women's Aid and Ms Ursula Regan, chair of the board of Women's Aid.</p><p>They are both very welcome.<br/><br/>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind our guests and those in the Public Gallery to either switch off their mobile phones or place them in flight mode.  This is because they interfere with our sound system.  I advise our guests that any submissions they have made or opening statements they may make to the committee will be published on its website after this meeting.  Following their presentations, there will be questions from the members.<br/><br/>I now call on Ms Martin and Ms Regan to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

Domestic violence and child abuse are often interlinked.  Domestic violence and child abuse may co-occur, with the perpetrator abusing his partner and also directly abusing the children.  It has been recognised that exposing children to intimate partner abuse is itself a form of emotional child abuse, with detrimental effects on the child's development and well-being.</p> <p>  Last year, 19,089 contacts were made with Women's Aid's direct services, during which 16,994 disclosures of domestic violence against women were made, including physical, emotional, financial and sexual abuse.  The kind of abuse women experienced includes being stalked, women and children being locked out of their homes overnight, being isolated from friends and family and being in fear of their lives because abusers threatened them with guns, knives and injury due to speeding in cars.  This also includes 898 threats by the abusive partner to kill the woman, the children or her family, or to harm himself.</p> <p>  We heard 3,816 disclosures of physical abuse, including women having their hair pulled, being beaten, being smothered, strangled and hospitalised.  We also heard 141 disclosures of abuse while the woman was pregnant, with a number of women experiencing miscarriage as a result.  We heard 526 disclosures of women being coerced into sexual activity, having intimate videos and photos taken and shared without their consent, including 226 disclosures of women being raped by their intimate partners, including during pregnancy or after childbirth.  We heard 1,540 disclosures of financial abuse, with women being denied access to the family income, having their own salaries or social welfare payments stolen or controlled by their abuser, being made to account for every penny spent and often being left without money for basic family needs.  Women were left with broken bones and teeth, bruising, head injuries and internal injuries.  Some women experienced miscarriages as a result of assaults and there were those who were experiencing post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and exhaustion.</p> <p>  Many of the women who disclosed these tactics of abuse have children.  In fact, 72% of the women who used our one-to-one services for the first time in 2018 had children.  We know from the report of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, FRA, that children are often aware of the violence experienced by their mothers and, therefore, we can confidently assume that a number of children in Ireland are aware of their mothers being abused as described above, either because they see the abuse happening or they see the aftermath.  They may fear for themselves, they may want, or try, to intervene or they may know their mother cannot protect them and may fear she may be hurt or killed.  We know that seeing, hearing or otherwise knowing about this abuse has a negative and profound impact on children.  In addition, we heard of 3,728 disclosures of abuse of children in the context of domestic abuse, including children being physically, sexually and emotionally abused as well as witnessing the abuse against their mothers.  In 432 cases disclosed to our helpline a social worker was involved.</p> <p>  Despite the range and severity of the impact of domestic violence on children, they are often the forgotten victims, with limited services and protection available.</p><p>They are affected by the lack of vital services such as refuges.  In 2018, our 24-hour helpline made a total of 244 calls to refuges for women who could not make such a call themselves.  On 126 occasions, or 52%, the refuges were full.  Many of the women who made these calls had children with them but safe accommodation was simply not available for them.  They then had to return to the abuser or become homeless.  Another huge gap is the lack of counselling services for children who have experienced domestic violence, through either being witnesses to the violence against their mothers or being targeted directly.  There are very few affordable and specialised services to assist children in their journey to recovery.  Moreover, the consent of the abuser is needed for children to attend counselling.  In our experience, such consent is often denied.</p><p> We have made a number of detailed recommendations in our submission in the context of research, guidelines, training, legal aid and the provision of supervised contact centres.  The key principle binding these recommendations together is that there needs to be a recognition in law and in practice that the best interest of children is to live free from domestic violence, including from witnessing abuse against their mothers, and that any custody and access arrangements need to ensure this as a first priority.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I have just two brief questions.  Ms Martin stated that there is little or no service available to children when they witness violence in the home.  What services are available and what needs to be done in this regard?</p> <p>  I know that our guests represent Women's Aid and that this is about women, but children also witness violence in the home where the female is the perpetrator.  Do our guests have any information about this?  If there is an organisation that deals with it, does it come together with Women's Aid, again for the child's sake?</p></speech>

The difficulty, as I outlined, is that there is very often a shortage of space and that refuges are turning away significantly more women and children than they are accommodating.  We had a recent consultation with women on family law, and one concern from mothers that came up consistently was the lack of therapy and support for their children and the fact that where it is available it is costly and that very often the therapist does not really understand the impact of domestic violence.  It is a very particular situation and understanding its dynamics and the level of threat under which women sometimes struggle is really important to understanding how to support these women and their children.</p> <p>  There will be children who are abused by their mothers.  This is not something people come to us about.  Most of our calls come from women themselves and about 3% are from men.  Sometimes they are fathers; a lot of the time they are women's supports, perhaps a new partner, etc.</p></speech>

We met the Children's Rights Alliance, Barnardos and One Family Ireland fairly recently to look for some kind of support on foot of the increased emphasis of the voice of the child, as provided for in the Children and Family Relationships Act.  It is a matter of being able to bring that voice centre stage in court proceedings and there being some kind of research and consultation with children on their experience.  Something like that might bring some of the answers to the question Senator Freeman asks.</p></speech>

She stated, "the consent of the abuser is needed for children to attend counselling" and she made reference to the children being witness to these incidents, which is horrifying to me, not only as a parent but as a parliamentarian as well.</p><p>Is there a remedy for that aside from guardianship <i>ad litem</i>, which comes much later in the process?  Is there an obstacle to a child accessing counselling services if the mother consents?  Is there some sort of blockage I am not picking up on?</p></speech>

This includes psychologists and family therapists, to whom a child might be referred for a variety of reasons though this context concerns domestic violence.  My experience is also as a family law solicitor.  I am in court on a regular basis.  In my experience, refusing to consent to a child being seen by a therapist is a standard blocking tactic used by perpetrators of domestic violence.  The only way around that is to bring a separate application before the court under the Child and Family Relations Act 2015 for the parent's consent to be dispensed with in the interests of the child's welfare so that this procedure can take place.</p></speech>

The main court complex for the Dublin area is Dolphin House, which has four courts sitting per day, five days a week.  An application to dispense with consent would be regarded as an emergency application.  Given the volume of business, it now takes three months from the date an application is made to bring it before the court if it is not considered an emergency.  It might take longer.  A case can be made if there is an emergency, and an applicant will certainly be moved up the list.  However, it is not an immediate application by any standard.  Quite simply, Dolphin House cannot cope with its current volume of business.</p></speech>

Like my colleague, I was horrified by those statistics.  As a family law practitioner in a former life, I am well used to the corridors of Dolphin House and what goes on there.  It is not unfamiliar territory.  I will ask all my questions and then perhaps we can interact after that.  Ms Regan referred to refuges and their inability to facilitate women.  Is there a standard procedure linking refuges with their local authorities to access emergency accommodation and prevent women and children from heading back to the family home and the abuser?  Is somebody equipped to liaise with the local authority?  My next question concerns ease of access to legal aid.  In the past women definitely had difficulties with the standard contribution.  I know there is a waiver system, but it was often quite difficult to get the waiver.  Could Ms Regan comment on access to legal aid?  Once a legal aid certificate is acquired, how easy is it to get a private practitioner to take on a very vulnerable client?</p><p> Reference was made to the family law courts.  In one way, we are spoiled in Dublin by having Dolphin House, a dedicated family law court.  Elsewhere, family law sessions are often mixed with other sessions.  The three-month wait that exists in Dublin could be six months in other places.  Has Women's Aid made any submissions or representations to the Department of Justice and Equality about the promised new family law complex?  A big hole in the ground is awaiting development.  I refer also to the provision of proper facilities for cases.  Last Christmas, a judge was held hostage in Dolphin House.  That was a very serious incident.  The previous Christmas, a judge and a practitioner were attacked in Dolphin House.  A lot of tensions are heightened in the run-up to Christmas.  Does Ms Regan have an opinion on the provision of that family law complex?</p><p> Finally, migrant communities are growing.  How is the Children's Rights Alliance accessing those communities?  Does it provide translated materials or work with various outreach groups?  Can our guests provide some information in that regard?</p></speech>

We are in touch with a great many refuges.  The problem for a lot of them is that there is nowhere to send women.  In the past they were sent to homeless hostels, bed and breakfast establishments, etc.  The difficulty is that these women are often at very high risk.  When a woman in this position leaves her partner, the risk escalates significantly.  Domestic violence services always put safety at the core of their work with women.  They have safety measures to protect women, children etc.  In regard to local authorities, the unfortunate reality is that there is sometimes difficulty for women trying to access refuge outside the county they live in.  There can be good relationships between local authorities where there is some openness to that.  We have sometimes heard of cases where women are not accepted in their local areas.</p> <p>  We also receive calls from garda&iacute; who might have a woman and three kids who are at very high risk in the back of a car.  The garda needs to find a refuge space and asks us to name anywhere in the country where protection can be found, offering to take them there.  However, no refuge is available anywhere.  There are Council of Europe guidelines on this issue and we have about a third of the refuge space we need.  That is significant.</p> <p>  I will address the question on migrants and perhaps Ms Regan will deal with the others.  Migrants definitely have significant additional needs.  Isolation is very much a tactic in cases of domestic violence.  If a victim has a language difficulty, the isolation process can be much easier and more effective.  For the last several years our helpline has had access to translation services in 170 different languages in less than a minute so that if somebody contacts us they can speak in his or her own mother tongue.  It is a difficult subject to talk about.  We share that service with refuges, and sometimes we are able to set up calls with refuges, the Garda, etc.  However the service is not available as standard.  That is a major issue.  A significant number of migrant women use the services.  We have links in that community and did an awful lot of work over a long period with the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  There are a lot of really good connections there.  Language is one of the big considerations.  In addition to having things that are more accessible for people with difficulties, our website has sign language for deaf women and BrowseAloud software for people with sight issues.  A lot of parts can be text-read.  All of our information is available in about eight different languages.</p></speech>

If somebody is eligible for legal aid is not bringing a "front-loaded" case, for want of a better description, in respect of domestic violence but is going to the Legal Aid Board to go through the process of separation or divorce, in certain counties that person will wait up to a year for that legal representation.  The person may be separating from a violent partner, although not by way of a barring order application.  In the context of the legal aid boards in Dublin, the wait is probably somewhere between four and six months for an initial consultation and then it takes on a life of its own after that.  There is a private practitioner scheme available where domestic violence is an issue.  To a certain degree, that works but there is no continuity in it.  In dealing with a woman who is fragile and the subject of domestic violence, or with children who have witnessed or been caught up in the brutality of domestic violence, there must be continuity in legal representation.  If they have to go to different people and try to explain the position all over again, they will give up because of the level of frustration that arises.  Excluding cases of domestic violence but including cases of guardianship, access to children and maintenance, it was confirmed to me the other day that in certain legal aid cases, a woman will not get more than one legal aid certificate per year.</p></speech>

Often proceedings are adjourned to allow for interim reports.  There could be 12 court appearances with one legal aid certificate.  I do not know if members of the committee are aware of the fee with respect to a legal aid certificate.  It is &euro;339.  I know many practitioners during the recession started taking on legal aid cases but as the legal and other areas have picked up, they are turning away and taking the meatier legal aid cases, perhaps leaving somebody who might have a difficult case, such as one involving domestic violence, that might require many reports over 12 months.  That is because the fees are so pitiful.  Rather than the process being kept in-house, it is going to the private practitioner panel.</p></speech>

As night follows day, there would be an application for access.  Looking at the volume of work in Dolphin House, there are between 12 and 15 cases listed per court per day.  Trying to get a proper hearing if there are complicated matters and trying to get an understanding of dynamics in a household with domestic violence takes some time.  It takes time to examine a fragile witness and get the full story of what is going on.  There would also have to be a certain reading between the lines.</p> <p>  A scheme was set up to provide for reports to be done on children.  An arbitrary age division was taken so now if children are over 12, by and large they are interviewed by judges; if they are over five or six but under 12, a report is compiled.  That is certainly of assistance to the court.</p><p>However, at the time, a very low fee structure was put in place in a process not unlike the cuts we mentioned in legal aid.  Only a handful of these experts compile reports for the court and, because of this, the delays in those reports run anything from six months upwards.  One can just imagine the damage being done to a child or children during that period.</p><p> This brings us back to the problem that when legislation is introduced, it may seem good, strong and progressive on the face of it but if there is not the requisite support behind it or the system to enforce it, that legislation will come to naught in the end.  We have very strong legislation in this area and the voice of the child is being heard.  It looks great when we read it and it seems progressive and that it would tick every box.  I hate using the expression but it looks like that until we drill down into the issue and realise that support systems are not there.</p></speech>

We have made submissions in the area, taking in infrastructure that should be there when attending the court.  One of the developments we are pleased about is that there is a drop-in support and referral service in Dolphin House.  We had been getting calls from women who told us they were on the bus going to Dolphin House and asked us what they needed to know.  We have been working really well with the Courts Service so the women can get a recommendation to go to the fourth floor.  At least if they do not get a barring or safety order, they can come back and some safety planning can be done.  We would like to see a suite of supports and welfare as part of the family law court process.</p> <p>  The delays regarding the Hammond Lane project are deeply disappointing.  I know the matter was aired in the media again in the past couple of days but the current infrastructure is really poor.  Anybody involved in the process has stated that it is totally inadequate.

I have some brief questions.  The Minister outlined in a reply to a parliamentary question from me in March that nine counties have no domestic violence refuge.  Do the witnesses know the level of demand in any of those counties or are they familiar with such data?  Will they indicate what it is like for a woman to have to travel to another county because services do not exist in her county?</p></speech>

As already stated, any action, particularly towards separation, tends to escalate risk for these women.  It is really important that services are available throughout the country.  Some women will want refuge or to use services in their own county but others would say they need to be 100 miles away or that they are in Dublin but need to be somewhere else.</p><p>We need an infrastructure or network that will allow us to meet all of those needs.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  Our experience is that many women are at very high risk.  While there has been good progress on the domestic violence legislation and the responses from the Garda, there will be a need for refuge for a very long time yet.  We have to admit this is the case and meet that need.  A refuge is a safe space.  Very often it is a guarded space with locked doors to protect women and children.  Unfortunately that option has to be there.  An awful lot of women or even their children have told us - and told me personally - for example, that they were in the Women's Aid refuge in Harcourt Street donkey's years ago and they can remember the black bags, sleeping on the floor and whatever, but that it really made such a difference.  Women may have to go to refuges a number of times.  The provision of refuge is inadequate in Ireland and that needs to be addressed.  The more isolated women are, the higher the level of risk for them.</p></speech>

One of the things that gives me heart is the fact that we have ratified the Istanbul convention.  It provides a really positive framework for addressing an issue like this.  It has four pillars that are all very important.  There is the issue of prevention and the work that has to happen, including training, awareness, and the work that happens in schools; and the issue of protection, the Garda and the refuges.  The part that is very inadequate is the whole issue of prosecutions and penalties.  We are doing a sentencing watch to look at this.  There are a lot of men who are repeat offenders.  They have left one partner, who has escaped, and they have moved on to another partner.  They are very dangerous.  The expertise of the Garda has increased to some extent in realising that.  It needs to be addressed much more seriously.  We also need a strong-arm approach in the context of monitoring.  While the legislation that we have may look very effective and is extremely welcome, we need more than just the recipe for the cake.  We need to be able to eat the cake as well.  Unfortunately while we can see that a lot of this is working, it is not dropping down to the ground.  There are women still sleeping in cars.  Women are couch surfing.  Women have had to move their kids.  We were seeing this before we had a homelessness crisis; the committee can imagine how much more compounded the problem is now.</p></speech>

I can only imagine that a child who has witnessed domestic violence and is suddenly told he or she has an access visit might not want to go.  Sometimes he or she could be dropped off or picked up late.  It is traumatic for a child, I imagine.  Could Ms Martin elaborate on what she said about supervised access and facilities for the children?</p></speech>

She is asking how she can do that in a way that is safe for her and the children.  There was an evidence-based development whereby Barnardos and One Family developed contact centres around Dublin.  They were not specifically for domestic violence but they were a good model.  There was a lot of feedback and one of the things we heard from them was that the issue of domestic violence was coming up very significantly among those children, to the extent that the organisations wrote to the court on some occasions to say they were fearful about the contact the father might have with those children.  A lot of women are really fearful about their children going on access visits.  They may be fearful about sexual or physical abuse, neglect, speeding in cars and numerous things.  We need a risk assessment process for children in order to assess how safe they will be.  We need infrastructure that will allow safe contact.  Supervised access could take place in buildings that have different entrances and exits so that the woman does not have to see her abusive partner.  It could ensure that the child is safe and that the access can happen when appropriate.</p> <p>  At the moment, the courts tend to disregard domestic violence and see it as something between the parents, rather than understanding that it has a significant impact on children. Many children will go very happily and will be disappointed if their father does not turn up; that may be the issue for them.  However, an awful lot of children are absolutely terrified and do not want to go.  They have to wait until they are 18 before they can refuse to go.  A lot of developments need to happen.  The risk assessment would determine ability to have safe contact.  The supports and therapy should also be in place for children in terms of dealing with the relationship, which is a very complex one for them to deal with.</p></speech>

There is no supervised access context in Ireland at all.  There was a pilot, which preceded the development of Tusla, in which Barnardos and One Family ran three centres.  There are a couple of <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements around the country.  There used to be a priest in Dublin who allowed his community hall to be used.  Women would have to bring their kids down to the local Garda station, even on Christmas Day.  They have to go somewhere public.  We are trying to look at the safety issue and mitigate the risk for them.  There needs to be proper infrastructure with policies, buildings and the back-up personnel who are trained and understand this, and are able to provide the service.</p></speech>

Many women would welcome their child having a relationship with the father but it is a difficult situation for them to be in when they do not know if the child will be safe.  Some men use it as a threat.  They may send photographs saying, "We are here, we are at the sea, I might drive the car off the pier and you might never see us."  People completely underestimate the level of threat that exists in a large number of domestic violence cases.  Until there is recognition of this, the responses are not going to be developed.  We are dealing with this inadequacy all the time.</p></speech>

There is a serious lack of a network of similar supports for children.  I sit on the national monitoring committee on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and another thing that has been difficult is the resistance on the part of the Department of Education and Skills to recognising that abuse happens in the home.  I have brought it up countless times at the committee, as have a number of people.  The officials say the Department has had much more of a focus on "stranger danger".  While it is important to have that, for many children this is something that has existed since before they were able to talk.  We should not expect them even to be able to verbalise it.  We have to find a way to support children in an age-appropriate way all the way through their lives.  Those supports are sadly very inadequate.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently considering some curriculum changes, which presents an opportunity.  However, people have to understand that this is something that is happening in a significant number of homes.</p><p>It has an impact on children.  We need a variety of responses so that where children are experiencing it, they can talk to somebody about it.  The main thing that they pick up on is the shame, stigma and safety issues, and very few of them will talk about it.  They are unlikely to even talk about the level of threat to themselves.</p></speech>

Senator Clifford-Lee mentioned local authorities and local authority housing.  In a situation where somebody is under pressure or there is domestic violence, what are the experiences of the witnesses with regard to interaction with local authorities, especially for people living in local authority houses when trying to get a transfer out of the house or to seek other local authority housing?  They are locked in with means tests and such with their partners.  How can one navigate that, given the dangers of divulging information?</p><p>With regard to people in private accommodation, a woman rang me recently who has been with somebody for 25 or 30 years and wants to go because of the situation.  She cannot apply for local authority housing because she owns half a house.  There are all those implications.  In my experience, this arose often with men contacting me ten or 15 years ago as a result of marriages breaking up, particularly men in their 50s.  A man would own half a house with his wife and, therefore, could not get on a local authority list.  This is it in a different guise but the same matters pertain with regard to assets.  Has there been any progress in local authorities regarding these hard cases or does the <i>status quo</i>still exist?</p></speech>

The experience that we have had is that, while in the past we might have been able to make some progress in supporting women with those issues, it has been very difficult with the housing crisis.  Under the national steering committee on violence against women, there were regional committee meetings in each county.  Local authorities came together to look at the issue of domestic sexual and gender-based violence at those.  Many of them were able to develop contacts and have reciprocal arrangements that helped.  It also meant that the issue of domestic violence was on their agenda much more so.  Those committees have since ceased.  They have not been <i>in situ </i>for a number of years.</p></speech>

The regional committee meetings then ceased.  They were supported through the HSE, as far as I recall.  Much work was done by the national steering committee, with guidelines fed in by Safe Ireland, Sonas, us and a range of domestic violence services.  The difficulty was trying to implement them.  The Department said to us that the concept of subsidiarity meant that one had to recognise the decision-making process at local level.  It tended to get stuck.  Our experience is that it was an area where about half of our time was spent in courts.  The same time was spent supporting women with housing options.  That has fallen away because of the housing crisis, because we have not been able to have any impact in that sector.  There are not enough housing options.</p></speech>

If somebody gets on the housing list, he or she can access HAP if he or she is lucky enough to secure private rented accommodation.  Ms Martin is saying that those bottlenecks still exist and there has been no progress on that, and that now these regional assemblies have ceased to exist.</p></speech>

It included face-to-face interviews in each country and one can access those data.  That gives some sense of the figures.  Anecdotally, people often ask me if I think that the level of domestic violence is increasing.  When we get a high level of promotion, there is an increase in the demand for our services.  It happens when people know that there is somewhere that they can go.  For example, when Clodagh Hawe was murdered, we had a 48% spike in the number of calls about that in the following weeks.  There is a correlation between awareness that help is available and people seeking it.  That says that there is a much bigger need, but we have very poor data to assess this with.  We conducted research which showed that one in five women experiences domestic violence at some point in their lives.  No other research has shifted that.  In 2005, the National Crime Council indicated that severe abuse happened in one of seven cases.  We still do not have the measure of this.  With the Istanbul Convention, good data are required because until one has good data, one cannot have good solutions.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Tanya Ward, chief executive, and Ms Edel Quinn, legal research and public policy manager, and thank them for coming.</p><p>Before we commence, I am required to draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they tend to interfere with the sound system which makes it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.</p><p>I also wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After their presentation, there will be questions from the members of the committee.  I now call on Ms Ward and Ms Quinn to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

We are a membership body that is almost 25 years old.  We are an umbrella organisation for organisations campaigning for children and young people in Ireland.</p> <p>  The report card is one of our flagship projects and it is an annual project.  The report tracks how the Government is delivering on its promises to children in the programme for Government.  These are not promises we have made up; they have been made by the Government and the Government has committed to them in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  One significant point about the report card is that while the Children's Rights Alliance writes and researches the report, an independent panel grades the report card every year.  The panel is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and includes a range of different experts.  That is important for us because while we are close to the issues, the panel tries to be as neutral as possible in grading the report card.</p> <p>  I will comment on this year's report card.  We are three years into the current programme for Government.  The Government got a C grade, which is the highest grade to date for this programme for Government.  This is because in nearly every area we have seen progress on the commitments the Government has made.</p> <p>  I will outline some of the high points in the report card.  The Government gets an A grade for the LGBTI+ strategy.  I will comment on the detail of that strategy.  It is probably one of the biggest and most effective consultations ever undertaken for a youth initiative by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  One significant point is that the measures in the strategy will deal with some of the key problems that we know LGBTI children face.  During the consultation we heard that many young people suffer from bullying in the school place.  They are stereotyped and many self-harm.  Even though we saw a high point with marriage equality, things have not changed sufficiently for LGBTI+ young people in schools.  I hope the strategy will get us there.</p> <p>  Another high point relates to child poverty.  The reason I say that is because last year, we had the most progressive budget to date since before the recession when it comes to child poverty.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection budget included a range of different measures that will have an impact for children.  We have over 100,000 children living in consistent poverty.  That number grew exponentially at different points during the recession.  We had a decrease in December, with 25,000 children lifted out of consistent poverty.  The types of measures in the budget related to older children, who are more likely to experience poverty.  There was an extra &euro;5 in welfare payments for those children.  There was extra funding for the school meals programme, including the piloting of a hot school meals programme.  That is really important because that is one of the answers when we are dealing with child poverty in Ireland.  There was also the possibility of lone parents being able to earn more every week before losing their benefits.  These kinds of targeted measures will make a major difference to families.  Obviously, however, we are only part of the way there and we need sustained investment and programmes if we are going to change the dial when it comes to child poverty.</p> <p>  Another area I wish to highlight as a high point relates to childcare.  Last year a total of 72,000 families got to benefit from a childcare subsidy.  That is significant in our history.  Committee members will know that we are far behind when it comes to childcare.  Other countries were developing their national childcare systems in the 1940s and 1950s and so we are years behind.  What is significant about last year is the fact that &euro;574 million was secured to provide a national childcare scheme subsidy.  There are issues in respect of whether that scheme will be wide enough for people living in poverty and I can talk to the committee in more detail about that but it is a milestone in the development of our system.</p> <p>  I will make some final points, including some points on direct provision.  We saw some significant developments in the past year when it comes to children living in direct provision.  The direct provision payment that children receive on a weekly basis was increased from &euro;21.10 to &euro;29.80.  That is significant because for 15 years, children in direct provision were only receiving &euro;9.60 per week.</p> <p>  Another important point is that national standards for refugee accommodation have been developed.</p><p>These have yet to be published and to be honest, unless there are independent inspections these standards will not be meaningful and will not result in the change that we need to see in this area.</p><p> There are low points too.  Committee members will see in the report card that the Government gets an F grade when it comes to child homelessness.  It is not that we fail to recognise there is much happening across the board.  We know over &euro;60 million is going into homeless services.  We know &euro;1 billion is going into housing assistance payments to help families try to stay in rented accommodation.  However, the reality is that between 2017 and 2018 an extra 500 children entered homeless accommodation.  These measures have not been sufficient to turn the tide when it comes to child homelessness.  We know that approximately 12% of children in homeless accommodation have been there for two years or more.  We are highly concerned about the impact of institutionalisation on these children, as well as the impact on their education and welfare.</p><p> Lastly, I wish to highlight the area of Travellers.  This is to my shame.  I have been chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance for seven years at this stage.  We are seeing a serious deterioration in the situation for Traveller children, especially when it comes to accommodation.  We know that 40% of Traveller children are living in overcrowded accommodation.  That makes it very difficult for them and it is a very stressful situation.  Oftentimes, they do not have access to sanitation.  We hear parents talking about bringing children out during the night to urinate.  We also hear, despite all of this, that central government is making money available to invest in Traveller accommodation but it is not being spent.  That is one of the major scandals when it comes to Travellers.</p><p> Those are some of the main points.  I am happy to answer any questions from committee members.</p></speech>

I will let Senator Freeman in presently because I know time is against her.  I will be quick.  I have some observations to make on which I seek your views.</p> <p>  Lest I be accused of being party political, a C+ grade is not good enough for this State.  An F grade on homelessness is disgraceful.  Our national legacy of the treatment of Travellers, regardless of what we have done in respect of ethnicity, is a problem.  I worked as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the last D&aacute;il.  I worked extensively with the then Chairman of that committee, and now Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton.  Our collective failure to provide Traveller accommodation throughout the State is nothing short of a disgrace.  I want to put all of those matters out into the open straight away.</p> <p>  There is one thing I find most frustrating.  Ms Ward hit the nail straight on the head in starting out by making the clear and unambiguous statement that the number of children in consistent levels of poverty has reduced dramatically in the recent past.  Yet, on every occasion when we have this conversation, especially in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the opposite information is being presented as fact.  I find it incredibly frustrating that the narrative is being created in the political world in this country to the effect that we, as a State and all its institutions, whether they be State-sponsored or NGOs, are failing in their duties or responsibilities in respect of consistent levels of child poverty or those at risk of child poverty.  The opposite is the case.  That is something I am keen to put on the record.</p> <p>  One of the questions I have relates to Travellers and I am pleased that Ms Ward has raised the point.  When I was going through all the submissions yesterday one point jumped out at me having worked on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the last D&aacute;il.  How do we change the attitude of local authorities and their councillors, especially in the context of a local election in two weeks?  How do we change the attitude of council members?  At times, for sound reasons, they refuse to permit local authorities to expend moneys on sites that are down back country lanes with absolutely no services whatsoever.  At other times, there are out-and-out objections for the sake of it.  How does the State grasp this contentious nettle and provide the services that we should be providing to an ethnically recognised part of our society?  How do we ensure that the area where we have a particular interest, that is to say, where the children of Traveller families throughout the State find themselves in deplorable conditions, is addressed?  Does Ms Ward have advice to offer to the committee?</p></speech>

There is a multiplicity of things we need to do.  From talking to Travellers about their everyday experiences, one of the core things to address is the discrimination and interpersonal racism they experience, which influences the actions of council members and local authorities in deciding what to do around accommodation issues.  One of the striking and shocking things when we went to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child was to hear Pavee Point, whose representatives attended with us, present to the committee how Travellers felt after the Carrickmines fire.  Travellers could not get their heads around the lack of compassion for them after the biggest fire in the State since the Stardust fire.  It was symptomatic of something deeper in Irish society which we have yet to address.  We need to do more work on valuing Travellers and their culture and identity in Irish society and to address the discrimination that happens for Travellers on an everyday basis.  Consistently, they will tell one that they have to hide their Traveller identity in the workplace because they are unlikely to hold onto their jobs.  We had Kathleen speak at the launch of our report card and she talked about her experience.  When she got her first job after school and they found out she was a Traveller, things suddenly became much more difficult and she was constructively dismissed.  If one looks at what happened to the Equality Authority around the same time and the reduction in funding, it just so happens that discrimination for Travellers increased and we did not address it.  There is a big piece there that we need to address.  Obviously, we have the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which has a very important role to play to address discrimination.</p> <p>  We may need to look at sanctions in respect of local authority members and the way local authorities operate or something more forthright to ensure they make the decisions to provide accommodation.  One particular local authority returned &euro;2 million to the Department and that has been done in successive years.  This particular local authority area has a very large Traveller population.  Something must be done at national level to address this crisis.  Travellers are ending up in homeless accommodation.  That is what Focus Ireland is saying.  Travellers have larger families and they are finding it more difficult to find homes and accommodation.  We need to take a more forthright and twinned approach by looking at Traveller identity and addressing discrimination.  We have to get to Traveller children themselves.  They do not value themselves at this point in time.  Morale is very low and they feel very low.  We had a consultation with children from around the country in which Traveller children took part.  There were two children in particular who, while they had never experienced discrimination, said they had no hope for their futures.  We have to change that.  Every Traveller child in the country should have hope for his or her future.</p></speech>

One of my questions follows a question from the Chairman.  I do not know if I am understanding this right.  It has to do with the Travellers.  I remember that we invited Pavee Point to an Oireachtas meeting on mental health.  One of the figures that stands out to me all the time is that 90% of Traveller men will not reach the age of 60.  That alone is horrifying.  When the witnesses say the money is not being spent even though it has been allocated, is it the local authorities who are refusing to spend it?  I do not get that.</p></speech>

They should be on county councils or running for election.  Is that happening at all?  I cannot understand how the money is being sent back.</p> <p>  The second question I have relates to my one-trick pony, namely, mental health.</p><p>Has the Children's Rights Alliance made any findings on mental health on children and the available services?  I am deeply surprised to hear the witnesses say the Government has scored a C grade, I am deeply surprised.  When I say "deeply surprised", I do not mean "pleasantly".  I do not believe it has achieved a C grade and would have put it all down as an F grade.  I would be interested to hear what the findings were.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any Travellers standing for election at the moment but there are obviously black and ethnic minority people coming forward.  What is very positive to see is that Traveller organisations are doing a lot of leadership development at the moment.  One will see great people starting to come up through education, including people with PhDs, who are going to lead into the future.  Excellent work has been done by Travellers themselves.  Mobilisation of the Traveller community to speak for themselves and to organise themselves and to lead is fundamental to addressing the key issues.  It is shocking to hear that there is money available for accommodation which is not being spent.  We always complain that no money is being made available by central government.  We need something more radical if we are going to change the figures because the State is just paying for it in other ways.  The State pays because Travellers are in homeless accommodation.  We are paying for it in terms of health services.  The Senator is right that infant mortality rates, the high death rate for adult men and low employment rates all smack of deep levels of deprivation that we have allowed to happen over a long period.  I do not know whether people realise that half of all Travellers are children and young people under the age of 18.  It is an extraordinary opportunity to engage in early intervention to address the deep levels of discrimination and deprivation.  I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Quinn, to discuss mental health.</p></speech>

It is one of the lowest grades the Government has been given.  That is due largely to the review of A Vision for Change not having been completed yet and the lack of 24-7 access to services, which is something that comes through on our own information line.  People are ringing up to ask what they are going to do for their child on a Friday evening when that child needs access to services.  Waiting lists are another issue.  Children and young people are waiting long periods for access.  Last year, approximately 20% of children waited over a year for access to CAMHS.  There are also waiting lists for community and psychology services.</p></speech>

When a young person is suffering emotionally and mentally and cannot get the support he or she needs, he or she finds it very hard to go to school and to stay in school.  The exams can be the reason for the stress but usually there has been a long lead in period.  By the time a young person needs to go to CAMHS there has usually been a long period of stress and that is the reason the person needs CAMHS services.  In an area such as Wexford, where there is a gap in service provision, school attendance will be lower.  We know that from talking to different actors in the field.  We think that is something that must be address because there is an issue with school attendance.  If one addresses the mental health needs of those children and young people, one will get better school attendance.</p></speech>

What we have been hearing from the HSE mental health service is that it is having trouble getting the staff to apply for jobs.  I think it has something to do with the level of pay and the location of the jobs.</p></speech>

The recruitment model of the HSE is not helping.  It is not a locally sourced service but it is a national centralised system of recruitment.  It would be interesting from the perspective of the Children's Rights Alliance to conduct research into this and bring it back to the table.  From my research and from speaking to bodies such as Tusla and others, I know there is no local or regional recruitment drive but only a national campaign and the use of panels.  That is why I asked the questions around the community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  There has been 114 assistant psychologists put into community health care.  I thank the witnesses for their time and I think this is a point they might feed back to the HSE when they speak to it.</p></speech>

I have two points, the first of which is child homelessness.  Nobody in this room will disagree on what needs to be done, but unfortunately it is not happening quickly enough.  We need social and affordable housing.  In the meantime for a child who is living day-to-day in a provision for the homeless, what can we do to make life better for that child?  The witnesses can talk us through the impacts of homelessness.  We hear so much about the emotional impact, as well as the impact on health but is there anything we can do between the time the child goes to school comes home to help that child?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019050800002#W01000"><p>There is quite a lot we could be doing to address the situation for the 3,824 children who are in homeless accommodation.  One thing that is striking about our housing laws and policy is that they were developed at a time when the main group of people availing of homeless services were men with addiction issues, rough sleepers and so on.  Given that children make up such a significant cohort of the homeless population, it is something we need to look at.  If we oblige decision makers to make decisions in the best interests of children, it would mean that when they develop accommodation solutions, that they have to think about the child.  One of the issues we hear from our members is that there is a major variation in the stock that is used in homeless services.  One might get a family hub with great facilities for families, such as great play facilities and then another might not have sufficient facilities at all.  The early years providers of services are seeing that.  They see children who do not have play facilities, children who do not a have a space to crawl and the big concern for very young children is that they will miss all their developmental milestones so that when they arrive at school, they will be way behind all the other children as well.</p> <p>  When it comes to the educational and emotional welfare of young people going through this experience, what was very striking from the Ombudsman for Children's consultation was the fact that children themselves did not see family hubs as the solution to homelessness.  What they want is a home as soon as possible, they want security because it is such a destabilising experience.  Something we have called for in our campaigns, Report Card 2019 and No Child 2020 is a time limit on the use of homeless accommodation.  If one minimises it to six months, one could try to minimise the impact of institutionalisation.</p><p>We are seeing the impact of institutionalisation on children, especially in the consultation document from the Ombudsman for Children and the research we commissioned last year on homelessness.  To give examples, 14 year old children do not have the possibility of being able to go to the family room on their own.  Children have to sign in every day, which makes them feel there are in a prison.  They are told what to do by other adults other than their parents.  That is what institutionalisation starts to feel like.</p><p> Another piece, from an educational point of view, which we uncovered in research we published last year was the distinction between a DEIS school and a non-DEIS school.  The DEIS school has more flexibility, a breakfast club and funding to provide extra supports for children.  In the main, schools are doing the best they can and doing a very good job for the children.  What non-DEIS schools have told us is that they have no flexible budgets to do anything.  If a child arrives in a dirty school uniform, they have no money available and teachers are spending their own money to buy clothes for a child.  They are also spending their own money to feed children.  What the schools have stated they need for a temporary period is a home-school liaison officer or teacher to support families.  Principals say they sometimes ring Focus Ireland, accommodation providers or hotels to try to get a family into accommodation.  A home-school liaison officer could do that work.  The findings of the research show that the emotional well-being of families is being affected.  Teachers say this happens over a period of time.  When that starts to happen, children start to miss school because they are ashamed of having to describe their situation as homelessness.  They say they have to leave early and cannot hang out with their friends after school.  They start to lose their motivation and they are more vulnerable to dropping out.  That is where we need a school completion programme.  We have had a lot of dealings with them in tracking the children to make sure we can keep them in school, but it is really about supporting the school to promote the well-being of children and give them the emotional toolkit they need to mind their mental health and emotions and giving schools the resources they need to do the best job they can.</p></speech>

Has Ms Ward found that the programme is working better than when it was within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills?  It is now under Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, or has she seen a decline in service?</p></speech>

Of what we are aware is that Tusla does not have sufficient educational welfare officers to do the job.  It responds to all reports, but it needs more educational welfare officers because it needs to be able to chase the non-attendance of children in school.  If one looks at Carol Coulter's report which documents children in child care cases in the courts, one will see that a significant number have not been in school.  One wonders what happened from an educational point of view.  If one looks at the statistics for children in the Oberstown centre, one will find that a significant number were not in school.  How come they were not in school?  How come measures were not taken to address the issue?  It is an issue that at the very least needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

We have made a number of submissions on it to the joint committee and the Department.  We hear that there is a consultation process in place with children and young people, which is an initiative for which we had called in the past couple of years.  We hope the experiences of children will enhance the legislation.  We welcome the latest iteration of the Bill, with the new executive office under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, as opposed to Tusla.  That is something for which we have called.  The status of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is the key outstanding issue for us because it will be a witness, as opposed to a party, in a case.</p><p>That undermines the role guardians <i>ad litem</i>currently have.  It dilutes the powers they have and the way they are able to represent children.  I refer to cross examination, for example.  One of the main areas where the convention has evolved over years is that guardians <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, would be able to cross examine through a lawyer - for example, it would be able to cross examine Tusla - on decisions taken.  They would be severely limited in their ability to cross examine and that would fundamentally impact the role that the guardians <i>ad litem</i>play and the way that children's voices are heard in proceedings that have a huge impact on their lives.</p></speech>

Anybody we have been speaking to has raised that.  They believe that is watering down the service because it is an invaluable service.  As Ms Quinn said, it is representing children's voices.  Does the role itself need to be enhanced?  When we look at figures from different counties, appointments of guardians <i>ad litem</i>are made quicker in some counties.  Is there anything Ms Quinn would like to see happen with that?</p></speech>

What we are seeing at the moment is that there is a real variance across the country.  In Louth guardians <i>ad litem</i>are appointed in around 75% to 80% of cases whereas in Galway it is down to 13%.  It is really necessary for judges in courthouses across the country to apply this to a more consistent level to ensure that guardians <i>ad litem</i>are appointed and to ensure that the judges give reasons if they are not appointing them.  That would hopefully help in that area.</p></speech>

We find the engagement we have with Government Departments when we are developing the Report Card to be open and transparent.  We would submit questions to the different Government Departments and try to get behind the rationale for some of the initiatives that might not be happening or to try to understand what the delays are and we find that generally, most Government Departments are open to recommendations and ideas when it comes to the different initiatives.  Ms Quinn manages all these relationships so she can give the Senator her direct experience of it.</p></speech>

We find that they are keen to highlight the work they have done so for the most part they tend to engage well and provide us with the data we need.  That is helpful.  We know every year that when it comes to completing our Report Card we can find the information we need and help our members with that as well if they are looking for particular information.  We find that it is a positive engagement, something that we have built up over years and we actively work to maintain that positive relationship.</p></speech>

It is only a two year strategy so we are about a year in.  I have not seen many actions completed but that said, they could be teeing everything up for the second the year.  Relationships, sexuality, education, bullying in schools, gender recognition and the legal relationship between LGBTI parents and their children will all come up but it is a fitting grade given the publication of the strategy.</p> <p>  I would love to stay on the various details but we would be going around in circles if we did.

There was a vigorous campaign last year that children should be given it, not only at school time but over the summer period to allow families to take their children out.  One is only talking about eight weeks.  It is something that, when we have the Minister in, we can raise again.</p></speech>

We might take it upon ourselves to get in contact with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to the issue.  It would seem to be one of those costs that involves a net benefit to the State in the long run.  Of course, we would need to determine what the cost is first.

A piece of work might need to be done to link the services together so that there are data-sharing agreements, which are obviously GDPR compliant, put in place to make them aware so that they can get those services in.  The key is getting children out of those facilities, particularly if they are inappropriate in any way, and trying to give them some sense of normality.</p> <p>  What was striking from the homework research we published last year, which looked at children experiencing homelessness, was that education facilities, such as cr&egrave;ches, Montessori schools, primary schools and secondary schools, are a place of solace for children.  They provide their only sense of normality.  The better the engagement that they have and the better the support that those institutions are given, the better the outcomes for children.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce Ms Edina O'Driscoll, project manager for the neurorehabilitation demonstrator project.  She is here in a voluntary capacity at our invitation in order to address any queries on this project which I will mention in the course of my statement.</p> <p>  Over 800,000 Irish people are living with neurological conditions, ranging from common conditions such as migraine, dementia and epilepsy to rare neurological disease, with approximately 40,000 additional people diagnosed each year.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, is the national advocacy group for neurological care, representing over 30 patient organisations.  We work closely with the Disability Federation of Ireland in promoting recognition of the need for community supports for people living with neurological conditions and the vital role played by voluntary organisations, including MS Ireland, in providing these services.</p> <p>  I wish to briefly highlight an issue which I do not have sufficient time to deal with in detail but which continues to impact significantly on people with neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, MS.  I refer to access to medicines.  The NAI supports the call by the Medical Research Charities Group and the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry for the development and implementation of a national strategy on access to new and innovative medicines.  The remainder of my statement will focus on the specific challenges in accessing neurology and neurorehabilitation services and call for investment in a series of specific projects which the NAI believes could make a significantly positive impact.</p> <p>  Neurorehabilitation services are critical to support recovery and prevent disability for people with neurological conditions.  The ongoing lack of access to specialist rehabilitation continues to have a devastating impact on individuals and their families, resulting in unnecessary disability and impinging on the precious potential for recovery.  Ireland has less than half of the specialist inpatient beds needed for its population and community-based services are totally underdeveloped, with only three community healthcare organisations, CHOs, having dedicated, but still only partially staffed, community neurorehabilitation teams.</p> <p>  A three-year implementation framework for the 2011 national policy and strategy for neurorehabilitation services was finally published by the HSE in February.  While implementation of this framework is included as a key action within the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, this will be impossible without dedicated funding.  A critical starting point is the need for investment in the neurorehabilitation demonstrator project.  This project is an innovative collaboration between acute hospitals, the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the Royal Hospital Donnybrook, Peamount Healthcare, local voluntary providers and primary care to develop a managed clinical rehabilitation network which will improve access to specialist neurorehabilitation for people in CHO areas 6 and 7.  This is not just about introducing a new service, this pilot project is fully in line with the aims of Sl&aacute;intecare to provide an integrated approach to the management of chronic neurological conditions, reducing length of stay in acute hospitals, saving bed days and most importantly, ensuring that people receive the right care in the right place when they need it.</p> <p>  I want to move on to a series of proposed projects to address the challenges in neurology services.  The neurology clinical programme recognises that over 20,000 patients are awaiting neurological evaluation, of whom at least 30% suffer from headache.  Headache represents the second most frequent condition presenting to acute medical assessment units.  In response to this, and in collaboration with the Irish Pharmacy Union and the Migraine Association of Ireland, the neurology programme has developed a new pathway of care that will expedite headache management to a community-focused model in an innovative, quality driven and cost-effective way in line with the aims of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The neurology programme also recognises that many neurological diseases are rare, requiring national centres of expertise.  Therefore, an innovative, agile and sustainable management plan has been developed using motor neurone disease as a model, that integrates care across the hospital community and capitalises on the expertise of the voluntary sector to provide high-quality, evidence-based, streamlined care for patients from diagnosis to end of life.</p><p> Finally, the neurology programme recognises the importance of providing evidence-based, disease-modifying treatments in a cost-effective manner for neurological disease.  The programme is developing an evidence-based treatment pathway for multiple sclerosis that can be replicated for other neurological diseases for which new, highly effective but costly treatments are anticipated.</p><p> The NAI is calling for investment in the initiatives outlined as a key opportunity to begin to address the huge challenges faced by people living with neurological conditions.  All the proposals are fully costed and ready for implementation.  Detailed descriptions have already been circulated to the committee or are available on request.  The NAI wishes to stress that a commitment to ongoing investment in neurology and neurorehabilitation services needs to be a key part of any future programme for Government.  We look forward to working with the committee in shaping future policy.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Paula Leonard, from the Alcohol Forum.  Ours is a national charity that provides support, information and services to people, families and communities impacted upon by alcohol harm.  I am Dr. Helen McMonagle, and I am speaking in the first instance in my capacity as a rehabilitation co-ordinator for people affected by a condition that is largely excluded in many national dialogues regarding alcohol, disability and neurorehabilitation in Ireland.</p> <p>  ARBI is a brain injury that is acquired as a result of the toxic effect of alcohol on the brain and the nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition that often accompany this pattern of alcohol use.  Over the past seven years of providing support in respect of this condition, I have seen, at first hand, the devastating range of brain-based difficulties that result from ARBI, including difficulties with memory, attention, planning, reasoning and judgment, all of which interfere with a person's ability to lead an independent life.  ARBI prevents people from overcoming problems with addiction and exposes them to a range of personal and social vulnerabilities, including risks to their health, safety and personal well-being.  This perfect storm of addiction and reduced cognitive capabilities, alongside poor identification rates, results in a vicious cycle of repeated hospital admissions and worsening prognoses for those affected.  Four recent reports - the intercollegiate report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, General Practitioners, Physicians and Neurologists of England and Northern Ireland and reports from the Scottish Executive, Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government - highlight the growing concerns surrounding the increasing numbers of men and women in their 40s, 50s and 60s developing this brain injury as a result of alcohol use, and calls for support services to be urgently developed to meet their rehabilitative needs.  Our local research, which we submitted to the committee, and our ongoing work to support people in the CHO 1 area, continue to highlight the health service limbo in which these individuals exist.  This condition belongs to no one HSE directorate.  It is a condition for which there is no leadership, strategic planning or care pathway for in our country.  This is very difficult to comprehend when a recent review of the numbers shows that this condition has had a &euro;6 million burden in three acute hospitals in the CHO 1 area over the last five years.  It has been shown internationally to contribute significantly to the burden of dementia, particularly early onset dementia, a large portion of the homeless population, and affects between 0.4% and 2.8% of the general population.  One person in eight is dependent on alcohol.</p> <p>  The committee must know that people with ARBI have no natural advocates.  They will not self-present to their GPs, local Deputies or the media in order to highlight the inequity that exists for this condition.  There is no professional group taking the baton and speaking on their behalf.</p><p>Our work with local services in Donegal mirrors the findings of many other sites internationally, namely, that providing targeted supports in this area results in better outcomes for people affected and a reduction in the cost burden relating to the condition. Having just one case co-ordinator, a local care pathway and a willingness among local services to work with people with the condition in the county, we have freed up the equivalent of one bed in our local hospital for two and a half years, or 939 fewer bed days.  In cost terms, Letterkenny University Hospital has spent &euro;850,000 less than Sligo University Hospital and &euro;700,000 less than Cavan General Hospital responding to this condition in the past five years.</p><p> We know that the detrimental impact of this condition extends beyond the people of Donegal and is a problem across the whole island of Ireland.  I am here today to make one request, namely, that this committee mirror the efforts of the Scottish Government and Welsh Government in this area and the intercollegiate efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  We ask members to support the establishment of a national working group to scope the needs of this population in an Irish context and deliver recommendations and a strategy to this committee as to the best way to respond to the growing needs of the cohort of affected persons.  Without that scrutiny and oversight, my fear is that people with ARBI will continue to perish in silence, being passed from pillar to post and with each service director refusing to take responsibility for the problem, as millions are spent on ineffective delayed discharges at an acute level.  We know from international work that it does not have to be like this.  Challenging and initiating change in respect of this issue is a win-win for everybody involved.  We hope the committee will give our request due consideration in proportion to the scale of the problem we face.</p></speech>

It is important to state at the outset that no mother intends to cause harm to her child and that foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASDs, are not the result of an uncaring act.  There are complex reasons that women drink during pregnancy and I hope we will return to them later in the discussion.  Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in the world.  More children are born every year with FASD than are born with autism spectrum disorder, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome combined.  FASDs are brain-based impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.  Alcohol has been documented as a toxic teratogenic substance for more than 40 years.  It passes freely through the placenta during pregnancy and results in a range of learning and neurological disabilities, behavioural deficits, difficulties with regulation of mood and behaviour, cognitive deficits and impaired executive functioning.</p> <p>  As outlined on page 3 of our submission, people with FASD are at an increased risk of a range of difficulties across their lifespan.  More than half will serve jail sentences or be confined in drug treatment or psychiatric facilities as adults.  The prison experience for people with FASD must be understood within a context.  Many of them have difficulties with impulse control, an inability to learn from punishment and discipline and difficulty understanding and adhering to rules.  Some 92% of people with FASD will receive a secondary formal mental health diagnosis.  Although FASDs are permanent, diagnosis, early intervention and support have been proven to mitigate associated risks, including poor mental health, addiction and suicide.  Early diagnosis can help to identify other associated health conditions.  In fact, 428 co-occurring conditions have been identified across 127 studies of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, including epilepsy, heart defects, compromised auditory function and compromised immune system.</p> <p>  In an international review conducted last year, Ireland was featured as one of five countries with the highest prevalence of foetal alcohol syndrome, FAS.  The latter is at the most severe end of the FASD spectrum, with the greatest alcohol effects, including physical malformations.  It is estimated that 600 babies are born with FAS in Ireland each year and that 40,000 people are living with the condition.</p><p>The numbers of those affected by FASDs, ranging in nature from mild to severe, could be ten times that figure because international evidence indicates that for every case of FAS, there are at least ten cases of FASD.</p><p> We are delighted to be here in the context of a review of neurological supports and services in Ireland.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends action to deal with neurological disorders associated with the consumption of toxic compounds, including alcohol.  A number of recommendations to this committee are made and shown on page 4 of our submission.  The key recommendation is for clear clinical guidelines on the diagnosis of FASD to be developed and agreed.  The development and adoption of clear diagnostic criteria will assist clinicians in the assignment of more accurate diagnoses of FASD and pave the way to more widespread early intervention, improved prevention efforts and cost savings.</p></speech>

I am familiar with many members so I will not go into too much detail on the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI.  We are an umbrella organisation that supports over 120 disability organisations and works with many others.  We provide information, training, networking, advocacy and representation, research and policy development and organisational development.</p> <p>  I will start by asking if we know who we are talking about when we refer to the disabled.  According to census 2016, 13.5% of the population, or 643,131 people, identify as having at least one disability.  One in four of those acquire a disability at working age, meaning that most of them are likely to be already in work, married or living in their own homes in their communities.  Once the onset of disability occurs, timely access to neurorehabilitation services will directly impact on a person's life and family so we fully endorse the NAI's call for greater investment in neurological and neurorehabilitation services.  However, DFI can only do half the job alone because most people with disabilities will continue to live in their own homes and communities.  They may have a short-term intervention in the form of acute services but they will return to their communities and, unless we invest in a solid community services programme that supports them and their families to live and navigate the world with their neurological condition, we will be putting money in false places.</p> <p>  We also need to ask what the disability spend is achieving.  We currently spend &euro;1.9 billion on disability, health and personal social services in Ireland.  In 2019, 85% of the HSE disability budget supports over 8,500 people through a range of residential supports and for 27,000 people in day places.  We are not questioning the need for these individuals to receive that support.  However, a small cohort of the disability population is soaking up a large amount of the disability spend.  These figures reinforce a report compiled as part of the value-for-money and policy review of disability services for the Department of Health.  Less than 10% of funding is directed towards community services programmes such as personal assistants, respite, day services and other services, areas where the neurorehabilitation services are involved.</p> <p>  Community services and supports are mostly co-funded by a range of disability organisations.  Ms Battles will give members a good sense of what that means.  Many of these are condition-specific and help individuals and families to navigate the diagnosis and develop strategies for self-management and for access to a range of services such as acute and primary care services, housing services, social welfare services and local education and training services which they need to retrain or reskill to enable them to return to work.  We fully support the call for acute neurorehabilitation services but we also call for a better understanding of, and investment in, a range of specific community services.</p><p>They include home supports, family supports and health and well-being services which Ms Battles will go through further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.329" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ava Battles" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019050800002#S00200"><p>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland was established in 1961.  In the 58 years since its foundation its mission has evolved to support people with multiple sclerosis, MS, in the rapidly changing therapeutic, social, political and economic environment.  It is the only national organisation that provides information, support and advocacy services for the MS community.  Our mission is to enable and empower people affected by MS to live the life of their choice to their full potential.<br/><br/>We receive 52% of our funding from the State and 48% through fundraising initiatives.  We are very cognisant of the lack of neurorehabilitation services available to people with MS and a wide range of other neurological conditions.  We are also very aware that MS and other progressive neurological conditions can have both physical and psychological consequences which may have an enormous long-term impact on almost every aspect of the daily lives of those affected.  Being aware of this and obviously everything Ms Rogers and Dr. McCarthy said, we believe that, as a voluntary organisation, we have a variety of creative and dynamic ways to mitigate the deficits mentioned.  I would like to take the joint committee through two or three of them.<br/><br/>One is our exercise related activity programmes that are run in the community.  As Dr. McCarthy said, most people come back out and live in their community after their diagnosis.  When we won &quot;Tesco charity of the year&quot; a number of years ago, the money was put into a research project with the University of Limerick's physiotherapy department.  The results of the research clearly demonstrated that, to effect change in an MS population, physical activity needed to be delivered with frequency and intensity to maintain the change.  The results also showed that when people stopped, they returned to a baseline, or often worsened.  We know from the research that a person with MS will probably, if he or she is lucky to receive it because it is provided on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, receive one hour's worth of physiotherapy from the State in his or her local community.  That is if he or she can get out of his or her home and travel to the physiotherapy class, or even get into it because a lot of the places in which classes are being run are not accessible.  We know that we have an issue in that regard.<br/><br/>We provide around &euro;200,000 of fundraised income a year for the provision and delivery of physiotherapy and exercise-related programmes.  In 2018, 1,802 people accessed the programmes in the Twenty-six Counties.  The delivery of the programmes is supported by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Therefore, what we have are community employment programmes, as part of which we have people participating in a back-to-work programme training to become physiotherapy assistants.  The physiotherapist makes the assessment of a person in the community and the trained physiotherapy assistants will go out to him or her on a weekly basis for the physiotherapy class.  It is someone who may not be able to get out of his or her house because he or she does not have transport from his or her rural location into the community or he or she may feel he or she is not able to do so because of fatigue.  Our physiotherapy assistants will go to the house and we know from the research that it is not only the actual physical activity that improves a person's mental and physical health but also the interaction with others and the social engagement with them.  The physiotherapy programmes came from the initial research programme and are being delivered throughout the country.  We have continued the relationship with the University of Limerick and developed two new evidence-based programmes with the focus on prevention.  They are being run with funding we have received where funding is restricted to research initiatives.  <br/><br/>The first programme about which I would like to tell the committee is Step it Up.  It is a physiotherapy-led exercise and education programme designed to improve symptoms through knowledge, exercise participation and coaching.  It has primarily been designed for people who are inactive, have minimal walking problems and been relatively recently diagnosed with the condition.  Its central aim is to encourage participants to address and plan for their physical activity needs.  Let us put it into reality.  Let us take someone called Mary, a 24 year old female nurse.  She has received a diagnosis of MS and is struggling to maintain her daily activity levels in her work.  As she is finding it really difficult, she comes to our community worker for an assessment.  The reality for her is that she is just about able to work during the week and when she comes home in the evening, she has to go to bed.  She is exhausted and needs the weekend to recover.  She is referred to one of our Step it Up programmes.</p><p>Based on a 12-week programme, she is now running with her dog and, as of last week, she was running up a hill.  This is real.  We can spout statistics all we want but I wanted to try to make it real for members.  Mary is a person who is now no longer concerned about not being able to work and she is no longer considering retiring at 27.  She is actively participating in and contributing to society and paying her taxes and she now has better quality of life.</p><p> The other programme, Better Balance, is a physiotherapy-led exercise and education programme designed to improve balance and reduce falls.  It is suited to those who have recently experienced a fall or who are afraid of falling.  It does not apply only to people with MS but it is obviously related.  Its central aim is to encourage the self-reflection of participants in their daily lives to avoid falls.  A 44 year old female who has retired from her employment due to multiple sclerosis had fallen three times in a two-year period and had three fractures.  She has not fallen in the past 12 weeks and is now going back out and socialising.  One must look at it from her point of view, that is, the point of view of someone who is 44 and retired.  These programmes are enabling her to participate in her community and increasing her quality of life.</p><p> We have taken all the research I have mentioned in respect of the two programmes and turned it into an Activity Matters programme, which is available on a website.  One can avail of it in one&rsquo;s own home, as long as one has an Internet connection.</p></speech>

Again, it is about us, as an organisation, trying to ascertain the needs of those on the ground and develop programmes that actually work for people when they are back in the community.</p> <p>  Let me mention two other programmes.  We have a 12-bed respite facility that operates in Dublin.  People come to it from all over the country.  It is not only a place where a person can get an MS NCT but it also presents an opportunity for carers who are looking after individuals with MS daily to get a break while the latter stay with us for five, seven or 12 nights.</p> <p>  With regard to working collaboratively with other organisations, we work with RehabCare in the west.  Unfortunately, it is only in the west.  The HSE provides funding to RehabCare for people with cognitive rehabilitation needs.  They come to us and meet our community worker and we identify their cognitive issues.  They are then referred to the RehabCare cognitive programme and receive an assessment.  They engage in a 12-week programme.  Again, the programme improves the quality of life for people with MS in the community.</p> <p>  As an organisation that provides services to people in the community, we support 100% the recommendations of the NAI and the DFI to this committee today.</p></speech>

They also run community-based programmes that facilitate people and support them in keeping healthy.</p> <p>  The DFI continues to endorse the calls from the NAI but we have two specific points.  First, we are seeking to secure a multi-annual investment programme, worth &euro;200 million over a five-year period, to bed down community-based resources and infrastructure that support people to continue to live with conditions in their homes and as best they can in their communities.</p> <p>  We want members to commit to the development of a strategy for community services and supports that brings coherence to this work and joins it up with the neurorehabilitation strategy, the value-for-money programme and the primary care strategy.  It should result in coherence so those conditions can experience seamless passage in and out of services.  We are asking members to endorse that.  We are reminding them that there more than 600,000 people with disabilities depend on these types of services, not on residential services or day services.  One in four of us today will probably end up depending on these types of services.  We are asking members to commit to supporting the development of the services those with disabilities need on a daily basis.</p></speech>

What is needed in the south of the country?  I had expected a representative of the HSE to attend, whom I had intended to ask what it was going to do about it.  Perhaps our guests could answer the question in a few sentences.  If they had a magic wand, what would they provide that is required in the south of the country?</p></speech>

Cork contains the second national neuroscience and neurosurgical centre.  The national neurorehabilitation strategy makes a number of recommendations for the development of specialist neurorehabilitation facilities to bring Ireland up to the minimum standard for the number of specialist beds it should have.  We recommend and endorse providing such a facility.  The number of beds, their location and so on need to be decided operationally and in conjunction with the roll-out of the national trauma strategy.</p></speech>

Best practice around the world cites the need for a specialist transitional unit in the community to facilitate early hospital discharge and free up beds at an acute level.

While I am very familiar with the other organisations represented and have worked with them, I am not as familiar with the Alcohol Forum.  Reading through the submission it sent to the committee, it is very disappointing to note the lack of experience in the area of assessment and the associated stigma.  I note that 80% of people affected are missed diagnostically.  Will the forum's representatives expand on this?  In this day and age, I cannot believe there is still stigma attached to the condition.</p></speech>

It is not specific to Ireland, rather it seems to be the case internationally.  It is only in the last ten years that research in this area has spiked, given the increased number of people coming through with the condition.  We know from a recent research paper published by the Care Services Improvement Partnership in the United Kingdom that there is a lack of diagnostic expertise and training to diagnose an alcohol-related brain injury among core professional groups.  The paper also set out that professionals often stigmatised patients and failed to see an underlying brain injury because they believed challenging behaviours or individual difficulties were due to individuals' alcohol use.  Professionals failed to recognise that it might be the result of a brain injury and to question whether something other than alcohol use might be going on with someone.  The consistent absence of resources in this area in Ireland does not incentivise professionals to identify the condition.  If it is identified, what does the professional do with the person who has it?  There is a great deal we could do to increase the identification rate and adopt best practice in the management of this condition.  We need to build expertise in the recognition and management of this group not only in addiction services but also in acute services.  There should be routine screening of cognition and malnutrition among long-term heavy users of alcohol.  That would help greatly to improve identification rates.  It should be spurred on by the fact that the prognosis for the condition is very good if identified early enough.  Over 25% of people can make a full recovery, while a further 25% can make a partial recovery and another 25% can make a significant recovery.</p></speech>

I welcome the strategy.  However, we can have all the strategies and plans we want but if we do not have enough neurologists, then the waiting lists will continue to increase.  Will new neurology posts be created?</p><p>Was Ms Rogers surprised that the capacity of the new National Rehabilitation Hospital will not be increased to meet the waiting lists?</p><p>Do the organisations support an inquiry into the foetal valproate syndrome scandal?  Are the organisations active in demanding that inquiry from the Minister?  Recently, the <i>British Medical Journal</i>concluded the evidence of the risks of congenital malformations in women exposed to valproate was clear as far back as 1990.  The risks of this drug were beyond all doubt from 2005 but it continued to be prescribed to women in pregnancy.</p><p>Do the organisations know when a decision will be made on Spinraza?  The availability of such new drugs would feed into these services by cutting down on the amount and cost of care for neurodegenerative disorders.</p></speech>

We would constantly highlight the need for recruitment.  In 2015, the Neurological Alliance of Ireland carried out an audit of neurology services in the neurology clinical programme.  The results still stand.  In fact, they have worsened if anything.  We found that none of the 11 neurology centres had a full multidisciplinary team, even the national neuroscience centres in Cork and Dublin.</p> <p>  Depending on the neurology service, it is a patchwork solution to see more people without putting the personnel required in place.  An increase in the number of neurologists is critically needed.  These conditions will grow as the population ages.  We are not going to see a decline in the number of people with neurological diseases but an increase.  To deal with early diagnosis and intervention, we will need the people on the ground and not just neurologists but also members of the multidisciplinary teams.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ava Battles" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019050800002#X00900"><p>Before we deal with that topic, I want to reiterate what Ms Rogers said about the multidisciplinary team.  A person needs an early diagnosis and that is vital.  However, I reiterate that such a person will go back into the community and will need the multidisciplinary approach which includes occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and neuropsychologists.  Neurologists were like hen's teeth when I started working in the sector and now we have 34.  That is great but it is ridiculous that somebody might wait a year to get a diagnosis.  There is much that can happen to somebody's underlying condition in a year.</p> <p>  I will reference the issue about access to medicines.  I will not speak specifically about Spinraza but I want to reference the issue of access to medicines.  We believe that people should have access to the right treatment at the right time.  There is a body of international evidence to show that people should be diagnosed early and treated appropriately.  In Ireland, we have an issue with access to new medications.  Someone who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, MS, 20 years ago would have been sent home, told to rest and given nothing.  Thankfully, neurologists now have a suite of 15 or 16 disease-modifying therapies at their disposal but new medications are coming on-stream all the time.  The difficulty is that people cannot access them because they are not getting through the current system.  I reiterate what Ms Rogers said earlier about the Medical Research Charities Group and the Irish Platform for Patients Organisations, Science and Industry stressing that we need to look at how that system is currently not working and how people get access to it.  The important thing is to keep people well, participating and contributing to society because the more we do that, the better it is for everybody.  I wanted to make those comments.</p></speech>

It has been proven in France and cases are going through the system in that jurisdiction which will likely be settled within a number of weeks.  I also mentioned earlier the conclusions of the <i>British Medical Journal </i>so the issue is not unique to Ireland.

It is important to understand that alcohol fits within the family of known teratogens and, in that context, we need one very clear message.  We need clinical guidelines established and an unequivocal message, from the top right down to GPs, as to the teratogenic properties of alcohol.  It has been considered a teratogen since 1996 and is also considered carcinogenic.  We also know it is a neurotoxin as was demonstrated by Dr. McGonagle's presentation on the development of brain injury.</p><p>For the families who have been impacted, it is important that there be clarity, consensus and openness.  We need to know the numbers impacted and have recognition of that.</p></speech>

I refer to foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and the issue of information.  I spoke recently to a front-line worker in the health service who had been dealing for three months with a pregnant patient diagnosed as having cocaine her system.  We are not only talking about alcohol only but a combination of alcohol and drugs.  A figure of 600 cases annually was given.  Are figures available from hospitals to show if the problem is greater in particular areas?  Is enough being done to get information out about consuming alcohol during pregnancy?  Abuse of alcohol is a major issue.  As we speak, approximately 2,000 of those occupying hospital beds for reasons directly related to excessive consumption of alcohol.  Is enough being done to educate people on this issue or is a more intense campaign needed?</p> <p>  On individual hospitals, some years ago, at least ten babies in the care of the Rotunda Hospital on any one day were suffering from withdrawal symptoms following birth.  Has that figure increased in real terms in the past ten years?  Such an increase would mean that our information systems are not working at a local or national level.  What must be done to highlight the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy?  How can that be factor into healthcare information programmes?  Can more be done in this regard?  Has any similar programme been shown to work in other countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.389" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Leonard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019050800002#Y00300"><p>On other programmes that have been shown to work, there is an acceptance at a global level that prevention on its own is not adequate to address issues in relation to foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  It is necessary to have a long-term strategy for the provision of supports, services and diagnostics to families who are impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure.  That said, there is a role for prevention and many forward steps have been taken in that area.  Levels of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in a population are linked to population level consumption.  On the positive side, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act has been introduced and the HSE has established a clinical working group on foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and appointed a clinical lead.  This group and the lead specialist have clearly marked out that the areas they will cover are prevention, education and population level messages.  That is very welcome and the DFI is happy it is happening.  In addition, through the Department of Health, an additional seven drug liaison midwives will be appointed under the national drugs strategy to work with women who have issues with alcohol addiction and support them in moving towards alcohol-free pregnancies.</p> <p>  While much has been done in this area, we have not yet reached a point where the policy and medical areas have one clear message.  At an international level, the World Health Organization says that no amount of alcohol intake during pregnancy can be considered safe, there is no safe trimester in which one might drink alcohol, all forms of alcohol pose a similar risk and binge drinking poses a dose-related risk.  We should all be concerned that binge drinking is very much the signifier of how people in this country drink.</p><p>Population level consumption was going down over a number of years but binge drinking continued to be the norm.</p><p> While we would welcome all of the developments I have mentioned, it is important that we do not just view this in the narrow space of prevention.  There will always be women who continue to drink during pregnancy.  The European Birth Mother Network is a group of mothers with children who have been impacted by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASDs.  The network is clear that there is a complex mix of reasons for women drinking during pregnancy, for example, childhood trauma, addiction and knowing people who drank during pregnancy and whose children were okay.  Not every alcohol exposed pregnancy will result in a child with an FASD.  These are important messages.  Another reason for prevention alone being a major challenge is that women may often not know that they are pregnant until they are five, six, seven or eight weeks into their pregnancies and the foetus may be exposed to alcohol during that period.</p><p> There are a range of reasons that we must approach this issue in a no stigma, no shame and no blame way and we must understand that it is complex.  We need prevention and a clear message from our medical community but we will also need supports and services, which can only follow on from diagnostics.  That is why we are asking committee members to use whatever access and influence they have to support the call for the development of clear diagnostic criteria for foetal alcohol syndrome, FAS, and FASD.</p></speech>

The figures that I have supplied at this meeting and in our submission have been extrapolated from international studies that used population level data and where the relevant figures were known.  Studies have examined drinking rates in Ireland and the number of women who have self-reported drinking during pregnancy and extrapolated from those figures.  It is likely that the figures in Ireland are higher.  From addiction services, we know that the number of people who are presenting with more than one addiction, for example, alcohol plus drugs, is increasing in Ireland.  This must be addressed in policy and services.</p></speech>

Their evidence challenges us in a number of ways.  I look forward to reading the transcript.  We may need to re-examine the issue.  Much has been raised at this meeting that we cannot get into in this session alone - prevention, different service mixes, who provides what, impacts on lives, etc.  I will leave that there, though.</p> <p>  I will start with Dr. McCarthy's presentation.  She stated that 85% of the &euro;1.9 billion for disability services was expended on residential day services and respite.  Those types of services go back to old God's time when we did not have diagnostics, we tried to put people in caring places and we did not have much else going on.  I would be interested in short responses to my question.  Do we have the wrong ratios in disability services funding?  While I am not suggesting that the services and supports receiving the 85% of funding are not needed, only 15% is being spent on supports that are located in the community even though it was pointed out that many people return to and try to survive in their communities.  This is particularly the case for the cohort we are discussing today, namely, people with neurological conditions.</p><p>How might Sl&aacute;intecare be part of the proposed solutions?  Is it lacking in this regard or does it have potential?</p><p> I thank Ms Roger's for her presentation on behalf of the NAI.  The national policy and strategy for neurological services was published in 2011 but the implementation plan relating to it was only published in February.  What has been the loss of progress in those eight years of not having an implementation plan?  Such a plan will never provide the billions required to address all of the issues but, in my view, producing strategies without timely implementation plans for the same year is wrong.  A strategy or policy without an implementation plan is akin to providing pain relief.  It is a three-card trick.</p><p> The impact of medicines was mentioned.  One of our guests stated that, dating back over 20 years or so, there was not a lot in terms of medicines to give to people.  I know from meeting people who suffer with MS that the lack of medicine in the early 80s made life pretty grim for them, which impacted greatly on their families.  The same applies in regard to other neurological conditions.  How has the development of medicines that can modify conditions impacted on people's daily lives and what is needed to further increase that impact?</p><p> I welcome the presentations on ARBI and FASD.  Dr. McGonagle mentioned that identification of ARBI is poor and referenced data relating to Letterkenny, Sligo and Cavan.  We hear a lot about continued waste in the health services.  I am not too sure that when they speak about such waste, people are referring to the effects of misdiagnosis.  Rather, they are speaking about items being thrown out or not used properly.</p><p> The recommendations put forward in the presentations are interesting in that they are not financial asks but calls for inquiries into what is being done for the thousands of people who suffer with conditions from which they are many knock-on effects, including for their families.  The recommendations are a plea to us, as a committee, to do what we can to improve services in this area.</p></speech>

That is not the intention.</p><p>I needed people to see the starkness of the inequity in accessing disability services in Ireland.</p><p> There was a question about whether we had the wrong models of support.  Without a doubt, this would have been mentioned in our policy review in the context of value for money.  Looking at what is expected of us under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, of course, we have the wrong mix of services.  People with disabilities and their families should be confident that they can receive services as close as possible to their local community.  This resonates with what we are talking about with respect to neurorehabilitation services.  The services should be as individual as possible.  It is no surprise that there has been no real increase in personal assistant and respite care services; such services facilitate a person in living in the community.</p><p> There is also the issue arising from the lack of demographic evidence to support the case for transitioning to a new model of service.  That is what is being attempted in decongregation and supporting new models of day services.  The evidence is available and people know the data and what they are talking about.  It can be planned.  It is very hard to speak about a new model of service with community services infrastructure when there is no demographic evidence to show what the need will be time and again to support the planning process.  That is required to give confidence to the planners and those who will deliver the service, as well as those who will depend on it.</p><p> The member is correct that we could rewrite a service model for people with disabilities as it is not fit for purpose.  People need to live at home or independently, or at least as close to communities as possible.  The process must be person-centred and there should be a mix or range of personally driven services such as personal assistants and home supports.  We also spoke about episodic health interventions that were required.  The process needs to move beyond health, as it is only the enabler.  Health services should be available to enable people to access services provided by other Departments and agencies.  Education services should be delivered through the education and training boards, for example, and there should be support to deliver them in a mainstream way as much as possible.  Social welfare and housing services are all mainstream services, but we need a health service that has resources and provides supports such as personal assistant hours that are fit for purpose and which can support people in accessing mainstream services.  We need to reinvent our understanding of the role of health bodies and look more at the personal social services side of health services in order to invest in them.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare is very silent on disability services.  It speaks to the new neurorehabilitation strategy, but otherwise it is very silent on disability services, although there may be one or two references to them.  We are looking for an interface.  People with disabilities are heavy users of the health system.  They are the people who are presenting with neurological issues and availing of acute services.  They are people with acquired brain injury and in relapse.  They are heavy users of core health systems.  They are also using neurorehabilitation services through primary care services and access personal assistants and home supports.  They draw across the health system, but they are dealt with individually through each siloed part of the HSE.  Sl&aacute;intecare looks for joined-up services and we want to have them "disability-proofed".  How can we enable these models of service?  Ms Battles could probably give a better example, but the majority of services could be delivered within a much softer community-based infrastructure such as the resources and supports for self-management provided at community level.  There are times, with a peak in the condition, when access to primary care services is required, but there are also times, especially at the time of diagnosis, when more acute services have a role to play in intervention.  Equally, it is critical to have fluidity in step-down services.  Sometimes there is silence in Sl&aacute;intecare in understanding the population and how it uses the health service.  That is something on which we probably need to work.</p></speech>

It is a practical project that is Sl&aacute;intecare on the ground.  It is fulfilling its ethos, something for which we were looking.  It is happening, which is why we are calling for funding for the project.  It fulfils that remit and is the magic formula for integration across hospitals and the community for people who are living long term with the condition.</p></speech>

From my perspective, the loss has been the increase in the level of disability because people have not had access to services.  It has meant a decrease in their quality of life and resulted in young people living in nursing homes.  My colleague referred to silos in the HSE in not having conversations with each other.  One budget will not result in a person being given a home care package, but we will put a 42 year old man with three children into a nursing home to provide him with care for the rest of his life.  It is about having seamless services that put the person at the centre of service delivery and developing services around the person to meet his or her needs to stay well and in the community.  That brings us back to Sl&aacute;intecare's ethos.  The lack of progress has been huge for us and everybody involved.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the impact of medicines.  When medicines are being discussed, one often finds that the only ones that will be mentioned on radio are the ones that will give a person another few days or weeks of life.  There are very few discussions about how medicines improve a person's quality of life.  If one asks people with MS - I can only speak about this specifically - they say the fact that there are new medicines brings huge hope.  That is what people need; they need access to medicines that will keep them well.  If I was to say to all of the committee members present that they would not make it to the bathroom, we would all be very embarrassed.  It is something we take for granted because we can just get up and walk out to go to the bathroom.  For some people, however, a new medication can make all the difference and enable them to make it to the bathroom.  It means that they are no longer afraid to leave the house.  They can socialise and work.  It goes back to the points made about people making a contribution to society and having a better quality of life.  I would broaden it from access to medicines to access to all treatments across the board as being vitally important.  Sl&aacute;intecare looks at it from the point of view of keeping people well and the self-management piece in the community, but we need to put resources behind it.  There is no point in producing a lovely report and then leaving it on the shelf because it will not benefit anybody.</p></speech>

With alcohol related brain injury and foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD, we can demonstrate from the evidence that by providing for early intervention and supports for families affected by the conditions there are huge potential cost savings to the State.  Canada is considered to be one of the global leaders when it comes to prevention, treatment and support in dealing with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  The Canadian Federal Government has estimated that it costs taxpayers the equivalent of &euro;1.2 million extra - Canadian $1.75 million - for every person who is born prenatally alcohol exposed, but that huge cost savings can be made through early intervention, diagnosis and support services across a person's life span.  Reference was made to waste in the health system.  Wasted resources in dealing with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders span the range of systems, including, for example, trying to address the issue of drop-outs in the education system and the cost to the justice system of somebody being incarcerated and jailed simply because they did not receive the right support or advocacy services within the system.  It is in terms of social and health supports such as not diagnosing or understanding the conditions and comorbidities.</p><p>The Senator is correct that our asks are related to our approach, understanding and acceptance that these are significant public health issues.</p><p> Our policy position on the development of diagnostics is informed by the families impacted on by foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.  Two years ago we supported families to form an alliance to end the neurological developmental disorder prenatal alcohol exposure, PAE.  When I asked those families about their one ask at today&rsquo;s proceedings, they all stated it was about looking for clear diagnostic guidelines.  They point out that nothing can happen until we at least understand what is happening with children.  They can then become advocates for the provision of transitional places in schools and so forth.  There will be a budget, but it will be a spend-to-save approach if it is done properly.</p></speech>

While I only caught the tail-end of the presentations, I am familiar with the subject matter under discussion.</p> <p>  How can we improve the public information programme on all of the issues with which the organisations are dealing?  We hear about various conditions and how matters have progressed to the extent that it is not possible to deal with them in the way that it is sought to deal with them.  There is space for a serious public information programme based on facts, rather than scaring the public, to make it aware of the issues in question.  How do the organisations see such a programme being put into operation?</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report addressed the question of diagnostics.  From their experience, are the organisations satisfied that its proposals are adequate?</p> <p>  New neurological conditions such as Guillain&ndash;Barr&eacute; syndrome appeared to have been difficult to diagnose until recently.  Rare conditions seem to present more regularly than anticipated.  As a result, diagnosis was slow, which was to the detriment of the patient.  The delay in diagnosis could have been two to six months, meaning that patients and their families suffered considerable stress.</p></speech>

We have the Ask about Alcohol campaign which includes radio, TV and web content.  It is the only WHO accepted website in Ireland which includes public information on alcohol.  We have the working group which is limited to the HSE.  In any other forward movement we would be in agreement with the WHO guidelines which state one needs to have the involvement of people and their families impacted on by the condition to know how to deal with it sensitively.  It is important to acknowledge what is being done well.  </p> <p>  The other challenge in dealing with foetal alcohol spectrum disorders is in the medical community, including obstetrics and gynaecology and GPs.  We suffered for many years because there were some equivocal messages coming through.</p><p>We are moving much closer to an unequivocal message.  I understand that the HSE is collaborating with a number of people to put together a position paper.  I hope we will have something over the next number of months to ensure the medical community sings from the same hymn sheet on that issue.  We welcome what is being done in this regard and we do not seek anything additional.  I do not know how it relates to other conditions, however.</p></speech>

For example, we recently had the MS Ireland MSunderstood caf&eacute; roadshow.  People only knew they were entering a coffee shop but they were able to experience some of the symptoms of living with MS.  The minute people came in the door, they felt unbalanced by the uneven floor.  When they ordered their latte or whatever, the writing on the menu board started to blur to give them the sensation of having blurred vision.  People with MS have informed us that when they are diagnosed, they often do not know what the disease is and their families certainly do not know what is.  Family members of an MS sufferer tend to perceive it as an older person condition and assume the person with the condition will end up in a wheelchair.  There is a need to increase awareness.</p> <p>  GPs were mentioned.  People with MS now visit colleges to address medical students training to become our doctors and nurses and talk to them about what it is like to experience the condition to give them a better sense of that.  There is much more public patient involvement taking place, which is important.</p> <p>  There is unity in working together.  In that context, we work with the DFI and the NAI in the context of the campaigns they run to try to create awareness among the general population about neurological conditions in general.  Many people do not have a sense of these conditions unless they have come to his or her door.  People have no idea about the rare diseases the Deputy mentioned.  We try to work with the DFI and the NAI to create awareness among the general population.</p></speech>

It is an under-recognised strength of individual charities, like MS Ireland and others, that they take on and do this work.  They fund-raise because no one else is doing so.  It is a huge responsibility on not-for-profit organisations to take on this education and awareness role.</p></speech>

I spoke earlier about the 85% of HSE funding that is going into disability services.  Of the other 15%, approximately 10% - or much of it - relates to information and advocacy work to help raise awareness of particular conditions and the similarities across conditions.  However, the HSE, the funder in question, is increasingly stating that funding awareness campaigns is not its business and its role is to fund core disability services.  The part of the HSE that helps promotion does not consider disability to be part of its responsibility because disability is done through the disability or neurological arms of the organisation.</p> <p>  Valuing the knowledge base of all of these organisations, their link with Europe and the information services they provide to families in crisis at any particular point and having that embedded in a real funding stream can make a significant difference to the lives of individuals and families in the community.  I thank Deputy Durkan for raising the matter because the value of the role played by the various organisations is underappreciated and nobody wants to fund that role.  It is something we must look at.</p></speech>

I had another engagement.  I will briefly touch on the valproate issue.  I am a pharmacist by profession and have been dispensing valproate for years.  We talk about awareness of the side effects and when they happened and so on.  In terms of where we go from here, women with epilepsy who want to have a baby have an additional requirement for folic acid.  It is all very well complaining about the past - as a pharmacist, I understand people's issues - but the focus should surely be on proper folic acid supplementation to mitigate against any of the side effects of medications that women often must take to keep them seizure free and maintain their pregnancies.</p><p>Folic acid is something I feel particularly strongly about, not only in relation to neurological conditions.  There is additional need for higher strength folic acid.  It depends on weight but I understand the current practice is 5 mg, 20 times the dose.  That is not commonly known.  That message must be delivered through GPs and community pharmacists because when it comes to access the community pharmacist generally knows first when someone is pregnant because pharmacists sell the pregnancy test.  I have done some work with my party on having folic acid placed beside pregnancy tests.  I have also done the sums on the cost of providing folic acid free of charge and have looked at what is done in other countries.  There are some things that we cannot change now but we can protect population health in the future with proper folic acid supplementation.  If anyone here is doing work on this, I ask that he or she address the issue. <br/><br/>One of the witnesses spoke about access to medication.  I agree that the focus of the system is on quality-adjusted life years, QALYs, which determine whether one takes X, Y or Z tablet.  When Orkambi was being approved it was widely noted that it was not only an issue of curing a condition or living longer but also what the increase in lung function could mean for somebody.  That discussion has started and it is not as cold and clinical as it used to be.  There is a way to go on this but the message should go out that whereas Orkambi did not go through the system or tick the boxes, a dispensation was made because of the particularly high rate of cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  Advocates put their names out publicly and showed what the small increase in lung function gave them in terms of quality of life.  <br/><br/>It may have been discussed before I arrived but there is an issue with rapid neurological disorders such as motor neurone disease and some of the rapid cycling types of MS, for which home care packages kick in at 65 years.  Motor neurone disease is often a younger person's condition affecting some patients in their mid-40s.  It does not matter what a person's means are or if he or she is a billionaire.  People with a condition such as motor neurone disease require a medical card because they require access to services.  The witnesses know this.  It is very concerning that individuals, including some who do not have family members, who are faced with the burden of this very frightening condition and a bundle of paperwork may be told that they cannot access services because they are below 65 years and have a condition that is sometimes associated with older people.  Have any of the witnesses or the organisations they represent done any work we could present to the Minister for Health showing how we could make it easier for people in such desperate circumstances to access services, home care packages and the grants they require to convert their homes as their condition progresses.  Many people who have rapid progressing conditions want to live in their own homes.  Sadly, I have often dealt with people who have died before they have had the appropriate adaptations made to their homes.  I would be interested to hear of any work on this or any proposals the organisations may have put to the Minister on it as it may be something that could be easily fixed.  No doctor will sign off on something that says a patient has a rapid progressing neurological disorder unless the patient has it.  I cannot see why GPs must certify and there is so much rigmarole when a definitive diagnosis has been made of a serious neurological disorder.<br/><br/>I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Recently the Environmental Protection Agency was before the committee on water quality.  I referred to a <i>National Geographic </i>report on the high level of drugs, illicit and otherwise, found in the water supply in some cities.</p><p>Last week it was reported that all the shrimp in Suffolk - I do not know if anyone else has read about the shrimp in Suffolk - have tested positive for cocaine.  By the looks of things, the excretion of illicit substances into our water supply is becoming a huge issue.  We talk here about people taking alcohol and other drugs consciously in pregnancy, but are the witnesses aware of any work or studies on increases in neurological disorders or conditions among neonates in this regard?  Is there any link between this and water quality?  Is any of the witnesses' organisations undertaking a body of work in this regard?  I have been waiting for three weeks for a reply from the EPA regarding the work it is doing on this.  Perhaps someone within the witnesses' fields is doing work on the very clear carcinogenic, teratogenic and neurotoxic effects of illicit substances, or perhaps it is only me thinking about these matters.</p></speech>

I understand her point and I will answer generally.  The issue is not known about.  The Deputy talks about the need for a campaign, but who will pay for it?  From our point of view, as an organisation representing those affected by MS, we could talk about the importance of taking vitamin D, for example.  Again, though, we are trying to provide a range of services, we are fundraising to provide those services and then there needs to be an awareness campaign.  There is the difficulty as to who will provide the funding for the awareness campaign the Deputy speaks about and how we resource getting the GPs and the pharmacists to take on board what we say.  Now one has to pay an external company to get one's leaflet into a GP surgery.  I do not disagree with what the Deputy says; I am just asking how we could manage to do it when we already have to try to provide a service directly to people.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned Orkambi and the discussion surrounding it not being as clinical and cold as it used to be.  I agree with her from the point of view of the fact that in the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics process one can now make what we call a patient submission.  This is very positive and very welcomed by our community in that we are not just down to a quality-adjusted life year valued at &euro;44,000.  What in the name of God does that mean to anyone?  From our perspective, therefore, the fact that we can make representations on behalf of the people who will be using these drugs is very positive.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's point about the medical card, yes, it is absolutely ridiculous that people who have been diagnosed with a condition and who already have to get their head around any such diagnosis, no matter what the condition is, sometimes have to fight for their medication, for access to whatever it is that would make their lives better.  I cannot say anything to the Deputy other than that it is ridiculous and it should not be that way.  People should have access to whatever it is they need for-----</p></speech>

The association knows that in any one year there are about 400 people diagnosed in different stages of the condition.  The association provides family support, aids and appliances and it steps into the space that Deputy O'Connell is talking about.  We know that model.  I do not know whether the Deputy was present when we spoke about the need for establishing a community services programme.  The community services programme would provide a service at the point of diagnosis or at the point of presentation.  Such a service would be able to respond to the immediate needs of the person in his or her home or as close to that person's home as possible and bring in, exactly as the Deputy suggests, GPs, physiotherapists, primary care and would co-ordinate in a sustained way all the actors that will help the person to live as long as possible with a good quality of life.  One would also activate the housing adaptation so that the person would be able to negotiate that new world because post diagnosis.  I can only imagine the sense of bewilderment and how an individual or family is trying to deal with the diagnosis and at the same time advocate, and access resources.  There is a need for this service. </p></speech>

If one takes the example of Epilepsy Ireland, or MS Ireland, those organisations work with the person in the community.  Where most individuals would have no idea how to go about filling in a grant application, the community worker has filled out at least 50 of them and knows exactly what one has to do to ensure that the application is granted.  They work with people who have been diagnosed, whether from a psychological point of view, whether the individual needs counselling or physiotherapy and they are signposting to the HSE and engaging with the various different organisations.</p></speech>

One could have four or five very good organisations working locally and an individual will experience his or her condition in a different way from somebody who is diagnosed in a rural area who has no access to resources.</p> <p>  When we talk about developing the community services programme, it is so there is an understanding of a shared plan and basket of services to which each individual is entitled once diagnosed with a condition or disability and living in the community.  It should not matter whether one is living in CHO 1 or CHO 9, a person should have the same access to services.  </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the fantastic work they are doing.  They are doing phenomenal work on the ground.</p> <p>  I am very interested in the alcohol programme.  I know that Dr. Helen McMonagle referred to the stigma and spoke a little about it, but I am extremely interested in this area.  There seems to be a significant moral model and stigma around alcohol-related brain injuries and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and at one point Dr. McMonagle said that people are passed between pillar and post and fall between two stools.  There seems to be a lack of compassion and empathy-----</p></speech>

From Dr. McMonagle's perspective, how does she think we can go forward on the issue of foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related brain injuries?</p> <p>  There was a World Health Organisation report on Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.  This extensive report described and discussed the increasing global public health importance of common neurological disorders such as dementia and epilepsy.  It dedicated a whole section to the neurological disorders, associated with malnutrition and the ingestion of toxic compounds, such as alcohol.  What efforts are being taken in the Irish neurology services to address these two neurological conditions, particularly around alcohol-related brain injury and foetal alcohol spectrum disorders?</p><p>I am sorry for rushing but I have many more questions. </p></speech>

Interestingly, the Donegal team is a national team that is based in Letterkenny.  The model is very good.  It proves not everything must be based in Dublin and, therefore, should be considered for use elsewhere</p> <p>  The presentation outlined everything and was very worthwhile.  As Ms Leonard said, there is no stigma, no shame and no blame in dealing with these issues, which is a vitally important message.  As the HSE and the Department of Health will understand, the initiative will save money.  I know that is the reality especially from sitting on local health forums every couple of months where we discuss the delays in discharging people from hospitals and ways to get people out of hospital.  The initiative will save money and free up beds, which is vitally important.  </p> <p>  I ask the Chairman, on behalf of the committee, to start a conversation by writing to the HSE and the Department of Health outlining the two tasks suggested by the Alcohol Forum.  I mean the establishment of a multidisciplinary cross-directorate national working group to tackle alcohol abuse and ensure there are clinical guidelines for diagnosing foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD.  </p></speech>

Has progress been made with the development of community clinical nurse specialists in terms of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and all the other neurological conditions that require community services?  If one cannot see one's neurologist or there is not a sufficient complement of neurologists then surely community nurse specialists in those disciplines would be of great benefit to people.  The initiative would reduce pressure on hospital-based services and increase the involvement of nurse specialists in delivering services in communities.  The witnesses can answer the questions in whatever order they like as long as they answer them all in the next ten minutes.</p></speech>

Very positive results have been generated by the epilepsy programme and its concentration on the development of the clinical nurse specialist.  The lessons that have been learned are being transferred to the neurology programme.  Today, the committee heard about some proposals to increase the clinical nurse specialist role in the management of motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis and I completely agree with the Chairman that needs to be transferred to other conditions.  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland welcomes the current focus on the neurology clinical programme.</p></speech>

The stigma around the condition is very pervasive.  There is a presumption that the condition is self-inflicted, that the person has had a hand in inflicting this, that sufferers are just alcoholics and difficult clients.  We need to consider that the majority of the people in Ireland who drink do so at a harmful level.  More than 150,000 Irish people are dependent drinkers and 1.35 million people are harmful drinkers.  It is important to note that alcohol dependency is a very big issue in Ireland.  In terms of neurological conditions, every life is important regardless of the cause of a person's disability or neurological condition.  These conditions must be given emphasis alongside other conditions and in a consistent way.</p></speech>

There are also some isolated initiatives and individual clinicians doing their best and taking a role in highlighting and researching the issue.  As our colleagues have said today, it must have greater prioritisation.  The World Health Organization, WHO, report names neurological conditions as the greatest challenge facing public health systems worldwide and we, in Ireland, are not treating them accordingly.  We have not been doing so and continue not to address the needs of people with neurological conditions.  This is coming down the line like a steamroller because of our aging population and, as a health system, we are not putting in the necessary investment or planning.</p></speech>

We often think, act and have policy in silos.  It is important, as part of the destigmatisation of alcohol, that we start to look at it as a neurological condition rather than the underlying cause of the neurological condition.  As a country, we absolutely need to address our problematic relationship with alcohol in the context of some of the figures Ms McMonagle has outlined.  We need to look at the condition that is in front of us.  Today's discussion has been welcome and I thank Deputy Pringle for his proposal that this committee would write formally to the HSE and the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Our other ask is that families have an opportunity to give a sense of things.  Families are finding voice in Ireland for the very first time.  It is not that we have a moral model in Ireland, we have no model at all.  We have no diagnostic specialists and no guidelines for foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, FASD.  We welcome being here and I thank the members of the committee for the opportunity.</p></speech>

The purpose of this morning's meeting is to meet with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for a general update on its work in the area of Garda oversight and accountability and to hear its views generally on issues and developments in the area of policing oversight including, of course, the report and recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I welcome once again before the committee Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, chairperson, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, commissioner and Mr. Patrick Sullivan, commissioner.  They are all very welcome here this morning.  I will shortly invite them to make their opening statements.  Before I do so, I draw the attention of witnesses to the situation on privilege.  They are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee; however if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

I am joined by my fellow commissioners Mr. Kieran FitzGerald and Mr. Patrick Sullivan.  Since we last met the joint committee, Mr. Sullivan joined GSOC last July after a Public Appointments Service open competition.</p> <p>  Representatives of the commission were last before the committee on 28 February 2018.  On that date the commission updated the committee on the fact that there had been no statutory changes since we had last met it in September 2016, but we were aware of the work being undertaken by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which had been established in the interim period in May 2017.  In February 2018 we also provided the committee with the business case we had submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In it we sought an increase in our staff numbers to assist in the development of our usual caseload and the provision of a separate protected disclosures unit.  As members will have seen in the larger submission we provided for the committee, the business case was met in full.  To date, we have taken on 21 of the 42 sanctioned staff, with the remaining staff to be with us in the coming months.  For the first time in its history, GSOC's number of staff is in excess of 100.  As of 30 April this year, 115 people were working in GSOC.</p> <p>  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was published on 18 September last year.  The recommendations in respect of a complaints oversight body were in keeping with the submissions made by GSOC to the commission.  GSOC welcomed the proposals, in particular the recommendation made on page 49 of the report that "all complaints about the police should be routed through IOPO [the tentative name for the new body] to determine what action needs to be taken".  At a briefing meeting that morning with Ms Kathleen O'Toole, the commission chair, she confirmed that "all complaints" meant from whatever source and that the Garda should not be investigating itself.  It is important to note at this juncture that in our fuller submission we see the word "complaint" as meaning any allegation, from whatever source, internal or external to the Garda, including from confidential human informants or other police agencies, indicating criminal activity or serious misconduct by a member or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  We have included in our submission the "police oversight principles" which were adopted in November 2011 by the European Partners Against Corruption, EPAC.  Key among them are that the police oversight body be sufficiently separated from the hierarchy of the police, subject to its remit, and that the police oversight body be governed and controlled by persons who are not current serving police officers.  These are fundamental oversight principles adopted by the European organisation mentioned.  They are in keeping with the proposals made in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland which has been endorsed by the Government.</p> <p>  GSOC recently made a submission to the review group on anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures which is chaired by the former Director of Public Prosecutions Mr. James Hamilton as part of that group's public consultation process.  GSOC reiterated the importance of independent oversight where allegations of corruption by Garda members were concerned.  We have had one meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality about the proposed new legislation and made further written submissions to it.</p><p>However, as of yet we have not seen any draft for the new complaints oversight body.<br/><br/>GSOC, with the other oversight bodies, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority, did raise concerns when we became aware that there was no oversight element in the implementation body set up to steer through the various recommendations made in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Of particular concern to GSOC is the issue of matching a new remit with resources.  In 2018, under the current legislative provisions, in excess of 500 cases were referred back from GSOC to the Garda for investigation.  There will have to be some increase in resources for GSOC to deal with this caseload.  It must also be noted that the Garda superintendents and inspectors who deal with these cases are spread throughout the country.  Consideration will also have to be given to the geographic challenges.  It must be remembered that there is a cost to the State under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Garda&iacute; are diverted from their usual policing duties to carry out these GSOC investigations and this has an effect in terms of their time and the resulting Garda costs.  GSOC is conscious that if a new complaints oversight body is to succeed, these are issues that should be dealt with in advance of the new organisation being set up.  The concern is that without proper planning, resulting in a delay, erosion of public trust in the new body will set in at an early stage.<br/><br/>GSOC is preparing a new business plan drawing on its experience and information to assist in predicting the type of organisation that will be required to meet the demands of a new legislative framework.  We hope to have it completed by the middle of 2019, particularly having regard to the proposed date of 1 January 2021 for when a new legislative structure will commence.<br/><br/>An area of significance in the work of GSOC and of any new body is access to information.  A key principle in the European Partners Against Corruption, EPAC, police oversight principles is that &quot;The police oversight body's investigators must be provided with the full range of police powers to enable them to conduct fair, independent and effective investigations, in particular the power to obtain all the information necessary to conduct an effective investigation&quot;.  As I indicated, the principles were delivered in 2011.  They are in keeping with the recently adopted Venice Principles, the Principles on the Protection and Promotion of the Ombudsman Institution, adopted in Strasbourg on 15 and 16 March by the Venice Commission, the European Commission for Democracy through Law and the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters.<br/><br/>We have noted in our submission to the committee that paragraph 16 of the principles adopted in March reads:</p><blockquote>The Ombudsman shall be entitled to request the co-operation of any individuals or organisations who may be able to assist in his or her investigations.  The Ombudsman shall have a legally enforceable right to unrestricted access to all relevant documents, databases and materials, including those which might otherwise be legally privileged or confidential.</blockquote><p>We have submitted the principles to the Department of Justice and Equality, to which the new legislation should have regard when dealing with the necessary powers required for fair and proportionate independent investigations.</p><p>Access to information in the Garda is a matter we raised at our first meeting with the committee in September 2016, at which we highlighted the provisions of section 66 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, which includes a statutory requirement on the Chief Constable, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Policing Board to provide documentation and information for the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p><p> GSOC has noted in its submission to the committee that, with the public, we have become aware through the media of allegations of Garda wrongdoing.  We are aware that the Garda continues to conduct criminal investigations of its own members without the knowledge or participation of GSOC.  We find this troubling.  This practice runs the risk of allegations of cover-up, bias or corruption when it becomes known that such investigations have been carried out internally.  It runs the risk that fair and independent investigations are not seen as such by the public because they were not notified outside the organisation.  Most importantly, it runs the risk of undermining public trust significantly if such internal investigations go wrong.  The practice also flies in the face of the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that all such matters be routed through GSOC or the new oversight organisation.</p><p> In our 2016 submission to the committee we highlighted as a priority the need to establish more efficient processes to deal with service issues.  We have included in our submission today the work that commenced in February 2018 between GSOC and the Garda on the local intervention initiative.  Committee members will see the spread of the initiative throughout the country, with certain exceptions.  GSOC has paid tribute to the work done by our former staff member Ms Pamela Howard and Inspector Greg Mekitarian of Pearse Street Garda station in Dublin in promoting and developing the pilot scheme.  It is an example of the two organisations co-operatively and collaboratively using their joint experiences to provide the public with a better police service.  GSOC and the Garda see this as an important process for the future.  To that end, we will continue to review numbers and satisfaction levels in this area.  It meets the needs of the people concerned, both garda&iacute; and the public, to sort out issues without resorting to formal disciplinary investigations.</p><p> An issue of great concern to all in the past few years has been the handling of protected disclosures within the Garda organisation.  GSOC sought and obtained an increase in its numbers for these important investigations.  We have set up a separate unit with separate facilities.  The last of the sanctioned investigators joined the unit in the past week.  As we have reported, GSOC received 24 new protected disclosures from garda&iacute; in 2018 and they have continued into 2019.  GSOC is of the view that the continued growth in the number of protected disclosures made to it indicates one of two things &ndash; growing confidence in GSOC to treat the disclosures respectfully or a lack of confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate such disclosures.  We have noted in our submission the contrast as far back as 2017 in the numbers officially reported by the Garda.  In that year there were 11 protected disclosures made to the Garda internally, while the number of protected disclosures made to GSOC in the same year was 22, double the Garda number.  It seems, as new legislation for both organisations is being planned, that the issue of how protected disclosures are dealt with in the two organisations could be usefully reviewed to provide for Garda staff the best and most efficient way of dealing with the issues that have arisen through the disclosures made during the years.</p><p>I have provided, belatedly this morning, a diagram workflow which provides a representation of how the current legislation directs us to deal with complaints.  As will be noted, it is a maze in terms of what is required.  We hope to have produced a better diagram by the next time we appear before the committee.</p></speech>

It is great that we are discussing this subject again but I get a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  These issues have been talked about more since the commission last appeared before the committee but in terms of structural changes, particularly legislatively, we are no further along the road.  That is my view.</p><p>My first batch of questions relate to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the work of GSOC.  The press statement issued by GSOC on publication of that report correctly, as far as I am concerned, pinpointed that a lot of what is said therein echoed what had been already said by GSOC.  In other words, there is nothing new in it.  This could have been legislatively provided for before now.  I am incredibly frustrated about that.  Does GSOC expect to get a statutory right to information, in particular?  As highlighted, this is an area that has been long lobbied for, including in the 2016 report of this committee.  Is GSOC any closer to getting that statutory right to information?  </p><p>I was concerned to hear in the opening statement that GSOC found out about the implementation group and that the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority have also been excluded from the implementation group around the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  That is news to me, which I do not welcome.  I note that when GSOC raised the matter with the Department, the response was that it will consult with GSOC.  I do not think that is adequate.  Do the witnesses still believe that GSOC should have a seat at the table?  I believe it should, and that this committee should do all it can to assist in that regard.  </p><p>It was also mentioned that the GSOC business plan should be available by the middle of this year.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on what that means and on the point regarding what additional resources are required.  It is a bit unfair to ask the witnesses to comment on the overlap with the Commission on the Future of Policing but an interpretation of it could be that we could have a lot of what is proposed in place and been well down the road already if we had not had the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  There is no reason much of what is proposed is being delayed.  I would welcome the witnesses' responses to those questions before I move to my next batch.</p></speech>

We have had some preliminary discussions with the Department to that end but we have not had sight of any paperwork at this stage.  Whether the statutory right to information will be addressed in the Bill, or not, we cannot say at this time.  As the Deputy said, it is a right we have been seeking for a long time.  We have put various mechanisms in place with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to try to expedite and facilitate the exchange of information but, limited success would, perhaps, be the best way to describe that process.  As of now, we do not know whether it will be a clear statement of access, such as outlined in the European Partners Against Corruption, EPAC principles and the Northern Ireland legislation.</p><p>We cannot say with any certainty at this time whether it will be there at all or whether there will be some other version of it.</p></speech>

Looking at the membership, it is clear that a significant number of members are Secretaries General from throughout the public service, as well as assistant secretaries general.  There is a significant number of cross-departmental representatives and, unsurprisingly, the membership includes the Garda Commissioner.  As the legislation is also going to deal with new structures in terms of oversight, I cannot help the committee in saying why it was not thought that there should be some representation from the current oversight bodies.  We have had one meeting with the implementation personnel but they continue their work at their rate.  Beyond that I am afraid the committee would have to direct questions to them.  They have a very ambitious timetable under the supervision of the Department of the Taoiseach and it appears they are anxious to meet a start date for change of 1 January 2021.  I wish them the best in that regard.  We are anxious for that too.</p></speech>

I do not want to put the witnesses in the difficult position of having to comment on what the Department is doing but this is a forum to put on the public record some of the issues or to tease out what is going on behind the scenes.  Hand on heart and on the basis of what has been said and the information provided, I am very worried about where this is going.  The witnesses were before us three years ago and legislation had been drafted at the time.  Deputy Wallace had drafted legislation that would have given us what all of us said we needed.  It could have been in place by now but the witnesses have not seen any paperwork at all with respect to the draft heads of Bill in this respect.  They have no idea what aspects are included.  They have put on the public record that the body looking at implementation is heavy on civil servants and garda&iacute; but there is zero involvement from the oversight bodies.  That is scary and unhelpful from the Department's perspective.  It is not really a question but the witnesses have provided that information and it is an appalling, although not really a surprising, spectre.</p> <p>  I ask about the current scenario with respect to the handling of protected disclosures.  It is clearly a growing area in which the witnesses have been involved.  What is the average timescale being looked at for GSOC to assess and come to a conclusion with a protected disclosure?  I know they can be broad in range but what is the rough timeline?  What kind of co-operation is being received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Has it improved in the past year or two or has there been a noticeable difference?  There was mention in the statement of how GSOC has opened investigations despite garda&iacute; not informing the commission about incidents.  The commission happens to hear about these in the media, etc.  These include matters such as the temporary loss of a firearm and ammunition and so on.  I am trying to get my head around how that would happen.  I assume the commission would ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na afterwards why it was not informed directly about such matters.  What answer was given, assuming that question was asked?  Is there anything that could be done to sanction that?  It demonstrates a gap in accountability that is really ridiculous.</p><p>It would be helpful if there was more information on the matter. </p></speech>

The rate at which we have been contacted by garda&iacute; from all around the country is increasing and that puts demands on personnel just visiting with people.  We have an initial process in place that assesses the information given to us.  Regarding what may be to the person making the disclosure a protected disclosure, we first have to establish what is the basis for saying that and then we have to look at it from a legal point of view.  We have found for many people it is a very distressing experience.  They have had significant long-term experiences where, for instance, something like bullying has affected their work life and personal life so, in fact, the taking of a statement has had to be done over the course of days as opposed to a one hour session, for instance.  These cases are, even from an early stage, quite complex and they can be very difficult for the people making the disclosures.</p> <p>  We have levels of communication, having regard to the protections under the Act, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those are working well enough.  Our difficulty in any case whether it is a protected disclosure or not is knowing whether we have all of the relevant information.  We may ask for A, B and C and get A, B and C in a reasonable period but it is only when examining A, B and C that we discover D, E and F are relevant so we have to go back and make an application for those pieces of information.  We can get what we ask for but we do not always get what is relevant.  At the end of the day we have to accept that we have gotten everything.  I think I set out in my submission an example of a historical matter going back to the early 1980s where on initial application we were told, perhaps not surprisingly, that they could not find documentation.  We went to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and, perhaps not surprisingly, they could find the documentation.  Then at a late stage we were told by the person involved that they had, in recent times, made an application under data access and got documentation and we discovered that, indeed, in the data access office was information whereas the official request came back with the answer that there was no documentation.  I am not suggesting there was malfeasance on anyone's part but it was clear that a line of inquiry was followed, it revealed nothing so the answer back to us was that there was no documentation yet sitting in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were indeed documents.  We do not know sometimes when we are told we have everything or there is nothing more whether in fact we have everything or there is nothing more, and there is no sanction in that regard.  It is an ongoing issue and it may be that something like this will always exist.  Short of going in ourselves and going through every press and every file, we may not get everything.  One would hope that if better file keeping, computerisation and better protection of documentation occurs within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we will then get everything.</p><p>In terms of contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on investigations, we have picked up a newspaper and read of a matter or heard about it on "Morning Ireland", having been, like members of the public, unaware of it.</p></speech>

The Garda was confident that the force was properly investigating the matter and it did not occur to it that there was a need to inform us.</p></speech>

I believe it is linked to Ms Justice Ring's statement that it was troubling that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued to conduct criminal investigations into its members without the knowledge or involvement of GSOC.  Either the Garda does not know it is supposed to do that or it is something more sinister.  This is very troubling.  Ms Justice Ring referred to the new draft protocol and stated that GSOC had not received a response from the Garda Commissioner about the protocol to date.  How long has GSOC been waiting for the Commissioner to provide an answer?  Have steps been taken to put the protocol in place?</p></speech>

It is even more troubling given that we were discussed the same matters three years ago.  At that time, we were a little more upbeat because GSOC had gone to the trouble of detailing the legislative provision that would have sorted out this matter.  Now we see not only the lack of change in that respect and its impact on the day-to-day work of GSOC.  Ms Justice Ring has put on record that in the protected disclosures incidents, some people have been incredibly damaged by what has happened to them or what they perceive to have happened to them without adequate investigation.  Some investigations last for days.  Ms Justice Ring stated that GSOC continues to experience major difficulty accessing documentation.  It is my guess that when we take these matters together, the process for carrying out investigations into protected disclosures is generally very long.  Is that correct?  I presume that most of the people in these circumstances are not in work.</p> <p>  What is the level of crossover?  I am aware of one protected disclosure involving a very serious case of alleged Garda involvement in the drugs trade on which GSOC has finished its report.  In tandem with the GSOC investigation, the Garda carried out an internal investigation which was still not finished after about four years.  GSOC, however, is not able to publish its report until the Garda investigation concludes.  Is that not the biggest flaw of all?  Does this not stunt the work of GSOC?  I presume an obstreperous Garda management - I am not saying that is the issue in this case - could delay the matter if it wished by contending that it is still investigating internally.</p><p>Does the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, have much interaction from a human resources perspective with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around the garda&iacute; and what for them is quite often a nightmare with regard to their working environment when their complaint is ongoing and in how their complaint is kicked between the two organisations?</p></speech>

Technically, under the law, we cannot discuss it if it means that identities are in some way disclosed.  GSOC may be investigating a complaint that the Garda is investigating, but we may not know that until very late in the day.  It may be very far advanced in that regard because it is closer to the information, which then causes problems for our investigation.  If we are going to have the structure that allows for two organisations to take protected disclosures from staff then some effort should be made to allow for better management of the protected disclosures.  We raised this in the general sense when submissions were sought by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, about the fact that we cannot talk to the Department of Justice and Equality, which may have had a letter or a submission, we cannot talk to the Policing Authority, which may also have received a letter or submission, and the Garda.  Four bodies, therefore, may have information about the same complaint but there is no mechanism to allow us to disclose information except in a formal investigative way with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We raised this with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the lead agency on the Protected Disclosures Act, and it decided not to deal with that issue in the review of the Act, which I believe took place in 2017.</p> <p>  There are also many issues arising around welfare.  We make it very clear to a discloser that welfare is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: we are not a welfare agency.  Many of the people who come to us are out sick or have been out, some are working and some allegations include lack of advancement.  These are issues over which we have no control.  We can only investigate the allegation.  The Garda is still responsible for its staff and members and it needs to deal with the employment, health and welfare issues.  We make this very clear also.</p></speech>

I believe the situation we are in is disgraceful, years on from when many of these issues were flagged.  In fairness, Ms Justice Ring has not been shy in spelling out the damage that has been done to some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who made these disclosures, and to some of the members of the public who are not getting answers because the commission's hands are tied.  The fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not take on board the information of GSOC's lived experience of the shortcomings, and that GSOC is not being consulted in the real sense about the changes that are due, really sums up the Department of Justice and Equality.  I appreciate that the commission cannot comment on that but I thank the representatives for coming in to the committee.  It has been useful, albeit scary.</p> <p>  I apologise to the Chairman as I must leave now.  I will follow up on the debate later.  I must be somewhere else now.</p></speech>

In the minor complaints area, there are even categories within that.  We categorise some as service level complaints where a level of public service, perhaps as simple as common politeness, is allegedly not observed and delivered to a complainant by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These are the subject of the local intervention scheme to which Ms Justice Ring was referred in our opening statement.  We have tried to establish local intervention and in fairness to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it engaged positively with it, especially at pilot stage.  The scheme is showing green shoots and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has looked to roll it out widely, although not fully nationwide.</p><p> That would deal with minor complaints on matters such as the non-return of a phone call or simple impoliteness or discourtesy.  However, there is another level of complaint that would still be less serious, depending on one's perspective, involving discourtesies that are not suitable for local intervention and the individual in question feels he or she needs the vindication of bringing a complaint to an oversight body.  Such complaints come to us and would continue to come to us in future according to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Under the current legislation, we can send many of these complaints back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That would not be the case in the future, however, as we would deal with these complaints ourselves.  That is why, for example, Ms Justice Ring referred to the issue of resources for this task because these complaints obviously command a fair amount of Garda resources and would require our resources in future.  We have no difficulty with that and it is right that they would come to us.</p><p> Where appropriate, local intervention is a very worthwhile initiative and one which we will try to reinforce.  We will work positively and closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement it.  Many of these matters are a basic public service and should not be the subject of complicated investigative mechanisms that are resource heavy, adversarial and confrontational.  The whole process is currently structured around finding a garda guilty of misconduct or of a crime.  In the new legislation, we are trying to focus on resolving the problem.  Resolving the problem is much more significant at the minor level.  In respect of more serious complaints where serious misconduct or a crime might be alleged, other sanctions are obviously more appropriate.</p></speech>

How will the remit of the new independent office of the police ombudsman differ from the current remit of GSOC?  I know that is a difficult question because Mr. Fitzgerald is not drafting the remit of the IOPO.  I ask him to answer it based on his reading of the commission's report.</p></speech>

A definition of a complaint has not been provided in the 2005 Act or any of the amending Acts to it thereafter.  Such a definition  would be very useful.  We refer in our submission to all complaints, as does the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The question then is what is a complaint?  As Ms Justice Ring outlined in our submission, we see it and it is seen internationally as are all complaints of wrongdoing.</p><p>At the moment, we assume that a member of the public has to walk into our office, go online or walk into a Garda station to make a complaint about Garda conduct.  That does not necessarily include information that comes to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on criminal activity or misconduct committed by a garda.  If a person is in custody and says that he or she has heard that Garda X has done something egregious, that complaint may never reach GSOC but it can be interpreted as a complaint about the conduct of a garda.  We have to be very clear about what we deem to be a complaint.</p></speech>

Ms Kathleen O'Toole laid it out very succinctly and used the phrase "all complaints".  However, in response to a question from my colleague, Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, on what she meant by the word "complaints", she confirmed when we met her that she meant all allegations of misconduct or criminal activity.  How that translates into legislation is a question for the drafters in the first instance and, subsequently, for the Deputy and his colleagues when passing the legislation.  We are highlighting concerns and saying that if a narrow definition of complaints is included in the Act, the police ombudsman will have a narrow remit.  If more clarity is given in terms of what a complaint is, we will be able to work in a broader way.  This is a matter to be determined by the Department and the parliamentary draftspersons and, thereafter, the Deputy and his colleagues.</p></speech>

I believe she referred to it and it is highlighted in the opening statement.  She states she believes the ombudsman should have a legally enforceable right to unrestricted access to all relevant documents, databases and materials, including those which might otherwise be legally privileged or confidential.  Those are broad powers to give to a statutory investigative body.  What type of legally privileged documents is Ms Justice Ring seeking access to?</p></speech>

They came about, I suspect, after many contributions and discussions.  Insofar as it would have a practical application in this jurisdiction, it is unlikely to get to that extent.  However, having said that, if documents relevant to our investigations rested in the legal section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example, they might be pivotal in terms of what people were advised to do.  That might help provide answers to some serious question we might have as to what we see people did.</p></speech>

There will obviously be a row about this, in the same way that there can be rows around legal privilege.  Is new legislation required?</p></speech>

Whether it is appropriate, proportionate or relevant must be something that can be relied upon on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>If we want to look at legal advice, we would have to make the argument for why we consider it relevant and proportionate.  However, the danger is that if somebody does not want to hand over documentation, a decision might be made to deposit it with the legal section and claim legal privilege.  In such circumstances, we might be able to litigate it through the courts and, for instance, a judge might look at it independently and decide it is important to our investigation.  However, there will be costs and delays in that process.  I am not saying that including such a provision in legislation would mean we would use it in every instance, but it would avoid the resting of documentation that could be relevant in a legal section.</p></speech>

I am not saying we would necessarily resort to that information or that people would not still have the opportunity to rely on legal privilege.  However, if we are told in the course of an investigation, particularly a serious investigation, that a person was advised by the Garda legal services that he or she was to do X, Y or Z, how do we measure whether what the person is telling us is truthful if we do not have sight of that?</p></speech>

For example, I read recently about a case where a garda had been returned for trial in the Circuit Court.  There would be no point in opening a public interest investigation when the DPP has already directed a prosecution and the matter is before the courts.</p></speech>

When one reads in the newspapers that a garda has been returned for trial, what is worrying is that we do not know how many investigations occurred about which we never heard.  They are the ones which are probably the most troubling.  If a garda is brought to court on foot of a Garda investigation, it looks like things have been efficiently done.  However, we do not know about the investigations that go nowhere.</p></speech>

On previous occasions when they were before the committee, the issue of a deficit in co-operation was discussed.  The statement mentions the need for unmitigated and legally enforceable access to information and evidence.  Has co-operation improved in recent times?  Are there areas in which there has been push-back?  It was said that trends were emerging in particular areas.  What is the trend around co-operation and engagement with various investigations?</p></speech>

I compliment the work of chief superintendent, Margaret Nugent.  She is in internal affairs and is our conduit for requests for information, as well as our general contact for investigations into protected disclosures.  She and her colleague, Superintendent Helen Deely, have been excellent to work with.  They are supported by Assistant Commissioner David Sheahan and, ultimately, the Garda Commissioner.  There are people at a high rank who are clearly supportive of the work GSOC does and anxious for us to have co-operation.</p> <p>  We do not just deal with chief superintendents, superindendents and assistant commissioners but it is at those levels we can run into difficulties.  When we have looked for information we have found that the people we dealt with acted efficiently and effectively but they then have to make requests to colleagues in particular stations around the country and it is at this point that things can get spotty.  The person who asks for the information takes what is supplied to them in good faith and they pass it on to us but the question is whether they got all the information they wanted and whether, in turn, we got what we wanted.  There is a sign of change and while this has to come from the top, it also needs to be recognised throughout the organisation.  People who are tasked with the job of making documentation available must understand the importance of doing so when it is first asked for, rather than deciding to give certain documentation and information but not other things unless they are specifically asked for them.  These individuals play an important role but we would like to see greater co-operation throughout.  The local intervention initiative will, hopefully, foster a more co-operative approach in local areas and local Garda stations to dealing with the public and this should feed back to ourselves.</p><p>Time will tell.</p></speech>

I indicated that our annual report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas today, but I understand it has been held back a week.  However, the committee should be seeing our annual report for 2018 soon.  In it we set out, for instance, where complaints come from in terms of the country.  In some instances chief superintendents have come to us to look for further information to dig down in their local area.  We have given them that information and we say we have seen a reduction in the following years.  I will again name check chief superintendent Dominic Hayes in the Kilkenny area, who came to us two years ago and noted that certain figures relating to his district were set out.  He wanted further information, and we saw a resulting reduction in the following year.  It can be down to people being curious, looking for information, and acting on foot of the information.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, mentioned the report from the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, but that is a different arena from where GSOC is at at present.  What is the follow through or audit of those cases that are handed back?  Does GSOC seek an update on the conclusion of all of them, or are they just handed back?

We know what the outcomes are, but we have no involvement in the investigation, unless we are supervising it.  In terms of outcomes, superintendents have, in fairness, sanctioned their own colleagues, so it is not that they find no misconduct.  In fact, they can find significant misconduct and be quite proactive in dealing with their colleagues.  We have indicated in our statistics that because superintendents and inspectors have a lot of things on their plates, some come back to us fairly quickly and others take longer.</p></speech>

That is obviously having a significant impact on the quality of follow-through.  Communication was also mentioned.  I can see that when stations have haemorrhaged a significant number of staff, and they have not got the communication, whether it is a positive or a negative result, the follow-through can break down confidence in some levels of policing.  GSOC has engagement with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  How does GSOC action the general dissatisfaction that has been highlighted in this trend, in terms of its role, and how are the improvements on that being measured?</p></speech>

If, as anticipated under this scheme, they deal with the small things, maybe in time they will also properly deal with some of the bigger things, which will reduce complaints coming to us.  It has yet to be seen, because it is in its early stages, and is only just over a year in operation.  The other, much bigger question, which is an internal one, is how the Garda service deals with misconduct at every level.</p><p>That is something we have no role in.  We may recommend somebody should be subject to discipline but ultimately that is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  If, as Mr. Justice Charleton said at the end of his dealings with the disclosures tribunal, the system is complicated, lengthy and undermined, then discipline is a problem for the Garda and ultimately the community.  We may feed it information under our current remit or even into the future.  How the organisation deals with that information, in terms of disciplining members, will ultimately be for it to decide.

The meeting has been very useful and insightful in terms of outlining the needs that exist.  Deputy Daly has very clearly outlined that many of the requirements have been identified by GSOC and others as having existed for a long time and, unfortunately, they were not acted upon.</p> <p>  Let me pick up on one of the previous questions.  Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring said her feedback is that the independent office of the police ombudsman, or whatever name it will ultimately take, is due to start in 2021.  Is this to say the organisation will be up and running?  Is it realistic?</p></speech>

It proposes that the terms of the new legislation will be effective from 1 January 2021.  Clearly, there will be transition issues for ourselves and various other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but it would appear 1 January 2021 is D-day, the start day, for a new organisation as we sit here today.</p></speech>

There will be the process of getting legislation through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We have no control over Members in that regard.  Inevitably, there will be unforeseen events between now and 1 January 2021, including something like a general election, which could affect all legislative timetables.  Therefore, there are many issues.  We are planning for 1 January 2021 until we are told otherwise.</p></speech>

There are protected disclosures from garda&iacute;.  A recent report outlined that, apart from 13 cases that were discontinued, 36 were still on the books and that there has not been any case from last year that led to a prosecution or recommendation of disciplinary action.  This is third report of that kind.  The first, covering 2014 to 2016, indicated nine disclosures were undergoing examination or investigation and that two were closed.  The 2017 report indicated that, of the 31 cases before GSOC, 25 were being examined or investigated at the end of 2017 and six were closed.  With regard to the six, the commission considered that further examination was not necessary or reasonably practicable.  It seems that, in most years, the majority of cases are carried over and that the remainder are closed.  Am I correct that no garda has faced a sanction from a GSOC investigation following on from a section 7 or section 8 protected disclosure?</p></speech>

The members will recollect that when we gave the business case last year, one of our main concerns was that we were setting up, for the confidence of the garda&iacute;, a separate unit within GSOC.</p><p>We started with one investigator, the senior investigating officer.  Late in 2018, we were finally given our sanction, and it is only as of Monday, 29 April that the investigator has been in the unit.  We have not been able to control the number of people making complaints to GSOC, while we have been able to control the number of people working there only in the past six to eight months.  Having achieved a full complement of staff, this is giving us the opportunity to deal with the backlog that has arisen.  When people approach us with a complaint, however, we tell them there is a backlog, that we have only recently achieved a full complement of investigators, and that if they are unhappy with the fact that the investigation may take some time, they do not have to stay with us.  They have another option.  They stay with us despite our telling them that the investigation will take some time.  We know we are trying their patience and that there is significant work to be done in the future, but we cannot stop people coming to us.  My colleagues and I receive protected disclosures at the initial stage and I pick up the phone and speak to these people.  I cannot tell them to go away.</p><p> We have a backlog, which we hope the current complement will deal with.  If the Deputy or anyone else expects us to clear our books immediately, however, that is just not possible, as we tell the people who approach us.</p></speech>

There is a backlog which, obviously, will take time to address.  Nevertheless, not a single case has resulted in a sanction.  From Ms Justice Ring's point of view, it is a matter of resources but I imagine there must be cases on the books for in excess of two years.  Are cases on the books for in excess of four years?</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the cases that were discontinued because it was not possible to bear them out or because there was insufficient evidence, I find it difficult to understand, even with the limited resources.  It has not been possible to bring forward even one of those cases to prosecution or to recommend disciplinary action.  I assume that the cases are not vexatious.  Does Ms Justice Ring accept that such a situation is disappointing, to say the least?</p></speech>

Under the 2014 Act, it was made clear that protected disclosures were permitted in respect of wrongdoings in the workplace.  The Act protected the identities of people making such disclosures but did not outline how to investigate those disclosures throughout the workplace.  I do not refer only to disclosures relating to the Garda.  Transparency International Ireland deals with many of these issues.  One of the first practical realities that confronted all workplaces was how to investigate an allegation of wrongdoing which requires the protection of the person making the claim of wrongdoing, while at the same time carrying out a fair and proportionate investigation.</p><p>It was heralded in 2014 and was a very important piece of legislation.  In the years that followed, GSOC and many other organisations had to grapple with the practical reality of how to investigate a protected disclosure.  Given the complexity around the Garda, we sought legal advice as to how to deal with these cases and it has been a step by step process to move forward on a complaint, gather information and at the same time protect the identity of a person.  It has not been easy which is why it is very important when passing legislation to consider also how a legislative proposal will work in practice.  We are still grappling.  If one goes to Transparency Ireland and talks to its personnel, one will hear that it remains a challenge for every workplace.</p></speech>

However, I hope the additional resources will mean we see things expedited.  I have a brief question about the following.  When she was before the committee last year, Ms Justice Ring said approximately half of the cases GSOC received could be disposed of within a year.  Is that still more or less the case?</p></speech>

The request was refused on the basis that to grant it would potentially identify somebody.  As such, I will be careful in my remarks so as to not identify anyone.  It remains my view, however, that there is a public interest in the issues that surround this generally.  I will be careful, but I intend to ask these questions all the same.  According to the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question I submitted, there were clearly issues.  If there were not, I expect the report would not have been commissioned.  According to the Minister's reply, a report was drawn up in 2016 under the direction of GSOC's director of investigations.  It related to a review of the workload on hand at the office in Longford.  Does Ms Justice Ring accept that, at that point in time, there were issues with the office and that it was not investigating as effectively as it should have been?</p></speech>

Certainly, there were even fewer people there in 2016.  In 2016, GSOC had perhaps one of the lowest staff cohorts at its Longford, Cork and Dublin offices.  It had approximately 77 staff across the organisation, which presented challenges in Cork, with which the Deputy will be familiar, Longford and Dublin.  I am not going to comment on an office which in 2016 was limited in terms of the number of people working there because the people involved are identifiable.  Unless the Deputy is going to say something specific about someone specific who has the right to reply, I am conscious that we are talking about a limited number of people who were working there in 2016.</p></speech>

One of the concerns the family had about the report was that the assertions of garda&iacute; had been accepted rather than tested or probed.  One example is that the Garda asserted to GSOC that it was unaware of events related to the case that had occurred outside the jurisdiction.  The family have documentary evidence that the PSNI had, in fact, informed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of these events.  The report took six years to complete and much time went into completing it.  Was it beyond the scope of GSOC or its resources to ask the Garda whether it was certain about its assertions and to seek further documentary evidence and contact the PSNI?  Why did that not happen?  Was it not possible with the resources available to GSOC at the time?</p></speech>

Insofar as communicating with the PSNI is concerned, the Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Justice and Equality is to introduce the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Bill to the D&aacute;il, if he has not done so already.  Its express purpose is to allow for international co-operation.  We have no right to seek information from the PSNI, no more than a member of the community has such a right.  We can contact the PSNI to look for information, but it can decide to give it to us or not.  However, we have no protocols, operating procedures or formal arrangements with it.  It is anticipated that, perhaps under new a policing Act in this jurisdiction, with the international co-operation provisions, that there may be better communication.</p><p>If we ask the PSNI for information, no more than if the Deputy asks, it may give it to us but it is not obliged to do so.  It is a difficult area.</p></speech>

The family, without any training, legal background or anything like that, were able to find this out.  The document was obviously relevant.  The Garda made an assertion that was accepted by GSOC, whereas the family were able to demonstrate that was not the case.  That is disappointing.</p><p>There was a disturbing report in <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>last July about a member of GSOC who was under investigation for allegedly coaching the solicitor of a garda who was due to be interviewed as part of an inquiry.  GSOC brought in an external investigator to carry out the inquiry.  The allegations reported in the newspaper are very serious.  It is also alleged that there was a failure to properly supervise an investigation into the alleged Garda mishandling of a complaint of sexual assault made by a woman.

Is it correct to say that cannot be discontinued under section 93?  Is it the case that it would either have to be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, or somewhere else?</p></speech>

For the benefit of non-techies, if a criminal investigation is completed the matter comes to the commission in the form of a report under section 101.  Having considered the report the commission can do one of three things: it can decide that the matter should go to the DPP for her consideration as to whether any criminal charges should be proffered; it can decide that no criminality was revealed but possible disciplinary misconduct and move it into a disciplinary investigation; or under section 101(7) it can decide, having read the report, that no misconduct is evident and can just finish the case.  Those are three options: DPP, discipline, or, under section 101(7), finding no misconduct and close the case.</p></speech>

It can be discontinued in advance of the section 101 report.  For instance, it may be that at a late stage a complainant decides not to proceed, it may be that the person against whom the complaint is made is ill or dies, or something happens to cause a decision to be made to not proceed with the matter.  However, once the report is prepared, it comes to the commission and the commission has the three options under the legislation.</p></speech>

My language may not be quite right but GSOC may ask the garda&iacute; for information, whatever it is called, and then GSOC decides whether it will take a public interest investigation.  I raised a particular incident and was concerned that it was not related to a public interest investigation.  This related to a discharge of a firearm within a dwelling during the course of a raid in Cabra in Dublin.  Video footage was published on some of the newspaper websites.  Would Ms Justice Ring agree that an incident such as that would be appropriate for a public interest investigation?  Should it not be the case that all discharges of firearms within dwellings require a public interest investigation?</p></speech>

They should be notified within 48 hours of the discharge of firearm, Taser or the OC spray.</p><p>We, therefore, receive notifications regularly, albeit not always within the required timeframe.  We look very seriously at all firearm and Taser discharges and the circumstances that gave rise to them and consider whether public interest investigations are warranted.  Sometimes we open them; sometimes we do not.  There is no threshold for where we should and should not.  For instance, we opened a public interest investigation when a firearm discharge occurred at Shannon Airport.  A plane had landed and been detained and a firearm discharged accidentally into the tarmac.  Fortunately, no damage was caused to property or a person.  However, because of the proximity of the discharge to aeroplanes and given the nature of the airport as a public place, we thought in that instance that it was important to open an investigation.  Perhaps now, with our greater resources, we are in a position to say we should open one in every instance, but we look at discharges on a case by case basis.  We have had to do so in many cases owing to the resources we have had available.</p></speech>

Because of a lack of resources and so on, it has been difficult to investigate every complaint and the process has been slow.  Has there ever been an incident where, following an investigation, GSOC intended to seek a conviction but the Statute of Limitations of the petty sessions Act meant that was not possible.</p></speech>

Whether a matter is indictable does not matter.  The 18-month period is longer than normal, as we recognise.  We also recognise that the 18-month period runs from the date of the alleged offence.  If someone comes to us straightaway, we have 18 months.  If someone does not come to us until six months after the offence, we only have 12 months.  If he or she comes to us 12 months after it, we have six months.  Therefore, a lot depends on when we receive the complaint in the first instance.  Our practice is to keep a very close eye on the statute, but it is not always possible at the outset of an investigation to know that what we are investigating is a summary matter.  We may not realise until after we have gathered evidence that, despite the seriousness attached to the complaint at the outset, the evidence relates to a more minor matter.  We are always conscious of the timeframe.  Have we ever gone outside it?  Again, I cannot say off the top of my head, but it is possible.  There are people who have come to us late and there could have been no investigation within the timeframe.  Recently, since the complaint was made towards the end of the 18 month period, the Director of Public Prosecutions considered it immediately and directed that a prosecution be taken because we were both conscious that time was against us.</p></speech>

This will emerge late enough in the investigation.  In this context, we certainly come across potential offences which are statute barred but which were not apparent at the beginning of our investigation.  This does occur.</p></speech>

We called for a Garda ombudsman long before the position was created.  We have seen the value of such an office in the North.  We hope the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and additional resources will strengthen the work of GSOC.  From what I can see, not every element is satisfactory at this point.  The work involved here is very important.  I hope that GSOC will continue to do better and that resources will assist it in that regard.</p></speech>

When we made our business case, we were conscious of the need not to end up with too many people doing particular work and not having enough support or administrative staff in the organisation.  Increasing the number of personnel puts a strain on the HR department.  We have to have regard to the effect increases in staff numbers have on the organisational structure.  The other element was that we were working within a financial framework and we had to have regard to how many persons we could hire within that framework.  Had we had an unlimited framework, we certainly would have sought more investigators and support staff but we were conscious of the financial realities and taking those realities we constructed a case that fit financially and met our needs.  To answer the question as to whether we would like more, yes we would.</p></speech>

Ms Justice Ring has made it very clear that one of GSOC's real concerns is matching a new remit with resources.  In 2018, in excess of 500 cases went back to the Garda for investigation.  If they are to come under GSOC's direct attention once again, there will have to be a significant increase in resources to cope.  This is very clear and I am of the view that GSOC would have the support of the committee in its entirety in that regard.  It is something we will most definitely do.</p> <p>  In the context of some of our recent reports on community policing and rural crime, Ms Justice Ring highlighted the fact that garda&iacute; are being diverted from their usual policing duties in order to address a plethora of these GSOC investigations.  I use that language quite pointedly.</p><p>We are losing them and their expertise in the context of the front-line duties that they should be performing.</p><p> It has been 15 months since representatives from GSOC were last with us.  I am still the Chair and, along with the clerk, I deal with all of the correspondence on a week-by-week basis.  I will share with our guests, in an honest and frank way, what I have noted with some disappointment during that period.  All that they have shared with us underscores or explains some of this.  There has been an increased frequency in expressions of a loss of confidence.  We receive a great deal of correspondence relating to matters that do not come within our remit, but people write to us in any event.  This is the justice committee, so they tend to vent and share their experiences with us.  I am sharing with our guests the fact that there is a lack-of-confidence factor, which is not what we or they want to see.  Everyone in political life has a responsibility to help to ensure that this does not become rooted in any way.</p><p> Ms Justice Ring referenced the emergence of a proposal to establish an independent office of the police ombudsman.  Am I describing that clearly enough?</p></speech>

I must say with some disappointment that it will not just set in at an early stage, it will be carried forward if people do not hear what Ms Justice Ring is saying and what we are reflecting on.  It would be of significant concern that the new body would start off not just having to prove itself but that it would also be obliged to carry forward a considerable lack of public confidence.  When Deputy Clare Daly referenced damage, I made the note that the damage had been done to GSOC in terms of public confidence by virtue of the fact that the resourcing was not all it should have been.</p> <p>  It was stated that GSOC could not just tell people to go away.  In that context, I am familiar with a case that has been submitted to GSOC.  I do not know whether it is standard procedure, but the correspondence issuing indicated that GSOC would make an arrangement to meet, interview and explore with the complainant the details initially provided in writing.  Some time later, a letter issued stating that GSOC had made a decision, yet there had been no engagement at all with the complainant.  How often would this be the case?  In the specific instance with which I am familiar, it has had a damaging impact.  The case involves very respectable and considered people who would not have made a complaint to GSOC willy-nilly .  The complaint had substance and a basis of concern, yet they were never afforded the opportunity that the correspondence from GSOC indicated would be theirs, namely, to be met, have their case heard, answer questions, elaborate and do what they and we all would have expected would have been their opportunity to do.  It never happened and they then received correspondence indicating that the matter had been discontinued without explanation.  I have copies of those items of correspondence.  I do not know what our guests can say to me in respect of this matter.  I do not know whether this was unusual or if it is a frequent occurrence that people do not get their day in court, so to speak.</p><p>It is important at least that people be afforded the opportunity to expand on the information they have provided.  Would Ms Justice Ring like to comment?</p></speech>

Insofar as we deal with, perhaps, 2,000 complaints per annum, I cannot say I know what the Chairman is talking about in terms of the individual case, but it would not be appropriate to comment on it.  I am, however, happy to speak to the Chairman about the case following the meeting, but I would be very surprised to hear someone was not given an opportunity to be heard.  There are procedures in place.  By its nature, an investigation should involve somebody who is making a complaint because we cannot know what to investigate unless we receive the full complaint.  The right to be heard of the garda or garda&iacute;, whom it is alleged has or have done something wrong, is also important.  It should not be until after these two aspects of a complaint are dealt with that a decision is made about the future of the case.  In that sense, I would be very alarmed.</p></speech>

In the case I have mentioned a decision, so-called, has issued.  I would like to comment on a case that has been referred to GSOC in the relatively recent past, but I am restricted somewhat in how I can reference it.  I endeavoured to raise the matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il and ask a question on behalf of my community about a significant Garda deployment that had had an adverse consequence for a resident in the broader community.  I do not know the person concerned and have never met them.  I know nothing about the nature of the exercise, but I understand it involved a significant number of heavily armed and black-clad members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the local media raised the matter with the Garda Press Office, they received the short and inaccurate response that the matter had been referred to GSOC and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be offering no further explanation or would not shed further light on the matter.  Taking account of international news, etc. which influences people's thought processes, there has been every imaginable, possible explanation for this exercise.  That is not appropriate.  People living in the community from where the person concerned comes are immediately suspect and labelled as being associated with serious matters with which they - I hope I am correct in saying this - have no association.  I am a little fearful because the Minister's response was that as the matter had been referred to GSOC, he could offer no further illumination.  Is Ms Justice Ring concerned that GSOC, in the referral to it of certain matters, is being used as a means of holding back critical information?  As an elected representative, I have a role and a responsibility to try to elucidate information on what is happening.</p><p>This has not happened in my memory, living in the community all the many decades I have chalked up at this point.  This was so unusual but nobody will offer any explanation whatever.  The GSOC referral is the reason, according the Garda press office and the Minister on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  That causes me concern.  Do the witnesses have any concern about GSOC being employed, used or misused in such a case?  Would GSOC's addressing of this matter take on board the wider consideration of what is reasonable?  Communities appreciate transparency and having some sense of what this is about.  There is a negative or a downside that can arise from the holding back of all information.  Others from the person's community have come to me in fear and every suggestion has been put as to what the wider interests might be, not only domestically but internationally and globally.  Nothing could be further from the truth, they say, although I do not know.  I am not an investigator or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On behalf of my community, I am only trying to establish whether this is something that will become a feature of life going forward.  How will people address it and why would the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be so tight-lipped on the matter?</p><p> I will leave it at that.  I am obviously compromised in how I can refer to this.  I hope I have been careful enough and I understand the witnesses must also be careful and may perhaps be even more careful in replying to me.  My first question is whether GSOC has concerns and the second question is whether it will consider the wider aspect of what is appropriate in deploying 20 or more heavily armed people in this way.  What would give rise to such an action?  For me it would be a concern that they might be met by a similar weight of force.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It is clear from what I have said that in our experience not everything gets referred to us.  There is clearly a differentiation as to what comes to us or does not come to us.  It would be our hope that everything would come to us as a matter of course and then we would not have to think about what is in the minds of the referring parties.  It has happened that we have got a referral closely followed by a press inquiry.  That is a fact that clearly raises questions for us as to how quickly the press discovers that a matter has come to us and why.  I cannot speculate on what is in the minds of people who send matters to us.  There are matters that come to us with great speed and they can be followed at even greater speed by queries from the media.</p> <p>  We have spoken about our remit and we have set out in our workflow diagram the restrictions we have.  The main restriction, which we have already said we would like to see dealt with under new legislation, comes where citizen A complains about garda B or garda&iacute; B, C and D.  It is all we can investigate.  In some instances we could go beyond that into a public interest investigation but again we would be looking at individuals.</p><p>As we have no role in operational matters, we cannot tell the Garda how to do its job.  We can only look at the outcome of the job and whether it displays misconduct, either criminal or disciplinary.  Again, under the current legislation, we are back to looking at the actions of A, B or C.  If A, B or C is acting in accordance with directions, for instance, than it is not misconduct.  If he or she is in a given place for an operational reason, it is not misconduct.  If we can look at an incident from the overview of the individuals involved, that may give us more scope.  We know it is frustrating when people make a complaint about an incident to GSOC and we have to extract from them or the Garda information on which individuals were involved.  The individuals in question may say they were acting in accordance with what they were told to do.  All that GSOC can say in such circumstances is that there was no misconduct.  We cannot say we thought it was bad judgment or anything about it operationally.  We can make recommendations for the future.  However, under the current legislation, we do not have recommendation powers and the Garda can, therefore, ignore our recommendations.</p><p> GSOC operates in that maze.  This affects the expectations the public have of us.  We must follow the steps.  We have indicated to the Department of Justice and Equality that we would like to have a legislative framework in place under which a complaint, which can be any kind of allegation, results in an investigation that is fair, proportionate and in accordance with the law.  Moreover, it should have one of three outcomes, either the matter goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda Commissioner or GSOC finds no misconduct by any party.  It would be a three-step process, not what the committee has before it.</p></speech>

This important because the use of such devices can cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  As there is no 4G in this room, mobile phones are no use to us in any event.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Les Allamby, who is the chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission; Professor Colin Harvey of Queen's University Belfast; Mr. Daniel Holder of the Committee on the Administration of Justice; and Ms Una Boyd.  They are here today to discuss citizenship rights following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of the European Union.  The committee touched on this issue in its original round of hearings and it was covered in the report we published in June 2017.  Here we are in May 2019 and the wider discussion has not yet reached much of what we would like to see implemented.  I do not intend to get into the politics of Westminster or elsewhere.  There is an understandable level of frustration.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we are aware that the recommendations we made in our report, on the basis of the advice we took in our hearings, are a living picture for many people on the ground on the North and South of this island, in the United Kingdom and across the wider Continent.  We appreciate the chance to engage with experts who have vast knowledge of this area and have worked in it.  I look forward to a frank discussion and exchange of views with them.  I would also like to welcome Ms Emma DeSouza, who is in the Gallery.  Members of the committee met Ms DeSouza informally before this meeting commenced.  We appreciate her time very much.</p> <p>  I ask everyone to bear with me while I read the rules on privilege, which will take a couple of minutes.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Mr. Allamby to make the opening statement.</p></speech>

The commission has worked productively with its counterpart, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, through a joint committee that was established under the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement to protect and promote the strongest possible human rights and equality protections on foot of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.  We also have worked effectively with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in those discussions.  We have also had a very significant engagement with civic society more broadly.  The joint committee that was established under the Belfast Agreement entered into the discussions with six key aims: to ensure a commitment to non-diminution of rights is evident and enforceable in the final withdrawal agreement; to safeguard North-South equivalence of rights on an ongoing basis; to guarantee equality of citizenship within Northern Ireland, a matter to which I will return; to protect Border communities and migrant workers; to ensure evolving justice arrangements comply with the commitment to non-diminution of rights; and to ensure a continued right to participate in public life for EU citizens in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  In our recommendations and our work, we have sought to preserve existing protections, while keeping pace with human rights and equality protections as they develop within the EU in the future.  In our view, while substantial progress was made in the withdrawal agreement, significant gaps remain and certain issues need to be resolved.  The question of citizenship rights is one of those issues.  In particular, consideration must be given to how existing EU law rights can be protected in a way that is consistent with the recognition in the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement that people can identify themselves, and be accepted, as Irish or British, or both, without any adverse consequences for rights.  We think there are three strands to resolving this: first, through the draft withdrawal agreement or any subsequent agreements agreed between the UK and the EU 27 or both; second, through bilateral agreements agreed between the UK and the Irish Government; and third, through legislative arrangements that are put in place by the UK Government within its own domestic laws.  I will take each of these briefly in turn.</p> <p>  On the draft withdrawal agreement, the December 2017 report acknowledged that people in Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy EU law rights as EU citizens where they reside in Northern Ireland.  However, it remains unclear what these rights entail in practice.  The nearest thing we have got to a public indication was a fact sheet on the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol in the draft withdrawal agreement, which was issued by the European Commission.  The fact sheet sets out the rights to be guaranteed, including the right to non-discrimination on the basis of nationality, the right to move and reside freely within the EU, the right to consular protection or help from the embassy or consulate of any other EU member state in a country which has no Irish Embassy or consulate, the right to petition the European Parliament and complain to the EU Ombudsman, the right to access European Parliament, European Commission and Council documents under certain conditions, the right to access to the EU civil service and the right to contact and receive a response from any EU institution in one of the official EU languages.  It appears that those rights apply to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland when they travel elsewhere to the European Union, rather than the reverse, on their return to Northern Ireland from the EU.  Under the Westminster European Union (Withdrawal) Act, the supremacy of EU law over UK law will no longer apply after the EU has left the EU.</p> <p>  The value and impact of any retained EU law rights will depend on the agreements that are finally reached to retain rights for people living in the UK as a whole.  The UK Government's position is that it wants to retain access to the European health insurance card for everyone across the EU.  It wants to retain access to Erasmus programmes throughout the UK.  Such arrangements have not yet been agreed because the draft withdrawal agreement is stuck in Westminster.  We in the commission have a particular problem with the current position that extends beyond the need to gain clarity.  The current position is that these rights will apply only to those who identify as Irish within Northern Ireland.  For us, that creates a potential move towards an unequal citizenship that is contrary to the principles of the Good Friday Agreement, unless those rights are extended to all the people of Northern Ireland.  That is the position of the joint committee in respect of this situation.</p> <p>  The second strand I would like to focus on is the bilateral agreements agreed between the UK and the Irish Government.</p><p>It appears inconceivable that the EU will directly grant people from Northern Ireland more EU law rights than those applying to EU citizens remaining within the EU as an intrinsic position.  Nonetheless, the EU has recognised the common travel area and that it provides a route for bilateral agreements to be reached which provide for additional rights.  This has been recognised as legitimate for social security purposes in the UK Supreme Court decision in Patmalniece <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.  In terms of access to certain social security benefits and residence clauses, being a part of the common travel area confers advantages over and above other EU nationals, and it is perfectly lawful.<br/><br/>We now know that the Irish and UK Governments have worked on arrangements to ensure provision is in place to, for example, mutually recognise professional qualifications in each state, to pursue further and higher education, to access health care, social and supported housing, homeless assistance and to provide an entitlement to vote in local and national parliamentary elections.  I understand that will be reflected in the memorandum of understanding being signed today by the two governments.  As ever, for us and others, the detail of the memorandum of understanding and whether any package of legislative measures that may follow will require careful scrutiny in order to assess the value and the legal protections that will be provided.  An agreement on reciprocity in social security was also reached at the beginning of February 2019 and has now been published.  The commission&rsquo;s position is in line with the research we commissioned last year, which noted that the legal underpinnings of the common travel area are built on sand, and that any future arrangements should be placed on a common travel area formal legal footing through a treaty in order to copper-fasten and future-proof arrangements.  I am happy to come back and talk about that further.<br/><br/>The common travel area is not comprehensive and it does not, for example, cover family reunification and family migration arrangements for people in Northern Ireland, including Ms Emma DeSouza.  For us, the announcement by the T&aacute;naiste that the Irish Government would underwrite the cost of maintaining the European health insurance card, EHIC, arrangements for everyone in Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal scenario was an interesting development.  That welcome reassurance extends beyond those who identify as Irish citizens and is consistent with the commitment contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  We are interested in whether that is based on citizenship or residence in Northern Ireland, but it shows that one can have at least a form of equal citizenship to preserve rights in line with the agreement. <br/><br/>Third are the UK domestic arrangements.  The British Nationality Act 1981 confers British citizenship on those born in the UK after commencement, if at that time the person&rsquo;s father or mother is a British citizen or is settled in the UK.  In effect, and this is slightly simplistic but not far off it, people in Northern Ireland are treated as British citizens whether or not they identify as British.  That clearly runs contrary to the clear intention and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  That was acknowledged as such by the Prime Minister Theresa May in her speech in Belfast recently when she outlined &quot;the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both and to hold both British and Irish Citizenship is absolutely central to the Belfast Agreement&quot;.  In that same speech, the Prime Minister set out her response to people encountering difficulties in securing rights as Irish citizens to bring in family members.  She had asked the Home Secretary, working closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to review these issues urgently and to deliver a long-term solution consistent with the letter and spirit of the Belfast Agreement.  Rather disappointingly, it now transpires from answers to parliamentary questions that the review is informal, is confined to family migration rules for the people of Northern Ireland, and has no terms of reference or fixed timeline save that a solution will be set out as soon as possible.  We would have preferred a more comprehensive and inclusive review, but I have little doubt that the Irish Government is seeking to bring its influence to bear behind the scenes.  We think, frankly, that it should be more upfront and open, and wider than that.<br/><br/>In Westminster, the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill is before Parliament.  It is a bit of a mouthful.  That Bill includes the repeal of the main EU law relating to free movement rights.  In future, such rights will be governed by UK law alongside any agreement reached between the UK Government and the EU 27, augmented by any common travel area arrangements.  The Good Friday Agreement citizenship rights have not been incorporated into UK domestic law and the commission recommended in its response to the legislation that a new clause be added to amend section 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981 to recognise &quot;the birth right of all people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose&quot; on a no detriment basis.  That recommendation, interestingly, is in line with the advice we provided on a bill of rights to the Secretary of State in December 2008.  At that time, the response of the Northern Ireland Office to that recommendation was instructional.  It outlined:</p><blockquote>The government recognises the considerable symbolic importance of a choice by a person to identify himself or herself as British or Irish or both, in line with the commitments made in the Belfast Agreement and believes that such a choice should be respected.  In the view of the Government, such a right is central to any bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  The Government therefore believes that any bill of rights for Northern Ireland should enshrine in legislation the right of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British or both.</blockquote><p>The consultation document acknowledged the need to discuss with the Irish Government how such a right can be formulated and made effective.  We would prefer to see a bill of rights to do that, but in the absence of one, as envisaged within the Good Friday Agreement, we would recommend that a similar legislative commitment is made effective in UK domestic legislation following discussion with the Irish Government.<br/><br/>The joint committee of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is due to meet in a fortnight's time.  We will consider commissioning some research on both the legal and practical ways in which we might address the outstanding citizenship issues linked to the UK leaving the EU, and how they can be effectively resolved in line with the principles enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  I am more than happy to expand on any of those issues following questions.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I have provided a written opening statement which has been circulated, so I do not intend to read that out, but will go through some of its key points with a view to moving on to the discussion.  Some of it echoes what Mr. Allamby has already outlined this afternoon.  There are three themes I would like to underline: the discussion around citizenship in context; Brexit, human rights and equality; and strengthening the protection of human rights and equality on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  At the end of my written opening statement, I provided an annex which is a proposal for potential amendments of the political declaration in the context of an amendment that was circulated earlier this year that would explicitly recognise some of the things we were talking about this afternoon.  Whereas the withdrawal agreement is to be taken as read, there has been some discussion about the scope for revisiting the political declaration about the future relationship.  That amendment was advanced in the context of that conversation and I thought it would be useful for members to see that this afternoon.</p> <p>  First, I refer to citizenship in context.  The Good Friday Agreement, and the birthright provisions that are there, the right to be accepted and identify as British or Irish, or both, have already been outlined.  It is helpful to put that in context in terms of the current conversation that is happening in relation to the North, and is reflected in the very courageous campaign being undertaken by Emma and Jake DeSouza.  That is the sense in which the parity of esteem, mutual respect, and equal treatment provisions of the Good Friday Agreement have been significantly neglected.</p><p>They have been subjected to systematic disrespect.  I put that out there as a context for framing this conversation.  I do not think it is possible to understand what is happening in the North at the moment unless we reflect on events in that context.</p><p> We have heard reference to the December 2017 joint report from British and EU negotiators.  Many people will be aware of paragraph 52 in that report.  It refers to the future rights of Irish citizens as European Union citizens and the debate that has emerged regarding Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland, in particular.  There is a real and merited sense that the commitment given in paragraph 2 of that same joint report has been neglected and now requires urgent attention.  I link that aspect to the earlier point made regarding the recognition of the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equal treatment in the context of the current debate on the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> An event is being organised in Newry tomorrow by Ireland's Future.  It follows on from a previous event in January.  The context for these events is a growing sense in Northern Ireland of Irish citizens being abandoned and disrespected and of basic elements of the Good Friday Agreement not having been implemented in full.  Aspects of the joint report from December 2017, particularly paragraph 52 obligations, have also not been taken forward and implemented effectively and practically and that underlines a feeling of formalisation failure in respect of elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  We need to see those rights codified in practice and the existing implementation gap closed.  </p><p> In placing citizenship in context, I also want to underline another aspect which links with my next point.  In the context of a current sense of disrespect and abandonment, arguments are being made in Northern Ireland for the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equal treatment and the rights of Irish citizens to be respected.  The people making those arguments are arguing for a levelling up in the sense that the rights of Irish citizens link directly to a wider debate about the human rights culture existing in Northern Ireland.</p><p> My second point is that Brexit has exacerbated the current human rights and equality crisis in Northern Ireland.  The word "crisis" is merited and I explain that in more detail in my full written submission.  There have been attempts to address this in the context of the Brexit conversation and the resultant withdrawal agreement and protocol for enforcement and implementation.  It has to be noted that human rights and equality made it into the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and it must be acknowledged that work has been done in this area.  There is a sense, however, as committee members will be aware, that this is an exercise in damage limitation.  I refer to Northern Ireland getting to remain in the European Union and the sense that everything else is really second best.  Regarding Brexit and the concerns remaining about paragraph 52, Irish citizens in the North are genuinely anxious that the obligations and commitments set out in that paragraph will not be realised in practice.  I underline again that is why proposals were made earlier this year to amend the political declaration to give a clear commitment to those paragraph 52 responsibilities in respect of the future relationship conversation.  The amendments proposed can, of course, be taken forward in a range of other contexts as well. </p><p> I also underline the need to strengthen significantly the human rights framework in the North and on the island of Ireland.  My written submission contains a number of proposals on how that might be done.  The overriding theme of this opening statement is that we have heard many references to the Good Friday Agreement in the context of a European-wide conversation on Brexit.  As we are now finding out because of this Brexit process, and as we knew before, there has been a systematic implementation and formalisation failure regarding key concepts in the Good Friday Agreement.  The case of Emma de Sousa serves as an example, as do other similar cases.  We really need to do something about that implementation gap and formalisation failure.  My written submission refers to some of the extensive measures needed.  Many of the areas will be familiar.  The bill of rights has already been referred to, as has the charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  It is important to acknowledge the work being done by the joint committee of the two human rights commissions on the island in areas such as equal marriage, language rights, women's rights and socio-economic rights in the North.  Action also needs to be taken, however, to address the significant implementation gap in a range of other areas with respect to the Good Friday Agreement.  In that context, the failure to respect, and recognise in law, parity of esteem, mutual respect and equal treatment for the two main communities in the North is a yawning gap.  Irish citizens have felt that absence strongly in the years since this implementation gap emerged.  </p><p> The final part of my written opening statement refers to a way forward.  I am more at liberty to speak about this topic than some of my colleagues here today.  To put it simply, and from my own perspective, addressing this implementation gap and formalisation failure is long overdue.  The way forward is very clear for Northern Ireland, the North.  While negotiations are ongoing, both Governments and all political parties need to openly and honestly confront and address the human rights and equality crisis that objectively exists in Northern Ireland.  If we are going to renew the Good Friday Agreement, its values and institutions, we have to face into confronting and addressing the human rights and equality crisis at the heart of the current problems in the North.</p></speech>

As committee members may know, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is an independent human rights organisation based in Belfast.  I and my colleague, Ms Una Boyd, work for the organisation.  We co-convene the Equality Coalition with the UNISON public service union, and we were also the NGO partner in BrexitLawNI, a joint project with the law schools of Queens University Belfast and Ulster University which engaged with much of their subject matter.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement recognises a birthright for those born in Northern Ireland to be Irish or British or both.  That is a treaty-based duty on both states.  The same provision also obliges both states to recognise dual citizenship.  Many other states do not recognise that right.  That provision, and related provisions on equality and parity of esteem, mean that the birthright to be British or Irish or both is meant to result in equality of treatment regardless of the choice of citizenship.  At the time of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the good news was that a fairly comprehensive legal framework, across a range of areas, ensured Irish citizens enjoyed equality of treatment with British citizens in Northern Ireland.  The bad news is that legal framework was EU law, which is going to be turned off by Brexit.  What is left is precarious, despite all the attempts to talk up the framework of the common travel area, CTA.  It is not possible, as things stand, for someone born in Belfast to land in a Belfast airport on any international journey and enter and reside in Belfast as an Irish citizen.  It can be done as an EU citizen but that right currently only exists under EU law.  There is a Bill before the British Parliament at Westminster at the moment to remedy that particular gap, but the same clause in the Bill also makes it easier to exclude or deport the same person.</p><p>There are many assurances about the largely mythical reciprocal rights of the common travel area.  I know there is a memorandum of understanding that will be published today and that we have yet to see but certainly there was no public consultation on the scope of that.  As it is just a memorandum of understanding it is not going to contain enforceable rights.  What we do not see is the UK trying to put in place a comprehensive replacement legal framework to replace EU law that will ensure equality of treatment for Irish citizens in the North.  In fact, if one wants a right as simple as not to be deported from one's country of birth, the direction of travel from the UK Government is really that one only has that right by virtue of being considered a British citizen.</p><p> Things are not so rosy either in Northern Ireland for those who choose their Good Friday Agreement birthright to be British.  Irish citizens will, of course, retain EU citizenship after Brexit and at least the basic freedom of movement in the EU that comes with that but British citizens will not do so.  Brexit has managed to turn everyone into a second class citizen albeit in different ways.  That is before we get on to the implications for migrant communities who, as shown in our research, are already facing increased racial profiling and discrimination.  Brexit leaves different groups of our citizens, and I will quote the title of one of our recent conference, "divided by the rules" as never before as there is going to be a lot of differentiation between entitlements in terms of citizenship status.</p><p> Brexit also creates real difficulties in complying with the equality of treatment principles of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is difficult to see how any form of Brexit, at least without some form of special status for the North that allowed British citizens to retain EU citizenship, can comply with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  Had Westminster discharged its duties under the Good Friday Agreement to legislate for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, that would have had a legally enforceable birthright to be British or Irish or both without differential or detrimental treatment, it is difficult to see how Brexit could be lawfully taken forward in the North at the moment. </p><p> As has been alluded to by others, after 1998 even with the Good Friday Agreement the UK failed to bring its citizenship laws in line with the agreement.  It continues to automatically confer British citizenship on almost all persons born in the North.  Nevertheless, the UK Home Office until 2012 did generally respect those rights of Northern Ireland born people who were attached to Irish citizenship.  That changed, post-2012, precisely to stop the exercise of particular EU rights such as family reunification as in the DeSouza case.  The policy changed to treat all Northern Ireland born people as also being British. </p><p> While Irish citizens maintain EU citizenship and rights like basic freedom of movement in the EU, most other EU rights, opportunities and benefits are not automatically retained after Brexit but require specific arrangements.  That is the case with political rights to return MEPs, the European health insurance card, rights to cross-border healthcare or education, rights to be joined by family members, etc.  As has been alluded to by other witnesses, in December 2017 in the phase 1 agreement in the EU-UK joint report, and I refer to the now infamous paragraph 52, it committed to continued access to and exercise of such EU rights, opportunities and benefits for Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  That is well beyond the basic list of citizens' rights that were alluded by the chief commissioner earlier.  The scope of that commitment is beyond that and that is testified by the language in the paragraph around specific arrangements for the continued exercise of these rights being examined.  However, there is nothing to implement that commitment in the draft withdrawal agreement.  It is only mentioned in the non-binding preamble.  It is not even mentioned in the political declaration on future arrangements.  That commitment really has been neglected.  </p><p> More recently, the other route to retain certain EU rights and benefits for Irish citizens in the North is under the EU settlement scheme.  It was possible to do so during its pilot phase but then the Home Office changed the criteria with the purpose and effect of excluding Northern Ireland born Irish citizens from retaining EU rights under the withdrawal agreement.  Again, that was done on the basis of also treating such persons as British.  There is a potential U-turn.  We now know of at least one case where a Northern Ireland Irish citizen has applied and successfully achieved the retention of EU rights under the settled status scheme.  It is up to the Home Office to clarify its position on this matter.  Unless that happens this leaves Northern born Irish citizens as almost the only EU citizens within the UK who will not be able to retain EU citizens' rights under the withdrawal agreement, which is quite a serious situation.  Let us consider where we are.  This is not where we wanted to be at this particular stage.  We wanted to be at a stage where Irish citizens had rightly retained EU rights and benefits, and that would benefit those who would choose to be Irish under the Good Friday Agreement or, indeed, those who choose to be Irish and British.  In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and levelling up, we really wanted to be at the stage now of not going for the lowest common denominator but be at the stage of looking at arrangements for those who also exercise their rights under the Good Friday Agreement to be solely British.  Instead of this the UK Home Office is quite actively seeking the lowest common denominator and seeking to strip every possible EU right and benefit from Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.  It is doing so in a manner that fundamentally conflicts with the Good Friday Agreement.  I think we are at a stage where we need significant movement from both Governments and the EU on this issue before it really is too late.</p></speech>

I really appreciate the work that they are all doing and continue to do in this area.  As I mentioned, Ms Emily Logan and a number of others have supplied the committee with written submissions, which are welcome.</p> <p>  I will open up the debate to Senators for questions.  I propose we take groups of three Senators to start with but that depends on how many Senators are offering.  I ask Senators to please raise their hands to indicate a wish to speak.  I call Senator Marshall. </p></speech>

It is a steep learning curve for many members on this committee and many people who have been acutely aware of the DeSouza case, which we have all watched with interest through the media.</p> <p>  Professor Harvey referred to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland being abandoned and a "systematic failure" in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  His comments will sound pretty grim to someone on the outside looking in.  I have lived in Northern Ireland for 50 years and I do not see a grim or bleak picture.  Certainly there are big issues and things we need to deal with but I do not view the situation in the same light as him.</p> <p>  Professor Harvey mentioned in his presentation that issues have not been addressed.  He referred to the failure to deliver on human rights, equality rights, Irish language rights, equal marriage, women's rights and to deal with the legacy of the conflict.  Is it fair of me to say that has more to do with the abject failure of the political structure of Northern Ireland as opposed to this issue?</p> <p>  I apologise for my ignorance on this matter but I am completely supportive of Ms DeSouza and the decision on her case is wrong, unjust and unfair.  How many similar cases exist?  Is there a tsunami of cases or a small number of cases?  We were led to believe earlier on that a relatively small number of cases fall into a similar category to the DeSouza case.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the issues that would be presented to Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland.  Are there reciprocal issues for citizens who would qualify themselves as British but reside in the South of Ireland?  How does that aspect fit with the wider discussion?</p></speech>

I was not aware of many of the consequences of Brexit.  I ask that we park Brexit for a few seconds, which I know is impossible to do in any walk of life in the current period, as I want to get my head around how we got here.  If there was no Brexit, hypothetically speaking, where would we be today?  Has a vacuum been created by the inaction of both Westminster and Dublin in terms of the human rights secured in the Good Friday Agreement?  We were led to believe these things were written in stone, including the possibility or opportunity of citizens of Northern Ireland to have Irish or British or both when it came to their citizenship and form of identify.</p><p>The delegates have highlighted what the ramifications of Brexit will be and the minefields that await.  Are we lucky to have dodged those minefields or have many individuals been unfortunate enough to step into them because of what has been written into the withdrawal agreement?  Although it is written into the agreement, was it parked and no action taken thereon?  If so, what actions could or should be taken?  Would the delegates cast the blame on the Government at Westminster, in Dublin or both?</p></speech>

I ask it now because to some extent it follows on from the point made by Senator Paul Daly.  I am not seeking to assign blame, but one of the main functions of the committee is to look for solutions to the myriad problems thrown up by the type of Brexit that is or could be on offer.  As referenced in the report of the committee, with the hundreds of suggestions we mentioned previously, there are two key areas at which I would look in terms of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement within and outside the context of Brexit.  What are the legislative gaps in the United Kingdom and Ireland that need to be filled and how can they be filled, regardless of what is going on in the wider discussion?  Second, is there a role for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference?  It is meeting today and good progress has been made on the issue of the common travel area by the T&aacute;naiste and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. David Lidington.  Can the conference play a more hands-on role in this area?  Should it do so?  Moving beyond the specific issue of rights, what role could the conference play in the future relationship between the Ireland and the United Kingdom outside the European Union which will ultimately be defined by the nature of Brexit, particularly in key areas of human rights and justice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Daniel Holder" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#E00300"><p>Leaving Brexit aside, it is really the absence of implementation of the rights-based provisions of the various agreements that make up the peace settlement that has contributed significantly to the collapse of the institutions.  These issues were the unfulfilled business.  They were safeguards against the abuses of executive power that took place and which ultimately made the institutions untenable.  On whose responsibility it is, I do not see it as the fault of the political structures, <i>per se</i>.  These are international treaties and agreements.  The main duty bearers are the two Governments, specifically the British Government which has the jurisdiction to legislate for the things for which it was supposed to legislate, including amending the British Nationality Act 1981 to bring it into line with the Good Friday Agreement, as recommended by the human rights commissioner, which would have prevented cases such as the DeSouza case from arising.  In addition, the introduction of a Bill of Rights was very much a core component of the Good Friday Agreement.  As I alluded to, if the citizenship rights provisions had been implemented at the time, we would not be facing many of the problems we are facing; rather, there would be equality of treatment and a retention of rights.<br/><br/>Ms Boyd might be better placed to identify the number of people affected by the Home Office decision in 2012 to deny Irish citizens in Northern Ireland EU rights to family reunification.  Of course, that is reciprocated for British citizens, including those born in the North, who live in this state because it is a right that attaches to a citizen of the European Union residing in a member state other than the one of which he or she is a citizen.  The issue caused by Brexit is that whereas this was restricted to a specific group of cases, namely, people looking for family reunification rights, Brexit massively amplifies the problem because essentially it shares the issue of people not being able to exercise EU rights as Irish citizens across a range of other areas of provision that would be covered by the withdrawal agreement or would have been covered by the paragraph 52 commitments.  Even if there is a welcome continuation of cross-Border health and education services, for example, under the memorandum of understanding for the common travel area, a distinction needs to be made because they are not enforceable rights.  The Governments might agree to an administrative arrangement, but who knows who the next Prime Minister will be or make up the next government of Britain or what attitude it will take to those administrative arrangements?  What we really need is an enforceable right.  Had some of these instruments been implemented when they were supposed to be, an enforceable EU right would be the type of thing that would be retained.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Una Boyd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#E00400"><p>A relatively small number of people have been affected by cases such as that of Ms DeSouza.  While working as an immigration solicitor in Belfast I encountered a lot of people who were in a very similar situation post 2012.  It is very hard to tell how many people have been affected by this because many chose to renounce, as advised by the UK Home Office.  They renounce and reapply and the problem quietly goes away, but many others instead choose to take the route of using the UK immigration rules.  We have not really seen the cases where the person was affected but managed to resolve the issue by taking a different route.  It is the campaigning by Ms DeSouza that has brought many families and cases to the fore and given them a place where they can say this happened to them and how it has affected them.  As Mr. Holder said, it previously affected a very small group of people, namely, those who wished to bring non-EU spouses to Northern Ireland, but it has now completely opened up and may affect anyone born in Northern Ireland who considers himself or herself to be an Irish citizen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Les Allamby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#E00500"><p>I will address one aspect of each of the three questions.  To respond to Senator Marshall's question, the numbers are relatively small.  I cannot remember off the top of my head the exact number who have renounced citizenship in the past ten years, but the figure for the United Kingdom as a whole is relatively small.  We do not know how many of them are people who are renouncing Irish citizenship.  There are two significant issues.  First, no one should have to renounce citizenship in order to preserve, assert or defend his or her rights.  Second, this will become a bigger issue, particularly if the legal case taken by Ms DeSouza does not go the way I hope it will, that is, if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, this will eventually apply to people who desire reunification with family members who are EU citizens.  That is when the issue of preserving EU rights will become far more significant, but i is not clear what will happen.  The UK White Paper on immigration essentially applies current arrangements for people outside the European Union and largely replicates them for people within it.  In the context of future proofing, this is a very significant issue and the numbers could become considerably greater.  That is why the issue is important.</p> <p>  "The Blame Game" is a television programme in Northern Ireland.  We have had enough of the blame game locally.  If Senator Paul Daly was asking specifically about the two Governments and the Good Friday Agreement, there are three pieces of the agreement jigsaw that have not been fully implemented, namely, a Bill of Rights, an all-Ireland charter of rights and the civic forum.  I am a great believer in the value of a Bill of Rights which comes into its own in times of stress and difficulty.  When things are stable economically and politically, people are less likely to need to reach for a Bill of Rights.  It becomes important when things are not so stable.  The United Kingdom leaving the European Union, something nobody envisaged 21 years ago, is just the circumstance in which a Bill of Rights is important.  If the identity rights I discussed in my opening statement had been included in a Bill of Rights recognised by the UK Government, we might have avoided some of these issues.  The importance and value of a Bill of Rights in the long term remains.  The all-Ireland charter of rights was very much aspirational; they were not necessarily enforceable rights, but the concept of parties across the island of Ireland signing up to and committing themselves to the general concept of rights and equality remains important.</p> <p>  On the civic forum and whether we should have some initiatives around a citizens' assembly in Northern Ireland, there is a need to have an umbilical cord between citizens and politicians and political institutions.</p><p>That was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and we do not have that.  Those all-important aspects are writ large as a result of the decision to leave the EU following the referendum. </p><p> I thought I knew - I think I do know - the Good Friday Agreement pretty well, but I found myself rereading it to refresh my understanding of the agreement in light of these political developments.  In the discussion we have had in Brussels, Dublin and London, it shows the value and importance of the Good Friday Agreement but there is work to finish there.</p><p> On the common travel area, clearly there is a good working relationship between the two Governments, as is acknowledged by both sides.  It again comes back to future-proofing.  If those relationships change either economically or politically for whatever reason, at the end of the day a memorandum of understanding simply signifies the two Governments agreeing their understanding of a situation; nothing prevents that from changing at the behest of either of those two parties.  We need to see some clear legal underpinnings.</p><p> Leaving the EU is interesting.  The UK Government used to maintain that the common travel area predates both Ireland and the UK joining the European Union, which, of course, is right.  However, many of the issues within the common travel area ended up being underpinned by EU law, including the freedom of movement, for example.  As that is going, we need something to ensure the common travel area arrangements are copper-fastened irrespective of whatever happens politically in the next ten, 15, 20 years or beyond.  Therefore while I welcome the memorandum of understanding - without knowing its content - as a step forward, it should be a step forward on a journey that is about ensuring those rights are clear not just for my generation, but also for a future generation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#F00200"><p>Senator Marshall asked some great questions.  I sense that - we may also be able to interpret recent election results in this way - there is an appetite for really progressive change in Northern Ireland.  Although that is often presented in a certain way, increasingly across a range of areas the North is not that different from Dublin in terms of where people are at.  Recent elections may have confirmed some of that.  The sense is that the promises of the agreement across a range of areas, which the members have heard, have just not happened.  People's aspirations for something better in respect of a bill of rights that would include rights for everyone have not materialised.  A charter of rights for the island has not happened.  Mr. Allamby is the Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  That body has seen enormous budget cuts in recent years, which have made its task more difficult and needs to be addressed.  It is great to see the work of the joint committee.</p> <p>  We are in the current mess because people have been involved in an exercise of sustained avoidance.  The agreement contains principles such as parity of esteem, equal treatment and mutual respect.  For too many years people have crossed the road or turned away and not addressed dealing with those concepts by legislating for them and making them meaningful in order that people can use them in practice.  That must change.  In my view, the Good Friday Agreement's values and institutions will only gain renewed life if that changes.</p> <p>  Although we have heard about the numbers being small, there is a sense in which, with courageous individuals like Emma and Jake DeSouza going into the public sphere which is always a risky thing to do, other people have the courage to emerge.  They have to be commended on that.  We should think about how it feels if a Northern-born Irish citizen is told they are really British even though they might think they have a right in the Good Friday Agreement to be Irish.  The birthright provisions in the Good Friday Agreement concern everyone on this island.</p> <p>  Those who stand courageously on one aspect of that birthright provision do so on behalf of everyone potentially protected by it.  They do so on behalf of everyone who wants to identify and be accepted as Irish, everyone who wants to identify and be accepted as British and everyone who wants to identify and be accepted as both.  The birthright provision in totality matters and we need to see it implemented in practice.  There is a conversation happening on the island, which will build in momentum.  It is about how we will share this island in the future.  The birthright provision clearly continues into the future.  It is intended to continue into whatever constitutional arrangements emerge on the island.  That makes it even more important to give thought to implementing that more effectively in practice.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right that the Good Friday Agreement and some of the things we are discussing will challenge the British state and British Government.  However, they will also rightly challenge the Irish State and Irish Government.  The Irish Government and State will be challenged by ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full along with the common travel area and all those things, which is absolutely as it should be.</p> <p>  The clue as to why the human rights framework is so important for the future of this island is in the title - it covers the rights of everyone on this island.  Today's conversation is one part of that picture and that is why the human rights framework is so important.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly spoke about blame.  Let us park blame and talk about solutions.  One of the remarkable things about the presentations that particularly my colleagues have given this afternoon and the ongoing work in relation to this island and the North in particular is that we have plenty of solutions.  I am beginning to think we are the masters at coming up with solutions.  The difficulty we have and why I mentioned the implementation gap is because the difficulty rests in implementation.  We have many solutions and no doubt the Senator is inundated with paperwork on them.  We need to see them implemented.  This is a big moment as regards implementation in the North.  We need to grasp that.</p> <p>  The British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors of this agreement and they along with all the political parties need to show leadership in taking this forward, as civil society on this island has already.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The Good Friday Agreement could potentially come into its own in the years ahead.  The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is one part of that.  It is excellent that it is now meeting more regularly.  The institutions and values of the Good Friday Agreement could come into their own in the years ahead in terms of what we are facing.  That will only happen in the context of the Brexit conversation and the negotiations that are happening in relation to the North now, if we stop engaging in an exercise of avoidance.  We need to confront and face into the rights and equality crisis that has been outlined this afternoon.  We need to address the failure to implement some of the instruments we have discussed - the implementation gap.  These rights need to be written down.  People need to be able to do something about these rights in practice if we want to give life again to the Good Friday Agreement. </p></speech>

I am sorry I missed the first part of the meeting; that is the nature of life around Leinster House I am afraid.</p> <p>  We hear much about the common travel area.  It is my understanding that there is no legal basis for the common travel area.  The two Governments are signing a memorandum of understanding today.  What is the likelihood in a post-Brexit world of that memorandum being challenged in the courts?  For the first time since the common travel area came into being it will actually be put through judicial review, which may change the entire concept of what we understand as the common travel area.</p><p> Professor Harvey has mentioned the exercise in avoidance that has been ongoing.  Citizens in both parts of the island signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.  We all then clapped ourselves on the back; money was invested in civic groups in Northern Ireland to ensure cross-community co-operation and the provision of training courses and we then all rested on our laurels.  To some degree, the peace process became an industry in itself.  Somewhere along the line the political side of the peace process dropped the ball.  Vital legislation should have been enacted to address the issue of rights mentioned but nothing has been done.  Thus, the Good Friday Agreement, a tripartite agreement underpinned by the European Union and the United Nations, may come under the spotlight as we diverge in different directions, with citizens in Northern Ireland becoming the meat in the sandwich as we try to figure out where we are going.  </p><p> At this late stage, is there a role for the European Court of Justice to compel both states, while still members of the European project, to enact all outstanding legislation?  There is one particular issue that has been a bone of contention for me since the Brexit referendum.  I believe that while it was within the gift of the UK Government to call a referendum on the island of England, Scotland and Wales, it was not so simple in Northern Ireland because it was part of a tripartite agreement, one party to which was not consulted.  Its citizens will suffer the consequences of an action about which they were not consulted.  Ms De Souza's case is a case in point.  As this late stage is there a role for the European Court of Justice before we lose the United Kingdom to the European Union?</p><p> My final question is a throw-away question, but it is one with a serious aspect to it.  Is it time to sit down and review the Good Friday Agreement to see if there are parts of it that need to be renegotiated?</p></speech>

I am delighted they are here to discuss the issue of citizens' rights post Brexit, which, for me, is probably one of the most important.  Much of the Brexit debate thus far has focused on trade.  For that reason, this discussion is important.</p> <p>  Mr. Holder mentioned in his presentation that up to 2012 the UK Home Office generally respected the rights of people in Northern Ireland attached to Irish citizenship but that post 2012, to stop the exercise of particular EU rights, the policy changed in the treatment of all people born in Northern Ireland as British.  Perhaps Mr. Holder might elaborate on what be believes spurred that decision.  </p> <p>  On rights and entitlements, Irish citizens living in the North will remain EU citizens, but they will no longer be able to elect representatives to the European Parliament or the European Council.  To me, that is a democratic deficit.  It touches on the wider issue of the State not affording voting rights to its citizen residents outside the jurisdiction.  We are extremely restrictive on the issue in comparison to other European countries.  Will the delegates comment on how we can ensure Irish citizens living in the North will not be disenfranchised entirely?</p></speech>

Senator Craughwell raised one of the questions I had intended to raise.  There is need for a legal mechanism to force the two Governments to play their roles as co-guarantors.  The Good Friday Agreement is a legally binding international agreement.  What does "legally binding" mean?  One imagines implementation of a Bill of Rights would be legally binding.  Perhaps the delegates might speak to that point.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the British Government was still talking about repealing the Human Rrights Act 1998 and replacing it with a British Bill of Rights.  What would it look like?  What input, if any, would others on the island have in that regard?  I take it that the Irish Government would not have any input.  How would it impact on the implementation of a Bill of Rights?  </p> <p>  It was also stated attention would have to turn to the pressing matter of resources and capacity building.  We are all encouraged by the civic nationalism and civic unionism and all of the conversations that are ongoing.  I agree that they need to be properly resourced to allow them to evolve in a way that will enables those conversations to take place.  </p> <p>  I would welcome responses to my questions about the legal mechanisms and resources needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#G00500"><p>To respond to Senator Craughwell's question about the common travel area, the widespread view is that it needs to be properly legally underpinned.  There has been a call for an international treaty to underpin it.  We await the details of the memorandum of understanding, but there is a real sense, linked with the issue of formalisation, that the common travel area needs to be underpinned properly in law.</p> <p>  If the United Kingdom ever does get around to leaving the European Union, one of conversations will be on the political declaration.  I realise, given the current shambolic mess that is British politics, some of this is not that straightforward.  If there is a conversation on the political declaration, it might include the issues about which we are talking.  In my paper I propose an amendment to the birthright provisions.  There may be other proposals that would copperfasten some of the rights issues in the context of a conversation on the future relationship.  </p> <p>  On the Good Friday Agreement question, the Committee on the Administration of Justice has used language reflecting a renaissance of the peace process.  There is a sense that we need to renew the agreement.  There was talk this afternoon of reading it afresh.  There is a lot within it that needs to be renewed and implemented.  Perhaps that is where the focus needs to be placed, rather than on opening it up for conversation.  On the European Court of Justice, in the context of debates on rights and equality and the social protections provided for, EU law does things in the United Kingdom that no other area of law does, particularly when it comes to enforcement and enforceability.  We need to bear in mind that its loss will be keenly felt post Brexit.  </p> <p>  To respond to Senator Black's question about voting rights which is linked with the conversation on paragraph 52, there is a sense there are things the Irish Government could do in the area of voting rights for Irish citizens in the North.</p><p>The message coming from the EU seems to be that this is a matter for the Irish Government.  It crystalises a real test for the Government to match some of the language around abandonment and not leaving people behind with doing it in practice.  The issue of going forward with voting rights is a challenge for the Government, for example.  We will see it later in the year on the matter of presidential voting rights.  To be clear, Ireland is an outlier in voting rights for those who reside outside the State.  It would be very much in tune with European and international developments for Ireland to take a much more generous approach on voting rights in this and other areas.  There needs to be follow through on this.  </p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the Good Friday Agreement.  It is an issue where lessons have been learned in the context of the Brexit discussion.  We have all been involved in conversations where we have discussed the agreement as an internationally legally binding document.  Some 21 years after the agreement we can see how it is not being implemented in practice, and we have raised that point, but there is nothing one can do about it.  One interesting thing around the Brexit conversation has been the emphasis in the withdrawal agreement and its protocol to issues of enforceablility and what will people be able to do on this in the future.  The agreement remains there, it is an internationally binding obligation and that is why I have put such an emphasis on domestic implementation.  It is important that the British and Irish Governments and the State ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is fully and effectively implemented in domestic law and that needs to be pursued urgently.  Lessons have clearly been learned in terms of the Brexit conversation.  We are now talking about the withdrawal agreement and the implementation of that but this is just the start of the discussion and the future relationship discussion is to come.  We must ensure that some of the rights that we have discussed today are enforceable in coming years and that we do not spend the next 20 or 30 years discussing words which exist on a page which no individual on this island can do anything about.  That must radically change in the next 20 years.  </p><p> I refer to the Human Rights Act.  When the current government in London gets the small matter of Brexit out of the way, the next thing on its list is the Human Rights Act which it plans to repeal and replace with something called the British bill of rights.  This is deeply and profoundly concerning.  Brexit represents part of a larger agenda, which is an attack on concept of the practice of human rights.  That needs to be faced, confronted and addressed.  The Human Rights Act has been fundamentally important to upholding people's rights in the North.  It needs to be defended and the Irish Government must confront the British Government on that.</p><p> On capacity and resources, many of us have been involved in discussions and negotiations, such as those relating to programmes for Government, where people use the language of co-design.  Everyone loves to talk about participation and everyone is involved in a conclusive conversation and civic society also being engaged in that.  Civic society on this island has played a heroic role but that can take money and resources.  When we consider issues of co-design and participation and when we are trying to ensure that civic society engages, there must be the capacity to engage and the resources to underpin that.  If we are moving into a phase where we are discussing a more all-island civic engagement and conversations, we need to pay attention to capacity-building resources.  Many individuals who are working heroically in civil society and in NGOs do so on temporary contracts in highly insecure employment conditions and they go the extra mile to make the argument on some of these issues.  If we are going to have conversations about participation, we must also have a conversation about money, funding and resources.</p></speech>

Too often, government documents, whether in the North or South, loosely use the language of co-design and co-production of major aspects of public policy with very little thinking at all as to how civic society will engage effectively in that process and in participation.  If the Government is talking about co-design and participation, it must think about how it will resource that and make it happen in a very practical and meaningful way.</p></speech>

Jurisdictional issues pertain to citizens in the North, which we have seen in Ms De Souza's case in terms of the legislative requirements and obligations that must be fulfilled.  Have today's contributors reached a view as to what the Irish Government should ask for?  We understand the jurisdictional contexts that exist on the island.  My latest engagement with the Government on this, through a Seanad Commencement matter, was that it was awaiting the result of the review announced by Theresa May in Belfast in February.  Through parliamentary questions and documents released to the media under freedom of information, it has subsequently transpired that to all intents there is no review.  It has no timeline or terms of reference, there is no indication as to who will carry out the review or what their remit is.  If we park the jurisdictional issue and focus on the Good Friday Agreement and on the root of all of this, namely that of our being Irish citizens, there is a political context which compels the Irish Government to do something.  I do not know if there is scope for the Government to act unilaterally on behalf of the State or as a member of the EU to further enable rights and entitlements to Irish citizens who happen to be resident just up the road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.632" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Les Allamby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#H00500"><p>I will try to answer the questions in the order they were asked.  Senator Craughwell asked if the common travel area could become entangled in the courts.  That is always possible.  I am not a great fan of trying to fight the legal status of something in the first place.  There are principles of administrative law where one could say that if both Governments changed their minds on something, say cross-border healthcare co-operation, there would be a legitimate expectation or administrative law arguments.  However, if either the Irish or UK Government unilaterally enacted something to get out of arrangements in the common travel area, there would be political fallout.  Would the courts give the common travel area and a memorandum of understanding greater weight than if parliament, either the D&aacute;il or Westminster, passed some legislation to make it clear it was getting out of some or all those arrangements?  I am doubtful one would find a court that would take the memorandum of understanding above legislation.  That is why it is important to have a very secure legal underpinning and a very clear understanding of where things are.</p> <p>  There was a question of whether the European Court of Justice could play a role. It is playing an interesting role.  I would nuance this by saying that the ECJ cannot act unilaterally, it cannot decide to make decisions, cases must be referred to it under the process.  One example would be the Irish courts on the European arrest warrant and whether it can be applied to the UK and Poland, given different developments there.  Those decisions from the ECJ were interesting because they said that while both were full member states that there is no reason to question the bona fides of a European arrest warrant.  However, one might look very closely at the arrangements that the UK will have when it leaves the EU.</p><p>They left the door open to say that while the UK is in the EU, it is expected to abide by all of those rules and, therefore, the European arrest warrant should carry on as now.  After that it will depend on what those arrangements are.  They have given a hint but they are very restricted in terms of what they can do because it is about questions that are asked.  I am with Professor Harvey on reopening the Good Friday Agreement.  I would like to see the completion of the existing agreement.  When terms like "review" are used, it often is interpreted as unpicking what has been achieved by the agreement.  I would like to see it completed.  </p><p> In response to Senator Black, there is a democratic deficit in the issue of voting rights.  Professor Harvey is again quite right that this is not an EU-led issue.  It is a matter for the Irish Government as to whether its citizens abroad or elsewhere on this island are entitled to vote in elections.  It is not dictated by the European Union.  Spain is a good example; its nationals abroad can vote.  It is in the hands of the Government.  </p><p> In response to Senator Conway-Walsh's question about the Human Rights Act and whether the Irish Government will have any influence, I think it will.  My understanding of where things are at the moment with the Human Rights Act is that the UK Government has said it will do nothing until it has completed leaving the EU.  My fear, to be candid, is that the matter will then become a political football rather than being a question of the merits of the Human Rights Act.  It may be based on politics rather than good policy or legislative or rights-based reasons for reforming the Act.  Where I think the Irish Government has a role is that in the Good Friday Agreement it was quite clear that maintaining convention rights was core.  The bill of rights was to be a convention rights-plus approach.  The Irish Government was tasked with incorporating the convention rights into its own law, which it did.  At the time the Good Friday Agreement was enacted the Human Rights Act was not in place but the UK Government had committed to bringing it in.  Any attempt to dilute the Human Rights Act seems to me to be germane to the Good Friday Agreement.  The Irish Government, therefore, has a perfectly legitimate reason to get involved in those discussions.  The Government made some representations in the earlier stages when there were far greater concerns about getting out of the Council of Europe and so on, which seem now to have receded.  The future of the Human Rights Act is a perfectly legitimate issue for the Government as the co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> On the standing of the international treaty, it was considered to an extent in Supreme Court decisions in respect of after we leave and Brexit challenges.  At the moment, as I understand the state of law, it is difficult to see how one can judicially apply the Good Friday Agreement effectively.  That may change with Ms de Souza's case.  I welcome the fact that we will look at it again in those circumstances.  We must never underestimate how important an international treaty is.  My experience on the international stage at the moment, when one engages with the UK Government, is that its people are very cognisant of their place on the global stage.  They see the UK still as a global player and they see themselves as a power for good in human rights and equality terms.  They do not like having a light shone on their own back yard if they turn out to have their own problems and difficulties.  In terms of recognising international treaties and applying them properly, we must never underestimate the importance of being able to persuade the UK Government that if it wants to stay on the international stage as an exemplar of human rights and equality, that always begins at home.  There are cards to play that are very important to the UK Government and this should not be underestimated.  </p><p> As to what this committee could do, I am timorous about responding as it is a matter for the committee.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised a couple of issues.  If this committee was saying something positive about a need for a bill of rights in the current circumstances, it would be welcome.  In the short term, the suggestion in our paper about copper-fastening citizenship rights in domestic UK law, or at least a recognition of the UK Government's position when it responded to a bill of rights would be important.  There is an umbilical cord whereby we can say this starts with the Good Friday Agreement and the response that was made to the advice given to the Commission.  Finding a way of dealing with that through a bill of rights or in some other way would be a very welcome recognition.  The review is still important, whatever the UK Government is doing.  It is disappointing and shows clearly that the underlying issues, including Ms de Souza's case, need addressing.  Whatever the UK Government comes up with, committees elsewhere among the co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement will look closely at those arrangements and what changes, if any, are made.  To measure them against the Good Friday Agreement would be very useful indeed.  I would not underestimate some of the valuable things the committee can do within its purview, although the Senators will know better than me, given that we are looking at this through the lens of leaving the EU, which is significant for both parts of Ireland and in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-08a.634" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Daniel Holder" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2019050800002#J00200"><p>I shall start with the issue of what changed in 2012.  That was quite a significant time.  Although, unlike Ireland, the UK never amended its citizenship laws to bring them in line with the Good Friday Agreement, until 2012, as a matter of policy, the British Home Office usually recognised people's right to be solely Irish in the context of the Northern Ireland birthright.  We can see that, for example, in the aborted attempts by the UK to introduce identity cards.  They conceded that there would have to be a different card and that they could not have a card in the North that said the holder was British if he or she was an Irish citizen.  They conceded that there would be a separate card.  We also saw it in the sense that people in the same situation as Ms de Souza who sought EU rights to family reunification generally had those rights respected.  People put in those applications and were granted them as Irish citizens.</p> <p>  In 2012, when Theresa May was Home Secretary, a suite of policies was brought in called the "hostile environment".  Those policies were subsequently legislated for but 2012 is when it started.  There was a series of - in our view and in human rights terms - very draconian immigration policies that aimed just to reduce numbers.  The Home Office latched on to a decision of the ECJ called McCarthy, which restricted people's opportunity to exercise EU rights when they were dual citizens.  The facts of this case were completely irrelevant to the context of people who have birthrights under the Good Friday Agreement because that is not what it dealt with, yet the decision was used as a pretext to prevent Irish citizens in the North from exercising EU rights to family reunification.</p> <p>  The lines they have taken to defend that policy are extremely worrying and have much broader implications for some of the other issues and questions that were asked.  In cases like those of Ms de Souza and others, the Home Office has basically said two things.  It has sought to reinterpret the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in a way that completely stretches credibility.  There is a broader worry if it does the same with other provisions in the agreement.  It is arguing that it is perfectly compatible to automatically confer British citizenship on everyone born in Northern Ireland and that there is nothing in the Good Friday Agreement to stop that, apart from the bit that states the participants "recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both".  It is worrying that things can be reinterpreted in that way.</p> <p>  The second thing the Home Office has done, which is even more worrying, is basically to say it is not bound by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is an international treaty and that does not oblige Her Majesty's Government directly to change its legislation.  I do not think this is correct but that is the line it has taken.  That is worrying in the sense of looking at other provisions in the Good Friday Agreement such as the duty to incorporate the ECHR into Northern Ireland law.  That is a core provision safeguarded under the agreement.  It is what we have currently, through the Human Rights Act, yet the Home Office is now saying it does not consider itself bound by the Good Friday Agreement.  That is a much broader worry.  It has exposed one of the weaknesses of the agreement, namely that there is no dispute resolution mechanism.</p><p>No international court was given jurisdiction to remedy faults.  When one hears of things such as the Home Office's position in cases such as that of DeSouza, one realises that it is no wonder that the EU is insisting on a legally binding backstop.  There has to be some supernational mechanism to enforce commitments as the UK has a long and consistent track record, throughout the peace settlement, of signing bilateral agreements and treaties which are legally binding under international law and then not abiding by their provisions.  There is a much broader set of problems involved which are highlighted by cases such as that of DeSouza.  </p><p> With regard to the common travel area, there is one thing which needs to be called out.  Ever since the Brexit vote there has been a lot of talk about reciprocal rights in the common travel area.  I have done a lot of Internet searching but I struggle to find any reference to the concept of reciprocal rights in the common travel area that predates the Brexit referendum.  It appears to be a bit of a myth.  It conflates two things that are actually different.  The common travel area is essentially a free movement zone.  It gives people the ability to move between the two islands and between North and South without passport controls.  That is reflected in UK law under the UK Immigration Act 1971, which states that local journeys within the common travel area shall not be subject to immigration control.  There are to be no passport controls on such journeys.  That is how it is reflected in UK law.  It is a problem that at times we see checks conducted by UK authorities both on the Irish Sea and on the land Border.  These checks are carried out with no legal basis.  Quite often these authorities will single out people they believe do not look Irish or British on the basis of racial profiling and seek documents.  They will then say that these checks are voluntary.  There are also problems with the legislation in this jurisdiction, which are not restricted to British and Irish citizens.  Garda&iacute; are allowed to ask for immigration documents, but only from non-EU nationals.  How are they to tell the difference?  There is a problem there in respect of significant racial profiling.  </p><p> The common travel area is really a free movement zone and should not be conflated with the reciprocal recognition of citizenship rights between British and Irish citizens, which gives people equivalence of rights.  That has a much more complicated history.  It does not have anything to do with the common travel area as such because it continued to exist between the years of 1939 and 1952 when the common travel area was suspended in its entirety.  British and Irish citizens enjoy the reciprocation of rights across the two jurisdictions but this predates most of the modern and some of the more draconian immigration controls, controls which interfere in every aspect of life.  That was not the case in those years.  During the years from 1922 to 1948, British law regarded citizens of the Irish Free State as British subjects which resulted in an equivalence of rights.  After Ireland formally legislated to become a republic, Irish citizens had a rather curious status under British law whereby they were not British but not foreign.  I do not make this up; that is what it said.  That was not completely unique because that was also the status given to Commonwealth citizens, who did not face particular restrictions.  That status continued after 1962 when restrictions were placed on Commonwealth citizens but most of this was dispensed with under the contemporary UK immigration regime which came into force in 1973.  That was also a key date because what replaced the ongoing arrangements was both states joining what would become the EU.  This granted British and Irish citizens, and citizens of other EU citizens, reciprocal rights.  We have therefore had reciprocal rights for the best part of 50 years, not based on the mythical reciprocal rights of the common travel area, but on joint EU membership.  </p><p> The two Governments are now putting together something really new, the reciprocal rights of the common travel area.  The problem is that they have largely been conducting this exercise on what the scope of these rights should be and to whom and what they should apply behind closed doors.  There is no consultation document setting out what the scope of these rights should be.  We have battered down doors with both Governments and have managed to get meetings and to have discussions, but that is no substitute for public or parliamentary consultation on what this should look like and what form it should take.  We only have a treaty on things such as social security and pensions.  There may well be big gaps in that; I cannot see housing and a number of other things mentioned.  The only thing that seems to be supplementing that is this memorandum of understanding, which will not be legally binding.  It may have some legal routes into it on the ground of reasonable expectation and such things but where I can see this clashing is where there are significant gaps.  We have anti-discrimination law and if one side of the community, Irish citizens, is not afforded rights equal to those of the other side of the community, that will collide with immigration law.</p><p> It must be remembered that the common travel area, CTA, is never going to replace rights outside the borders of the CTA.  That is one of the reasons it is far more limited than the rights that would be available if paragraph 52 of the joint report, regarding continued access and exercise of EU rights, were implemented on the basis that we are in the extraordinary circumstance whereby Northern Ireland will be a jurisdiction outside the EU in which every single person born, now and after Brexit, will either be or be entitled to be an EU citizen.  To allow EU citizens to be stripped of all rights is not a good place to be.  </p><p> With regard to our asks, a number of things could be put to the Irish Government.  The first one is fairly straightforward.  The Irish Government needs to hold its line about the implementation of the citizenship provisions under the Good Friday Agreement.  There have been mixed messages in some correspondence.  We do not want to see an artificial separation of issues of citizenship and identity.  That cannot be done.  The Government should hold the line that the UK should amend the British Nationality Act 1981 to bring it into line with the Good Friday Agreement.  We would like to see the Irish Government moving to implement those aspects of EU rights that are within its gift, one of which is voting.  There is no more politically sensitive issue in the North than voting.  The Government should ensure that is taken forward.  The common travel area should be underpinned by an enforceable treaty.  We really need to open up the discussion as to its scope rather than it being held behind closed doors.  It also needs to be underpinned by the bill of rights because that is the only way in which it will be properly legally enforceable in domestic law.  </p><p> The final ask is big but fairly straightforward.  Clearly there are going to be further negotiations.  The withdrawal agreement is not going to be reopened but it is possible that an addendum could be added to it.  It is also possible that changes could be made to the political declaration on future arrangements.  In his amendment Professor Harvey sets out something we would really like to see, which is the reinsertion of the existing commitments to implement paragraph 52 of the joint report.  With regard to the correlation between that and the other provisions of the Good Friday Agreement referenced in the withdrawal agreement, it is important to ensure there is a mechanism for levering up in order for everyone within Northern Ireland to retain that type of provision.</p></speech>

We have talked about the wider human rights framework in which this all needs to be placed.  I acknowledge and commend the work that has been done in securely locating some of these arguments in the position of the EU 27.  That has been fundamentally important and it is also important that remains the case and that the arguments about this island remain at the heart of the conversation about the future relationship.  The Irish Government has an important role in that, which is why we have heard reference to the political declaration.</p> <p>  I will speak to the issue of Irish citizenship with regard to Irish citizens in the North.  It is something to which the Irish State, people in the South of Ireland, and the Irish Government really need to pay attention.  I have a sense that something is happening with regard to Irish citizens of which people need to be aware.  With regard to the Good Friday Agreement, we have heard about parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality of treatment.  There is a sense that is being disrespected on a sustained basis.  I am conscious that other people may have other views about that but I want to put it out there that Irish citizens in the North sense that tangibly.  We have seen the confidence and supply arrangement between the current government in London and the Democratic Unionist Party.</p><p>Not a day goes by without reference to the precious union.  Speaking as an academic, I have been to many conferences in the UK where people agonised for days over the fate of the UK's constitution.  I have spoken at those conferences and engaged in that conversation, but, speaking somewhat personally here today, when one raises a question about the constitutional future of this island, it seems to invite a rather different response.  We need to recognise that we have to conduct a conversation about the constitutional future of this island in a mature way, and with a measure of civility.  That is about constitutionalism on this island.  I have been at many events as an academic where we have talked about constitutionalism on the other island in the UK and we need to have one about this island as well.</p><p> I am speaking here today as an Irish citizen who is not about to wave my passport in front of the committee, and what I pick up is a sense that, to be candid, the passport I have does not seem to hold any sort of inferior status because I was born in Derry and now live and work in Belfast.  There is a sense in which that really matters for Irish citizens, however, I pick up an odd mood in the Irish State and Government about recognising the fact that there is a broader context in the North.  There is a broader human rights framework, but there are also Irish citizens in the North who are not in a very good place and who feel fundamentally disrespected in terms of some of the things we have been talking about this afternoon.  The Irish Government seems to be remarkably anxious about upholding the rights of some of its own citizens who live in the North of this island.  If there is one thing the Irish Government should do, it is to lose that anxiety and caution about defending, acknowledging, and recognising the rights of Irish citizens in the North of this island in the context of the broader human rights and equality framework we talked about this afternoon.</p><p> My final point in relation to that is very clear.  I accept, acknowledge and commend the work the Irish Government has done thus far in these negotiations, but if there are things it can do in relation to, for example, voting rights and the democratic deficit that we have just heard about, then why not go ahead and do it, and make some of these verbalised commitments meaningful in practice so that democratic deficit is addressed, and those voting rights are respected.  I have talked about the broader human rights framework, and speaking personally as an Irish citizen and a European citizen, I think that Irish citizens in the North have had enough.  They want to see an Irish Government that confidently speaks up for the rights of everyone in the North, that recognises that the Irish citizens who live in the North do not have a second-class version of Irish citizenship, and to see that reflected in Irish Government, law, policy, and practice.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>
