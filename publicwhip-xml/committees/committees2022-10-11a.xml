The purpose of today's meeting is to continue the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the veterinary medicinal products, medicated feed and fertilisers regulation Bill 2022.  The committee will hear from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon, and officials from his Department.</p> <p>  All of those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, and they may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in the context of participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts.  Members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Heydon, and the following officials from his Department: Dr. June Fanning, deputy chief veterinary officer; Dr. Paul Corkery, senior superintending veterinary inspector; Mr. Ted Massey, senior inspector; Ms Louise Byrne, deputy chief inspector; Mr. Conor O'Mahony, principal officer; Dr. Sheila Nolan, principal officer; and Mr. Peter Collins, assistant principal officer.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.  We might take the meeting in two halves, dealing with medicinal products first and fertiliser second, if that is acceptable to him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#A00300"><p>Very good.  I am in the hands of the Chair.</p><p>I thank the committee for the invitation and opportunity to speak this evening as it engages in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, cannot be here present for understandable reasons but, on his behalf, I thank the members for facilitating an early discussion on this topic because it is a key priority of the Department and because there are measures in it that he is seeking to have in place for the start of next year.<b></b></p><p>I am joined by my officials, whose names have been listed by the Chair.  They will be here for the course of the meeting.  The officials dealing with fertiliser will join us later if we reach that element.</p><p>The Bill proposes to introduce legislation that deals with two distinct aspects of agricultural life.  First, it is to provide for powers to make regulations on areas that recent EU regulations on veterinary medicines left to be determined by national law, such as the retailing of veterinary medicines, for the introduction of a national veterinary prescription system, NVPS; repeal the Animal Remedies Act 1993; and modernise the legislation that governs the general veterinary medicine area.  Second, the Bill will amend the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act 1955 by inserting new registration requirements and related provisions to enable the collection and processing of information on the manufacture, importation, sale, supply and use of fertiliser in the State. </p><p>With specific regard to the area of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed, I wish to make some key points.  The Bill is important for farmers and the wider agriculture industry.  I stress that the priority of the Department from the outset has been to strike a balance between the continued availability of these products at a reasonable price for farmers, meeting regulatory requirements and protecting the rural economy.  </p><p>A growing understanding of the risks of antimicrobial resistance, AMR, is among the key drivers for recent changes in EU legislation in this area.  As members will be well aware, AMR poses significant challenges to society and the Irish farming sector.  Responsible use of antimicrobial products in food-producing animals is a key element in helping to combat resistance.  This Bill, together with SI 36 of 2022 &ndash; the European Union (Veterinary Medicinal Products and Medicated Feed) Regulations 2022, which gives effect to EU Regulations 2019/4 and 2019/6 &ndash; is a key step in dealing with the challenge of AMR.</p><p>The committee previously reviewed the EU regulations in detail and issued a comprehensive report in 2021.  In drafting this Bill, which deals with matters that were left to national discretion, the recommendations of the committee were taken into account.  </p><p> In addition to the implementation of certain matters of national competence as permitted by EU Regulation 2019/4 on medicated feed and Regulation 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products, one of the main elements in the Bill is the provision of a statutory basis for the introduction of a national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, which will facilitate the electronic generation and dispensing of prescriptions of veterinary medicines for food-producing animals.  This will provide greater assurance as to the traceability and use of veterinary medicinal products and in so doing, protect animal and human health and support consumer confidence.  The introduction of this electronic system will also provide greater choice for farmers when getting prescriptions dispensed.  This has been a central consideration of my Department in drafting this legislation.  The Bill will make it mandatory for all veterinary prescriptions to be generated electronically using the NVPS.  The system, in this current phase of development, will facilitate the recording of veterinary prescriptions by a registered veterinarians across eight food-producing animal species.  It also caters for the dispensing of any such prescription, where appropriate, from a registered dispensing outlet such as a licensed merchant, co-operative or pharmacist outlet.  </p><p> The NVPS is a free to use, standalone system to both prescribers or dispensers.  However, my Department has worked alongside existing prescribing and dispensing software providers to allow them to integrate seamlessly with the NVPS.  My Department has been engaging with stakeholders in relation to the NVPS since November 2020, both bilaterally and in multi-stakeholder forums.  The significant communications campaign has recently escalated, most notably at the 2022 ploughing championships.  The team is planning further engagements in the coming weeks and months with both veterinary practitioners and dispensers around the country regarding training and use of the NVPS.  It is planned that NVPS will be extended to companion animals in time.  </p><p> Turning to the second part of the Bill-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#B00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the meeting.  As he quite rightly said in his opening statement, this is the second time the committee has addressed this issue.  We have already met all of the stakeholders on a couple of occasions and compiled a report.  We are now compiling a second report as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p> <p>  Everyone who has appeared before this committee and all members of the committee itself understand the importance of handling antimicrobial and anti-parasitic resistance.  That is not an issue.  The stakeholders who will be most affected by the major change in the regulations which will make anti-parasitic medicines prescription-only, told us when they appeared before us how this will affect their businesses.  I refer in particular to the businesses of licensed merchants, members of the Irish Co-Operative Organisations Society, ICOS, and the pharmacies in rural Ireland.  As recently as last week they were before us and it was not Mystic Meg stuff.  They were able to give us numbers and percentages for the drop-off in sales when antimicrobial medicines became prescription-only.  They stated that intramammary sales alone are down 90%.  They have come a long way in meeting the Department since their first visit here.  The major issue is with the claim that the regulation will be implemented but the implementation will avoid anti-competitiveness and will enhance and increase the availability of product.  That will not happen when it becomes a veterinary, prescription-only product and that has been proven in the context of the changes to the antimicrobial and intramammary products.  </p> <p>  The solution that was put to us, loud and clear, is the inclusion of the "responsible person" when it comes to the prescribing of anti-parastic products.  The responsible person has been recognised by the Department.  The Department initiated the responsible person programme and stated what training and qualifications were required back in 2012.  From what we have been picking up at this committee, the issue is one of differing legal opinion.  I believe the Department has legal opinion from the stakeholders and from the Attorney General.  In the context of an all-Ireland animal health plan, the suitably qualified person can prescribe anti-parasitics in the North of Ireland.  Northern Ireland is outside the EU now but it had accepted a derogation that the suitably qualified person could prescribe anti-parasitics.  What we are hearing is that the Department cannot accept the role of the responsible person because responsible persons were not prescribing at the time the regulation was introduced.  Yet, the Department recognised them and they were de facto prescribing anti-parasitics from 2012.  This cannot be determined on the basis of different legal opinion at the cost of rural jobs and rural businesses.  We need to step up to the mark and find a solution.  I hope a solution can be found and let it be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  If we do not get this right, the ramifications for jobs and businesses, as well as for animal health and welfare and the quality of our animal-based food products, will be enormous.  We will have two different systems on the island and irrespective of what arguments we make against going to the North, people will do so.  Anti-parasitic products will come into the North.  If farmers do not dose their cattle it will cost them money but if they have to go to the grief of getting prescriptions and so on, then they will get their hands on a bottle.  That will not be recorded in the context of traceability or Bord Bia systems but will be administered in the interests of the animals.  </p> <p>  It is vitally important that we get this right but there is nothing in the Minister of State's statement to indicate that we are going to overcome that hurdle.  We cannot stand over the loss of jobs that was predicted here last week.  We did not hear estimates or Mystic Meg stuff.  Stakeholders had proof.  They told us that their antimicrobial sales dropped by 90% and if they see a similar hit or drop in their anti-parasitic products, they will go out of business.  These businesses are the lifeblood of a lot of our rural communities.  They have the knowledge on the ground.  They understand the type of land being farmed and the type of animals being kept.  They know as much about farming practices as vets do and in some cases, they know more.  If the veterinarian whose care the animal is under can prescribe off site, it is in essence still the farmer who is going to be self-diagnosing.  The farmer will be explaining the symptoms to the vet and then the vet will write a prescription.  In that regard, it does not make sense.  </p> <p>  I am disappointed that the Minister of State's statement did not address these problems but maybe he can address them now.  In my view the only solution, having dealt with this issue for almost two years at this committee, is recognition of the responsible person.  To be quite honest, as it stands at the moment I cannot see this Bill passing and I am saying that as a member of the Government.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Daly for raising a number of important points.  Initially he talked about antimicrobial resistance and intramammary tubes, which farmers are well aware of, having used them on a very regular basis.  I take on board the concerns he has raised and am aware of the points that have been made at this committee previously.  Like many colleagues, I too have met merchants and businesses that have significant concerns in this area.  As I said in my opening statement, this is about us getting the balance right.  We definitely do not want to see a negative economic impact but we also do not want to see a negative impact on farmers who have a role to play in the context of prevention.</p> <p>  In terms of antimicrobial resistance as opposed to anti-parasitics, there is a clear difference in prescriptions.  An intramammary is an antibiotic, as the Senator is aware and the prescription length for that is five days whereas an anti-parasitic prescription has a life span of 12 months.  In many respects, anti-parasitic applications would be planned out by a farmer in the year as a preventive measure rather than as a way of dealing with symptoms.</p><p>The Senator referred to symptoms, which are an element of it.  An animal might display symptoms indicating it needs a wormer or whatever, but we know that, where cattle go into a shed, dosing for liver fluke can be preventative four or six weeks later.  There is a clear differentiation and they are not the same, but I take on board the Senator's points and concerns.</p><p> The Senator spoke about legal opinions that had been submitted.  The latest legal opinion we have received is under consideration.  We are trying to get the balance of the details right.  How that works out will be in the final legislation.  I accept the Senator's right to reserve his support until after he has seen the final legislation, but there are time pressures to get it in place for farmers.  We have also made commitments in that space.  We must get the balance right so that this legislation is robust and does what it needs to do.  It is in farmers' economic interests that we get this right.  Resistance to antiparasitics and so on is not a good thing.  In certain parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, such is the level of resistance to antiparasitics that ruminants cannot graze.  This is a challenge.  The drenches farmers are familiar with fall into four groups &ndash; white drench, clear drench, pink drench and yellow drench &ndash; and there are many products, but if a farmer's animal develops a resistance to one of the four, then it is resistant to all of the products within that group.  If human health was so dependent on so few medicinal products, we would be concerned for ourselves.  The Senator acknowledged this issue.</p><p> We are trying to get the balance right.  Regarding the specific point that the Senator raised, we have legal opinion which we are considering.</p></speech>

He relayed to the Minister concerns that many of the current proposals were unworkable.  Has the Minister's statement that he wants solutions to this issue that will not be detrimental to the various parties involved been acknowledged within the Department?  Is there a concern in the Department stemming from the submissions we have seen and the statements by bodies that have appeared before us in recent weeks?  Unfortunately, we are hearing that the number of veterinary practices being sold could be in the double digits.  In fairness to the Chairman, he is trying to put an end to that with his Bill.  What we are hearing is that, if practices can get a hold of everything where veterinary medicines are concerned, it will be worth a great deal of money when selling the practices.</p> <p>  The Department is well aware that practices are being taken over in parts of the country.  At one stage, someone in Donegal had to travel 50 or 60 miles to get a vet because practices had been taken over.  Is the Department not concerned that farmers will be at a disadvantage and that a monopoly will take over?  No Department should cod itself.</p> <p>  There is embarrassment in this for farmers.  That is the main problem.  A vet does a herd test and comes out if there is a problem with a ewe yeaning or a cow calving.  How will a farmer look that vet in the eye, ask for a prescription and then say he or she is going down the road from the vet's because it might be &euro;5 cheaper at a pharmacy or a co-op?  It is not doable.  We need to get this fact into our heads.  We are going to create a monopoly.  I am afraid the veterinary side of the Department is taking the side of the vets.  As politicians, though, it is the farmer we should be considering.</p></speech>

From the perspective of animal health, food health and our reputation, ensuring antiparasitics are still of use to us down the line is critical to our farmers.  If we get this wrong, we will do them a great disservice.  That is our focus.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's point on the availability of vets, a prescription for an antiparasitic lasts 12 months.  At home, we plan this out.  I could tell the Deputy the times of the year when we generally apply antiparasitics.  There will be times when we react to an animal's symptoms, but it is usually planned.</p></speech>

I told him at the beginning we had not made a decision.  We have a new legal opinion, which is being considered.  I am just replying to the Deputy's specific point.  He painted a picture of a farmer going to a vet looking for a prescription for use on the same day.  I am making the point that a prescription will last 12 months and that, in certain instances, farmers will look for it in advance of when it is needed.</p> <p>  Regarding the number of vets, surveys have been done and the number of vets in the country is increasing.  There are more now than there were in 2019, when there were 2,948.  That number has increased to 3,302.  Various vets have different roles, but the most recent survey showed that 95% of farmers had a vet within 20 km of them.  That information has been reconstituted and the Department is working with the Veterinary Council to undertake a repeat of the study to get more up-to-date figures.  The figures I cited are quite recent, though.  This is not to say any decision has been made.  I am just addressing the specific points the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

There was no proof it was more dangerous.</p><p>Has the Department looked at working with the responsible persons, such as through a course or whatever?  We are all in favour of ensuring we keep on top of all this - everyone is responsible in that way - but there is no evidence in the UK study to show that a responsible person is any better or worse than a vet at prescribing medicines.  Has that been taken on board?</p></speech>

This is about what fits within a legal framework in the context of any legal challenges that might be made down the line.  I might hand over to Mr. O'Mahony for the other specific questions.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State stressed, we recently received a legal opinion from ICOS and the ILMA, which we will have to consider fully, and it may have consequences.  Notwithstanding the study showing there may be no greater or less danger in an SQP prescribing, we are left in the reality of our legal position and of implementing the requirement that antiparasitics be up-regulated to POMs.  That is our position at the moment.</p></speech>

Given the losses already among co-operatives and pharmacists, there is a huge knock-on effect here.  Do our guests realise that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#D00500"><p>As the Minister of State outlined in regard to the reported drop-off in intermammary sales, there are slightly different practices and behaviours with regard to antimicrobials, which are more of a just-in-time method of purchasing by farmers on foot of a prescription with a short validity period, versus being able to pre-plan the dosing regime much further in advance than would be the case for antimicrobials.</p> <p>  One of the key elements of the NVPS, its design and how we are going to implement it relates to ensuring that farmers have as much choice as possible.  A farmer can, for example, be associated with more than one veterinary practice and he has availability and flexibility in regard to getting a prescription.  He is not tied to one vet from whom he can get a prescription.  There is a choice in terms of both the prescribers he or she can go to, once there is a relationship with the prescribing vet, and the dispensing outlets where he or she may purchase his antiparasitics.</p> <p>  We are trying to build as much flexibility as possible into how the NVPS is designed, from both a technical and a practical point of view, in order that a farmer will have choice in regard to both prescribers and dispensers.  That is one of the steps we are taking to mitigate, insofar as possible, any limitations a farmer may feel he or she has, because there is more flexibility within the system, in how he or she obtains medicinal products under the proposed NVPS.</p></speech>

Has the decision been made?  We as a committee need to know this.  I will be blunt about it: if the responsible persons are taken out of the legislation, I will not support any legislation that comes before us as a committee.</p></speech>

I have not been a Member of this House for very long but I imagine this is a fairly unique scenario in that a Minister of State is saying to a committee that it should proceed with pre-legislative scrutiny of a Bill whose precise outcome we do not know.  As both members who spoke before me indicated, one very pertinent point has been subject to all the written observations the committee has received and all the interactions we have had with organisations.  It has been the subject of a report the committee produced and the Minister of State cannot give us an answer as to what the Bill will look like.  It boils down to the issue of responsible persons.</p> <p>  In the Minister of State's view, as somebody who is as well aware of the sector as anybody in the room, would he have considered what responsible persons in licensed merchants, for example, were doing over recent years as essentially the same as prescribing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#D00900"><p>To return to the Deputy's initial point, we have come quite quickly to pre-legislative scrutiny because there is urgency around this legislation.  If we did not properly consider the most recent legal opinion we received, with all the focus it is getting at the moment, he would have a different line of attack at me, I would respectfully suggest, because it is important we look at every opportunity there.</p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, which was not dissimilar to Deputy Fitzmaurice's point, is moot.  Nobody here is casting aspersions on responsible persons.  It is about how we ensure that legislation we bring through will be robust, will meet the regulations it needs to meet and will meet the interpretation that will be made of it under an EU approach.  Obviously, that is part of our consideration in our approach here.</p> <p>  I hold responsible persons in the highest regard and nobody here is suggesting the work they have done in the past is now any less important.  It is about how we can make this fit and ensure that any legislation we bring in will be robust and meet the regulations that are required.</p></speech>

One of two things has happened.  I might outline a scenario for the Minister of State.  A derogation was provided for in the regulations and that derogation, we are now told, is null and void because it was not implemented properly, if it is the case responsible persons were not prescribing.  In my view, however, they were, and I think anybody who has knowledge of the sector would agree.</p> <p>  The Department's case is that due to its misreading of the regulations, the derogation does not apply.  The European Commission has been asked on several occasions, including by my party colleague, Chris MacManus MEP, about whether the derogation can apply to responsible persons and the response has been that it is up to the member state to adjudicate on whether a derogation applies.  It is the Minister of State's Department that has said, consistently over recent months, that the derogation does not apply to responsible persons, in a manner that I would say is against common sense and the legalities of that.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the urgency of the regulations.  The EU regulations came into effect in January 2022 and the Department deferred part of its implementation.  It seems to me that internal departmental deliberations were legally offside, as the law stands.</p><p>The urgency arises from the need of the Department to become legally on-side in respect of the regulations.  That opens up the bigger issue of how the Department deals with EU regulations.  Time and again, when issues are raised at this committee, we are told we cannot do this or we must do that because of EU regulations as if these EU regulations came out of thin air.  The Government, in other words the Department, was represented at every step of the way in relation to these regulations.  I was a member of the European Parliament when they came through and we would depend on the Department to flag up potential issues in terms of its implementation at an Irish level.  Nobody saw it.  The people who were supposed to see it are the people who are telling us now that it cannot be done.</p><p> I must go back to the point as to the real willingness and sense within the Department to find a solution.  It strikes me, if the Minister of State is considering legal opinion that has come from third parties at this late stage in the day, that there has not been that drive within the Department to find a solution.  We all want to see antimicrobial and anti-parasitical resistance tackled.  We all accept that it is important but we also acknowledge that there are crucial cohorts, in terms of animal welfare and in terms of the dispensing of medicines and the ability of farmers to be able to access retail outlets to purchase that and other material that are under threat if this proposed legislation, as we were led to believe would transpire, goes ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#E00200"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for raising those points.  A central tenet that the Deputy leaves out of the points he is putting forward is the change in approach from an EU level to antiparasitics - the up-regulation.  In European law, the default position is that veterinary medicinal products, VMPs, for food producing animals require veterinary prescription before they can be supplied.  However, Ireland has historically availed of the derogation criteria, Article 34 of Regulation 2019/6 in EU law, which allowed for VMPs to be supplied without a prescription as there is no evidence of resistance to these products or environmental damage associated with their use.</p> <p>  Our knowledge of these products have changed following the 2019 report from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  The HPRA is the national competent authority, as the Deputy will aware, which determines the route of sale of veterinary medicinal products.  The report concluded that VMPs that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in law and evidence now exists that, with regards to environmental demand and growing anti-parasitic resistance, these products need to be supplied under prescription.  The criteria for the derogation by which antiparasitics did not require veterinary prescription no longer exist and, therefore, the requirement for a veterinary prescription for these products exists regardless of the introduction of Regulation 2019/6.</p> <p>  I got a bit technical there but it is to make the general point in response to the Deputy that the regulations have changed.  Mr. O'Mahony may want to come in on that specific point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#E00300"><p>Before the officials come in on this, this is a political charge but it is against the Department in terms of the structure because the criteria changed because we allowed it to change.  Therein lies the problem.  Nobody seemed to see it or, if they did, they kept it to themselves.  I would like to know which it is.  I do not know if I will ever be able to find the answer to that.  The officials of the Department and the officials from the permanent representation may have realised that the criteria that allowed the derogation to be in place would be undone as a result of the new regulations.  Did they inform the Minister of the day?  They certainly did not bring it to the attention of members of the European Parliament that I am aware of.  Did they believe, to give them the benefit of the doubt, that the new criteria would still allow for responsible persons to be able to dispense these products on the basis that they had already been doing so, as was the case in and the interpretation of our nearest neighbours when they were applying the law?</p> <p>  Let me ask two questions relating to that.  Essentially, if one were to take what the regulation aims to do or what the stated objective is, to reduce the use of these products in order to ensure that we do not have unnecessary resistance building up, it has been implemented for a number of products.  The Minister of State might give me clarification as to precisely their number.  We have heard evidence from the co-operatives, the licensed merchants and the pharmacy unions, all of which state that their sales of those products have reduced by 60% to 90%, depending on the organisation.  Is the Minister of State aware of what overall sales now look like compared to beforehand?</p></speech>

In terms of antibiotics, there is a five-day length of lifespan for a prescription.  Antiparasitics will have a 12-month lifespan.  They are very different.  The officials here can come in with the specific details in terms of numbers but the Deputy is not comparing like with like there.  They are not the same in terms of the prescription process.</p></speech>

In respect of the products to which the regulations apply and that previously did not, within three of the four sectors that dispensed them we are told that sales have reduced by between 60% and 90%.

In relation to statistics or market data on the overall sales of antimicrobials, we do not maintain data on that.  There is no legal basis for the recording of any gross data on antimicrobials.  To give the Deputy a straight answer, we do not have that data.  That data is not available.  It is also confidential commercial data, which is one of the difficulties in trying to ascertain accurate figures in relation to the sales of antimicrobial products.</p> <p>  It is also important to note the change in relation to intermammories only came in on 28 January 2022 and there has not been a full 12-month period of that yet.  We are always aware of the industry, and are aware of what Independent Licensed Merchants Association, ILMA, Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, stated in the past two weeks.  We do not dispute those figures or anything like that because they are the figures that they state.  The capacity to explore further market data is not available and it does not exist.</p></speech>

There are implementing Acts and delegated legislation, that currently we have officials on working groups in Brussels on, precisely on this.  We will in the future have it.</p> <p>  I go back to the Deputy's point about reduction in the sales of antimicrobials generally.  Every year, the HPRA, together with ourselves, compiles a voluntary survey and feeds it back into the European surveillance on antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine or European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption, ESVAC.  We found that last year there was a reduction in the overall amount of antimicrobials sold.  We have done a lot of communication within the Department and we have communicated the fact that prevention is better than cure.</p><p>Vaccines and other measures, such as biosecurity on farms, should be used instead of antimicrobials.  It seems that our message is getting through.  In our voluntary survey last year, there was a reduction of more than 15% in overall antimicrobial sales.  We expect that antimicrobial use will reduce.  In response to the question about intramammaries, the prescribing practices of vets and the fact that they can only issue a prescription for animals that they have seen and clinically examined means that the amount that they can prescribe is the amount that is necessary for the treatment of the animal.  Previously, a vet would have been able, under the law, to prescribe more than was necessary just in case.  The discretion regarding use of antimicrobials just in case has been reduced and it is based on risk.  The vet must do a risk assessment about how much antimicrobial medication will be required.  That can be followed up on by us and the Veterinary Council of Ireland under its ethical code.  We expected that once we hit 29 January, we would see a fall-off, and we have on an overall level, which the Deputy was asking about.  We are glad to see that.  We will have precise details.  We will capture it through the NVPS.  I can hand the Deputy over to my colleague.</p></speech>

There was mention of no veterinary participation in the system, no comparable products, that it will not reduce the administrative burden, that it increases border trade and that it reduces accountability.  The NVPS will address all those matters.  We have had vets working in the system for 12 months, since last December.  A total of 20 vets have been using the system as a pilot cohort since 28 January.  We have had engagement with and feedback from veterinary practitioners about how the system will work.  Since then, we have made significant improvements to the system to make it more user-friendly.  That is based on the feedback from those vets.</p> <p>  The issue of comparable products arose.  We have had discussions with ICOS and ILMA about producing a comparable list so the vet can prescribe an antiparasitic product and then the licensed merchant or whoever is dispensing the product can choose from a comparable list.  That list is being produced.  It will be built into the system and is ready to go.</p> <p>  There were comments about this not reducing the administrative burden.  Anybody who does not have a system will be able to use the NVPS.  It has all that information.  We spoke to farmers at the National Ploughing Championships.  Every farmer that came to the counter welcomed the NVPS because they will have a digital prescription.  They have problems with vets handing them prescriptions.  All those records will be in one place at the same time.</p> <p>  Those are only a flavour of issues that will be addressed.  I have another ten that I could go through in response to Deputy Carthy saying this is in complete disarray; it is not.  We have done user acceptance testing on the system and it is ready to go.  We have changed it.  We are working with software companies on the integration issue.  That is the last matter to address.  Everything else is ready.</p></speech>

Can I ask about the idea of the 12-month prescription?  Something similar is said online about the dairy health certificate, which happens on dairy farms on a particular basis.  Do we need to be thinking about a more practical approach than that regarding what Mr. Corkery has just said about the vet's interaction with the animal itself?  Are we looking at this on a 12-month prescription basis or are we looking at individual farm visits in order to deal with whatever the issue may be?  I am looking for clarity on where the process is.  Is it something similar to the dairy certificate application or will an individual call be required for the issue or plan?</p></speech>

As long as they have a customer-patient practice relationship, or in other words, as long as the vet has been on that farm once and knows about the farm, they do not have to visit in order to prescribe anti-parasitic medicines.  I would make the point from a veterinary perspective that in most cases in Ireland, because farmers are so well up to speed with antiparasitics and because they use them so frequently, we are not looking at clinical cases.  No diagnosis is necessary.  In other words, the use of antiparasitics is almost as necessary as feed is to pastoral systems.  One doses and there are some ancillary tests now that are being used more frequently, such as fecal egg count tests.  Those can be provided through dung samples and so on.  They will help to identify resistance but there is not the necessity for the vet to visit the farm every time an anti-parasitic is required.  Remember that the antiparasitics are not just those used for worms but for lice.  For example, Senator Lombard happened to mention the health certificate that is used on the dairy farms.  At the time the vet is doing the process, if the client asked the vet and if the vet is willing, that would be the time at which one could plan out, as some of my colleagues have said, the herd health plan for the year.</p> <p>  I remind the Senator that the Department is running a targeted advisory service on animal health scheme, which is an EU co-funded scheme.  That scheme has only been opened up since March and there are 14,000 farmers already who have looked for this co-funded visit from a vet to be able to provide this health plan for the year.  It will cover issues such as lice, mange, scab in sheep and roundworms.  Where there is evidence that the products have not been working, the vet will discuss with the farmer the possibility of taking dung samples and the vet can analyse the dung samples.  If this system continues as it is, the likelihood will be that there will be savings here for farmers and they will not end up using products that are not working.  They will use products that will work effectively.  In the long term, this will be an important solution to keep anti-parasitic medicines working in this country.</p></speech>

However, on the sheep farmer element, that is probably the one stage where we do not have that regular vet call on a herd test etc.  Does Mr. Corkery think that that will be an extra cost?  Is the veterinary power there?  I will give an example of Glengarriff which is a wonderful part of the world, on Beara Peninsula, which is approximately the same size as Louth, or slightly smaller.  One vet covers that entire peninsula.  Geographically, with that kind of scenario for a farming base that is down there, is it going to put an extra burden on an already - and no offence now - ageing population of vets that we have there at the moment?</p></speech>

It is again a new regulation and it is slightly behind the veterinary medicines in some ways in terms of implementation.  I will let Senator Lombard know that I am aware that requires an annual visit a minimum to every farming enterprise.  While sheep farmers in the past may not have seen vets on farms, in the future it is likely that they will do.  To be fair, any sheep farmer who I know of does use vets for lambing and so on and there are visits.  It is rare enough and I do appreciate the geography that Senator Lombard is speaking about.  I also believe the fact that the vet does not have to go there to prescribe antiparasitics and can prescribe from the clinic will assist.</p></speech>

I realise that this is the third hearing.  We previously received evidence from, I think it was Terence O'Shea from Glengarriff, who claimed that he had been in business for 40 years and that he would be out of business within six months.

I have to re-iterate to Senator Lombard that the priority here has been to meet our regulatory requirements while also giving farmers the greatest choice possible and trying to minimise that impact on businesses that are in that space.  It is a matter of trying to strike the right balance between all those different bits.  Change is challenging for lots of different sectors in lots of different ways, but if we do not get this right, we will have a big problem down the line in terms of resistance to medicines that are important for our farming enterprises and our food production system.</p></speech>

There is acceptance by the committee, by the industry and by all stakeholders in it that we can proceed with the dispensing duties of antimicrobials by vets exclusively.  The issue here is antiparasitics.  The background to this is our commitment to an all-Ireland economy, our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, striving to ensure that the protocol is in place and that it is enforced.  This is so that local products, in the North for example, can be labelled Irish and can by association be labelled European and, by association again, they can be in a position to be marketed to those markets and those third markets that the EU has agreed on behalf of its citizens and its member countries.  They also have the other option, too, if they so wish, and that is the beauty of the protocol.  That is recognising the huge improvements there have been in recent years in relation to that economy and our products and the efforts that are made to ensure that there is uniformity in relation to animal healthcare and so forth.</p> <p>  This is a proposal in relation to the national veterinary prescription system.  I was listening to Mr. Collins.  Is it correct that the Department is proceeding on 3 December with its implementation?  Is it correct that that system will not cater for the responsible person within these outlets as it presently stands?</p></speech>

Obviously Dr. Corkery has expertise in this area.  One of the points he made to support that exclusion was to say that a vet - only a vet it would appear - can assess the herd needs into the future or assess resistance on the part of the animals based on the assessment of the dung, for example.  Could the responsible persons not also offer such a service if they are included in the legislation to participate in the NVPS?  There should not be any contention, assertion or inference that that is not possible because they are not veterinary surgeons.</p> <p>  As was said earlier, we need to know how long it will take for the Department to assess the opinion which seems to be the only avenue to afford the opportunity for the responsible persons to participate in the NVPS.  As it stands, they will not be participating.  When is that opinion expected to be assessed and responded to?  At that point it might be appropriate for the Minister of State and his officials to come before this committee again because he will be in a position to prescribe the legislation and the committee can pass its judgment on it thereafter.</p></speech>

We only last week received the latest legal opinion which was mentioned.  It is very new and we want to give it the due consideration it deserves because this topic is so important.  We will have a decision on that as soon as we can.  Should pre-legislative scrutiny be passed allowing the legislative process to start and if the Department were to find that legal opinion stood up to scrutiny and the legislative process had begun, it could be dealt with by way of amendment.  Either way, this committee will be dealing with that legislation whenever it comes before the House.</p></speech>

Based on the previous EU legislation and 2019/6, to avail of the derogation, they must fit all the points under Article 34.3.  The one there is the issue with is that even misuse is supposed not to have any problem from a resistance point of view.  However, unfortunately, resistance to antiparasitics is already out there and has also been documented in Ireland.  The problem is that the up-regulation of antiparasitics to prescription-only means they require a veterinary prescription for their use.</p></speech>

The antiparasitics were up-regulated by the HPRA because there is now known resistance to antiparasitics.</p><p>As the Minister of State said, it is important we that can use these products and keep them available for farmers so we can look after animal health and our export markets as well as all the livelihoods that are dependent on the agrifood sector.</p></speech>

Under Article 105(4), the derogation applies only to vets or persons who were professionally prescribing medicines prior to 2019.  At that stage, RPs were not prescribing those medicines because they were not prescription-only medicines, POMS, as Dr. Fanning said.  When the regulation came into force in 2019, everything was still okay.  It was subsequent to that, when the HPRA decided those medicines became POMs, that the RPs were outside the derogation loop.</p></speech>

Would it be fair to say, in general terms, that if the UK entered a derogation on any legislation, be it on justice or home affairs, it would flag a certain amount of interest and the Irish delegation would at least look at what was happening to understand why it was doing it this way and whether it would be beneficial to us?  In a variety of areas, regulation in Ireland is quite similar to that of the United Kingdom.  If that was flagged, was a decision made in the Department at that time?  It seems to me that a decision would have been made that we were either going the way of the United Kingdom at that time or we would bring in prescriptions for antiparasitics.  As Deputy Cowen said, we are talking about antiparasitics, not antimicrobials.</p></speech>

The reason was that the UK identified resistance in the parasites far earlier than we did.  We did not have evidence of antiparasitic resistance for at least ten years after the UK had determined it had a problem with antiparasitic resistance; hence it did what the HPRA did in Ireland, and up-regulated.  In that up-regulation, it was decided that SQPs would be allowed to issue prescriptions.  Prior to the introduction of the new regulations and prior to the HPRA's report to up-regulate these medicines, any new antiparasitic medicine that was approved within the community had to have a veterinary prescription.  In Ireland, a number of antiparasitic medicines have existed for a number of years that have required a prescription, for which a veterinary prescription has been issued, and we have allowed the responsible persons to dispense those.</p></speech>

These were new products that thankfully came on to the market.  They were not used that frequently because we did not have much evidence of resistance.  There would not have been many farmers going to their vet saying they did not believe the antiparasitic medicine was working.  However, it did happen.  Teagasc has stated it is using antiparasitic medicine on farms.  There are new research papers on these new medicines and, for a number of years, they could only be issued on foot of a veterinary prescription.</p></speech>

The answer is that it is up to the vet, but it is up to the member state to determine for how long that will be.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether they have a limit on the duration, but the decision is left to the vet.  I spent some time in France as the agricultural attach&eacute; for the Department; therefore, I am somewhat aware of what they do there.  They have quite a restrictive system regarding the duration of prescriptions.  The duration would be shorter term, of one month or two months.  We would be more flexible in Ireland, but then again, one must remember that most cattle are partially housed in France, which I was surprised to see, and they go out for periods.  France does not have the same issues we have because of the wet climate in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am uncomfortable.  I do not like monopolies.  I watched the whole proceedings and I know the officials are uncomfortable.  They are doing a job for the Department and the Minister of State and they are here with him this evening.  I do not like monopolies and I never have.  Any time you have a monopoly you have a problem.  I listened to officials from the Department of Health and other Departments in years gone by saying nobody but a doctor or nurse could give an injection in this country.  When Covid came they brought in laypeople.  They brought in anybody who could give an injection and they were allowed give injections.  Anybody who could do anything in the area of health could do it.</p> <p>  I have been uncomfortable since this debate started a few months ago.  I am asking the officials to go back again.  I am asking the Minister of State to revisit this whole monopoly.  I do not like monopolies.  As the previous speakers have said, agriculture is supposed to be being dealt with on an all-Ireland level.  People are people and if people along the Border are able to go into Northern Ireland they will be able to get whatever they want to get.  They will be able to get prescribed whatever they want to get prescribed.  If a chemist, a wholesaler or whoever wants to sell them the goods, they will be sold.  Until we can have this on an all-Ireland basis, we should not be bringing forward this legislation.  I do not like the way the legislation is being introduced.  The Department was having many discussions with different veterinary organisations and then all of a sudden it went flat.  Now the Department has made a decision it is going to push this through.  I am saying it is not going to and I am asking the officials to reconsider.  There is going to be chaos in December if they push this through.  I am just very uncomfortable.</p> <p>  I have been in business all my life.  The departmental officials spoke about the leniency of the Department and how good it is.  I have never found the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine too lenient.  I have dealt with a lot of farmers for 30 years and the Department is the most unreasonable outfit there ever was when it comes to the rural environment protection scheme and every other type of scheme.  Then there is what the Department does to farmers over the mistakes they make and the kind of penalties it puts on them.  I am uncomfortable.  I support the Minister of State and want to get this legislation through.  I do not like it and have not from the beginning.  I do not like monopolies and hate to see people being put out of business.  I am from rural Ireland and this is going to have a major effect there.  It is going to have a major effect on jobs, on chemists and on animal welfare.  The officials will talk about animal welfare and everything else but we are all about health and animal welfare.  This is not well thought out.  The Department should go back and try to get a derogation.  This legislation should get put off, certainly for this year.  It is something the Minister of State and the Department should look at again.</p></speech>

His views are passionately held.  He was saying he was following the committee earlier.  He would have seen in my earlier presentation that as recently as last week we received a new legal opinion from stakeholders.  We are giving that due consideration to see if there is any way around this.  Ultimately, we want to strike the right balance and ensure that while giving farmers the greatest possible choice we also meet the regulatory requirements we are duty bound to meet.  It is about trying to get that balance right and seeing how best we can do that.  I touched earlier on the points around the 12-month nature of a prescription.  In many instances there is a clear gap between when a prescription is written and when the product needs to be bought.  It may not always be the same day.  We want the maximum regulatory flexibility we can get.  That is why are giving due diligence to the latest legal opinion we have received to see if we can have as practical and flexible an approach as possible.</p></speech>

What percentage of them are currently being processed on the NVPS?  Would the Minister of State and the officials accept that vet-only prescribing will not meet regulations, because there will be no competition?  Anyone with a grain of common sense can see that.  There will not be competition and it will lead to less availability.  Objective 5 of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 states:</p> <blockquote> 	This Regulation aims to reduce the administrative burden, enhance the internal market and increase the availability of veterinary medicinal products, while guaranteeing the highest level of public and animal health and environmental protection. </blockquote> <p>Do the Minister of State and the officials accept the responsible person and the veterinary pharmacist have critical roles to play if this objective is to be achieved?  Their roles are not apparent from the draft regulations.  Do the Minister of State and the officials acknowledge that as a result of the moves made by the Department in 2012 to endorse a personal qualification for the responsible persons that committed them to include several prescribing responsibilities, responsible persons were prescribing these medicines when the EU regulation came into force in 2019?</p><p>I would like answers to those questions.  I am calling for a fair resolution here.  There is going to be a lot of wrong done and much of it to rural businesses.  I am concerned about that.  This must be got right.  There must be proper collaboration with the stakeholders who have provided the Department with a legal opinion.</p></speech>

She outlined them well.  I am going to go to the officials, especially Dr. Corkery and Mr. Collins, to answer some of her specific questions on the percentage of prescriptions and the vets element.</p> <p>  Let me bring it back to the start.  The process here and the reason we are doing this is to ensure we have the best possible health standards for our animals.  As I have said previously, we are trying to strike the right balance between giving the greatest choice possible to farmers, meeting our regulatory requirements and ensuring the sustainability of our pasture-based livestock system, which is crucially important to rural Ireland and our rural economy.  Many of the members present come from constituencies where it is so important.  A threat is posed to the health of our animals by resistance to certain medicines upon which we are so dependent.  That is the motivation behind these practices.  Now it is about getting the elements for our own national competence into national legislation to try to apply them as best suits our country while complying with the regulatory requirement, as we need to do.  It is a balance and a challenge.  I do not profess that it is perfect or that the final solution will be perfect.</p><p>Any stakeholders in this who come with legal opinion believe there are ways around the legal challenges we all know exist and which members of the committee are aware of and have dealt with extensively in the previous report.  We are actively analysing them to see if there is some way to try to apply those that would best suit our system.  It is about getting that balance right, which is ultimately what we want to do, while also recognising that the motivation here is the longer term threat to the health of our livestock in a pasture-based system, which is so important to our rural economy.  I will bring in Mr. Collins first on the percentage of prescriptions query and then I will bring in Mr. Corkery on the vets point.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier to Deputy Carthy, there are 20 vets using the system on a pilot basis for us, and 100% of the scripts they are writing are going onto the national veterinary prescription system, NVPS.  Those written scripts are dispensed prescriptions.  There are no undispensed prescriptions on that system at all.  They are using it in a capacity for us to get practical feedback on the practical application of the system.  They give us information on what is good about it, what is working and what does not work.  They are talking to farmers about it, asking how it works, and the farmers are getting the SMS texts or the prescriptions on those.</p></speech>

Objective No. 5 is about the availability of product.  Previously, each member state would have had its own authorising agency, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority, and its own number of products that each market would have.  This new regulation has brought in access to products in other markets in certain circumstances.  The first thing it has done is to make sure the prescription issued by a vet is valid throughout the community.  This is one way in which the availability has been increased.  That prescription can be used throughout the community but one must use the products that are, in the main, authorised in the member states.  There are circumstances where those products are not available and there are some that are specifically for exotic animals and equines.</p> <p>  Ireland is such a small market within the veterinary medicinal products sphere that we need products from other member states.  Prior to this regulation it was much more difficult to access them.  The provision in Article 110 of the veterinary medicinal products regulation relates to what we know as the "cascade".  For example, one can go to Lithuania for a product if the product is not available here or if that product is not available with those ingredients.  This is where the market has been greatly improved in the context of objective No. 5.  It is very important we are able to utilise this system of accessing medicines in other EU member states, and for the European Medicines Agency, EMA, to facilitate that.  The EMA has designed a new database, the union product database, UPD.  The agency has made that database available to all of the member states.  We now have a big repository of all the drugs available throughout the community that we can access if we are in short supply or if we do not have them in this market.  It would not be fair to say this regulation is not being implemented here.  My division in the Department, along with Mr. O'Mahony's section, are communicating the benefits around the accessibility and availability of products, of which there are very many for vets and for animals.  At the end of the day this is to ensure there is enhanced animal welfare so that, for example, the gerbil or other pet animals that might need a particular treatment will have access to product and so we have access to certain products for horses, along with vaccines.  It is all to ensure there is more preventative medicine and less use of antimicrobials, which is another of the objectives.  This is where the availability comes in.  We are utilising all of those flexibilities this new regulation extends to us.</p></speech>

I have two questions that may have been answered already.  The first question is on the refill on the Internet.  I see that the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association has said that farmers should be able to purchase veterinary medicines from legitimate sources online, be that in Ireland or the EU.  Will the Minister of State explain if this means medicines that are approved in Ireland and are not subject to prescription will be precluded from being purchased online from outside of Ireland by a farmer?</p></speech>

Since then, some members of the major milk producing co-operatives have experienced the budget 9% reduction in the intra-mammary tubes status.  This raises questions about the Department's preparedness and competence to address adequately what is being addressed through this legislation.  We are still in the dark about the Attorney General's advice, which is another factor that brings the whole thing into question as far as I am concerned.  The Minister of State is saying this pre-legislative scrutiny is being rushed because of a sense of urgency.  What if the Minister of State were looking at this from any other position than from where he is.  If he was looking at it on his own, would he find it acceptable?  Did the Department give any consideration to ensuring the reps could have similar abilities such as the suitably qualified persons?  Does the Department believe this ship has sailed at this stage?</p></speech>

I will deal first with the intra-mammary tubes.  Similar points were raised here earlier.  As I pointed out, they are antibiotics and they are subject to a prescription that has a five-day life span.  That is as long as a prescription for an antibiotic would last.  What is proposed here for a new prescription for antiparasitics is a 12-month life span.  We are trying to strike the right balance between safeguarding and offering farmers the greatest choice while also meeting our legal regulatory requirements and trying to ensure we are very mindful of the impact on merchants here.  The 12-month licence makes it very clear there could be a significant gap between the day a prescription is acquired and the day the product is purchased.  Obviously, given that intra-mammary tubes are antibiotics, that gap is only five days.  It stands to reason that if one gets a prescription that will last for five days, we would probably expect this product to be purchased that same day or very close to it.  They are not necessarily comparing like with like.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's other question, if I were sitting in any other chair here, I would see the balance that there is.  I would see the great regard in which we all hold the responsible persons and for the role they have played in the past, but I would also see the challenges of the up-regulation that antiparasitics have brought in.  I would see the challenge of trying to maintain the maximum flexibility and choice for farmers while also making sure we meet our regulatory requirements.</p><p> I would also see, taking a fair-minded approach, the great medium and longer term threat if we do not take a serious approach to how antiparasitics are used in livestock.  Earlier, I highlighted that there are only four key groups of drenches, as farmers would know them, and lots of products come from them.  Only four key groups of drenches have active ingredients and if our livestock become resistant to any one of those four groups the number of options available will be reduced.  Preventing such a situation is the motivation for this legislation.  This is about giving assurances to the very farmers that the members and myself represent.  We must ensure that their livestock and pasture-based system, which is so crucial to farmers and the rural communities in which farmers live, is protected long into the future.  Our approach is about trying to strike the right balance.</p></speech>

I reassure the committee that we received the advice recently and we are giving the advice its due consideration.  We are going through the advice with a fine-tooth comb to see if it can work and are assessing whether we believe it would stand up to the regulatory scrutiny experienced by all legislation.  That is why we do not have absolute clarity on that legal point tonight.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the time pressure concerning this legislation, and not just for this element but for the fertiliser element, which we will discuss later.  That directly impacts on farmers in respect of the range of options they will have, for the eco schemes that they can join and all the rest.</p> <p>  The legislation is very much in the hands of the committee in terms of the pre-legislative scrutiny and in the hands of Members of the Oireachtas as to how legislation passes through the two Houses and goes through those phases.  The Department must ensure, when we come back with our adjudication on the latest legal opinion, that we can say hand on heart that we have gone over the legal opinion with a fine-tooth comb and analysed it inside out and ensured that we have looked at it in every way and if there is a way it can be accepted and integrated then great but, if not, we want to be able to say that we have gone through it in that way.  We received the legal opinion last week and I assure the Deputy that we are working hard and fast to ensure that we go through it.  We are doing that work with an element of wanting to make sure that we do it speedily we are not going to rush our work to the extent that we do not give this the due consideration that it deserves. </p></speech>

In reality, and for clarity, all that we can put into legislation or regulation is that a prescription can be &quot;up to 12 months&quot; because it is the veterinarian himself who will decide.  Am I right to say it is the vet who decides the duration of a prescription?</p><p><b></b>Let us say a vet tests my cattle in March and I ask him on the day to give me a prescription for antiparasitic treatment that will last until this time next year.  Let us say he turns around to me and says that it would not be ethically professional for him to prescribe something that a farmer might use next harvest.  Considering that I do not know whether there will be a drought or a wet summer or what the climatic conditions will be like between now and then and vets says to me that it would not be ethically professional for a vet to do so and will not give an annual prescription, is he or she in the right to do so and the Minister of State, his officials or me would have a foot to stand on to tell him that he had to give me an annual prescription? </p><p>What has been said here is that we are putting up a camouflage of an annual prescription as a lifeline for the merchants, pharmacists and the co-operatives but we are handing even more power to the vet who will decide whether he will and he or she will be covered by professional ethics by saying he or she will not.  Power is, therefore, being handed over.</p><p>When we started this conversation I was the first to speak and I mentioned anti-competitiveness and availability.  Handing vets more power will not solve the anti-competitive issue.  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned you would feel ashamed to look a vet in the eye and say you will go somewhere else to buy them.  You are now looking the vet in the eye yet he refuses to give the prescription and he will be within his right to refuse.  I want this matter clarified before we finish.</p><p>I wish to mention an issue that has not been mentioned  The French prescribing system and its issues have been mentioned.  In our previous deliberations - and I do not have my notes with me so I cannot give an exact quote - it emerged that Scandinavian countries have discovered that decoupling led to the best results in their antiparasitic plan.  Why has Ireland not examined decoupled prescribing and dispensing?  We should let vets be vets and suppliers be suppliers.  The Government has not even addressed the idea of separating prescribing and dispensing. </p><p>I have a fond memories of a previous meeting where we discovered that Scandinavian countries have statistical proof that shows they have the best results in handling antiparasitic resistance and in those countries vets are vets and suppliers are suppliers.  We have not even discussed the option.  If the merchants, co-operatives and the pharmacists stand to lose if we get this right, why do we not go down that road and maybe the vets will lose a small bit?  In Ireland we have a one-way street in this area. </p></speech>

It is done in law.  If in the Bill we put in a provision that a prescription for antiparasitic medicine will have a duration of 12 months then that is what it will have.  I recall saying earlier that the current situation is that a vet can decide that a prescription will be for as long as the vet determines.  In this legislation that we are scrutinising it is possible to insert a provision stating, "A prescription for anti-parasitic medicines shall be valid for one year", and if we get the go-ahead to ensure the NVPS is the only way in which a vet can issue a prescription, then the NVPS will default to 12 months.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, these are almost in the nature of feed.  In Ireland, one does not see symptoms.  There is generally no necessity for a diagnosis.  They are required, they are different and they are part of a herd health plan, which is why the TASAH scheme, which I mentioned earlier, is so important.</p></speech>

I could end up therefore, throwing a prescription I get in March prior to the summer on the fire.</p></speech>

Over the past six or seven months vets have called meetings in hotels throughout the country.  We see vets giving us biscuits and sandwiches and all different stuff while they tell us what is coming down the line.  It was made very clear to farmers in many places throughout the country that vets would be calling out to the farms to decide what prescription would be needed.  Has the Department made any allowance for this in the legislation?  The answer is that it has not.  Has it made any allowance for the farmers who will have to pay more money than previously?  The signal being given out by the Department seems to be of a jolly thing of vets doing herd tests and when the farmers and vets are sitting in the jeep afterwards, when the farmers are giving the vets a few hundred euros for the herd test, they will say they want products for fluke or other issues for the year, the vet will write out the prescription and everyone will be happy.  This is not how it will end up.  Farmers are at the end of the barrel of a gun on this one.  The vets will have the opportunity to screw farmers and that is the fact whether or not the Department wants to admit it.  This is how the legislation is being written.  Farmers throughout the country will be at the end of this stick with vets.  It has already happened.  I have seen the build up to this where vets are bringing people to hotels.  I have never seen it previously and it has been happening over the past six months.  They are getting farmers ready to bring them in.</p></speech>

The Department is speaking about 12-month prescriptions that will be of benefit to reduce resistance in animals.  In actual fact a 12-month prescription, if given by a vet, would be counter-productive to what the Department is trying to achieve.  If vets give the full possible coverage that farmers need for the year they would be providing drugs the farmers might not need depending on various circumstances.  To say that vets will give 12-month prescriptions that will help to reduce resistance in animals is a fallacy and it is wrong.  If we get a dry year farmers will not need a fluke dose.  If we get a wet year they will need it.  When we get damp weather we have more fluke than in a dry year.  To think vets will say on 1 March or 1 April that they can predict what farmers will need for 12 months is wrong and misleading.</p></speech>

To say that on one day of the year farmers will know what they will need for the year is wrong.  If, for example, there was an offer for something that farmers might need it would be counter-productive to what we are trying to achieve.  Let us cut out the nonsense and be square.  A 12-month prescription will not happen in reality.  If it does happen in reality it will cost the farmers money.</p></speech>

We discussed this with the HPRA and came up with what HPRA has advised us to call a comparable product list.  This comparable product list will be available.  The dispenser, be it the co-op or the licensed merchant, will be able to examine the prescription and will have been given, in our national veterinary prescription system, every product that can be substituted for it.  This will include the product it will have on its shelf.  We have worked with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and the Independent Licensed Merchants Association to ensure this is workable.  Recently they proposed additional changes and we have accommodated them.</p></speech>

This is where I was coming from in my first point.  The responsible person will not have that much wriggle room if I have a prescription since March and I have had a bad summer.  The provider will have to give what the Department and the HPRA have decided is an identical product.</p></speech>

For example, if we were speaking about car parts and a clutch it would have all of the clutches available that would suit the car model.  It depends on the species.

The Department has explained where the process started and ended.  The Chair has made a valuable point on whether it will work at the end of the day.  There are all types of land and we have seen all sorts of weather this year.  We have had unbelievable weather that I have never seen before.  If this fails, which it could, what is plan B?  Will we go down the line of having prescription only and dispensing only?  Have we thought about what plan B will be?  Plan A has been put in front of us and it is questionable, to say the very least.  Obviously there is a plan B somewhere in case we do not meet the targets.  Will we go down the dramatic road of removing dispensing completely from vets?  Will we have it for another entity to deal with?  I am very concerned that plan A, according to the Chair's analysis, might fail and plan B has not even been thought up.</p></speech>

The question in some regards relates to the question asked by Senator Daly about decoupling.  That matter, as Deputy Carthy knows, was discussed at length in the European Parliament.  It looked at whether there is evidence to suggest that with regard to antimicrobials, decoupling would improve the situation and reduce the amount of antimicrobials dispensed.  It did in Sweden but other member states, which I would prefer not to mention, that have coupled are the heaviest users of antimicrobials.  There was another matter.  It was considered that if we decoupled in countries that had not decoupled prior to the treaty that introduced the Single Market it could amount to a state aid if one sector were prioritised over another.</p> <p>  On the previous occasion I came before the committee I mentioned a situation where a vet is asked to attend to an animal on an island.  The vet can determine what is wrong, make a diagnosis, decide what the treatment is and issue a prescription.  Is this any good to the islander if the vet walks away and says the animal cannot be treated because dispensing and prescribing have been decoupled?  These are the reasons behind it.  It is not only in Ireland but in the European Union.  The feeling at the European Parliament was this cannot happen.  There are parliamentary debates to support this.</p> <p>  The Chair asked about prescriptions being issued at the start of the year.  For example, when the herd health plan is being made for dairy farmers they may be issued a prescription for fly tags or pyrethroids to prevent flies during the summer.  We may then not have a very dry warm summer, such as what we had this year, when there are an awful lot of flies.  The product would not have to be dispensed.</p><p>It is the same with regard to what the Senator said about the flukicide.  If a person does not believe he or she has a problem, just because it is on the prescription-----</p></speech>

Let us be honest and fair; Mr. Corkery might think that is a constructive way of going about reducing the use of antibiotics.  We take milk samples approximately six times per year.  We take faeces samples to dictate our dosing regime.  Mr. Corkery is telling me that I can have a foolscap page of anything I might want and that is the reason the Department is bringing in this proposed legislation.  As has been said, we are creating a monopoly on who will control it.  Mr. Corkery is saying a veterinarian will give a prescription.  That will not last.  Once this proposed legislation comes into force, that 12-month prescription will not last a year.</p></speech>

We have seen that if one doses for fluke and it is not there, it creates resistance.  There is no point in saying it does not.  Unless samples are being taken, however, we will not know whether the level of fluke is there.  Mr. Corkery is telling us that the Department is going to hand a farmer access to all this instead of going down the route of him or her going to a responsible person with a milk sample and getting the product he or she needs, which can be proven from the milk sample.  This will not achieve what we want it to achieve and it will create a monopoly as well.  Ultimately, it will add significant extra cost for farmers.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Chairman's points about the responsible person are valid.  They were echoed by other members of committee.  We are looking at the latest legal opinion to see if we can make that work.  Outside of that, pre-legislative scrutiny is all about having these types of detailed debates around impediments where the Department officials, as very experienced people in the area of agriculture, food and the marine, would have an insight.  It is open to the committee to make recommendations about that length of time.  If it is the committee's recommendation that it would be a different length of time, that is a possibility.  We take on board the points that have been made, however.</p></speech>

For ordinary people, what we are talking about in that instance is exactly what happens for human medicine whereby a GP prescribes and a person purchases in a chemist.  That system is in place for very good reason, which is to ensure that the person who is prescribing is not incentivised to over-prescribe where there would be a profit motive behind that.</p> <p>  I was peripherally involved with some of the discussions at an EU level.  My recall of that is different from Mr. Corkery's, which I will not dispute.  My recollection is not that the European institution said this cannot happen, but that it will not happen at an EU-wide level.  My understanding was that the discretion was left very much at a member state level.  However, I do recall that in stark contrast to my experience regarding whether a derogation is in place, the Irish Government was very active on that particular point in opposition to any suggestion that there would be an EU-wide decoupling of the prescribing and selling of animal medications.  I had sympathy with the arguments that said it could make veterinarians unviable in some peripheral rural areas, and that there may be instances where emergency prescribing and dispensing would be required within a short timeframe.  However, the first argument is lost with the enthusiasm with which we are moving forward on a piece of proposed legislation that could potentially make many other very important businesses for rural communities unviable, particularly our licensed merchants and our co-operative sector.</p> <p>  The Minister of State prefaced quite a number of his remarks on the basis that he is still considering the legal opinion and new legal advice he has received.  When we go into the depth of the responses we have been receiving, however, I do not get a sense of an open mind.  I get a sense that the Minister of State is pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing us by saying that the Department received further legal advice and that he and his officials are looking into it.  However, every single substantive response we have received to any of the questions that have been put very clearly point to the view that minds have been made up in the Department, and we are proceeding along this basis.</p> <p>  I will make this final point.  Mr. Corkery mentioned state aid, which, unfortunately, is one of these things at EU level where what suits the goose does not always suit the gander.  Once the EU puts in place a measure, it cannot breach state aid rules.  My view of this proposed legislation is that it is in breach, at the very minimum, of the principles of the Competition Act.  There are, if you like, four sectors through which this type of medication is dispensed and prescribed, depending on what term we are going to use.  In the aftermath of this proposed legislation, there will basically be one.</p> <p>  The advice we have received and the testimonies we have received through written submissions do not just come from those sectors that gave evidence but from what I can see, also from virtually every farm organisation.  The people at the front line who represent farmers are telling us that if this happens on the basis the Department has indicated, it will make providing medication to animals more expensive for their members.  This is at a time when margins are already tight.</p> <p>  I have two questions in that regard.  Will the Minister of State examine the full outworkings of decoupling and look at decoupling as an option?  As I said, it is not something for which I would have advocated but we are coming into extreme circumstances, and it is only through this that we will be able to save many local businesses that will otherwise be under threat.</p> <p>  Can the Minister of State give us a timeframe for the examination of that new legal advice, as he has indicated?  I do not believe we can close the pre-legislative scrutiny process relating to this proposed legislation until we have received an assessment of the Department's adjudication on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101100002#O01000"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for those supplementary questions.  Dr. Corkery outlined earlier the challenges around decoupling, not just in terms of state aid.  State aid rules were investigated by my Department, however, and it was found that to restrict the supply of veterinary medicines from one grouping for economic reasons would be considered state aid.  A sound evidential basis in veterinary medicine is required to justify any partial or full prohibition on veterinarians doing that.</p> <p>  I will bring the Deputy back to my earlier point about having maximum flexibility for farmers in as much as possible in terms of their livelihoods and the role they play.  This situation has already been outlined.  A farmer in that space may need a prescription and need the product that same day on a farm that may be in a very isolated area, such as on an island or some equally isolated location.  We are tying the hands of that farmer to have the ability to access it if we decouple.  That is the very clear position on that issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's second point, the timeframe is very clear.  It is as soon as possible.  I would love to see this being a solution,  The Deputy talked about the tone and the references beyond that legal opinion.  Let us be clear; the committee has gone through this for two years.  We have all looked at this issue.  We have all heard from the various stakeholder groups and had them appear before the committee.  We have not up until now been able to find a legal regulatory mechanism that will allow us to be able to deal with the issue of the responsible person in Ireland in the proposed legislation.</p><p>If the legal opinion had not come in last week, we would still be in that position.  I would love this new legal opinion to work.  We owe it to everybody involved to analyse it , ensure that we go through it with a fine-tooth comb, turn it inside out and see if we can make it work.  That would be to the benefit of the merchants, rural Ireland and everybody involved.</p><p> I understand the misgivings and concerns that colleagues have raised, but whatever legislation we bring through, we are duty-bound, on this side of the table, to make sure that it fits the regulatory and legal requirements that we have to meet.  We will make that decision as soon as possible.  I would love for it to work.  Before that came in, we had not found a legal opinion that would work and that we believed would stand up to that scrutiny.  That is being straight and honest about it.</p></speech>

Witnesses giving evidence within parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence given to the committee.  This means witnesses have a full defence against any defamation action from anything said at the committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected to not abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precinct are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to publications by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee and to any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  We will take the second half of Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon's statement on fertiliser as read, as all Members here have read it.</p></speech>

I have a few short questions.  I have worked on cross-country pipelines.  One does a way leaves, roadway or whatever one wants for different types of work and construction.  If one is doing a way leave one could be going through 20 to 100 different farms.  It could be 100 m wide or 50 m wide, depending on the job one is doing.  The ground has to be what we call "reinstated" as one would be going through the farmer's land.  Who accounts for that fertiliser?  Is it put on to the nitrates of the farmer on each individual system or how does it work?</p></speech>

Irish Water will have done a deal with the farmers to put a pipe from Ballymore Eustace to Leixlip, for instance.  It goes cross-country, but all that ground has to be reinstated because of the way leave.  Whose responsibility is it?  Is it the farmer on whose land the fertiliser is put on?  The civil contractor has to reinstate all the ground, put in the pipe and do everything as a contact with Irish Water or otherwise.  That is all.  If it is an issue the witnesses have not come across, they can reply to me later.  I have no problem waiting.</p></speech>

In this case I assume it is applying it on a number of farms so it attributes the fertiliser that goes to each farm on the database.  If there are ten farmers involved, the smaller farmers obviously have less land, so there is less fertiliser attributed to them, while the larger farmers have more attributed to them<i>pro rata</i>with where the fertiliser was actually used.</p></speech>

Farmer Joe has a way leave gone through Irish Water for six to eight months and the reinstatement will be done in September.  If I am working on my fertiliser spreadsheet, what I am allowed to use or what my targets are, and the contractor puts out a lot more, which it will because it has to try to grow grass and not go back on it, there is a danger it will not know the amount or the volume.

I know what Deputy Fitzmaurice is saying from a civil contractor's perspective but from the farmer's perspective, it not something that will happen very regularly.  It will happen once.  It will be applied to the farm and there will obviously have to be communication between the civil contractor and the farmer as to how much fertiliser can be spread on the land so they are within their means on that.  As I have said, in terms of the overall point about this Bill, my focus is on how this will impact farmers on an annual and an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

There have been a number of interventions to make it easier for those small companies whose core business is perhaps not selling fertiliser, as the Deputy outlined.  They might do different things and sell a small amount of fertiliser.  They have options open to them.  They can use the application programming interface, API, system or they can log on through <i>agfood.ie </i>to register that way.  The system is pretty straightforward.</p></speech>

It could be a very valuable tool in terms of putting measures in place at a later stage that would incentivise individual farms to reduce emissions.  The difficulty I have with it is a fairly obvious one.  What procedures are envisaged for a farmer from, for example, my county, who happens to go to a merchant?  It may be across the Border, but it may be their closest merchant.  What provision is in place in that instance?  How will that operate?</p></speech>

Farmers and other professional fertiliser end users can continue to purchase fertiliser from Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are keen to ensure that trade continues.  We do not want to discommode that trade as normal between two jurisdictions.  However, this proposed legislation does place a legal obligation on anyone importing fertiliser into the State to register as a fertiliser economic operator and to submit data on imports to a national fertiliser database.  We have developed a system to make the registration process as simple as possible for farmers.  I acknowledge there are concerns in the industry and the concerns it has in relation to the issue.  There have been discussions on this matter in the consultative committee meetings.  We cannot legislate for other jurisdictions, but my Department has been in close contact with colleagues in the area.  In terms of farm controls, which are risk-based and include specific checks on the import of fertilisers, these checks will be a key focus of on-farm controls in the roll-out of the national fertiliser database.</p></speech>

As it stands in the legislation, if I as a farmer go to any merchant in this State, purchase fertiliser and give my herd number, the onus will be on the merchant to upload all of that and it will be assigned.  It is a very simple process.  Am I supposed to say to somebody who might be in the parish of Cullaville - the parish crosses the counties of Monaghan and Armagh - that if they happen to be driving home and they have an empty trailer and decide to pull in to load up with a dozen bags of fertiliser for whatever reason, they need to register as a fertiliser economic operator?  In all honesty, what does the Minister of State think the chances of that happening are?</p></speech>

Farmers who are end users will register with us as a professional fertiliser end user.  We also recognise that some farmers will import fertiliser directly or they may sell or transfer fertiliser from farm to farm.  In those circumstances, we have made the system as simple possible so that when they are on the <i>agfood.ie</i>log-in page, which farmers are very familiar with, under the national fertiliser database tab there will be a very simple pop-up box to ask if you are importing or selling fertiliser and if you want to register as a fertiliser economic operator.  It will simply be a tick box.  The process is straightforward.  They will still have to submit the details concerning the products they have imported.  All of those products have been uploaded onto the fertiliser database, including products that are distributed and sold in the North of Ireland, to make that process as simple as possible for farmers.</p></speech>

To say very clearly back to the Deputy, the farmer only needs to register once.  I know many farmers who go on the <i>agfood.ie</i>system to mark a range of different things, whether it is to click in for schemes or going online to register the movement of cattle.  People have cattle going in and out of their holdings all the time.  Farmers have shown themselves to be very capable of doing that.  This is a once-off process that is a tick-the-box on that system.</p></speech>

A farmer from County Fermanagh travels to his local merchant who happens to be in County Monaghan.  What happens in that instance when he purchases?  What does the merchant in that instance do to record the fact that farmer has bought a quantity of fertiliser?</p></speech>

He will go to the merchant and buy the fertiliser, and the merchant in those circumstances is registered as a fertiliser economic operator and is obliged to submit returns to the Minister through the national fertiliser database.  We will have information on those sales that are, in essence, outside of the jurisdiction.</p></speech>

We do not want to stop merchants in the Deputy's constituency in counties Monaghan or Cavan from selling produce if they have a customer who comes from Northern Ireland.  As calculations are done about the impact of fertiliser spread, we need to be able to show and it is important we clearly say that something went outside the jurisdiction.</p></speech>

Obviously a farmer from the North does not have to provide a herd number.  To be honest, there is no definitive way we will know that, but we will have the overall data about fertiliser flows.  We will seek to verify that data having regard to our risk-based controls under the nitrates action programme that my colleague Mr. Massey can speak about; under integrated controls division, ICD, cross-compliance checks; and also under the eco-schemes.  The matter must be considered in the round and when we look at all of the data together we will be in a better position to assess whether there is full compliance with the database.</p> <p>  It is in everyone's interests to have full compliance.  As part of our extension of the nitrates derogation we gave a commitment to the European Commission that we would have a national fertiliser database.  From our point of view, it has many other significant benefits as this national fertiliser database will seek to achieve many of the objectives we pursue relating to our environmental and climate ambitions.  We want a fully functioning system that is reliable and accurate.  We accept any new system needs a period of bedding-in and we need to build compliance.  We will actively engage with farmers.  We have made the system as simple as possible to try to encourage regulatory compliance.  We are learning as we go and are taking on board stakeholder views at our stakeholder committee.</p></speech>

It is a good phrase "to have a system that is fully functional, reliable and accurate".  I contend it is not possible to do that on a partitionist basis.</p> <p>  Finally, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, what interaction he has had at ministerial or official level with his sister department in the North.  Why have we not sought to roll this out on a co-ordinated all-Ireland basis which would resolve all of the issues I have raised?</p></speech>

I cannot speak on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who has responsibility for this area but I am sure he has discussed it with his counterparts as well.  Ultimately, Deputy Carthy would like to see this done on an all-island basis.  That would be the cleanest way to answer his points and it may happen in time, but for now we will work with the situation we have, in close co-operation and with the safeguards that have been outlined by Ms Byrne.  Obviously, it is a different jurisdiction and we cannot force them to participate, but detailed discussions have taken place and I believe they will be open to it in time.</p></speech>

The problem is some people will always try to circumvent some rules and the anomalies I have drawn attention to will allow that to happen, I would argue, fairly easily.  Yet the alternative does not bear thinking about - that we would put a hard border in place for this, which is something that would be used by political opponents.  We should only implement this aspect of the legislation when we have an all-Ireland framework in which it can operate.  I believe, unless the Minister tells me otherwise, this is one of those areas where there would not be political opposition from within the assembly or Executive if we ever get it back up and running and that the soundings from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs would be positive.  We are talking about an all-Ireland agricultural sector that is equally important in County Fermanagh as in County Monaghan.</p></speech>

We have not received any negative indications such that the Deputy said he would be concerned about.  They see merit in it.  Obviously we cannot preempt what future administrations up there might do.  Hopefully Stormont will resume sitting as soon as possible and have an active assembly that we can engage with more on a political level as well.  They definitely see that.</p> <p>  I make the point again that there are significant penalties that will focus the minds of the very few farmers the Deputy talks about who might consider trying to breach this.  I expect compliance to be positive but for those who do not comply, there are significant consequences.</p></speech>

We are in the hands of the Oireachtas.  As Minister of State I would not in any way preempt how long it might take for the Houses to pass this legislation.  However, we are all acutely aware, notwithstanding the concerns and challenges raised in the committee, of the impediment and the importance for farmers of passing this.  A number of eco-schemes are due to commence on 1 January 2023 which might not be able to commence if we do not have this legislation in place and those schemes give farmers a number of options around liming, fertiliser, fertiliser application and different elements.  Ideally we would like to see as much consensus as we can, resolve as many of the issues as we can and get the best possible solution to those that cannot be resolved, but ultimately we would like to get this legislation in place before the end of the year because that is critical.  We heard earlier about the timelines for the NVPS but that is not within our gift and I will not second guess the role of Members of the Houses.</p></speech>

There is one in my parish.  We need to apply nitrogen to that every six weeks to make sure the grass grows.  Otherwise the grass will not germinate on a continuous basis.  Sand-based pitches in the complex use a significant amount of fertiliser.  How does the derogation apply to that?</p></speech>

They have to register as users.  It depends whether the club purchases the fertiliser separately or if it is sold by the operator.  An operator might offer an overall package where the club pays X amount of money for the process and part of the cost is for the fertilser.</p><p>It is the same as a farmer dealing with a contractor in that the vast majority of farmers will sell fertiliser on their own account, the contractor will collect it in the co-op, and it will be paid and charged to the farmer.  In some limited instances, the contractor buys it or the local merchant has the contractor as part of it, and it is all one bill.  The contractor is the end user in that case.  It would depend on those circumstances for the GAA club and whether its members are buying the fertiliser themselves or whether they are the end user.</p></speech>

They are a club run by a parish and a parish entity.

As somebody who started out as a Deputy before pre-legislative scrutiny, the merit of this process I see is that we can tease through these issues and give absolute clarification before we get the legislative process underway properly.  I will come back to the committee and clarify the specific point in relation to GAA clubs and soccer clubs, if the Senator is happy with that for now.  This will clarify the differentiation between the likes of golf clubs, which are definitely commercial, and the others that are not.  We will provide the clarity as to exactly where that defining line is.</p></speech>

I see the relevance and the importance of the Bill and I welcome it.  We want to see it in action but there is a slight flaw in the sense that the register is going to record what a person purchases, not what is spread.  I can see the Northern Ireland Border issue being a problem.  It has been a problem throughout all our lives as where there is a border, there will always be something coming over or back across it that should not be and will never be recorded anywhere.  If we get down to the environmental issues, there is also the amount of fertiliser that is spread on a particular square meterage of land.  If you stockpile your fertiliser, if as a dairy farmer you have had a good year and you buy in a lot of fertiliser at the end of that year, nobody is ever going to know where or when it was spread or at what rate it was put on the land.  Again, if the Minister of State is doing his environmental calculations and I have 100 acres and I buy the standard equivalent amount of fertiliser as somebody with 100 acres would buy, how does he know I am not putting all of that fertiliser on 50 acres and none on the other 50?  From an environmental point of view, it is a problem that we will be recording what we purchase and not what we spread and where we spread it.</p></speech>

At the beginning of this process, there is a one-off opportunity or requirement of farmers to declare opening stock on their farm holding.  The opening stock of those dairy farmers who had a high income and may have purchased some fertiliser at the back end of the year will be recorded in the beginning of the next year and the process will be there for farmers to register that.  At the end of every year, there will be a closing stock record, we will also have the full detail of the sales and what was purchased from the merchants, and that will give the overall figure of what has been spread throughout the year.  We will have the opening stock, the closing stock and what has been purchased throughout that 12 month period as well.</p></speech>

In every process there are always ways in which people might try and get around it and that is the reason we will have an inspection regime and controls and measures in place to act as a deterrent.  What is also really important about this process is that it is easy to use.  We do not need to add layers of complexity and red tape for farmers.  We have to recognise also that this tool will be a big addition to farmers.  I say this as a farmer myself.</p></speech>

It is to all of our benefit that we do this and have a better handle on how much fertiliser is spread here.  We will definitely have a much clearer picture on that with this process in place than we have to date.</p> <p>  Also, the Senator talked about how much fertiliser is spread.  When we get this legislation in place before the end of the year, this mechanism will allow an eco-scheme that rewards farmers for precision spreading and make sure we are doing that better.  Looking at it in the round, everything we are doing cumulatively is about assisting farmers and it is to all farmers' benefit not only to have a better handle on this but that we see an improvement in water quality across our country and improved nitrate reviews down the line.  It is in all our benefit that we get this back the right way and I am confident the system will work well.</p></speech>

I would prefer if there was some way of monitoring what is actually spread rather than what is purchased.  With the border issue, there will be opportunities for a very intensive farmer, who will have a neighbour or family member who might not be near as intense, and they will put fertiliser on their register.  That potential is there.  I am not saying they will and I am not denigrating people or practices, but as long as you are only recording the purchase and not what is actually being spread on a particular holding, there are a few windows of opportunity there for it to be abused.</p></speech>

There will always be people who will try to exploit certain circumstances but as the Minister of State has said, that is why we have a system of on-the-spot inspections and on-farm controls.  Our inspectors go out on the ground to verify things are correct.  If the legislation progresses and we get the database in place, those controls will feed into that and verify the quality of the data we have in the database itself.  We are looking at risk-based controls at merchant level and at farm level to ensure we have a robust database that will deliver what it is intended to do.</p></speech>

Every year they are obliged to submit details on their fertiliser purchases and use, closing stocks and the like.  At the moment that imposes a significant burden on those farmers because they have to gather paperwork, go to their adviser and upload the information onto a system.  This new provision will streamline all of that and all of the data will be on the system.  The farmer will be able to look at the system and see what information is stored.  There will be a record of all purchases and the nutrient concentration in those purchases.  If we can get to a point where we have a reliable database, then we can say to farmers that there is now no need for them to engage in an administrative burden and paper-based record-keeping system.</p></speech>

We are saying this is a new system and we must bed it in.  The data will come into the national fertiliser database and, primarily, the information will be fed in by the fertiliser economic operators.  Let us walk before we run and over time the data will be given back to farmers.  At the moment the information is in the form of reports on the system.  As time progresses and once we have the system bedded in, we can then look at other opportunities for sharing that information.  A farmer will always get access to his own data and a merchant will always get access to the data on fertiliser that he or she sold.  Over time, that is where we want to get to so that the new system will be useful for farmers to use to inform their management decisions on their farms.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the various retrofitting schemes available, as well as district heating, which has been raised here in the last number of weeks.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the following representatives from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI: Ms Margie McCarthy, director of research and policy insights; and Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Byrne, director of national retrofit.  Both witnesses are welcome back.  We have met them before.  Ms Kerrie Sheehan, head of research and technology, is new to this committee.  She is very welcome.  Joining us online are Mr. Brian O'Mahony, head of national retrofit and community department; and Mr. John Randles, head of delivery.  They are also very welcome.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege.  I remind our guests of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>If their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on the campus do.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask any member joining us online, prior to making his or her contribution, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I ask Ms McCarthy to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined, as the Chair said, by my colleagues Dr. Byrne, Ms Sheehan, Mr. O'Mahony and Mr. Randles.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present our opening statement.</p> <p>  At the SEAI our purpose is to drive action in Ireland&rsquo;s clean energy revolution.  We are funded by the Government through the Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications and the Department of Transport.  We are catalysts for action through our data-driven actionable insights, our end user-focused grant and incentive programmes and through our capacity-building processes with and for citizens, communities, and the business and public sectors.  In 2022 our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.  Of this, &euro;267.2 million is allocated specifically to energy retrofits in homes and communities.</p> <p>  To set the context for the forthcoming discussion on retrofit and district heating, I note some figures from the national energy balance 2021 that was recently published by SEAI.  While our national energy budgets set a reduction target of 4.8% CO2 emissions per annum up to 2025, our energy emissions increased by 5.4% in 2021 and our renewable energy share for heat remains at under 7%.  Heat is responsible for a quarter of our emissions and its demand is 94% derived from fossil fuels.  The national heat study provides evidence that the pathway to decarbonisation for the heat sector with the least cumulative emissions deploys electric technologies.  This is critical to meeting our national targets.  Essential to our pathway is the deployment of district heating and heat pumps at scale and the backbone is the achievement of our renewable energy targets for electricity.  The EU and national legislation is clear that our net zero pathway is dependent on using less, namely, efficiency such as retrofit and using clean energy, meaning a shift to low carbon technologies such as district heating solutions.  Unprecedented effort is required on both of these to succeed.</p> <p>  The national heat study found up to 50% of our heat demand nationally could be met through district heating.  This is a proven technology that offers the benefit of decarbonisation and energy resilience.  In many cases, our mainland European neighbours that use district heating at scale have not experienced the price fluctuations currently in play.  We cannot afford to continue to support fossil fuel heating in our homes and businesses and a clear alternative must be prioritised to support this transition.  The Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications has established a working group on district heating that is due to report by the year end and the SEAI is closely supporting this work.  Ireland&rsquo;s challenge is to deliver this at a faster pace than experienced elsewhere but our opportunity is we can learn from well-established practices in district heating to do this well.</p> <p>  In February, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced the opening of the registration process for the new national home energy upgrade scheme, which offers substantially-increased grants for a typical B2 home energy upgrade, including enhanced grants for the installation of heat pumps.  The scheme offers a hassle-free home energy upgrade with One Stop Shops providing an end-to-end service.  To date, 12 suppliers have been registered and are active on the scheme and ten additional suppliers are at various stages in the registration process.  All registered suppliers have reported strong pipelines of work and increased conversion rates of inquiries to commitments.  Grant levels were also increased and harmonised across other SEAI retrofit schemes.</p><p>More than 36,000 applications have been received by the SEAI across our schemes and all are experiencing significant levels of demand from homeowners.  This equates to <font color="#333333">approximately 28,800 homes being retrofitted.  Typically, homeowners have a period of eight months to complete works once approval and there are constraints on delivery at the present time.</font><br/><br/><font color="#333333"> The warmer homes scheme is our main energy poverty scheme.  It operates under different conditions and constraints from our other schemes.  More than 3,200 homes have been delivered through the scheme to date in 2022. </font><br/><br/><font color="#333333"> As referenced when we met the committee in April, we are in unprecedented times and the national residential retrofit plan is experiencing many of the same challenges facing the wider economy, namely, inflation and supply chain constraints in terms of labour and materials.  While anecdotal information suggests that the material supply-chain constraints experienced immediately post Covid-19 have eased in recent months, many suppliers report difficulties in securing appropriate labour supply.  Also, the significant levels of inflation reported for some building products related to retrofit is a cause for concern.  The SEAI is acutely aware of the potential to further inflate specific markets by simply increasing grant levels.  Therefore, we have focused on attracting more contractors to participate in our schemes.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#333333"> The SEAI is delivering significant climate action.  Ireland&rsquo;s carbon-free future is dependent on efficiency actions and our pathway to the elimination of fossil fuels.  This task is not easy.  Critical to its success is Government support for the solutions required.  In the heat sector the key solutions have been identified and they marry approaches taken in other nations.  It means building on the current significant investments and commitments from Government.  We urgently need further actions and investments to support the widespread implementation of district heating, the necessary supports required to eliminate fossil fuels in our buildings and publication of a national heat policy approach.  The SEAI recognises the challenges ahead but is ready to play its part in supporting this national ambition.</font><br/><br/><font color="#333333"> Finally, our thanks to our colleagues in the Department of the </font>Environment, Climate and Communications for their continued support and close collaboration.  I welcome discussion with the committee, and my colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Do members agree to allowing exactly seven minutes for a back and forth interaction with our guests?  Agreed.  I will ask a few short questions before going through the list of people who wish to ask questions.</p> <p>  The opening statement contains a strong message about labour supply.  It is true that across the entire economy we have reached full employment.  What does the SEAI propose will increase labour supply?  Do we need to encourage people from overseas to work here in order to meet demand?  Does Ms McCarthy have a sense of the solution?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#E00400"><p>I thank the Chair for his question.  Labour supply is a common theme that has come from our contractors.</p> <p>  By way of context, our better energy homes scheme provides individual grants and we have more than 1,300 registered contractors.  Due to the publication of retrofit schemes, and the clear policy direction and funding put in place by the Government an increasing number of contractors have come back to the scheme.  Thus far to date this year an additional 328 contractors have joined the scheme relative to last year where we had 127.  Also, in our one-stop shops, we have 12 registered and another ten in the pipeline.  Other larger construction-type entities are looking into one-stop shops.</p> <p>  One of the areas that we will look to work on is apprenticeships.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has put in additional funding for apprenticeships and we will consider ways to customise apprenticeships slightly more.  For example, to qualify as a plumber one must undertake a four-year apprenticeship where one studies the full spectrum of plumbing works.  There is a lot of traction around the idea of having an apprenticeship specifically for a renewable installer. To be a heat-pump installer one needs some of the plumbing things but not all of them.  We need to consider whether we can compact the apprenticeship into that space a bit more and we are starting to look into that and seeing that as an option.</p> <p>   In regard to going abroad, we have had discussions with our colleagues in the Construction Industry Federation who have experienced the same thing and CIF has deep experience of going to other countries.</p><p>They also have deep experience of going to other countries.  Traditionally, we would have gone to eastern Europe but that is no longer available to us.  A lot of people left during Covid and did not come back, and a lot of the countries that we would have gone to are doing similar programmes.  We are talking about going further afield, if not quite into the Middle East, then further into eastern Europe, for example, Uzbekistan, Turkey and other places outside the EU.  Some of the interesting constraints are, first, visas to get people here and, second, accommodation when they do come here.  We are engaging with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, because it has practical experience.</p></speech>

On the warmer homes scheme, the target is 4,800 and Dr. Byrne said 3,200 homes had been done up to the end of September.  How many of those are to B2 or B2 equivalent?  I will ask Mr. Randles, our head of delivery, to address that question.</p></speech>

The first thing is to go in and assess the house for what needs to be completed, and it may just be attic or cavity wall insulation that fits the bill.  The new programme will definitely focus on the worst performing homes.  It was launched in mid-February and has changed the programme and given priority to Es, Fs and Gs which were more than likely to come up during construction to B2.</p></speech>

We did a full re-profile of our targets and budgets in July, a kind of mid-year profile.  On the basis of the information we had in July, we expect that we would get probably in the region of 25,000 homes done.  What we have seen since July is very strong demand across the programmes in regard to homes.  Our programmes are typically back in delivery in the sense that we will see a lot of programmes coming through in the last quarter of the year.</p></speech>

Going by the July profile, we expect to have in the region of 7,500 B2s done.  It varies slightly because we have an assumption model built into this in terms of which homes deliver B2, so we are seeing very strong demand in our solar programme, which delivers some B2s as well.</p></speech>

Of the 12 registered, we have delivered 1,270 home energy assessments and that has led to 637 works orders, which is increasing on a daily basis.  I will check this with my colleague but I think we have approximately 84 of those works orders completed and paid.  Mr. O'Mahony might confirm the number of works orders paid.</p></speech>

When the scheme started in March, we had to register the one-stop shops.  The homeowner journey is that they first do a home energy assessment and once they have completed that, the pathway to upgrading their home to at least B2 or better is laid out, and they can then make the decision about the works applications.  A way of looking at it is that there is a lag.  A criticism directed at me continually is that the numbers are not delivered yet but it is actually about getting up to speed and now, as Dr. Byrne mentioned, what has happened is that nearly 1,300 home energy assessments are completed.</p><p>Homeowners have made applications and more than 600 homes are in the process of completion, with 100 of them finished.  We expect that to continue into next year and beyond.</p></speech>

What rate of inflation is currently being reported in this sector?  Do the witnesses consider it to be a deterrent?  I know people for whom it is a deterrent.  They engaged but the cost of the work was beyond their expectation and their means.  What level of inflation is being reported on these works?</p></speech>

The first relates to the level of inflation in the wider construction sector.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland estimates there was approximately 7% to 8% inflation for the first half of the year.  The rate of inflation is indicated to be slowing down somewhat but we have not yet factored in energy costs in that regard.  Labour cost inflation is running at 5% to 10% but overall inflation in the past year and a half has been heading for approximately 22%.  Within the construction sector, the cost of certain products and materials has shot up way more than everything else but, on average, it is approximately 7% to 8% for the first half of the year.  That is the inflationary piece.</p></speech>

That is in place to protect homeowners against high electricity bills when running a heat pump in a non-insulated or leaky home.  The HLI study is to consider whether, with heat pump technology vastly improved and looking at varying home insulation, we could increase the HLI to allow a broader range of homes to go into it.  The study has commenced but it has not read out yet.  We have designed it to have readouts with milestones.  As such, even though the completion of the study may be two years down the road, we will have readouts in one year's time so that we can start to help to inform decisions on the matter.</p></speech>

We are now in an emergency situation, both in terms of the SEAI recording that our carbon emissions went up in 2021 - which is not surprising as we were coming out of Covid but, nonetheless, we want to see steady progress - and we have a price emergency.  In that context, should we be leaning all the schemes offered by the SEAI much more towards shallow work?  It strikes me that, at best, we will get to 30,000 homes under all its initiatives, whereas there are 2 million homes in the country and many of them are in very low BER categories.  Is this a time for focusing on shallow measures such as heat controls and cavity wall insulation?  I presume the SEAI has a fairly detailed picture of where in the country cavity walls exist - on which estates and in which generation of houses - and how many of them have had work done.  Could we make more of an impact quickly by using these more shallow methods?  Could we get a very early win, so to speak, by looking at all the housing stock and targeting the worst of it with the cheapest opportunities, be that attic insulation, cavity wall insulation, heat controls or smart meters where they have gone in?</p></speech>

It is a good point.</p><p>It is useful to tell the committee that we introduced grants of up to 80% for attics and cavities.  We have seen an increase of 280% year on year in terms of the number of people applying for those grants.</p><p> By way of background, over the past ten years we would have put in place somewhere in the region of 260,000 attic grants and 220,000 grants for cavities.  A significant amount, but not all, of the work has been done.  We have been asked about the shallow measures under the warmer homes scheme and whether we can do things more quickly due to the emerging situation.  Given the dynamics of the warmer homes scheme, approximately 30% of the applications are now suitable for shallow measures in terms of the surveys that have been done.  I will ask Mr. O'Mahony to comment on the wider piece on what is out there regarding homes.  Mr. Randles might comment on the warmer homes scheme and shallow measures.</p></speech>

Almost 1 million homes have ratings under the building energy regulation, BER, scheme.  We are able to draw conclusions as to the building stock across the wider country.  About 162,000 homes that are suitable have not had their cavity walls filled, that is, the shallow measure mentioned.</p></speech>

About 500,000 homes would be suitable for solid wall insulation.  That would be regarded as a deeper intervention.</p> <p>  In terms of roofs, about half of the homes in Ireland would benefit from further attic insulation.  The general rule of thumb would be that homes constructed from the early part of this century onwards are all modern and energy-efficient and homes constructed before that generally might need some improvement if that has not already been carried out.  In our schemes we have individual measures schemes, such as the better energy homes and solar PV schemes.  We have seen significant growth in the application rate for those scheme since March.</p></speech>

There is low-level opportunity.  If we know an area comprises homes built before 1960, we know where they are.  Why not use contractors to target every home in poorer energy estates to install cavity wall and attic insulation?  It would be very cheap to do and there could be a demonstration effect in older estates by doing a lot of work at one time.  The ambition for the midlands scheme was to go in and gather up everything.  I am worried that with a one-stop shop we are taking the best aggregators and putting them into the highest and most expensive realm of activity.  Should we not put aggregators into cheaper and quicker early win stuff?</p></speech>

The homeowner can choose what he or she wants to do.  He or she can choose to do one measure or many.  At the other end of the spectrum is the one-stop shop we mentioned, under which we want homes to reach B2 or better.  People have to carry out many measures to get to that uplift.  We also have community schemes.  We took the approach mentioned by the Deputy in the midlands scheme.  We tried to work with local authorities to upgrade homes in an area-based or aggregated approach.  The programme concludes this year.  We have not completed the scheme, but at this stage we can say there were challenges during Covid in terms of completing the homes.  There are also issues around getting into estates to generate interest with homeowners.  The community energy grant scheme or the better energy community scheme-----</p></speech>

The issue for me is scale.  We can do shallow retrofits at scale if we reorganise a little to drive them.  Most of the aggregators the SEAI is putting together will do very expensive long-term projects.  I worry a bit about the balance in the midst of the crisis we are in.</p></speech>

We deliver that in partnership with project co-ordinators who are usually connected to sustainable energy communities and local authorities.</p><p>We have seen that recently in Cork, where two housing estates have been upgraded, with local authority homeowners who were energy poor and private homeowners all upgraded.  In recent years, local authorities have been pushing all of those homeowners to go to B2 and the utilities are coming in to help bridge the gap for the homeowners to reach that B2 uplift.  That is actually happening.  What I am trying to explain is that we are doing everything.  We cannot just do one and concentrate wholly on an area-based approach.  We believe that is very important and that is why we are trialling different approaches, but we believe we need to be doing everything across the board, not only to deliver on our climate targets but also to help homeowners through this and future winters.</p></speech>

In a time of emergency, where resources are limited and there are constraints around the availability of construction workers to do this work, the focus must be on those homes where people are at risk of, or are already in, energy poverty and where the upgrades can be done quickly and efficiently.  That is one of the reasons the Social Democrats spoke repeatedly throughout the budget about solar energy.  Solar panels will see a reduction of 40% in energy usage, as will retrofitting, but it seems the focus is very much on the latter, which is much more expensive and takes an awful lot longer because it cannot be done as quickly.</p> <p>  On the warmer homes scheme, 3,200 homes have been delivered this year.  How many are on the waiting list and how many have actually qualified?  Some homes have already qualified for those grants but how many are on the list to be qualified and how long is the waiting list?</p></speech>

A change to the programme was announced in the middle of February this year whereby the prioritisation was for E, F or G rated homes first.  However, prior to that, we were heavily impacted by Covid so we have been clearing out the pre-Covid waiting list.  We are now moving on to applications and conducting surveys of applications that were made this year, from February onwards.  Overall, less than 30% of the homes are suitable for shallow measures such as cavity and wall insulation.  The poorer performing the home, the deeper the retrofit that is required.  It is the case that E, F or G rated homes tend to be in fairly bad condition and require a fair bit of intervention, possibly even a heating system.</p></speech>

When will that be made available?  My understanding is the scheme would be worth &euro;8 billion.  According to the statistics provided in the opening statement, 36,000 applications have been made to the one-stop shop.  How many of those are actually in progress and how many are waiting for information on a loan?  I would imagine the availability of a loan would be a determining factor for many people who want to get their homes retrofitted.</p></speech>

There is no waiting list on the other schemes <i>per se</i>.  We have a waiting list for the warmer homes scheme and the better energy homes scheme is an individual measures scheme.  We expect the low-cost loan to be in place in the first quarter of 2023.  We are working with our colleagues in the Department, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the European Investment Bank, EIB, on the modelling and are providing the background statistics and analysis to allow the risk people to finalise the details around the loans.</p><p>We have been working very closely with the Department and we expect and understand it will be available to consumers by the first quarter of the year.  The first tender or expression of interest has been done and there will be a second short-listing from which they will select the institutions that will be able to participate in the scheme.</p></speech>

Dr. Byrne spoke about the importance of data centres and how they could play a large part in the scheme.  Data centres will account for 30% of our electricity use by 2030 so they are a major part of the jigsaw.  I found it really interesting in his district heating report that Dr. Byrne did not know when trying to model it where they were, how much energy they were using or what size they were.  There were no locations available for him.  As the entity is data driven, as he says, the lack of transparency with data centres and all these issues around them would really undermine his ability to plan and look at reducing energy in that sector.  I want to make that comment because it is a major gap.</p></speech>

What is very important in capturing waste or surplus heat from data centres is that it is built into the design before a centre is constructed.  We know there is potential in Ireland at the moment to add in with data centres.  We have seen the success in Tallaght where this was built into the design right from the outset.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are at the moment, Ms Sheehan and I along with a number of others in the organisation are working very closely with the display energy certificate, DEC, on the working group.  Out of the heat study, essentially we have produced candidate areas of heat demand which are largely urban or town population areas.  The next step now is looking at where the key sources of heat are and where the anchor tenants are.  They are usually public buildings or large services within those zones.  That is the next stage.  What is really important in measuring feasibility with those is a national commitment to district heating.  I could not have said it more strongly than in the opening statement.  We really need a commitment to district heating and then a movement through it like electrification, or like the pace with which we built out the gas network.  That is how we will have to do it with district heating if we really want it to play a part.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses give a bit more information on the scope of that working group?

Until that point there was an assumption that the cost-effectiveness of district heating was in areas of higher heat density such as very heavily populated cities with a large number of consumers in a small area.  The heat study found the effective cost would allow us to use district heating in much smaller urban areas and towns throughout the country.  The climate action plan had identified a target of 2.7 TWh per year.  The impetus of the heat study was mentioned a number of times in the climate action plan as a key part of informing the next steps.  On the basis of what the heat study is telling us, the working group formed by the Department is looking at the various implications of rolling out district heating at pace throughout the country.  These implications are regulatory and financial and there is also the planning, research and innovation that will inform district heating zones.  These all feed into the group that is charged with identifying an action plan for district heating that stretches ambition in terms of the terawatt-hour over the year for district heating between now and 2030.  The SEAI is feeding into this with significant mapping information.  We are also about to launch feasibility studies in certain candidate areas.</p></speech>

The committee might follow up on the district heating system and the working group.  I am sure we will discuss it again.  I want to turn to the issue of deep retrofits.  On the previous occasion the SEAI was before the committee, the target was 500,000 homes with 75,000 homes per annum.  If I heard correctly, 25,000 homes have been done so far this year.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

This year our target is to bring 8,640 homes to a B2 rating.  We will have done 25,000 homes but not all will achieve the B2 rating.  The target is just shy of 27,000.  We reckon we will get very close to it when we look at the projections, but not all of them will achieve a B2 rating.</p></speech>

I want to refer back to district heating because we discovered last week as part of the energy and cost-of-living crises that the existing district heating schemes are not regulated by the CRU.  Did the SEAI know that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margie McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#M00900"><p>I refer to the definition of "district heating" and "communal heating" to begin with.  The regulatory position, which is part of what the working group is working on now, is the long-term situation and how regulation will play out as part of that discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#M01000"><p>So Ms McCarthy was aware that district heating schemes are not regulated by CRU.  The cost to the individual homeowner is about three times the cost she or I would pay, plus they cannot go to <i>bonkers.ie </i>and move to another supplier because they are tied in.  Was she aware of all of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margie McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#M01100"><p>To differentiate between a district heating network and communal heating, communal heating is where a heat source and the supply to the consumer is within the boundary of one property whereas district heating is an energy hub that feeds into a range of estates and properties.  That is where the district heating piece is coming into play.  We are aware of commercial rates being applied within certain communal heating schemes and we are involved in a feasibility study around protecting one such scheme, about which I ask my colleague, Ms Sheehan, to address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#M01200"><p>Because we are all stuck for time, I want to make the point that the definition of one versus the other should be clarified because thousands of people, particularly those living in apartments, are being subjected to punitive rates of energy costs and they do not have the option to go to <i>bonkers.ie</i>and move supplier, which is serious.  If the SEAI can make any progress in developing that, it would be very useful.</p><p>The other aspect I am intrigued by is the target number of retrofitted homes.  I am aware other members have asked about this.  To achieve the target of 500,000 homes retrofitted by 2030, it would mean 60,000 to 70,000 homes would have to be retrofitted per year, and we are falling short of that.  In addition, we are coming up against the problem of contractors and labour not being available.  I will describe the situation as I see it as someone who represents a constituency of mixed types of incomes within it.  The one-stop shop is great if a person has a hefty income to be able to pay upfront for deep retrofitting and can apply for all the grants.</p><p>To avail of it, however, a person has to be well-off financially and able to pay the money upfront.</p><p> The warmer homes scheme is great if one is on fuel allowance and gets one's house done for free by the State or through the SEAI.  I found out recently that the waiting time for those on the list was two years but the witnesses have told us it is more than that; it is 28 months.  In the budget, the Government extended fuel allowance to thousands more people, including the over-70s.  They are going to be applying to the warmer homes scheme and that will push up the waiting time.  Those people are over 70 already and it will be two or three years before they get a sniff at the scheme.  Problems are being piled on top of problems.</p><p> Another problem I see coming down the tracks is that of individual energy upgrades.  A contractor has written to us to say that it can currently apply directly to the SEAI for a grant to carry out attic insulation, wall cavity insulation, external wall insulation, internal wall insulation, ventilation or the installation of mechanical fans if the applicant signs a form consenting to the contractor making the application.  From 1 January, that will change.  Contractors will no longer be able to apply for the grant; the individual seeking to have the work done will have to do so.  That leaves a cohort of people in the middle who account for the vast majority of homes.  Median earners - those who are not very wealthy or very poor but work for an average industrial wage - will need to have &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 upfront before being entitled to anything at all.  This is ridiculously punitive and unhelpful.  Obviously, we are in a cost-of-living crisis and those people do not have those sums of money.  Their energy costs are spiralling out of control, yet from 1 January the SEAI will make it more difficult for them to do something about that.  I am dealing with people in that situation.  For example, there is a lone parent with two children who lives in a corner house on Ballyfermot Parade and earns &euro;35,000 a year.  The one-stop shop is no good to her as she does not have the money to go to it.  The warmer homes scheme is not available to her.  She is stuck in the middle and she does not have &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 to pay upfront to have work done to her home.  She is typical of many people.  What is the rationale for that decision?  Is it that the SEAI does not really want people to access the scheme because it does not have enough people to work on it and does not have an apprenticeship scheme set up?  An apprenticeship scheme should have been set up years ago.</p></speech>

We are also fully alert to the changes made in the budget and the impact they may have.</p> <p>  The other issue raised by the Deputy relates to the energy efficiency obligation scheme and it is a change in policy in terms of moving towards deeper measures.  It has been well flagged to the industry for the past year and a half to two years.  The Deputy described the potential local impact of that.  I will ask Mr. Randles to provide more detail in respect of the Deputy's query.</p></speech>

The energy supplier applies on behalf of the homeowner to the better energy homes programme.  That makes it less cumbersome for and potentially more attractive to the homeowner because the contractor or energy supplier is doing all the work.  The homeowner just pays the net price, less the grant and any discount leveraged by the EEOS, directly to the contractor.  The energy supplier applies for the grant and we submit the grant to the energy supplier which, in turn, pays the contractor.  Unfortunately, a group of contractors that works for a particular energy supplier has decided it will no longer participate in this from 1 January.  That is what the Deputy is referencing.  Other energy suppliers will continue but she is referencing a particular contractor that works directly for an energy supplier and has decided to cease working on smaller measures.  That is what happened there.</p></speech>

This contractor has been informed by the SEAI - I have this in writing here in front of me - that changes to the individual energy upgrade grants to come into effect on 1 January 2023 will mean that the homeowner is liable for the full cost of the works upfront.</p><p>That is what I am referencing.</p></speech>

We are probably talking about a traditional or heritage build.  There may be issues around the type of materials that can be used.  They would not be the same as the materials that can be used in a building constructed from concrete or timber.  I would advise to get a home energy assessment and understand the pathway to upgrading, and options will be presented to the homeowner.</p></speech>

The window replacement is part of the overall fabric package to get a homeowner to a B2 level.  I do not want to teach the Chair how to suck eggs, but most of the heat is lost through the roof of a house, followed by the walls and then, to a much lesser extent, the windows and doors.  We have included windows and doors as part of the overall package for B2 measures.  There are significant grants available for window replacement.</p></speech>

It is typically walls that are performing worse and to do windows in isolation means homeowners end up with fantastic windows, but it is like putting a Porsche engine into a Mini.  If the windows are replaced without insulating the wall, the necessary impact is not achieved.</p></speech>

I want to give Ms McCarthy and Ms Sheehan more time because they did not have much time earlier.</p><p>I am interested in the distinction between communal and district heating, on which they were clear.  This is something we do not talk about.  I will let Ms McCarthy and Ms Sheehan talk more about it.  I am interested in the opportunities we have in that regard.  Ms McCarthy might also refer to the heat study published this year.</p></speech>

The hypothetical stone cottage in west Cork is a good entry point.  The heat study recommends and highlights the two key solutions to decarbonising our heat sector for homes in Ireland.  The installation of heat pumps is likely to occur in detached, rural, oil-fuelled homes and district heating is more for homes in towns, villages and cities.  The heat study looked at the costs.  I spoke about heat density and we were at a much higher figure in that quite a big population demand was needed in a small area for it to be cost effective.  What the heat study did was show us that we can actually cover much larger and less densely populated areas quite effectively with district heating.  We can see this is being done really well across Scandinavian and Nordic countries.</p> <p>  To address some of the questions asked earlier, what is really important is that district heating is agnostic to the fuel type.  We are not necessarily talking about being tied into any specific fuel.  The advantage we have, and what we are seeing in Europe, is that district heating networks are not being affected by price fluctuations in the same way as we are being affected by being tied into various fossil fuel sources.  That is a really important piece for us to learn from because we are starting out with district heating.</p> <p>  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned, we have some communal heating pieces.  We do not have district heating at a large scale.  We are just about to launch two new schemes in Tallaght and, I hope, Dublin city centre.  These will show us how effective it can be to have decarbonised fuel sources in them.</p> <p>  What we have done in the heat study is use the information we had initially.  We are now identifying how many candidate areas are available to us to get to the target of 2.7 TWh per year.  That is our next step.  If we think about it, that is a 2-D map.  What we then need to do is look at the feasibility study, which involves considering whether there are rivers to cross and mountains to get over or whether there are real financial issues with a particular area.  I will hand over to Ms Sheehan to speak about how we are supporting that feasibility work.</p></speech>

We have to do it very fast and we have to get roll-out to get our targets and decarbonised heat, in which Ireland is a laggard at the moment.</p> <p>  From a practical point of view, the national heat study showed that just over 50% of heat could be achieved through district heating.  Ireland currently has 1% through district heating.  That was assuming all things were equal, however.  Building on that and challenging each of the assumptions of that particular calculation, we have done further work to identify candidate areas around Ireland.  It is basically a heat map, if one were to look at it.  Again, there are assumptions with any of these things.  This then informs us on where to delve further.  If we think of the darker colour of where there is higher density of demand or load, then we need to get to those individual areas.  That is where the feasibility comes into this.</p> <p>  We have a few prongs on this.  One is what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith spoke about, which is a particular site that is using gas for the communal heating system.  We are looking at the feasibility of decarbonising that.  At the same time, we are looking into parameters for a scheme, or enhancing a scheme, to fund feasibility studies into the future.  Then, to inform that, we are conducting our own three-sample feasibility studies.  What these are looking at when they go down is-----</p></speech>

That is very helpful, however.  We will probably have time to come back to this discussion.  I call Senator Boylan.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Rourke spoke about the attic insulation figures, and Deputies Bruton and Whitmore spoke about the idea of shallow retrofitting.</p><p>Is it not true that attic insulation really fell off a cliff from 2011 to 2019?  What was the rationale for that?  Was it Government policy?  Was it a change in the grants that were available?  We have figures to the effect that 51,577 attics were insulated in 2011 whereas in 2019, it was 7,562.  What explains that significant cliff edge?  Was it Government policy?  Was it a change in behavioural attitudes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Q00200"><p>I am looking at the same figures because we gave the committee those figures.  It is quite significant.  There are two parts to this.  At that time, the schemes opened when we were in a recessionary period.  A home renovation incentive was also put in place.  From looking at the figures, it has decreased over a period.  There has been no significant change in Government policy that would impact attic insulation in that way.  Grant levels had remained static for quite a number of years prior to their uplift earlier in the year.  It is not, therefore, entirely clear to us.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to give some insight into why that may be.  As the Senator said, however, there may be a behavioural element to this.  People were focused elsewhere, particularly during the earlier part of it.  Significant work was done during the recession but it tapered off at the tailback of the recession when the construction industry definitely shrank in size.</p></speech>

The SEAI noticed that this was happening and there was this drop-off in interest.  Was anything being done at an SEAI level to ask whether we need to encourage people to continue to do this?  If we had continued on the trajectory we were on in 2011, a significant number of emissions would have been saved had people continued to get their attics insulated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.547" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Q00400"><p>When we look back over the previous decade, as the Senator said, we would have seen a drop-off.  A number of changes were made to the scheme whereby some of the grants were adjusted.  As the Senator said, it was a very successful initial two-year period of what I believe at the time was called the home energy saving scheme.</p> <p>  What happened over time, as Dr. Byrne mentioned, is that people's perspectives and viewpoints changed coming out of the recession.  There was, therefore, a behavioural aspect to this.  In the last number of years, we have changed our focus to try to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A discussion is happening today about shallow versus deep retrofitting.  However, we are not only focused on this winter but on those in ten years' time or in 2050, by which time we want to have zero emissions in our residential sector.</p> <p>  There was a change approximately ten years ago.  Since just before Covid-19 happened, however, we saw the numbers start to build again.  There was a pause during Covid-19 but it has recovered rapidly this year.  When we look into the supply chain, we see that the supply chain is responding and doing a really good job.  There is a lag between when a homeowner is interested and when the supply chain can respond, but suppliers are doing that.  We are now seeing capacity starting to be added.</p></speech>

There is a move to these more complex, deep measures rather than looking at the more shallow measures.  The hub controller is one measure that was brought to my attention.  My understanding is that this is smart technology that actively integrates with the boiler.  Two different analyses on the hub controller, one of which was carried by the SEAI, found a decrease of between 30% and 36% on household bills.  Some 12,000 household have this hub controller fitted.  It is quite cheap at a cost &euro;300 or &euro;400.  The company was installing it for free in households and it was then getting that grant back.  Is it true that this sort of measure will now no longer be eligible for the energy efficiency obligation scheme?  Households will, therefore, be losing out.  It seems to me that if we can reduce household bills by 36% for something so cheap, we should extend that measure for a little while when we are in a cost-of-living crisis.</p></speech>

The Senator referenced the energy efficiency obligation scheme.  We looked at that and at the underpinning policies around it, which are shifting towards deeper measures and bigger packages of measures.  Again, the eye is not on the immediate future but on 2030 to 2050.</p> <p>  What has happened in a broader sense is that we are in a particular environment right now that is kind of mature.  We look at policy and the length of time it takes with the energy efficiency obligation scheme and the consultation and that entire process.  Events then catch up with us, as they say.</p><p> We are in the middle of an energy crisis.  People would not have predicted at the start and the changes to the energy efficiency obligation scheme, EEOS, policy and obligations.  We are in a switch towards deeper measures.  I refer to Deputy Smith's comments.  One of the contractors was doing shallower measures.  A commercial decision made by one of the energy partners to move into deeper measures has led to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.551" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#R00200"><p>I understand we want to get the deep retrofit but we are where we are, to use that awful phrase.  People are really struggling to pay their bills.  If there is a system that can reduce people's bills by 36% and it costs &euro;300 or &euro;400, and if we want to shift the energy efficiency obligation scheme away from that, are there short-term measures where we can ensure these households get these types of short-term measures which could make a very significant difference to their bills?</p></speech>

We have obviously dealt with the situation referenced by Deputy Smith and we are aware of the contractors.  We are looking at that ourselves and are asking how we can package up our grants.  We have a menu of grants.  How can we incentivise those grants in slightly different ways to ensure the people doing those works can continue in as close a fashion as possible?  Some of the energy partners are moving to those deeper measures.  Those are commercial decisions they are making in looking at the long-term market.  At the SEAI level, we are asking how we can change things from our side of it to make it more attractive to keep implementing these measures.  We have had engagement in terms of looking at the likes of heating controls and at whether we can get another package of grants to help people to understand their energy usage better and things like that.  It is almost a bit like Ryanair where you pull things together and you might give a different grant if you get a certain measure but aiming at the shallower measures.  </p> <p>  I might ask Mr. O'Mahony to comment at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#R00400"><p>I was not directly involved in that study on the hub.  My understanding is focused not on the energy-poor sector but those heating controls are still eligible for support today.  I refer to the better energy homes and the individual measures.  Home owners can do just one measure if they wish.  That is really important.  We are still focusing on that.  We are also pivoting our programmes to look to the future.</p> <p>  Regarding those shallow measures, there has been discussion today about cavity and attic insulation and heating controls.  I will take the example of attic and cavity insulation.  If you take a typical terrace or end of terrace home that needs an upgrade for attic and cavity, it would cost in the range of about &euro;2,500 to &euro;3000 to do both of those measures.  The grant is about &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500, depending on the house type.  Often somebody needs to find up to &euro;1,000 and that can be a challenge for some people at the moment.  We recognise that.  We do not have the loan scheme in place but if you go to the credit union and borrow &euro;500 at 7% to do one measure, over one year it would cost about &euro;43 per month to pay for that upgrade.  However, the energy savings you would see this winter and next winter would be about half of that.  You would get about &euro;25 to &euro;40 per month benefit.  There are options available for people.  We recognise that and we need to respond and help them.  That is why when you look at the individual measure scheme or the better energy homes, you will see the supports are much higher for those shallow measures.  We are still trying to support that sector.  As my colleague, Mr. Randles, mentioned, we have seen almost a tripling of the activity in that sector.  That sector has grown tremendously this year and we expect that next year, it will grow tremendously as well.  However, we need to be realistic.  The sector is not going to grow by ten times overnight.  It will take a couple of months to get there but we are growing and we are on that pathway to grow for both the shallow measures and the deeper measures.</p></speech>

I am thinking about people in my own constituency who are worried about the little district in their own home and they cannot put the heat on in the kitchen and the sitting room at the same time or they have to deal with cold bedrooms.  I know there is a pilot scheme in Tallaght running off a data centre.  I would not like district heating to be some kind of a ruse to get more data centres.  However, I would like to ask the witnesses how they are communicating with communities that might be looked upon favourably for district heating.  What can we do to make sure they are not wasting their time and money applying for heat pumps, upgrading homes or whatever?</p><p> The last time the witnesses were before the committee, they said they were working on an energy security emergency group, ESEG, and working on vulnerable household schemes.  I would like to hear about how that is progressing.  The SEAI also hosts energy clinics where people can drop in if they have queries.  I would like to get feedback about that as well, because the communication and messaging has not been great.  Many people who are financially vulnerable as well might look upon these things and say they cannot afford it and there is no point in even applying for it.  I would be interested in the outreach on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned people struggling at the moment in their homes.  Some homes have already adopted a number of the measures recommended through Reduce Your Use.  We recognise that some are living with 19&deg;C heat already and struggling with that.  We take that on board.  The Reduce Your Use campaign is very focused on behavioural changes that can be made that could allow savings of between 10 to 15% on energy costs.  If some measures around heat controls or servicing a fossil fuel boiler are added in, these are all things that can add up to a 20% saving.  Getting that message out has been a key part of what the SEAI is doing.  The Deputy mentioned communications with communities.  A lot of what we are doing is speaking to people on the ground through the sustainable energy communities, SECs.  Even our phone calls are up significantly.  I think Mr. Randles can give us a number if we want one, but they are up by significant multiples.  Much of that advice is what can be done behaviourally before ever taking a penny out of your purse to try to make a retrofit change.</p></speech>

It is about finding the most cost-effective heat source in any particular zone.  What we have done is identify zones where there is good heat density.  The next step is to start to identify where the best heat sources are.  That could be anything, for example, geothermal, biomass, heat pumps or industry waste heat like that from data centres.  The Deputy mentioned, for example, that has been really effective in Tallaght.  Already, we can see they are adopting thermal storage on that site, which allows for greater flexibility in the system.  If we achieve district heating throughout the country and thermal storage within each of those energy hubs, we then start giving some flexibility back to the grid.  All of that plays its part.

It is great to be made to feel welcome.  I also welcome the guests.  This has been very useful.  I will talk about Carlinn Hall, a community heating system in Dundalk.  It includes 200-odd houses.  Initially it was biomass.  There have been many twists and turns but it was replaced by gas when gas was cheap and gas is no longer cheap so that is a disaster scenario.  It is not a good environmental situation either.  There has been a fair amount of engagement between myself, the management company, Frontline which provides the heat which buys from Energia.  There have been some dealings with the likes of the eco village in Cloughjordan to try to come up with efficiencies.  That is all good stuff.  The only real long-term solution is switching to some type of biomass, perhaps woodchip, or geothermal.  The SEAI was talking about a feasibility study.  I assume that is where it is.  Can we get into some detail about that?  I am interested too in specifics about the grant structure that would pay for it.  The way I see this working in the short term, unless something changes, is that while Frontline was happy enough to buy heat from anyone to a degree, the only way it would be feasible would be for a company to come in and do it and a management company, which was really the residents, would have to come to a deal with them.  They would be on the hook financially and they would basically be signing in blood.  That might be the only way to deliver a solution.  I am taking up time that SEAI could be filling with information.</p></speech>

We are not at the point where I could give the Deputy a solution now but we have started it.  We are also working directly with the related people.  We are looking at it from the geothermal aspect.  We might have to do more subsequently but that is what the study is now.</p></speech>

Am I correct that there a similar project that has used geothermal?  Could Ms Sheehan go into a bit of detail on that?  My understanding is that for this to work you could be talking about going down 2.5 km.  Once you go down that far it is free but I imagine there is a significant cost in doing that work.</p></speech>

It is site specific.  They have to do the exploration to determine how far down they need to go.  The heat study said further work was needed beyond 400 m to really understand Ireland's capacity to contribute from geothermal.  We will be focusing on this site in particular to determine that.</p></speech>

I should have mentioned earlier in response to a question on district heating areas that Cloughjordan is a good example.  That is to go back to the Deputy's comment on a good advisory to the particular situation in Carlinn Hall.</p> <p>  In terms of geothermal feeding into district, we are not aware of it currently but we can certainly check that.  We have a team who are experts in terms of the geothermal side.  The national heat study pointed to the fact that we did not have sufficient geothermal data yet to be able to fully realise its potential in the study and playing into district heating.  The Geological Survey of Ireland has been doing additional work and would see significant potential for geothermal, and it could be very cost-effective, in particular in a larger district heating area in a very urbanised area.</p></speech>

The prices have gone up recently.  I have been inundated with communications from people.  In fairness, Frontline dropped its price around 14 June to 32.9 cent per kilowatt hour, which was a spectacularly high price at one stage, but at that time it was a reduction.  From 12 October it is back up to 42 cent.  Frontline is looking at billing monthly so there is even a slight increase in its standing charge.  According to Frontline, it does not make any money from selling the heat but only from maintenance and in other areas.  Two things need to come into play as a short-term mitigation.  That is how we can get the electricity credits to those people in some way, shape of form, and then possibly by looking at Frontline from a business support point of view once the support funding for energy costs is passed on to the people who live in Carlinn Hall and equivalent estates.</p></speech>

We are all looking at what could be a very nasty winter, especially cost-wise.</p> <p>  I expect that Ms McCarthy is engaging with the task force on district and communal heating systems.  Such systems only really happen in Britain and Ireland.  The rules have been changed in Britain in order that this cannot happen.  I imagine we are looking at planning regulations that would put a curb on this.  My fear, which is based on what I have been told by Frontline, is that developers are continuing with these types of build.  That is something we would need to get knocked on the head as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses stand over the figure of a 36% for the reduction in heating need?  That seems a very significant reduction for the very low cost that is involved.  The witnesses referred to an 80% grant for attic and wall insulation, but if there is that sort of saving to be gleaned from heat controls at such a low price, it would seem justified to promote heat controls perhaps with the 80% support.</p></speech>

It also separates the water heating from the central heating.  It is about heat management and resource management rather than about actually saving energy.  It supports the behavioural aspect around heating, such as by having better thermostats in the home.  That is what it is all about, but fundamentally the grants are still available for heating controls and they continue to be available.</p></speech>

In regard to heating controls, typically what they do is help to manage the heat, as Mr. Randles mentioned.  They can lead to energy efficiency savings.  They are still an eligible measure and they have a place in helping people to save money.  We completely agree with that, but one thing that can happen is that the level of savings depends completely on the starting point, the level of insulation and energy performance of the home.  Many times with these types of controllers and measures people propose, they look at the energy savings from a theoretical perspective and they may see a BER improvement of 36% or an energy performance improvement of 36%.  However, in programmes, we also take into account the comfort aspect and behavioural aspect.  This is because what can happen is, when somebody does an intervention in their home, such as attic insulation, cavity wall insulation, retrofit or heating controls, they sometimes take some of those savings in improving the comfort of their home.  Instead of their home being very cold, therefore, they may heat more of the rooms more frequently.  We always have to take account of that when looking at the energy savings delivered.</p></speech>

I did contact it before about this issue and I did not get to bottom it out satisfactorily, so I would appreciate a response on that.

If the SEAI is going to correct for that, it would be correcting for that right across all its saving predictions.</p> <p>  I would like to go back to the other issue the SEAI representatives raised, which was about these obligated entities.  What exactly are their commitments now?  I was surprised to hear the witnesses say these entities could decide for commercial reasons that they were moving out of one area and into another.  I thought this was an obligation we put on them in lieu of their fossil fuel use, that they had a certain obligation.  In that context, I would be interested to know if we can put obligations on, for example, generators such as wind generators, which are making very substantial windfall gains, to do something around demand management?  How flexible is that tool of obligations?</p><p> We have seen significant changes in the relative cost of fuels, such as heating oil, which has gone up by 73% in the past 12 months.  Solid fuels have gone up by 32%.  Electricity is around the same at 38%.  Natural gas has gone up by 60%.  Is this having a noticeable effect on the choices that people make?  In general, we would not like to see more people using solid fuels as a response to the energy crisis.  Is that something that we should be aware of as a risk?</p></speech>

The key part of that is an obligation that is put on energy providers to help their customers to reduce their energy use.  The key tenets of the scheme are that they have moved from shallower measures to deeper measures, so they now have to have a minimum of 100 kWh uplift.  That is the crux of the issue, that the energy partner for each home has to have a minimum uplift in terms of the energy performance of the home-----</p></speech>

We talk about shallower measures, namely, attics, cavity walls and heating controls, and these typically do not achieve that 100 kWh uplift.  As a result, the energy partners are moving their focus across to the package of deeper measures.  The three I have mentioned are included in the package of deeper measures, but they must do more.  That is where particular matters come back into play in terms of making decisions about how they will achieve their obligations.  As I said, attics, cavity walls and the heat pumps were what they had done.  They had received energy credits for each of those, but they now have to go into deeper measures.  That is the context of the changes that are taking place.  That was a policy decision and it would have been well discussed, put out to consultation, etc.  It was flagged well in advance and will be implemented on 1 January.</p> <p>  I do not have visibility in respect of the flexibility of the energy efficiency obligations, but it is a reasonable proposition that the scope of energy providers is widened to include obligated parties.  Ultimately, that will be a matter for the Government and the Department, as opposed to ourselves.</p></speech>

That scheme  was due to be in place by the second quarter but I am not sure if it is up and running yet.  I do not think it is.  Can the SEAI indicate when it will be up and running?  Will batteries and inverters be included in that scheme in order that those homeowners can continue to use their stored electricity, even if there is a cut-off or a blackout?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

We are in progress with that scheme.  We have submitted and completed a business case, we have worked with the Department on that and we are finalising the legal elements of the scheme with our partner providers.  As soon as we have those bottomed out, we will be rolling it out and we will be putting pressure on.  The quarter 2 timeline for deliverables was probably somewhat ambitious because this work is in addition to everybody's existing tasks.  There are obligations on energy providers.  This is not an obligation on them; it is a co-operative piece.  That is why it has taken somewhat longer than we would have anticipated.  We are close to rolling it out now.</p> <p>  On the second question, inverters are being included in the package.  Batteries are not being included because of the cost relative to the benefits of involved.</p></speech>

It is about the level of resources that the SEAI has and the new programmes that are being put in place.  There was an announcement just before the budget in respect of Solar Schools.  It was thought that all schools - primary and secondary - would get free solar panels.  I had assumed that these would be rolled out through the SEAI because it already rolls out the pathfinder programme for schools.  Has it done any work on programme?  What timeframes are we looking at?  Was there money allocated in the budget for the SEAI to do that?</p></speech>

We will be integral in rolling out any programme because, as the Deputy said, we have experience in terms of the grants.</p></speech>

I will have to revert to the committee on it because it would be the responsibility of the other part of the SEAI, the public sector business team.  We can come back to the Deputy with an update on that.</p></speech>

It  has been running for a number of years and has done an average of nine schools per year, so putting solar panels on every single school in the country seems very ambitious.  I presume the SEAI would need additional resources to run a major programme like that.</p></speech>

Again, I do not have exact details but I understand there are somewhere in the region of 3,200 national schools and not quite as many secondary schools.  We are talking about a significant number of buildings.  Ultimately, we are leaning into a solar energy sector which, as my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, said, is scaling up.  When we launched the original domestic solar grants in 2012 or 2013 there were only seven or eight providers.  We have about 130 solar providers at the moment and we would want to see a significant scaling up of that sector, which we are seeing at the present time.  Obviously, additional resources would be required.</p></speech>

One could install solar on a roof in a matter of one or two days and that can reduce energy use by up to 40%.  In parallel, one could do a retrofit which could take months, cost an average of between &euro;60,000 and &euro;70,000 and only reduce energy use by 40%.  Why is there such a focus on retrofitting?  Should that focus be changed now so that there is more of an emphasis on solar?  Solar technology has improved and the cost of installation has improved.  Should we be seeing a switch in our focus?  Dr. Byrne made reference to &euro;240 million for retrofitting this year.  My understanding is that the budget for solar is &euro;14 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We seem to be putting a lot of investment into the slower and more resource-heavy end of things, rather than in solar which would give us a quicker win.</p></speech>

In the retrofit programme, we have a fabric-first approach which involves getting the fabric structure of the home correct so that whatever the source of heat, less is being used because the fabric of the home has been improved.  When we get to that point, we then move to the use of renewable technologies, including heat pumps and solar.  Solar power will provide electricity and hot water but it will do nothing for the heating of the home.  Approximately 80% of energy usage in the home is for heating the water and the space.  We do not want to conflate the two issues.  The SEAI is very keen to ensure that people follow through and focus on the retrofit because while we are in an immediate crisis now, we must also look to 2030 and 2050.  We want to make sure that the overarching fabric of people's homes is correct.  I will ask my colleague Mr. O'Mahony-----</p></speech>

I do not know whether my thinking is correct here but if one is generating one's own electricity and one's own energy through solar, even if one is wasting some of it because one's home has a B or C BER, from an emissions perspective that does not matter.  One is generating one's own electricity while not adding to our carbon emissions.  In that context, is our focus wrong?  Should we not be saying to people that they can generate their own emissions-free solar energy, greatly reduce their energy costs and do so more quickly and more cheaply?  If it is cheaper for the State to help them to do that, should that not be our focus?</p></speech>

It is definitely a question of balance.  The heat study spoke to the shift in focus to decarbonisation in buildings, leading to the elimination of fossil fuels.  We talked earlier about the heat loss indicator playing its part in the installation of heat pumps and getting that to the right level so that houses can still run their heating systems cost effectively.  It comes down to what part solar can play in terms of its effect on energy use.  As Dr. Byrne mentioned, it will not play as big a part in heating which is a big energy use in the home.  What we are trying to do, on the back of the heat study and in the context of a cost-optimal approach, is to encourage people to get their homes to a fabric level that allows them to decarbonise to non-fossil-fuel use.  Does Mr. O'Mahony want to come in on the solar piece?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Y00100"><p>Solar PV is a fantastic technology and we have seen the market in Ireland grow from 13 companies to over 150 now.  We are seeing solar panels in many homes, businesses and communities in Ireland.  We support solar technology in individual schemes, community energy grant schemes and the business scheme that we have now.  It has a part to play.  When one looks at a typical home, as was mentioned, approximately three quarters of the energy used is for heat and one quarter is for electricity.  When one looks at that from a cost perspective at the moment, with electricity, oil and gas prices increasing, anywhere from one third to one half of someone's overall energy bill may be for electricity.  Solar PV can potentially contribute in the region of one third of that.  It can seem like this is what we should be putting all of our efforts into and scaling up.  What is actually happening is that the solar market is growing really quickly.  We have seen more than 40% growth year on year.  That is essentially down to home owners who see what we call its kerb-side appeal.  The solar market has a role to play but the harder effort is to get people to insulate their homes.  The insulation in walls, in attics and in the boilers that people look at once a year, at most, are much more difficult and are the areas where we have to support home owners, businesses and communities to transition.  Solar PV definitely has a place but it does not lead to the same decarbonisation or energy bill reduction that a retrofit provides.  It definitely has a place and that is why it is part of our schemes.  We see it as way of bringing people to the SEAI and putting them on the road to decarbonising their homes.  The same applies with schools.  Solar PV has a role to play in schools and through the community energy grant scheme we have supported some schools to install solar PV, along with energy monitoring, so that we can engage with both the schools and the students.</p></speech>

District heating is really where that question comes into play because fabric efficiency is not so essential in the context of a district heating network source.  Fabric efficiency becomes much more about the comfort and well-being in the home as opposed to decarbonisation.  If we can roll that out in a quicker way, it will answer that question.</p></speech>

Solar is not perfect, and people would also need to do retrofitting.  If, however, we are trying to help people this winter and next, the quickest way to do that is through pushing the solar option, particularly for those who cannot afford it.  I refer to people who would be eligible for the warmer homes scheme.  That scheme does not include solar which is a missed opportunity.  That scheme should be providing free solar for those homes as well.  People need to feel the benefit in their pocket and solar is a really quick way of doing that.</p></speech>

One cannot say that district heating is plug and play because the infrastructural requirements are so large in terms of the main transmission lines but for the homeowner, the oil or gas boiler could be replaced with a heat exchanger.  That pumps heat into the home.  The demand continues to increase if one does not have an efficient home, so it is important to have efficiency.  In terms of getting the homeowner on a route to decarbonisation, a simple connection into the home is required once the network is in place.  The homeowner is no longer using fossil fuels for what is a significant energy use in the home.</p></speech>

There are questions about what they see as shifting goalposts in respect of the guidelines that are coming in.  Are the witnesses aware of that issue?  Has it been resolved?  Has there been a good uptake on the scheme for businesses and others this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Z01000"><p>The short answer is that we are aware of the issue.  For any sort of a policy change, when we come closer to the time of implementation, changes are made.  Those changes relate to the level of solar grant support under the better energy communities scheme.  We have a number of projects in and we are looking favourably on projects that have solar in their application and can be completed this year.  We have been working with the Department and taking a fairly flexible approach.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to give the Deputy a tiny bit more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Z01100"><p>There has been no changing of the goalposts.  The guidelines specifically state that solar photovoltaic, PV, panels must be installed by the end of the year.  The original intent in that respect was that the small-scale generation scheme would be deployed.  There is not going to be an overlap between the two schemes and there is going to be a gap.  The Department is considering that at the moment and updating the guidelines.</p> <p>  From the perspective of the industry, the second point relates to planning.  The planning guidelines were changed last week to allow for more rapid installation.  We have approximately 10 MW of solar PV supported through the communities energy grant scheme.  We are aware of another 10 MW that we are assessing at the moment.  We expect to provide offers and support in that respect.  It returns to the previous point.  The solar PV sector is important in Ireland now and we want to ensure it is a sustainable sector, going forward, and will be here for decades.  When we talk to the companies working in the sector, they have the same perspective and view as us.  Some of the earliest companies were here before the start of the schemes and are going to be here after the schemes are given direct government support.  It is important that the supports we give to the sector are clearly signalled and those in the sector know when they are going to end and what the supports are.</p></speech>

What is the total number of households in the private rental sector that have availed of SEAI retrofit grants this year?  I expect that there are particular challenges for the private rented sector.  What is that figure?  Are there plans to improve on it?</p></speech>

Landlords are eligible to apply for all the demand-led programmes but we do not track how many of those homes are rented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#Z01900"><p>I see that as a problem in and of itself.  Since the introduction of these schemes, one of the concerns has been that renters will be left behind.  Dr. Byrne mentioned earlier that SEAI has every level of detail.  That is fundamental information that would need to be captured in applications.</p> <p>  I see a number of themes in the questions asked by both the Government and the Opposition.  Some of them are fundamental.  Mr. O'Mahony said we have to do it all and pointed to an area-led approach on the community energy grant schemes.</p><p>We see commercial decisions moving to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not surprising, given the incentives and plans involved, but there have been a paltry number of deep retrofits or retrofits to a B2 standard in 2022.  We have sectoral emissions ceilings reports which state we need to be delivering in excess of 60,000 retrofits a year from 2022.  We will deliver 7,500 this year.  It strikes me that there is a plan that will deliver B2 homes in new-builds, in the homes of people who can afford it and in already warm homes that get solar panels.  At the same time, people living in poverty, energy poverty and colder homes are being left behind on long lists.  There is the low-hanging fruit of shallow retrofits and technologies.  The change is not happening at the pace and scale we need it to, particularly at a time of energy crisis.  What do our guests have to say to that charge?  It has been said on both sides.</p></speech>

The answer is that every journey starts with the first step.  It is important to reiterate that we started on this particular part of the journey on 8 February when we announced the launch of the one-stop shops and the re-profiling of all the grant schemes.  We are absolutely in the capacity-building phase.  We are looking to the targets that the Deputy and others have referenced and what we need to achieve towards the end of the decade.  However, we must build the foundations.  We have seen solarcoasters in other jurisdictions, with solar panels going up and down.  We have seen changes having dramatic impacts on the insulation industry.  We are trying to build a steady, stable platform that is accessible across the schemes and across the country.  We are focused on 2030 but the long game will ultimately run to 2050.  We are at the early part of that journey.  I would like the opportunity to come back before the committee at whatever regular interval it wishes to report on how we are progressing on that journey.  However, as we have referenced a few times, we are pushing into a sector.  As the Chairman mentioned, we are close to economic full employment at the moment.  We are pushing into a construction sector that is seeing constraints.  There are constraints too around the education and health sectors, and any other sector one cares to name.  We are working in that frame.</p></speech>

The point has been repeatedly made about the low-hanging fruit of shallow retrofits.  All the incentives are to move into deeper retrofits that are incredibly slow.</p></speech>

There has been significant delivery in that respect.  Since the warmer homes programme was established in 2009, 143,000 homes have been tackled.  We are not starting from a standing start.  A significant volume of work has been done.  As we have referenced in the course of the meeting, the year-on-year growth in respect of attic and cavity grants this year alone is heading towards 300%.  We are pushing forward.</p></speech>

I know that in the spending review of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2020 and the social impact assessment, the Department flagged the fact that we are not collecting those types of data so we do not know whether we are reducing energy poverty as well as reducing our emissions.  Are there any plans to collect those kinds of data around the demographics of households?  Has that been happening since that Department report can out?  Is SEAI doing that at all?  I know our guests said it was not collecting those data in respect of tenants.  Are any data being collected about households?</p></speech>

We work a lot with our research colleagues.  We have a behavioural research unit that does much of that type of analysis but not on an individual home level.  If you apply as an individual for a better energy home grant we do not profile you or look for data from you, because I do not think we can, concerning your particular demographic.  Through our behavioural unit we look at where the money is spent, what is happening and what the various trends are there.</p></speech>

The other question goes back to the attic insulation again.  It is that same spending report.  I think in 2011, &euro;78.1 million was spent on energy efficiency and in 2015 it was &euro;43 million, which is a 45% decrease based on my back-of-the-envelope figures.  Mr. O'Mahony mentioned policy changes ten years ago.  Was that a policy change to reduce the amount of expenditure on energy efficiency or was it that it was an underspend?  In other words that 45% reduction spent by the SEAI on energy efficiency was because of the behavioural changes and people not opting for those schemes.  Am I making sense?</p></speech>

If the officials do have that, how much of the expenditure between 2011 and 2019 was on attic insulation?  There was a 45% decrease and I am asking if it was a decrease in the allocation given to the authority by the Department or a decrease due to an underspend because people had shifted and gone in different directions?</p></speech>

There was recent publicity about the fact not having a fridge door on your fridge means you could halve your energy use by simply retrofitting a door to it.  Is that sort of initiative by a small business open to support?  I am aware of the EXEED scheme and so on but they sound like much bigger types of scheme.  Is there support for such a retrofitting activity or can small enterprises get accelerated capital allowances?</p> <p>  When the loan scheme comes, and I appreciate it is not quite there yet, is the SEAI planning to confine that just to the one-stop shop people who do the big lot together?  Alternatively, and to take Mr. O'Mahony's point, is the authority going to get the loans to the smaller people who do a few measures and might otherwise struggle with the funding of the 50% that falls to them?</p></speech>

The loan scheme is going to be run through high street and pillar institutions so it will be open to individuals and non-commercial landlords to just go in and apply as you would go into a bank or post office to get a loan.  There will obviously be criteria and we are lining up the eligibility criteria with the criteria around the schemes as well because you do not want a situation where your criteria for the schemes are X and your criteria for the loans are Y.  They will be open to anybody to apply for as a private individual.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the small energy grants scheme and the other situation with the small enterprises.  Mr. O'Mahony may give more detail on this but under the community energy grant scheme we go into small businesses and community centres and look at the full suite of options that are available to a small business to improve its energy performance.  Some of that is to do with the electrical costs around refrigeration and things like that.  Mr. O'Mahony may want to comment on that.</p></speech>

At this point in time to the best of my knowledge there is nobody exactly taking that particular one and doing a grant programme for putting fridge doors in retail establishments or garages or anything like that.  As part of the wider work, when you go into a small business and look at the energy provider the project co-ordinator will get an energy audit and look at the measures available to that business.  Normally, what the Deputy has just described is one of a suite of measures you would be recommending and we would fund that package for a small business through the community energy grant scheme.</p></speech>

The last time the authority was in I asked for a projection on the numbers, and I think Deputy O'Rourke did too, of how many B2s the authority expects to have installed by 2030.  The question is whether that target will be met.  I have not seen that projection, though the authority may have sent it and I missed it.  If the SEAI has not sent it I would really appreciate it.  How many B2s have been done to date?  It was mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

That leaves 484,000 to be done in eight years, which is a considerable number.  In order that we can walk away from this meeting comforted the 500,000 target will be met, we need to see what the target is for next year.  I assume the authority has projected this out on an annual or even a quarter-by-quarter basis.  It needs to know what number it needs to be hitting between now and 2030 to ensure the 500,000 target is met.  We cannot afford to come to 2028 and realise that is way out of reach.  Can the officials provide that to us?  I assume the authority has modelled and projected this information.

I will bring in my colleague, Ms McCarthy, the district heating evangelist.  The target is not B2s <i>per se</i>.  Rather, it is CO<sub>2</sub>emissions reduction.  When we looked at the best way of reaching that target, we looked at B2s.  In terms of energy savings on an individual home basis, though, taking a home from a G rating to a C rating probably saves more CO<sub>2</sub>than taking a home from a B3 to a B2 rating.  We will be examining the relative proportions of the package build-up in terms of how best to achieve CO<sub>2</sub>emissions reductions.  This is where district heating comes in.  If we roll out district heating at a greater level than is currently the case, it will effect a greater reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, which would impact on the other set of targets.</p></speech>

If the ultimate target is emissions reductions and if we can cut a home's emissions by 30% within a day or two, should that not be where the focus lies?  The figure for solar this year is &euro;14 million, yet the figure for retrofitting is &euro;250 million.  It is way out of kilter.  The focus is completely on retrofitting.</p></speech>

The majority of energy usage in the house is for heat.  By installing a heat pump, someone is decarbonising that usage and reducing emissions immediately.  We are examining the barriers to grants for heat pumps and trying to broaden them out to more homes, which will have a greater impact on emissions.  If the electricity grid meets its own targets, it will get us to 80% renewables by 2030.</p></speech>

If a home can produce that electricity itself and use the car as a battery, it will support the grid.

To use a phrase, it is "solar bling".  I do not mean this is a pejorative sense.  One of our concerns is that, while we know the importance of retrofitting and improving the fabric of the home, we also know that people have a limited amount of funds to do that.  There is another phrase &ndash; "You can only spend your money once".  If the homeowner puts money into solar, will it impact negatively on his or her ability to insulate the fabric of the home?</p></speech>

When someone installs solar, that person spends money for fixing up his or her home on solar instead of retrofitting.  There is a benefit, but there would have been a greater benefit from the fabric piece.</p></speech>

There is no solar grant for people on lower incomes and the grants for solar are low compared with retrofitting.  I see it as part of the package, but someone on a low income will not be able to afford solar even though it would reduce his or her energy costs by 30% or 40% immediately.</p></speech>

We are in a crisis, so I take the Deputy's point in that regard and it is why we are looking at the issue.  However, the fabric upgrade helps more in the longer term.  It moves a home away from CO2 emissions and into renewables, decarbonising the home.  These two elements &ndash; the shorter term and longer term &ndash; are blended together.</p></speech>

What people want to see, and what the witnesses are looking for themselves on some level, is work on decarbonisation and what can be done to deal with the cost-of-living or energy crisis.  We need a grant scheme that provides the best bang for our buck, particularly for those who cannot afford it but most need it.  There is a general notion in this room about delivering that.  There is a specific piece of work that needs to be done across the board.</p><p> As regards the heat loss indicator survey and that thing that was spoken about for a long time, an awful lot of people said that the only thing that really mattered for decarbonisation was not so much retrofitting but getting the cosy effect from the likes of heat pumps.  I noticed prior to energy costs going through the roof when someone opened the door one when I was canvassing on a newly-built estate, I would be whacked by the heat coming out the house and the residents would speak about how great that situation was but I probably was not getting the environmental impact whatever about the cost savings and how comfortable the heat was.  The issue is delivering that.  It is finding the exact mix and what is needed to ensure a house is airtight enough that a heat pump will work.</p><p> It has been mentioned that the survey will take a number of years but information will be forthcoming fairly quickly.  How quickly can we get an indication of a fit-for-purpose system that can do real business from the point of view of decarbonisation while ensuring that there are cost savings?  I get the point that there is a particular way that people must operate heat pumps because at the moment electricity also costs a huge amount.  It is wanting to be airtight versus getting a high BER rating, etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margie McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#FF00200"><p>The heat loss indicator study should provide an initial review by summer of next year.  We need a two-year process for us to get full results but there is another part to this.  Like the Deputy said, the SEAI has a behavioural economics unit.  The unit has done an awful lot of work examining the operation of heat pumps once installed.  That issues are: what role does the heat pump installer have in driving those behaviours and how can we create better awareness among homeowners on how to operate this technology?  Quite a central point of that is the installer.  An installer should not just install the technology but spend a bit of time explaining to people how to use the system, which is an aspect on which the behavioural unit has done a good study.  That aspect directly impacts on the efficiency of the pump, how that affects an electricity bill and the comfort of one's home.  Like the Deputy mentioned, a heat pump creates a different type of heat as it is across the home as opposed to just being central points of heat.</p> <p>  The behavioural piece is about how to help people once a heat pump is installed and when it is being installed.  The heat loss indicator survey is about whether we can get people and a grant level, and eligible for a grant, in a home that may be less efficient than is currently required for a grant.  Next summer we will have an initial reading from the survey but we will not have the final study.</p></speech>

These homes that are pretty much heat pump ready but are currently oil fuelled and we are trying to market directly to them, increase awareness of heat pumps and what they can do, and of the grants system.  In the meantime we are targeting those homes.</p></speech>

So as not to offend half of the country I confirm that I am speaking about myself and not about anybody else.</p><p> I am not sure if the following observation is fair or unfair.  The owner of a middle-sized contracting company came to me and said that the problem at the minute is that the company is still doing pieces of work in homes and applying for the grants for people but the company cannot apply for the same sort of grants that are available to those that can go directly through the one-stop shop or whatever.  He spoke about that being a difficulty for contractors.  He also spoke of the one-stop shop being a closed shop in the way it operates and said he believed the qualifying criteria and capacities are not particularly reasonable.  This all sounded reasonable to me and I look forward to hearing an answer from the delegation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#GG00200"><p>On whether the situation is fair or unfair, I am not sure and I just think that it is interesting.  I can understand the dilemma where a contractor looks at these one-stop shops being treated like a favourite son, as it were.  We have 12 places in the pipeline and ten more to go.  We have relatively strict qualifying criteria because we want people to operate at scale.  It is very difficult to retrofit a retrofit so we want to make sure we have a quality system base.  A key driver in a one-stop shop is having those quality processes in place.  Many of them, though not all of them, have got ISO 9000 certification and things like that so there is that piece in the market.<br/><br/>I reiterate that we are on a journey.  Many individual contractors are working with one-stop shops presently.  For example, some of the one-stop shops come from the construction sector where they are doing it themselves and some come from the project management side of things where they are contracting in very many individual contractors.  I can understand people looking to get into it.  If you are a medium-sized contractor, there are constraints in place.  We have the community energy grants scheme where we encourage people to get involved in multiple projects, build up those skills, learn the lessons and then apply to become a one-stop shop.  Nobody is excluded <i>per se</i>.  It is about growing into it.</p></speech>

Usually questions are spread among more guests.  It feels like quite an interrogation.  On the point about batteries made by Deputy Cronin a few minutes ago and, I think, by Deputy Whitmore earlier, correct me if I am wrong but the rationale for this scheme is not to protect medically vulnerable people from a power cut situation but to reduce their costs by providing solar panels and an inverter.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Typically, medically vulnerable people have no options to reduce their use.  That is the whole point of it.  The Chairman or I can switch off lights etc., but a person who must use a particular machine such as some sort of dialysis machine must keep that machine on.  We have all seen on the news people with multiple types of machines and, therefore, with very significant energy costs they cannot avoid.  That is the rationale behind this.</p></speech>

Did the study primarily examine existing waste heat streams, potential future waste heat streams or both?</p></speech>

We are now looking more at where are the potential heat sources because it will be seen from that heat study that a lot of the heat within district heating came from the likes of heat pumps and biomass as well as industrial waste heat.  As referenced earlier, geothermal energy played a smaller part but data centres certainly were not a key feature or focus of meeting the demand.  That is quite a local area.  Now that we have identified about 80 candidate areas to meet the target of 2.7 TWh per year, it is about looking at those candidate areas, where are the anchor tenants and where are the base best heat sources.</p></speech>

It is going the other way rather than saying we have this much heat and how can we use it, and we have this much demand and how can we now match the generation of heat.</p></speech>

They are looking at where are the candidate areas and then doing the deep dives into those whereas our Scandinavian and Nordic neighbours have had a longer lead-in time.  Some of those might have come from declaring they had waste heat here and agreeing to harness that into a network.  Others may have come from having a large district or urban area that they really want to decarbonise and deciding to look at heat pumps etc.  It has been more of an organic journey.  Ours will have to be more focused on where is our best effort to get this up and running to have it established at a critical mass.</p></speech>

That is a key piece for public and private investment in the area.  All part of the conversation currently is who will be the anchor tenants and is there good heat demands in the area, not only residential and smaller businesses but solid source anchor tenants.  That is what one sees in most of the successful networks.  They started off with key public buildings and maybe leisure centres, swimming pools, hotels and hospitals, which are the big high-heat demand buildings in a network that give a guarantee that one will have a certain amount of baseline demand before connecting other customers.  That is a big part of the business model for it.</p></speech>

Ms Sheehan will speak to the various parts of the working group there.  The second is getting in to local authorities, which are currently looking at their local renewable energy strategies and their climate action plans and at a local level are working with their climate action regional offices, CAROs, and literally explaining what district heating is, the opportunity it offers and showcasing what is about to happen in Tallaght.  That is a capability that will have to build very fast across Ireland.  When we talked about capability constraints, that is one that we will really have to look at because building that capability into Ireland to be able to deliver it at pace is probably one of our biggest challenges.  The other is general acceptance and public knowledge and awareness of what the system offers.</p></speech>

Local authorities tend not to employ mechanical engineers.  Am I correct that is the skillset that is needed there to understand energy and heat?  Maybe some are better than others.</p></speech>

Without pre-empting what the output will be, what one will see from other jurisdictions is that local authorities or municipalities need some hand-holding in terms of expertise and guidance from a national level as to how to role out these projects.  Certainly, there is lots of that knowledge available.</p></speech>

It is the national strategy, that Ms McCarthy was talking about, and then designating roles and responsibilities across the system to do it, from regulation, planning, finance, support, what local authorities do or do not do, and private or public decisions.</p><p>On funding, it will cost to build out at scale.  There is that knowledge base about public perception and then all the different actors across the system.  There are questions.  For example, what is district heating and what does it mean for them?  It is about building up that awareness and acceptance.  On market development, we cannot do anything without the sector mobilised and having confidence to operate within in.  Then there is skills and capacity.  Everything comes back to that key component.  There are skills but it will have to be adapted to district heating.  Some of the skills are needed in other areas and that is another prospect.</p></speech>

We have rolled out system-wide networks and we know how to do it.  It is a different type of technology but the strategy technology is fairly simple.  It is a matter of the acceptance and commitment to doing it and raising the finances.  Whilst those decisions are being pulled together and recommendations are being considered for them, we at SEAI are trying to get in place this area mapping so that when those decisions are ready to be made we will be ready with the information to say across the country these are the highest candidate areas, and when we get to the next stage that these are the next candidate areas, as we roll out climate action plan targets over the period up to 2050.</p></speech>

Apologies, I had to attend another meeting.</p> <p>  Earlier I heard the figures relating to the warmer homes scheme.  They stated that 3,200 homes had been delivered so far this year, 1,300 contractors were involved with 328 to join and there were 11,300 applications with 420 in progress.  If my figures are incorrect, I ask for them to be corrected.  There is a waiting time of 28 months with ten months for the survey delivery.  Is there scope to improve those timeframes, particularly that ten-month delay?  We are talking about people who are in dire need.  Many of those houses have a low energy rating to begin with but they households also are on low income.  How can that process be sped up?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the retrofitting.  I have had a few queries where people are concerned that the basic retrofitting was not done to the correct standard a number of years ago.  Does it automatically preclude them from the 80% grant if their house is not up to a certain specification?  If the witnesses could answer those two questions, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#JJ00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will take those two questions.  To clarify, on the warmer homes scheme, we have 33 contractors.  It is a procured panel.  The one with the 1,300 contracts is the better energy home scheme for individual measures and that is growing.  A constraint to be aware of on warmer homes scheme is that it is a procured panel.  There are 33 contractors on it and we have to work through those 33 contractors.  On that scheme, the Deputy correctly identified that there is a significant period in terms of getting them done.  We have discussed and developed proposals which we have now with our parent Department regarding how we expedite that and bring that waiting period down.  That is one part of it, albeit a slightly larger one.</p> <p>  Within the scheme itself, there are also so-called "pain" points.</p><p>This is a phrase we use on the customer journey where we look at every single part of the journey, we ask how we can make that better, what are we doing here and what is adding value.  It is that point of designing a constant iteration of improvement.  Can we make marginal changes across multiple parts of the process to improve the cycle time?  We are doing as much of that as we can.  We are also trying to make it beneficial for contractors.  For example, we have given them a 4% increase in the rates across all measures earlier in the year and we have just implemented a 75% stage payment, which improves the cash flow for contractors on that scheme.</p><p> On the second question which was specifically around retrofitting and eligibility, people are not eligible for a scheme where they cannot be funded twice for the same measure, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

If, for instance, a good few years ago - Dr. Byrne is correct in that this was under a certain scheme - somebody applied for attic insulation which did not bring the property up to a specific standard, due to fact they applied for it under the previous scheme, irrespective of how good or beneficial it was, is it correct to say that they cannot re-apply under the 80%?</p></speech>

The case has been made on delivery, picking up on a number of points already made, that if we got the plan-led approach in district heating on residential and commercial planning, that we could deliver homes more cheaply and more quickly.  Industry has said that if it took that approach with district heating, homes could be delivered more cheaply, and 14 days more quickly.  Is that something the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI has heard of, concurs with or is familiar with?</p></speech>

Is that what the Deputy is referring to, namely, targeting where we would run incentives and how we would support various ways of decarbonising heat?  District heating would play its part in the demand side unit, DSU, element of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#KK01000"><p>This will also be in respect of delivering new homes and local area plans.  If we employed district heating for the new homes to be built, they could then be delivered more cost effectively and in a quicker timeframe because one is then taking a plan-led approach as opposed to repeated individual connections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.792" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#KK01100"><p>If I may make a point, as a general rule of thumb, it is always easier, quicker and cheaper to do it the first time.  As when we discussed the retrofitting piece, to go back and do something afterwards is going to cost more.  As the Deputy has correctly pointed out, if we can plan this in, where we have discussed district heating areas, where we know we need homes and can layer those up, it is probably ultimately cheaper to do it right the first time than to have to go back in afterwards.</p></speech>

They talked about the need to provide not 80% but 100% grants.  Is that a case that the SEAI has heard from them and is it something that SEAI is considering or has considered?  If it has considered it, what conclusions has it come to?</p></speech>

We talked at the beginning of this meeting about inflation.  Talking about 100% sounds great and that we will just pay for it.  First, there was a scheme in England that did just that.  One of the biggest limitations of the 100% grant was to get people to clear their attics.  They set up a charity to help people clear their attics to go and get the thing done.  The other thing about 100% grants is that it is highly likely that we will end up driving inflation in the scheme.  While one talks about 100%, it sounds great in theory but it will end up just costing the taxpayer and the State more in terms of what is done.</p> <p>  There have been various ideas on how we build scale on our schemes and we are trying to balance out building the scale of the schemes with the governance requirements we have.  We talked earlier in this meeting that we are spending significant amounts of Exchequer funding on giving grants to homeowners and we have to ensure that they are done at the right level and quality.  These are issues we have to consider and they certainly impact on how one delivers at scale.</p><p>I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Brian O'Mahony, who may want to make a comment on the 100% grant issue which he has looked into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.798" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022101100002#LL00200"><p>Earlier in the year we look specifically at the 100% rate grants and then at the different types of homes.  Based on instruction from the Department, we looked across the stock of houses that we delivered over the previous two years to understand what the typical home is.  Essentially, one has many homes now and, to use a broad categorisation, when one goes outside of urban areas, one finds that newer homes can be larger and in urban areas one can find homes that are smaller, albeit if one looks back through the housing statistics, one can see detached homes which are relatively small which need to be upgraded.  Those types of homes are receiving higher than 80% funding because the 80% funding was set at the typical rate of homes.  Larger performing homes do not get the 80% funding; it would be lower in the case of a significantly larger home than the 200 sq. m one.  There are swings and roundabouts in delivering that and it would be very challenging to deliver a true 100% funded scheme given the different types and typologies of homes out there.</p></speech>

My final question is on the emissions reductions savings.  That is what this is all about, as has been articulated by SEAI.  Of the retrofits that have been carried out this year, particularly the ones to B2 level, has the SEAI an assessment of the emissions reductions savings that have been made on those?  I believe that there will be 3,200 such homes in the warmer homes schemes, and I appreciate that they are not all B2 level homes.  Does the SEAI have emissions reduction savings per scheme?</p></speech>

I have the summary figure here for the moment and this figure for the year-to-date is 19.48 kilotonnes on the schemes.  We have it broken down and we have a computer emission reduction calculation per scheme but that figure is the global total at the moment.  I can get the Deputy figures per scheme also.</p></speech>

On that point and in returning to earlier points, I note that there is not a scheme directly targeted at homes with solid fuel.  Should there be one?  We have had a conversation on turf and on the sector emission ceilings which specifically say that there should be a targeting of that cohort of people.  Has the SEAI considered the quickest way to get the maximum amount of CO2 emissions reductions?</p></speech>

For fear of reiterating a point, we started in February and the job is like getting an aeroplane to take off, where we look at the various grant measures and the way in which we can bundle, package or incentivise those.  We are relatively clear in that while we work very closely with our parent Department, we are all of the shared view that we are not going to have one scheme right out until 2030, but we will be targeting, just as Ms McCarthy has indicated earlier on, certain things in certain areas.  Somebody, through our information and advice, who has a larger, detached, rural home which is run on oil could benefit.  One starts then to pick the incentives apart.  Effectively, we have to get towards market segmentation.  We are talking about homeowners, which is not a homogenous group of people.  We then start segmenting different schemes and incentives for different outcomes and groupings.</p></speech>

Has SEAI looked into in any way, shape or form at anything in that area?  Poolbeg is obviously waste heat.  I was in the regional development centre in Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT, and it looked at studies being done on excess heat that could be contained and moved via truck-type units.  I was wondering what the viability was of such a scenario.  Is SEAI aware of some of these ongoing research projects?</p></speech>

We will not get into energy production.  Hydrogen production is an example, where you produce hydrogen by realising our resource and you move it effectively and store energy in that way.  Similarly, this would be done - and I mention it a lot - even within the energy hub of a district heating site where you have thermal storage happening in the site.  That can meet your heat requirement through the network when you have low, maybe very expensive, electricity and you are using heat pumps to provide your district heating.  Instead you start using your thermal storage.  This also allows for flexibility on the grid because you are not drawing down electricity at that specific time.  If you have amber alerts or something like that, you have thermal storage instead.  That is just one example.</p></speech>

Their time was very much appreciated.  It was a very thorough conversation and discussion.  I think we went for three or four, or five rounds, even, of questions and that is very unusual for this committee.  We appreciate all the information the guests have given us and look forward to having them back again as the various schemes develop.  They will be keen I am sure, to report progress. I thank them all. </p></speech>

We will have two sessions today.  The item on the agenda for consideration at this first session is alternative aftercare services for young adults.  We are joined representatives of the Simon Community.  I welcome in the committee room Mr. Wayne Stanley, head of policy and communications, and Ms Karen Feeney, who is head of services of Galway Simon Community.  I also welcome Ms Aisling O'Hara, service manager for the youth service and community-based housing in Galway Simon Community, who is joining us on Microsoft Teams.  I thank them for being with us at this meeting.</p><p> The Teams chat function should be used only to let us know if there are any difficulties or urgent matters.  It is not to be used to make general comments or statements during the meetings.</p><p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to contribute in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to that constitutional requirement, so anybody who does participate through Teams from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any committee members who are partaking via Teams confirm, prior to making their contribution, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> In advance of inviting our guests to deliver their opening statement, I advise them of the following in respect of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses who are participating from within the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  In the case of witnesses appearing virtually before the committee, there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege would apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p><p> We are delighted to be able to hold this session, which has been a long time coming.  I invite Mr. Stanley to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Karen and Aisling, who run the dedicated youth service in Galway Simon Community.  It is a service we are very proud of and it identified a number of the issues we are going to talk about.  The Simon Communities are also a member of the Irish Coalition to End Youth Homelessness and sit on the national homeless action committee.  In these roles, we have ongoing collaborative dialogue with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the development of the upcoming youth homelessness strategy.</p> <p>  Today we wish to highlight the needs and experiences of young people who have experienced household disruption or adverse childhood experiences but who have never officially entered State care.  These young people are over-represented in homelessness because they fall through the cracks of support systems.  We bring this discussion to the committee because we believe there is the potential to reduce the experience of homelessness for these young people through targeted intervention and collaboration.  In our broader submission, we have also highlighted the needs of young people leaving State care.  This group are an identifiable population, meaning it is easier to target them with housing supports and homeless prevention.</p> <p>  However, our focus today lies with an additional cohort who have experienced adverse childhood experiences but have not been taken into care.  Some of these may be known to Tusla due to welfare concerns, most likely because they experienced family breakdown as a late teenager but did not officially enter care, possibly because they aged out or because the circumstances at the time were not deemed to be at a level of risk that warranted significant intervention.  This can include those who have had experiences of abuse, who have been surrounded by addiction or who have experienced family breakdown in their late teens.  Studies show these young people are over-represented among early school leavers, experience higher rates of mental health difficulties and are over-represented among homeless adults compared with the general population.</p> <p>  The concern is that this group are, to a certain extent, currently unknown or invisible and, therefore, there appears to be less awareness of their needs, which we fear is compounding the issues.  These young people often require support but they fall through the cracks of our support systems, making them vulnerable to homelessness, poverty and educational disadvantage.  They do not have access to social supports similar to those provided in aftercare, which prepare young people for the transition into adult life.  They often receive a lower social welfare rate, which can compound the risk of poverty and housing insecurity.  We fear they are vulnerable to hidden homelessness because they do not have support to navigate or be able to afford the housing market.  They are not entitled to housing support or targeted homelessness prevention such as the capital assistance scheme, CAS, for care leavers provided through Tusla and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They are not currently entitled to additional educational supports for children in care and aftercare such as the bursary scheme operated by Tusla and the Department of Children, Disability, Equability, Integration and Youth.  The upcoming youth homelessness strategy appears firm that it will focus on young people after the age of 18.  However, the threat of homelessness and housing security begins well before then.  Therefore, Tusla in particular can play a central role in protecting this group from housing insecurity.  A co-ordinated, universal response and policy measures can be developed and implemented to protect this group from homelessness and housing insecurity as they enter adulthood.</p> <p>  There are a number of recommendations in that regard.  Additional key workers can provide support into early adulthood, including with homelessness prevention.  Existing homelessness prevention policies such as the CAS for care leavers could be expanded to be more inclusive of all young people at risk of homelessness.  Young people under the age of 25 are still subject to a lower social welfare rate.  While some categories of young people have been included in the higher rate, this particular welfare group are not and this compounds their risk of poverty and homelessness.  Collaboration could also be increased.  Galway Simon Community's dedicated youth service is a prime example of successful collaboration between a range of stakeholders.  This multi-agency partnership that exists between Galway Simon Community, Galway City Council and Tusla to ensure youth services are well informed and young people are well supported has proven effective in the outcomes it is having for young people, such as increased employment among the group.  There is further potential in this model if appropriate housing can be sourced.  While this might look different in other areas where working relationships differ, the core principle of a dedicated partnership service has proven very effective.  The Simon Communities of Ireland see value and potential in this model and wish to work with the committee and agencies to promote and extend this type of collaborative work.</p></speech>

It was very well researched.  This is the first time I have seen some sort of crystallisation of the issue of vulnerability among that cohort of about 10,000 people, including the 1,274 in the 18-to-24-year-old category.  They come to us, as public representatives, and they present in some way, shape or form but we just do not know how to deal with the issue.  There is no playbook for any Deputy or Senator for dealing with that cohort of people.  If they have been in the care system, there is no transition, and if they have not and they are identified as having had, as Mr. Stanley noted, an adverse child experience, they just fall through the gaps.  When I talk to local authorities, there does not seem to be a solution there either.  The question is how we can help these people transition and what our guests have come up with is, potentially, a way forward.</p> <p>  Are they confident they can get sufficient traction with this strategy such that resources will be provided, given this will be about resources following on from their organisation's advocacy?  Can we sort it out?  Is there a sympathetic ear at departmental level?</p></speech>

In my experience of officials, Ministers and other politicians across parties, if a solution that works is provided, a listening ear is generally given in return.  More money is definitely needed.  One of the main issues we have at the moment, which Ms Feeney and I were just talking about before the meeting started, is that with the housing crisis, the dominos keep falling and the vulnerability of those young people coming to the services is increasing.</p><p>I will allow Ms Feeney speak to this because she will tell the story better than me.  We have examples of things that work.  There is a major problem on the housing side but there is a collaboration at local level in Galway and if that can be replicated, and we can build momentum behind it, it can be done.  In terms of a listening ear, that shifts.  We have a youth homelessness strategy on the way and we hope to expand from that.</p></speech>

The Galway example involves placing people in accommodation.  What is the real-time experience of somebody who presents to a local authority, for instance, where he or she has to fill out a housing application form and go through this bureaucratic process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Feeney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#C00300"><p>A multi-agency, almost local, task force was set up because young 18- to 24-year-olds were increasingly presenting for homeless services in 2012 and 2013.  A group got together and one of the first things it did was to have some dedicated apartments.  We initially started off with eight units of accommodation.  That way it was very much about keeping young people out of emergency homeless services, which is a completely different shift in their identity.  A lot of planning and design went into that.  In this instance, the local authority provided the accommodation units initially.  The next resource piece is around staffing.  That involves tailored support to young people to either be in work or training, and to get counselling or the other allied health services they need.  It is very much around that.  It is then about supporting them to move on into accommodation.</p> <p>  Since 2016, the numbers seeking our help have increased.  We have an additional four units and now have 12 beds altogether.  We believe that within the context of Galway it has kept the numbers presenting to emergency services much lower than they otherwise would have been.  For the young people involved, they do not have this identity of having been in homeless services.  It is very much about supported housing.</p></speech>

As there is that collaboration with Tusla, quite a number of young people have passed through.  We have worked with approximately 150 young people since the project started, and opened and admitted people, in 2016.  Of those, probably a good 50% have been through the aftercare system.  Still another 40% would have been from families or situations where there was an awful lot of stress but which did not meet the threshold for the young person to go into care.  In some instances, and credit where credit is due, Trojan work has been done by people - through Meitheals, for example - who are there trying to help out.  It is just that the family is too threadbare to support the young person in homelessness, or at risk of it, or in hidden homelessness.</p> <p>  The spend is not that much.  What it is taking to deliver this service is not expensive considering that what it is saving is significant.  Annualised through section 10, it takes less than &euro;130,000 a year to run this service.  The major point is that it is about prevention.  We see the outcomes for people.  At a philosophical level, we have also been committed to trying to break a lot of intergenerational cycles where we have known parents and grandparents who were in services previously.  We can see that tailored support makes a difference.  We are in partnership with Tusla and its aftercare service for many of our clients but it is about giving people that.</p> <p>  Once people move into accommodation, we are there to support them.  We do not get too focused on age.  Services do not cut out for people when they reach the age of 25 because small interventions can stop small problems becoming big problems and people then tend to sustain accommodation.  A small percentage of cases will end in emergency accommodation.  Many of the people we support are in contact with the criminal justice system but do not necessarily go to prison and there is low recidivism.  We can see that.</p></speech>

It was very good to read the report.  I have worked in homeless services in the past.  I have also been homeless and I know of the challenges that are faced.  I was homeless as an adult and not as a young person, so I can only imagine how difficult it is for young people.</p> <p>  Youth homelessness has always been a major issue.  Often, the only temporary and emergency accommodation available is in the hostel-like scenario, where young people are often in the same rooms as older people who are more entrenched in homelessness.  That creates its own problems.  Is there any outreach or in-reach to these facilities by the Simon Community that offers young people supports when they are in emergency accommodation?  For example, this housing crisis is probably the worst I have ever seen.  I have been an elected representative since 2016 and it is the worst I have seen it.  The bespoke places for young people in emergency accommodation are drying up.  There are so many people looking for help that is simply not there.  In the absence of bespoke young persons' emergency accommodation, does the Simon Community undertake any in-reach to any of the other facilities out there to identify these young people and offer them supports at that level?</p></speech>

One of the fortunate things about Galway is that is a more manageable population.  There are two emergency hostels for men in the city and one for women.  We run one of those hostels and another organisation, COPE Galway, runs the Fairgreen Hostel.</p> <p>  There is a pretty conscious effort, and there has been a lot of work in the collaboration we have in Galway, to as far as possible keep young people - the under-25s - out of that emergency situation.  This is what this project was dreamt up to do.  I believe we will come under more pressure.  I recall at the planning phase talking about young people ending up in tourist hostels.  There is no chance of young people getting beds in tourist hostels at present because all the university students are in them.  It is a completely different-----</p></speech>

We do in-reach to prisons.  Sometimes, if people have to wait for a bed through us, they may have to spend time in an emergency service.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes" but given the current climate and how much pressure there is, we can see the realities of rough sleeping among young people are beginning to increase.  There is a very different climate out there.</p></speech>

I am interested in the Galway project.  If something is working, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  How does Ms Feeney see that being rolled out for a bigger population, such as Dublin?  We have four local authorities in Dublin.  Would she start with one smaller local authority or one area and work it out that way?  What is her thinking on that?</p></speech>

A big part of it is having workers that will follow individual client journeys.  A big thing that happens to young people is that somebody says to them that they cannot do something with them until they fill out a form, and they are sent off to do it, but if they are not organised or are under stress, that will not happen.  Sometimes, we really need people to hand-hold through that system so young people do not fall through.</p></speech>

We have not had a massive turnover but the project is tight in regard to this target group.</p></speech>

We will have Tusla in later.  One of the criticisms we often get about Tusla relates to the high turnover of staff which means that young people must tell their story over and over again and are retraumatised.  There is a lesson there.  If staff can be looked after and retained, that builds up a relationship with young people so they can move on to the next stage of their lives.</p></speech>

As a service. the Galway Simon Community youth service has really developed.  Reflecting on what Ms Feeney spoke about, we started off with four apartments and then gained two more units.  The service itself has developed in terms of the outreach capacity.  Some 62% of the young people we are supporting this year are supported through community supports.  We view that as a preventative piece.  We are seeking to prevent young people from coming into habitual homelessness.  It is important that we are conducive to the needs of young people.  When we look at the needs of young people, we see that some of those things are identity, meaning, belonging, self-actualisation and psychological needs.  If a young person is homeless, his or her needs, including the need for a sense of belonging, are not being met.  We are working with a cohort of young people who do not belong anywhere because they are homeless.  Those things are really important in making sure we are conducive to the needs of young people.  The preventative piece we try to do by working with and supporting young people through the community is an important part of that.  If we can prevent a young person coming into any service, that is the optimum result.</p></speech>

I refer in particular to their accounts of how vulnerable people who age out of State care and experience household disruption are left susceptible to homelessness and poverty.  It is shocking that 1,274 young people aged 18 to 24 were officially recorded as homeless in August.  Not only is it a record high number but, as the witnesses have indicated, the figure is likely to be much higher in reality.  We have also been shown that it is largely an invisible group of people who can fall through the cracks.  Services such as those provided by the witnesses are among the only insights we have into this world.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  If there is not time to answer them, a written reply would be helpful to inform the committee.  The opening statement and submission highlighted the need for key workers to provide support into early adulthood around homelessness prevention, provision and life skills.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the importance of this support and give an indication of how many key workers we have and how many are needed?  Will they outline how people under the age of 25 are still subject to a lower social welfare rate of &euro;117.70, which compounds their risk of poverty and homelessness?  From my perspective that lower rate is an ideological one from centre-right government parties and is not based on an assessment of the needs of that cohort.  Will the witnesses give us a sense of the importance of ensuring vulnerable young people receive the higher social welfare rate?  One of the Simon Community's policy recommendations is the expansion of the CAS in terms of eligibility and ambition.  This scheme provides funding for housing in specific categories of housing need, including youth homelessness.  Will the witnesses outline for the committee the importance of that expansion?  Finally, will they give us a sense of how these issues manifest regionally?  Are there variations between counties or urban and rural settings?</p></speech>

She can correct me if I am not answering them.  At this stage, due to the expansion of the service, we now have two key workers, each of whom probably has an active case load of about 20.  We have additional support.  People can need more intense supports at different moments in their journey.  Much of what is required by young people at the start involves being recognised as homeless.  Getting the medical card and the social welfare payment involves overcoming many bureaucratic challenges.  Sometimes it is about taking people through that process to ensure they have full access to their entitlements.  Much of it can be about helping people who have difficulties with self-regulation and communication.  We help them with those kinds of lifestyle issues - how to keep patient in an Intreo office, for example, or how to express their needs to a GP.  Such important minutiae are part of the give and take of social care work.  There is also the issue of setting goals and ambitions, and getting those kind of wins.  The cut and thrust of this day-to-day work is about how to navigate problems and ensure everything is not lost.  When young people do not have support, it can be like a game of snakes and ladders in which a few badly chosen words, an ill-judged loss of temper or a missed appointment causes them to go back down the snake again.  Our work is about having somebody to accompany people through that journey.</p></speech>

We have grown.  Initially, there was just one worker on the project but it has grown.  Our core funding is through section 10, but we also have a contribution from Tusla.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question about the social welfare payment, if I recall properly a significant decision in this regard was made in a budget around 2010 as part of the austerity programme.  I can guess that some of the thinking was that if young people were still living at home with their parents, they did not need to call on a full social welfare payment.  That may have been understandable, given the pressures at the time.  It continued to be available at the higher level for young people coming out of care, but a whole other subset within that cohort never formally went into care.  They never had that eligibility even though they were completely on their own.  At that time, the rate was about &euro;100.  Some young people have diagnoses, may be neurodivergent or have issues with mental health.  These issues may not have been picked up.  If they were not with families that figured this out before the age of 18 - unfortunately, the burden remains too much with families - it is a big challenge to get it figured out and recognised thereafter.  Sometimes they do not have the coping skills, but they are on this lower rate until they are 25.  There should be more discretion around the actual needs and vulnerabilities of young people who are in homeless services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.848" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Walter Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#D01200"><p>As Ms Feeney said, there was a commitment from the Department and indeed the Minister at the time that young people leaving care would not be affected by those cuts in the social welfare rate.  However, there was no capacity within the system to identify groups that were harder to identify.  There was a group coming out of care who could be easily identified because they had a care plan.  Therefore, they could get an increased rate.  If there was a way to identify young people who were homeless or were going to be in homelessness, the logic was that they would have done the same thing for them.</p><p>These young people are harder to identify.  They fall between the cracks and so they are not getting the increased payment.  The truth is that regardless of age, if we want to prevent homelessness, people need time and resources.  They need capital.  That is how a person stays out of homelessness.  If the State is providing less to young people who are competing in what is currently an insane market, then we will see increased homelessness, particularly in the context of vulnerable people.</p><p> On the final point about accommodation for care leavers funded via the capital assistance scheme, when that innovation came in, it had the potential to be an absolute game-changer.  Young people who go on the housing list are going to be waiting on it for years.  CAS-funded accommodation for care leavers provides an opportunity to build up a stock of housing that are permanent homes for young people who are leaving care but that, in our view, should be expanded to young people who are in the more difficult situations to which I refer.  The number of people who leave care every year is fairly stationary.  It is between 500 to 600 each year.  That is far too many, but lots of young people have had very good experiences and perhaps do not need the same level of support.  If we can build up a stock of housing for these young people, they will, as they are given support, transition to the next phases of their lives and move on from rental accommodation.  They should not be forced to move on but they will naturally do so.  Once we build up a stock, we will have the resources to provide accommodation for young people who are in difficult situations and for those leaving care.  It will be an absolute game-changer if it is properly resourced, if the accommodation is built and if it is provided to the young people that need it.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have actually been answered.  All of us have seen homelessness, and very much so recently.  There has been an increase in the use of food parcels.  In my area in Carlow, St. Clare's Hospitality Kitchen gives out meals every day.  The increase in that for young people has been absolutely unreal.  It is a concern because when we speak about people who are homeless it can be couch surfing, staying in unsafe accommodation, sleeping in cars or squatting.  It may be somebody who is in a domestic abuse situation.  There are major issues.  Like other members, I work daily with people who are in these situations.  If a person has no home address, it is a huge issue to then go in for a social welfare payment.  If a person applies to the local authority to go on the housing list when he or she is already couch surfing and has no address to give, straight away this is a massive barrier.</p> <p>  In technical terms, there is no joined-up thinking between Tusla, local authorities and other agencies.  It becomes a major issue when a person who is couch surfing or staying with a friend comes to a Deputy.  Perhaps through no fault of their own, the person did not get on with his or her parents or the family and had to leave.  The amount of red tape to try to sort that out is not right.  We need to address this matter.</p> <p>  We also spoke about medical cards, which is another issue.  This particular age group is falling between the systems.  Unless we have all of the different agencies working together with some sort of a reformed plan, I do not know how we are actually going to resolve this.</p> <p>  We also need to have some system in place if somebody is in such a situation and they also need to get mental health counselling or go into some system for a while.  Ms O'Hara spoke about Galway and all of the really good work being done there, which is very welcome.  We have great groups in Carlow, but we need to set up some sort of reformed plan at national level whereby we can go to a local authority, a social welfare office or a doctor and say, "This is a case of homelessness and this man or woman is actually couch surfing, has nowhere to go, or is squatting in a little door somewhere".</p> <p>  Reference was made to the fact that 1,274 young people are living in emergency accommodation.  Are the majority of those men or women?  What are the figures in that regard?</p> <p>  As previous speakers indicated, this has become a massive issue.  It needs to be addressed.  I am very passionate about it in the sense that it is growing.  We need to look at it with the local authorities and with funding.  We are always told, through the local authorities or through Tusla, that we have the funding, but when we want to set up funding, for example, for a particular cohort that I feel is falling through the cracks in the system, we do not seem to have a mechanism available.  We do not know where to go for support.  I am working with people sometimes and I do not know where to go in order to try to help them.  How do I help them?  When I go to try to sort something out I might go to somebody I know, but that should not be happening.  All of us, especially the person who is in the situation and who may be homeless, must have support.  We must know where to go and who to contact.  In Galway they are very lucky.  There are other agencies and while everyone is doing their best - I am not here to criticise anyone - I feel that in small areas such as Carlow, Kilkenny or across the country we need to address how we stop people and young people falling through the cracks.</p></speech>

It can be so difficult.  I spent last week in Budapest at the European Youth Centre with the European Council.  My visit included a training session for Housing First for Youth.  If anybody is not aware, Housing First for Youth is a programme that we run in Galway.  It is also run nationally.  The idea behind it is that we house somebody and wrap the supports around that person.  It would be the total opposite to the staircase model where the person must be rough sleeping on the streets, then goes into emergency accommodation, and then must wait on the list.  It is the total opposite to that.  Over the seven days last week, we looked at developing a youth housing first model, which would be very similar to what Mr. Stanley spoke about.  It is about extending the CAS for care leavers to other at-risk cohorts of young people.  I have worked with colleagues from Canada and there is a body of evidence to show that it works very well in Canada.  Scotland also has a really successful model.  Overall, this model has reduced the number of presentations into emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  As was said earlier, the model of care for the needs of young people is very important, but if we think about the concept of plasticity and what that actually means, it is that a young person's social environment can be shaped or moulded at key points.  This is the point at which somebody can come in and support that young person.  If all it takes is housing and security then the money is worth spending on something like this.  As Ms Feeney said, the cost is minimal overall and over time.  I believe in an extension of CAS for care leavers to the at-risk cohort of young people, reflecting what my colleagues have already said.</p></speech>

The bit that is missing in this is that each department or section in a local authority has people they work with.  They administer the systems.  How do we build bridges and focus across that?  One of the ways is through CAS, which creates that just by being there because it creates a framework into which young people fit.  Otherwise, we do need initiatives like those kinds of shared services and experiences across departments in local areas.  That is really the way forward.  There are models of it for care leavers with multidisciplinary teams where the local authority, the HSE and Tusla are all involved in deciding what the best way forward is for the young person.  The model is there.</p></speech>

I apologise that I was not here for the start of the meeting.  I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the kids who end up in homelessness and the reference that was made to neurodivergence.  I do not want to label any kids but is there a type of kid or young person that ends up presenting more in homelessness or is it because the care has ended at the age of 18?  Is it the kids who have not had the right interventions and supports around trauma-related behaviours, be that related to neurodivergence or other issues?</p><p>Have we not wrapped enough supports around children and foster families in supporting those children?  Is it a breakdown of care placements or is it when they turn 18?  I wonder whether it is a bit of a mix.</p></speech>

There is a certain number of young people for whom the foster care works well.  They progress to third level education and often can have extended placements with the original foster family.  With others, things break down around the age of 18.  We can often get urgent referrals at that stage.  Sometimes when they break down, the young person needs fairly practical support.  There are others in whose story of origin, for want of a better word, there has been such extreme neglect and loss.  At the end of the day, poverty is the biggest demon.  It will always drive the most complex problems.</p></speech>

When we have stood over &euro;117.70 being paid to those children, it feels criminal that we would watch young people who have ended up in a system probably because of poverty and then as a State we have entrenched them further in that poverty by not giving them the supports that they need.  It shows what a bad parent the State is in the first place.</p> <p>  A young lad whom I supported recently was eligible for CAS but then he met a girl and they had a child, and then they excluded him from the scheme.  Is that something that Ms Feeney comes up against much?  It is nearly like he was being denied the same supports because he was developing his own family and it changed his relationship with CAS.  I am wondering about young people's right to family life and them being excluded because their partner was not in care, they have had a child and they have changed the criteria on them.</p></speech>

This has become so unusual in our country that she has secure accommodation.  She is a woman who has been in care.  She has loads of potential.  Having that secure base and whatever support she needs going forward, she will have it.</p></speech>

It is geared towards single people.  Some of that flexibility will have to be worked out with local authorities.</p> <p>  CAS for care leavers is a limited scheme and, because we have the youth service threshold for the support needs, we are able to be a little elastic on it.  I recognise that for the extension of CAS for care leavers, and potentially for young people who have not been formally in care but have had acute needs, there probably needs to be a dedicated support system to go with that as well.  That is one of the tensions because it is just the housing without any support.  We are choosing, as a voluntary organisation, to continue to provide that support but we have a little flexibility because we have this other youth service in place.</p></speech>

Ms O'Hara mentioned the Scottish and Canadian models.  I would love to know what specific parts of that model should be implemented with urgency here to be able to address some of the issues.  Maybe someone can elaborate on the specialist support that they provide in respect of dual diagnosis.  More information on that would be great.</p></speech>

The basic principles are that every young person has a right to housing and that young people also have a right to housing without any preconditions.</p> <p>  Another important element of this model was a no-discharge policy into homeless services.  Many people can get scared by hearing that but the whole point of the model is that placements may break down and there may be times when a new solution may need to be explored with a young people but that the service or the workers will stay with that young person no matter where he or she is until another solution can be found.</p> <p>  Another part of it is that there are no time limits.  It is not like we have one or two years to sort this problem out but that there is no time limit.  That is what makes this specific model that I am talking about so important and what makes it work.</p> <p>  There are many examples from Scotland, Canada and the UK where this modelling has worked.  It is very simple.  It is long-term housing for young people.</p></speech>

I am fascinated that they have developed a model where all of the stakeholders are willing partners and they have been able to find accommodation and to have the wraparound supports.  How could I get this service going in Cork, for instance, which is where I am from?  I could see some challenges in breaking down the silos between all of the constituent partners that would be needed to come together on this.  Although not insurmountable, these are challenges nonetheless.  Have the Simon Community carried out research, either academic or their own, around the results and the follow-ons of individuals coming through the system?  How they are getting on now, because I would love to see this model replicated?  If I, as a public representative, could guide somebody into such a service, that would be meaningful for me instead of having to go through the usual frustrations that we experience as Deputies trying to advocate for our own people.</p> <p>  I would love to take their model.  I would love to engage in the research that they have carried out, if any, and bring it to Cork, for instance, and say that here is a model and it works.  It would force people to shake off their own preconceptions about young people who are presenting to them because often their experience is not a good one.  Ms Feeney crystallised it for me perfectly in terms of the snakes and ladders.  When somebody is vulnerable, it is easy for me to talk as I have the capacity to advocate for myself.  Not everybody else does and they need those support.  What is their perspective on how we could replicate this model and get the political buy-in for that?  I would welcome their views on that.  It is a big question and I am sorry for that.</p></speech>

The numbers began to creep up.  Young people were presenting to emergency services and all the services decided to take action.  It took one person to call the meeting to begin to explore the matter.  It took a bit of time to discuss what would be the shape of this and whether we could find a building.  Initially, we thought that we would make a CAS application but the local authority identified a group of apartments together.</p><p>The local authority renovated the apartments and, in turn, leased them to us.  Section 10 provides initial staffing.  There is also some funding from Tusla around that because a number of care placements break down when children reach 18 years of age.</p><p> As Galway Simon has evolved we have built a health and well-being team as part of our homeless services that are largely funded through social inclusion.  We have an addiction counsellor on staff.  We have had occupational therapy.  There is a specialist service that tries to get people back to work and have social integration.  Recently we have added a clinical psychologist to our team.  There are now more options and ways to problem solve.</p><p> Dual diagnosis is still pretty weak and we do not have a highly evolved system.  Addiction and mental health issues tend to be seen separately but we continue to advocate for dual diagnosis.</p></speech>

If placements break down then one must find an alternative.  Even if one has to be out one cannot stay in a unit with the person but a key worker will work with him or her to find an alternative.  Commitment is very important to young people because one will be tested on that for sure.</p></speech>

However, here we have a perfect solution that is not being rolled out to other parts of the country.  Today's meeting in public session has afforded us a great opportunity to hear people's views.</p></speech>

One of things that we are seeing with the increase in homelessness, which was alluded to by Ms Feeney, is the fact that young people are coming in whereas before they might have been stuck in a youth hostel.  Now, they have been rough sleeping and they are presenting to us.</p></speech>

We mentioned in our report that youth homelessness is often hidden because their social network tends to have greater flexibility.  It is easier to sleep on somebody's couch if one is a single woman or man.  It is easier for one's friends to find space if they are not in the same space as they may be later on in their lives so there is more capacity for people to move in and out of homelessness.  In the current crisis, that space is contracting so there is a rapidly increasing urgency to address youth homelessness.</p></speech>

Last week, I had a total emergency case of a young girl in her leaving certificate year who experienced homelessness because she had absolutely nowhere to go.  We were able to support her to provide a solution but I have received an increasing number of referrals as young people find themselves having to sleep in their cars or sleep out as they have absolutely nowhere to go.  At the moment the beds in Galway Simon are full and we do not have emergency accommodation for young people specifically.  As the committee members will all know, there are no emergency beds nationally.  Increasingly, we are seeing young people having absolutely nowhere to go.  Galway Simon was in the very lucky position of being able to support the girl I mentioned but had we not had a bed for her then I do not know what type of solution we could have looked at.</p></speech>

We are joined by Tusla representatives today - Mr. Bernard Gloster; chief executive officer; Ms Kate Duggan, national director, services and integration; Mr. Pat Smyth, national director, finance and corporate services; and Ms Clare Murphy, regional chief officer.  I believe we have two guests joining us online through Microsoft Teams as well - Ms Rosarii Mannion, director of people and change and Dr. Anthony O&rsquo;Leary, director of quality and regulation.  The representatives are all very welcome.</p> <p>  In advance of inviting our guests to deliver their opening statement, I advise them of the following in respect of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses who are participating from within the committee room are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  In the case of witnesses appearing virtually before the committee, there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege would apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a matter, it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Gloster to give his opening statement and then we will follow up with questions and answers. </p></speech>

Our staff and funded partners have many skillsets including psychological and social support capacity.  They have been very much present with other State agencies over the weekend and this will continue for as long as required.  All resources at our disposal and any additional resources required by our team there will be made available.  The collective trauma of the community will not be known for a time to come and we assure them as a State agency in their midst that we stand in solidarity with them ready to assist them in any way necessary into the future.  </p> <p>  I want to express my thanks to the committee members for their kind invitation to appear before them today. I am joined in the committee room by my colleagues, Ms Kate Duggan, Mr. Pat Smyth and Ms Clare Murphy, assisted by Ms Niamh Duddy, my business manager.  Other colleagues are online to assist should questions arise.  In the three matters covered in the committee's invitation, and recognising there are many other dimensions to our work, I want to make the following opening remarks.  </p> <p>  Since I last appeared before the committee in May, the agency has published the annual report in respect of 2021.  The year 2021 was again underscored by the effects of the pandemic on Irish society and as a critical service provider of front-line essential services for children and families, the agency&rsquo;s core focus was to ensure the continued delivery of these essential services.  In addition to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Tusla in 2021 was also severely impacted by the cyberattack on the HSE ICT network.  The agency&rsquo;s response required a large-scale operation.  </p> <p>  Against the backdrop of these challenges for the agency, the demand for services and support for children and families continued to increase during that year.  In addition to the increased referrals the agency also continued to provide all of its other statutory services in adoption, domestic sexual and gender-based violence, education welfare and support, regulation of early years services, and a whole range of family support services.  During the pandemic, we were able to ensure continuity of support for care leavers, particularly those who at the time could have had difficulty because of age or access to education supports at the height of lockdowns.  That period has again highlighted for us the many needs and challenges for care leavers and also the possibilities there are for more improvements.  The agency has made significant change and progress despite the challenges of the past two years.  New management and leadership at national and regional level is now established.  This means the agency is in a stronger position to deal with the challenges that are to be expected in statutory social services.</p><p>In 2021, the agency managed 73,069 referrals to child protection and welfare services.  There were 5,863 children in care at the end of 2021, 90% of whom were in foster care, while 23,807<b></b>children received a family support service in 2021.  A total of 3,059 young adults were in receipt of aftercare services at the end of 2021.  In the academic year running into 2021 our education support service worked with over 5,500<b></b>children.  Over 4,000<b></b>early years services and a range of other specialist activities for children were regulated by Tusla on behalf of the State.  <br/><br/>The second item on today's agenda is foster care compliance.  When I last appeared before the committee, I addressed several aspects of foster care and associated issues, resulting in a very productive engagement with members.  At that time, I advised the committee that Tusla was involved in developing its own overarching strategic plans for three elements of alternative care, that is, residential care, foster care and aftercare.  In my earlier appearance I provided the committee with the plan for residential care and committed to foster care being next. <br/><br/>Since that time and following extensive engagement, the board of the agency has now approved the foster care plan which I shared in recent days with members.  Implementing this ambitious plan will require support and decisions beyond the authority of Tusla.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister to actively supporting our efforts to improve foster care services for both the children and their carers.  Specifically in respect of compliance I advise members that our foster care services are inspected by HIQA in addition to our own internal governance systems.  Every effort is made to ensure that there is an appropriate level of attention to improving quality and increasing the oversight on important issues such as safeguarding.  HIQA has conducted successive themed inspections of foster care services and this has been essential in driving improvements.  <br/><br/>When we consider the totality of inspection reports in foster care since 2019, the improvement is in the order of a 34% increase in the number of compliant or substantially compliant findings measured against the HIQA standards.  The 34% increase relates to a Tusla aggregate of all HIQA foster care reports.  HIQA&rsquo;s own published overview reports clearly point to improvements and also some shortcomings still to be addressed.  I am conscious that all of this noted, there remain challenges in some of our local areas.  I assure members that there is a very strong focus on supporting those areas to reach compliance and this is part of the consistency challenge that the agency faces.  I am satisfied that where HIQA has identified deficits, we have developed plans for improvement and are taking steps to mitigate risks.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the many people who continue to put themselves forward as foster carers in what is an enormously selfless endeavour.  They, along with our dedicated staff, are what will ultimately ensure the quality of care for children. <br/><br/>On the issue of aftercare, I understand the committee raised this matter on foot of communication from the Simon Communities.  As noted earlier, having completed multi-annual improvement plans for residential care and foster care we are now in the consultation phase for similar in aftercare.  I look forward to this being finalised by January 2023.  In the meantime, members should note that 3,045 young people and adults up to 22 years of age, inclusive, were in receipt of aftercare services at the end of quarter 2 of 2022.  This is an increase of 10% from the end of 2019.  Almost half of those 18 to 22-year-olds in receipt of aftercare services at the end of quarter 2 had remained living with their carers, with a further smaller number returning home.  Approximately 76% of 18 to 22-year-olds in receipt of aftercare services at the end of quarter 2 of 2022 were in education or training.<br/><br/>Members should also note that 82% of all young adults in receipt of aftercare services at the end of quarter 2 of 2022 had an aftercare plan.  A full 92% of those with an aftercare plan were assessed as needing an aftercare worker and of these, 91% had an aftercare worker at the end of quarter 2.  There were 198 young adults awaiting an aftercare worker at that time.  However, the 198 awaiting an aftercare worker received attention from an aftercare manager.  I want to assure the committee of our continued efforts to assign aftercare workers to those young people who are in need of them.  All areas also operate a drop-in service and for the first six months of 2022 a total of 4,500 entries were recorded on the registers for drop-in services. There remain many challenges for care leavers and young adults who have left care.  Among those challenges are the issues of sustainable accommodation and adequate mental health supports.  We will continue to work with all other State agencies to advocate for improvements for young people leaving care.  <br/><br/>That concludes my opening remarks.  I am happy, together with my colleagues, to assist the committee with any questions arising.</p></speech>

I have lots of questions but will not have time to put them all to our guests.  Some of my questions seek clarification to help me understand a number of things.  Sometimes when one is supporting people or dealing with specific cases it can be unclear whether something is a policy, a statutory requirement or something else.  Let us take the example of a person who is 18 and is due to leave foster care, care outside the home or kin care.  The householder providing the care says that the young person, who may be about to start a post-leaving certificate course, can stay but that arrangement breaks down and the young person leaves at 19.  If the person does not take up aftercare between 18 and 19, does he or she lose the opportunity to take up accommodation or certain aftercare supports and services?  What happens in those circumstances?  I came across this recently and I did not know why that would happen.</p> <p>  The next issue I want to raise is the financial support which, as we know, only continues beyond the age of 21 if the person is in full-time education.  Some people will not be able for that in that moment but may be able for it later on, as a mature student.  They could be like myself and want to go to college in their late 20s when they feel safer and their head is a bit clearer.  Does Tusla believe that policy should be revised?  People who are not in education may possibly need more support than people who are, in terms of where they are in their lives.  Is there a suggestion here of the deserving versus the undeserving poor or care leaver?  The Shared Vision, Next Steps document and youth work legislation refer to those in the 18 to 24 age bracket.  Should we consider continuing with payments and with foster care placements until the age of 24?  What do the Tusla representatives think of that?</p> <p>  Are there specialised supports for asylum-seeking young people who are leaving care?  They will often be in a more precarious position than others in terms of family connections and community ties.  In relation to performance, a key objective outlined in Tusla's annual report is a consistent response across all services but in 2021 just 62% of cases awaiting allocation were active.  What steps are being taken to address that backlog?</p></speech>

I will let Ms Duggan deal with the questions around 18 to 19-year-olds and being able to access financial support if they do not access it at the start.</p> <p>  From a policy perspective there are two things that are helpful.  First, I agree with what is implied in the Senator's question, that is, that there needs to be a more adaptable and flexible approach to how we apply aftercare supports, as opposed to the traditionally rigid view involving full-time education and so on.  We have started to do that now and are funding an organisation called Way 2 Work which works with young people around their talents and skills and the possibility of apprenticeships.  They have major programmes going on in Dublin, Cork and Limerick at the moment and those involved in those programmes can get aftercare supports.  They do not have to be in formal education but we have a way to go with that.  </p> <p>  The second part or the flip side of that, which is something that carers and social workers have told us, is that we have to exercise some degree of caution.</p><p>When young people leave care at 18 and wish to leave care, we should try to support them to do that but not simply open up full access to a full aftercare allowance when they are not involved in any structured element of their lives because that type of access to that kind of money can be quite destructive when you are still at that fairly tender age.  It is a balancing piece.  I agree with the broad thrust of the question that there needs to be a much broader review than the limitations from where it came.

It is important that it is not just matter of the financial supports and that there is a much wider service to support them to access therapeutic services and housing if they have been in the care of the State for more than 12 months between the ages of 13 and 18.  Those are the broad parameters we have to work with under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015.  It is important that young people who have been known to us or who have been in care are entitled to access their aftercare support services, apart from the allowance.  In the case the Senator has described, if that young person has been in care, has dropped out of education or has deferred, he or she can access education until he or she is 19 years old, and the young person is still entitled to the same supports and services.</p></speech>

The overall improvement measured by HIQA and assessed as &ldquo;compliant&rdquo; and &ldquo;substantially compliant&rdquo; against the standards in child protection, residential care and foster care suggests to us we are moving in the right direction in terms of consistency.  We are now up to up to approximately 81% compliant in that.  This is a quite significant rating but it is nothing to be complacent about.</p> <p>  Where consistency is perhaps harder and a challenge for us, particularly on the unallocated cases, and we have made some improvements on the higher priority cases, is not just shared learning throughout the country but also, and this has been well rehearsed in this committee and in other forums I have been in, the issue of staff, demand on staffing, staff turnover and availability of staff.  This continues to present us with a challenge and that is the route.  If the workforce is not consistent, you are constantly trying to catch up with the new workforce to bring them on board.  It is a work in progress.  I am not going to say it is perfect because it is not.</p></speech>

To give an updated context, to date, 501 separated young people seeking international protection have presented to Tusla.  Some 224 of those were from Ukraine.  We are seeing an increase not only in the numbers fleeing war in Ukraine but also in the wider cohorts coming from a number of different countries.  Today, 174 of those young people are in placement and, of those, 65 are from Ukraine.  The same provisions within the Act apply in that, if they are there under section 5, the provision of accommodation, they are not then entitled to the aftercare allowance.  We certainly would give them aftercare supports, but they would then be entitled to the normal social protection allowances.  What is important is the amount of work we are doing on reunification, because that is the role Tusla has, together with our colleagues in the Department of Justice, to support those young people to reunify with their families.</p></speech>

I contrast that with Wales, which has begun a trial or pilot for a universal basic income for all care leavers, regardless of their situation.  There can be high-quality aftercare supports if a young person is leaving care in education and training.  It is often those who are the most vulnerable and the most needy who struggle either to get into or maintain a place or who just are not ready for education, but given the way things are set up, they are often ones not getting as high a level of service.  The Welsh experiment is an interesting one we should be looking at here.  I appreciate the challenges of some of that.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear Tusla say, and I echo what Senator Ruane said, that it has to be asked how many 26-, 27-, 28- or 29-year-olds in the general population are still at home and still getting support from their parents.  In a situation where the State, through Tusla, is the corporate parent, we should be looking at not just the challenges presenting in terms of housing supply but at extending that upper age limit for aftercare generally.  I appreciate that may not be entirely in Tusla&rsquo;s gift and we should be talking to the Minister about that, but certainly, based on the witnesses' comments, it sounds as though Tusla is supportive of that.  For me, the challenge is what more we can do for those young people who are struggling, who are perhaps more chaotic or who have had a more difficult journey through care and are struggling to engage with aftercare.  There are many sources looking at that.</p> <p>  One of the other issues I would look at is in terms of performance.  I know I have spoken before about demand, anticipation and workforce planning, and I underline the need for that, because if we can do that and publish it, it will give us a yardstick against which to measure our performance and it can be very useful.  It also, in terms of recruitment, puts it up to the Minister and to the universities about whether we are delivering enough trained social workers.  One of the questions, and I do not know whether the witnesses can shed any light on this, is whether we are training enough social workers.  If we are not, then why not?  Is it because of a lack of demand or a lack of places?  Where is the bottleneck there?</p> <p>  I have spoken quite a lot about foster care.  We had a positive engagement with some stakeholders, and I am sure the representatives from Tusla were watching, who all clearly identified the need to do more.  The strategy the Tusla representatives spoke about is welcome but there were other things identified that could be done.  Outside of the strategy and in response to that session, what will Tusla be taking on board and committing to deliver in the coming years?</p></speech>

That is very clear, and I do not disagree with his observation one bit about the Welsh approach.  My earlier comments would not be to say that I think any care leaver should be without support.  I was simply talking about the quantum of the allowance in somebody's life at a time where there may be chaos.  It has had a destructive effect as well as a helpful effect.  However, in the main, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view.  To put it clearly on the record, I do think 23 and 24 are too young to stop support, considering that young people who have come through the care system have not even come through all of what might considered to be the normal range of supports and attachments in life, and therefore it is well beyond that.  I take most of my reference points from meeting with care leavers such as Empowering People in Care, EPIC, the Irish Aftercare Network and others and I listen carefully to what they say.  Ultimately, they will be the experts who will shape the policy I have spoken about that we will be rewriting between now and Christmas.  To be fair to the Minister, he has been very open to and welcoming of that.  He genuinely has.</p> <p>  There is a direct correlation between workforce planning and improved performance.  We now have a robust people strategy.  However, as to the Deputy&rsquo;s question whether we are producing enough social workers, the answer is, &ldquo;No, we are not&rdquo;.  Why not?  There has been a traditional base of the development of programmes in the universities.  I recently met with the Secretary General of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The chair of Tusla has also met with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The Secretary General of the Department has moved on certain matters to try to progress them.  I am open to a wide range of options that will develop social work capacity and supply into the future right across our personal social services, and not just Tusla.  We have to be open to things like apprenticeship models, sponsorship models and others.</p><p>If we simply continue to produce the number we are producing then myself and my many successors, and the successors of Deputy Costello, will be speaking about the shortage of social workers in Ireland.  We have to change the supply pattern.  We also need to change the methodology so we have multidisciplinary teams led by social workers in response to children.  We must resource social workers with other key resources that can help them with different approaches to caseloads and case types.  This year we are employing 20 speech and language and occupational therapists to work exclusively with children in care teams.  This will make a difference to what social workers can do for children.  It will make a difference to their case management.</p><p> On the foster care plan I will ask Ms Duggan to speak on what she is prioritising for 2023.  I have heard foster carers categorically and loudly and clearly in recent weeks on some of their dissatisfaction.  We have heard this and she has spoken to several hundred of them.  There are improvements we can make immediately.  Perhaps she will give a sense of what we have prioritised coming into 2023.</p></speech>

The need for support came across very strongly in the forum.  This is not just financial support from Tusla but other supports such as access to therapeutic services and better training.  It is about better communication.  Foster carers need more robust communication.  They need to feel they are partners in the approach to care planning for the children in their care.  It comes back to the need for consistency in how they access services and the types of services and supports they can get.  In the coming years we are on course to implement more than 29 recommendations of the plan.  They are very much about our vision of ensuring that 90% of children remain in foster care.  More than this, it is looking at new models.  We have looked at models in Wales, Scotland, Canada and Australia with regard to how we support foster care places, in particular those where foster carers are finding it difficult to continue to support and where young people in foster care are finding it difficult to remain in placements.  We are looking at consistency in service provision in all of our business supports to make it much easier for foster carers to receive a consistent support service.  It is an ambitious plan but we are committed to implementing all of these recommendations.  These recommendations will go a long way to dealing with the issues that have been raised.</p></speech>

I want to speak about foster carers.  I received correspondence from a foster carer who is also a social worker.  She wrote to me in a private capacity.  In her letter she states her worry is that many foster carers will not be able to continue to do what they do and that it will not be affordable for people to consider becoming foster carers, especially as fostering impacts on a carer's ability to be available for other paid work.  She has layered much more into the letter but this is the kernel of it for me.</p> <p>  Mr. Gloster has stated that Tusla's strategic plan on foster care services was approved by the Tusla board on Friday, 30 September 2022.  I will reflect some of what I have heard from foster carers about the letter issued to them.  They found the letter extremely patronising.  It is important that Tusla hears this because it is what I have been hearing from foster carers.  They engaged in what they thought was a meaningful process after which one of the recommendations was an increase in allowances and financial and other supports.  This is highlighted in the letter from Tusla to them.  Mr. Gloster and Ms Duggan said they heard loud and clear what the foster carers said.  The budget came after this.  All that arose for foster carers from the budgetary process, in which I assume Tusla was directly involved with its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was an allowance of &euro;325 or &euro;350.  Did Tusla, through its parent Department, make a specific recommendation that the allowances to foster carers should be increased in budget 2023?</p></speech>

If this is the case and we have the proof of it, we can ask where the Department was in its engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We can ask why we have been left with a situation whereby foster carers feel extremely patronised by the fact the allowance was a paltry sum by any objective analysis.  The great job they do is acknowledged in the language that is used but concrete supports are not forthcoming in real terms.  I acknowledge there is a strategic plan but I am not sure whether, following what happened with the budget, foster carers now have confidence in that.  There is a political element to this.  There needs to be engagement with Government parties on the non-delivery of supports.  If it is the case that Tusla has actively advocated then, I say "fair play" to it.  This must be acknowledged and there is a line of questioning that must be pursued with the Minister.</p> <p>  What is happening with Positive Care Ireland?  Has it been wound down?

I am happy to answer the question without the papers in front of me.  I addressed the committee in May on the matter.  Positive Care Ireland notified us of its intention to dispose of its interest in its business.  Equally, it engaged in a process in which it sought to secure the sale or transfer of the company to another provider.  A provider engaged with Positive Care Ireland and successfully negotiated whatever terms it did.  The provider has successfully engaged with Tusla and registered as a provider with it.  I gave an undertaking to the Deputy at the time, when he made active and appropriate representation, and I gave an undertaking to the committee.  Our sole focus at the time were the children who were in care in the Positive Care Ireland houses.  Our hope now is that the new provider, who is in our open tender process, will be able to expand the offering to other children and young people.  Our regulations service and our operational service are actively engaged with the provider.  It is challenging of course, as it is for every provider, but I believe it is working quite well.</p></speech>

I think that is based on the fact that the young person is technically in the care of Tusla rather than the family, so he or she must wait on the list even if the foster family wants to get a private assessment.  I am curious to know what is the case with that.</p> <p>  Another issue we spoke about previously is not getting the back-to-school allowance when a child is in foster care.  That seems like an outrageous reality at the moment.</p> <p>  Another main point that was raised in the discussion on foster care is the importance of a consistent key worker in a young person's life.  That aligns with evidence from the Simon Communities of Ireland today with particular reference to young people in the foster care process.  What measures are being taken by Tusla to ensure children in foster care have access to the same support workers, as much as is viable?</p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise concerns family resource centres, FRCs.  They are a vital support service for vulnerable groups across the country.  We are lucky to have so many of them, but they are running on threadbare budgets.  The centres in Bandon and Skibbereen in my constituency are in desperate need of permanent locations.  From a strategic point of view, what is Tusla going to do to fund and ensure the development of FRCs, which are such an integral part of the support for people in the medium and long term?  Those bodies are entirely dependent on funding from Tusla.  I am not aware of whether Tusla is dealing with them.  Some FRCs are in HSE-owned buildings and others are not.  I do not know how to help or support groups that need a permanent home.</p></speech>

It is difficult when there is a high staff turnover.</p> <p>  On the assessment of need, I want to be very careful not to stray across the definition of "assessment of need" as intended under the Disability Act.  I know that has been a subject of significant debate in this committee with my colleagues in the HSE.  In the general sense, if somebody in a care placement has a pressing need for a particular type of assessment that is not available publicly or in a timely way, we try to support that and help to secure it privately.  I would be the first to say to the Deputy that I do not believe that is consistent across the country.  That is part of what we are now trying to change so that the experience is the same for every foster carer.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that, in general, if there is general agreement that a child needs an assessment of need in the broadest definition of that phrase and it is very clear that he or she cannot wait on the public list or for other availability, we will assist foster carers and children to secure that, but I would not say that is consistent in the way we would want it to be.</p></speech>

We try to rely on what the professionals in the case say as well.  There can be times when there are conflicting views between all of the people involved on what is the best approach to the child's needs.</p> <p>  I spoke with the Minister only two weeks ago about FRCs.  He is considering if it is possible for 2024 to look at another round of the FRC programme.  In the meantime, we continue to fund them.  This year, we increased the core funding by 4%, which is what was available to us to do that.  There are other agencies that also fund them as well, so it can be a mixed bag, depending on where they operate.  In some places the local authority funds them and in other places the HSE funds them.  We are committed to FRCs because they take a very collective and holistic approach to supporting people in communities.</p></speech>

They might get very small, minor grants but capital funding specific to FRCs is not available.  Many of them grew up out of local initiatives and might have started in a local authority building, if one was available.  What I generally try to do with the family resource programme is to encourage a multi-agency approach in the State.  If we put up the money to staff the FRC, I would also have a clear expectation that organisations such as the local authority, the HSE, and the Department of Social Protection would consider what possibilities they have to support it because such centres are supposed to be multi-agency and multifactorial.  They are not just in the children and family space.  There are no easy answers to the question on capital funding.  I have not personally heard of an FRC that is on the brink.</p></speech>

I accept the point about there being multi-agency responsibility, but ultimately that means no one is responsible.  That is the problem.  One of the FRCs has had to move location six times in a short period.  The manager, who Mr. Gloster mentioned is funded by Tusla, has brought the stuff into their own home while looking for another property.  The service has been disrupted.  The centre is in a perfect location now but it can only get a one-year lease every time.</p></speech>

I want to be clear, as I do not want to raise expectations, that the funding, including capital funding, of FRCs is a much bigger piece than for Tusla itself.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>  In our recent discussions with the Minister, he was very committed to seeing if he could unplug the piece concerning the back-to-school allowance.</p> <p>  I know there has been much criticism of the foster carer's allowance recently.  I am sorry to hear that people are communicating to Deputy Sherlock that they felt patronised in some way.  The foster care allowance is approximately &euro;350 or &euro;325 depending on the age of the child.  It also comes with the proviso that it is totally tax free and it is not assessable as means for any other social welfare payment.  It is separate to considerations on children's allowance and other issues.  There were considerations built into it at the time but time has moved on and we need to review it and look at it in a different way.  As I outlined, we fully support that.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Murphy to comment on the consistency of support workers, and also the issue of the assessment of need consent raised by Deputy Costello.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.945" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#M02100"><p>The first thing I would say about consistency is that it is our wish that every single foster carer would have what we call a link social worker, which is an allocated social worker to offer them support.  Unfortunately, due to recruitment and retention issues, that is not always possible.  In scenarios like that, we try never to have what we call a dual unallocated case.  If a social worker is allocated to a child, as a temporary measure, we ask the social worker to support the foster carer until such time as we can allocate a social worker.  It is our wish to have a social worker - what we call a link worker - but it is not always possible.  Sometimes we can get a team leader, who is the manager, to offer support.</p> <p>  Regarding enhanced rights and the assessment, in a scenario where a foster carer is awarded enhanced rights and wants an assessment with which Tusla is in agreement about providing, I am not sure why Tusla would not have funded it.  I do not understand what the particular issue is because if a foster carer has enhanced rights, consent is not an issue.  What were the circumstances in the case the Deputy raises?</p></speech>

If a family wants to pay privately for an assessment of need, I am told they cannot because they are not the guardian; Tusla is.

When we were before the committee last time, we spoke about the development of our therapeutic services.  We have just moved to a point whereby five of our six regional therapeutic co-ordinators will look at bringing consistently to how therapy provision and the assessment of need is undertaken in respect of young people in foster care.  That should bring consistency and clarity to the process.  If there is an issue, I ask the Deputy to bring it to our attention offline.</p></speech>

The statutory amount we paid out on foster care last year was &euro;86 million, which was for all kids under 18 years.  For aftercare, we paid out &euro;27 million, an increase of approximately &euro;2.5 million on the previous year, which has been an increasing trend in recent years.  On other care costs, which include adoption, etc., we paid out approximately &euro;8 million.  We paid a total of &euro;121 million in statutory care last year.  In addition, we had private foster care provision with approximately 500 children in the care of private care or managed through private foster carers, to whom we paid out just under &euro;25 million.  In total, between the statutory payments for foster care, aftercare and independent or private foster carers, the figure amounts to roughly &euro;145 million.  The Deputy raised another question about private residential.</p></speech>

We talked about the need to increase the payment for foster carers.  For one thing, there is a rising cost of living and there has not been an increase in the payment in a long time.  In the context of the percentage of children in foster care is going down and the percentage of those going into residential care is rising, the cost to be in residential care is &euro;6,000 versus the small payment to be in foster care.  What is the cost of having a child in residential care versus the cost of having a child in a foster family?  It is being pushed for them to do this on a budget, and we know it makes sense for better outcomes for children, but from a budgetary perspective, it costs ridiculously more to have a child in residential care instead.  Does it not make budgetary sense for the Government to increase the pay for foster families?  I do not understand.</p></speech>

The cost of a child in residential care, be it private or in our services, is approximately &euro;7,000 per week.  The complexity of care-----</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;350,000 would cover the cost of one child in a residential placement for one year.  That is a different scenario from a child in a normal foster care placement and the numbers reflect that.  As was said earlier, 90% of our kids are in standard foster care arrangements.  The 10% of children who are in other arrangements have more complex needs.  It is not done on a straightforward money basis and we have never argued that it is on a one-for-one money basis, but I take the Deputy's point in that the cost to the State of children in foster care is much lower than kids in residential care.</p></speech>

She is correct in that the minimum cost of having a child in residential care is between &euro;6,000 and &euro;7,000 per week.  There are some exceptional cases, which we call special emergency arrangements, that could run up to &euro;24,000 per week in some cases.  It is important to be on the level about that.  The capitation rate for the provider of private foster care is approximately &euro;1,200 per week.  The foster parents still get the same amount whether it is public or private, but the cost to the State is approximately &euro;1,200 per week, and then there is the cost to the State of public foster care.</p> <p>  I am sure Deputy Costello with his professional background will understand this but part of the difficulty is that it is not a zero-sum game, and I would not want to reduce the narrative to that.  Apart from retaining foster carers or, indeed, residential care settings, we are increasingly seeing a different and complex context from which some children coming into State care present.  A small number will require increasingly intensive services that come at an enormous cost.  The answer to that, as I recently said in a media interview, is not simply in Tusla. </p></speech>

I am in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency and Deputy Cairns is in Cork so there must be an issue.  It is good that it has been raised, and we will leave it with the representatives.  I have come across this recently.</p></speech>

I am from the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, as is the Chair.  How many social workers are there in counties Carlow and Kilkenny?  The pressure for social workers, because we need so many more, has become a significant issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  The foster care allowance rate of &euro;325 for a child under 12 and &euro;352 for a child over 12 has not risen since 2009.  Private foster care, about which I was speaking to the Taoiseach, costs up to &euro;7,000.  I have spoken to foster mothers recently about their issues and I have to give them credit.  We all listen to "Talk to Joe" on "Liveline".  The amount of information I got while driving to Dublin was another factor that brought this issue home to me.  Foster mothers did not say it to me, and I have to be politically correct in this, but I felt from speaking to them there was a fear there that if they were to say too much, they could lose their children.  That was a concern for me and it really worried me.  I recall thinking that they were not saying it, yet I could sense a fear there.  Some said that when they have looked for money for special food, beds or school assistance, they were told they would not receive it, but this beats all.</p> <p>  One lady looked for an occupational therapist privately, because the waiting list was so long, and she got a quote for one.  The next thing, the social worker came back to her and told her to get three quotes, which meant she had to look into bordering counties such as Wicklow and other areas.  That is unacceptable and must be called to a halt.  She got the price for an occupational therapist, but then they looked for two more quotes.  I said, "No, that cannot be allowed to happen".  This is an issue I wish to raise with Mr. Gloster, if that is okay.</p></speech>

I refer to the cost-of-living crisis.  There was such love among the foster mothers I spoke to, but equally such love among the children as well.  It is a situation where it is important for us to have more social workers, but this is mainly about the children.  They are my main priority, and we must ensure we have as many foster families as possible.  In that regard, in the context of the cost-of-living crisis we, as politicians, must ensure we do all we can to support foster carers and that extra funding is provided for them.  This needs to happen.</p><p> Another point raised with me was aftercare for children, perhaps related to college or further supports.  Representatives of the Simon Community were with us before Mr. Gloster and his colleagues joined us.  We spoke with them about the issue of adults over 18 falling between the cracks and into homelessness.  I feel this is the case, and I have said we need more joined-up thinking between Tusla, local authorities and the HSE.  There must be full reform in this context.  I reiterate that when working with people the biggest issue I have found is that it is not possible for them to go on the housing list because they have no addresses and equally impossible for them to go on social welfare for the same reason.  If people want a medical card in that context, what card can be given?  I am not blaming anyone for the lack of joined-up thinking, because we could all blame each other.  We all have a duty of care in this regard.  I ask, therefore, that we set in train some sort of joined-up thinking process with all the different agencies.  I ask that this possibility be examined.  </p><p> Returning to the issue of children in care going to college, I raise the issue of what further supports are available in this type of situation, whether that might involve allowances or whatever.  Another point raised with me was that not everybody, whether living within care with a foster family or not, wishes to go to college.  As Mr. Gloster said, some people may want to be apprentices or to take up something like that.  What kind of funding and supports can be availed of by people who do not wish to go to college but might wish to do something else?  </p><p> I thank all the witnesses for coming in.  We are all passionate about this topic.  One of my family is a foster carer and I am very much aware of what is happening in this area.  I therefore think we can do much more.  My bottom line is that everyone needs to work together to see what we can do.</p></speech>

On the joined-up thinking point, I ask Ms Duggan to comment on what is going on with the housing strategy, because we have a clear input into that policy.  Before that, however, I will comment briefly regarding the Deputy's contribution.</p> <p>  I not only accept that the Deputy heard what she referred to, but I also saw some reference to it on social media as well.  As the CEO of a State agency, I wish to be very clear, and I am very clear with my staff, that no foster carer in Ireland need fear any type of reprisal and, if it is happens, it will not be in my name.  Foster carers advocate for what they believe is right.  If I thought for one minute this would run to the extent of someone interfering in a case management decision, I assure the Deputy I would take the most serious view of it.  I assure foster carers that they can use their own names and advocate and they are quite welcome to do so.</p></speech>

Of course we will, because it is equally important that public confidence is appropriately informed.</p> <p>  On the question of additional supports to foster carers, in the last year, on top of the ordinary allowances, we paid &euro;3.1 million in additional supports to 800 foster carers.  It is not, therefore, that the system is devoid of a willingness to wish to provide support for foster carers.  It is not the case that there is a prejudiced view against supporting them.  I just think the process is not consistent or structured enough.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, he has been very supportive of us providing him with a plan to get this approach right.  It would be disingenuous of me not to note this aspect.</p> <p>  As I said, we have now introduced Way 2 Work Ireland, a specialised organisation, because many young people do not want to go to college.  We must support them as well.  These are people leaving our care and they are entitled to the same support, love and affection as anybody else would be in any set of circumstances, whether they go on to college or never go anywhere.  As I said to Deputy Costello, though, there must be a point where we try to manage the safety of children at that vulnerable age.  This is a challenge for us.</p></speech>

It is a programme where we have doubled our funding in the past two years.  It is targeted at supporting those hard-to-reach young people who find it difficult to access training or support.  In this period, 148 young people have undertaken mentoring who had not been able to access education or training, and 53 have now secured employment.  Training and education has been accessed by 408 young people overall through that programme.  These were young people unable to access the traditional routes to education and training.  Apprenticeships and training were arranged with key industry partners, including John Sisk &amp;amp; Son Limited and the Construction Industry Federation.  This is, therefore, a positive, good news story.  We have doubled our funding in this regard because this programme is working well in supporting those young people who have found it difficult to access education.</p> <p>  Turning to the inter-agency element, it is important to state first that in all our areas we now have an aftercare steering committee.  It has members from the HSE, local authorities and Tusla and is concerned with assessing the wider needs of young people as part of their aftercare plan.  As Mr. Gloster said, we have made a significant representation regarding and have had significant input into this process, along with the advocacy groups, such as Empowering People in Care, EPIC, and Care Leavers Ireland, and all the Departments in respect of the youth homelessness strategy being launched in November this year.  It has ambitious targets concerning this inter-agency aspect in the context of the preventative element of youth homelessness and concerning how we respond to the existing problem.  Tusla has just opened our first semi-independent living unit as well, in Donegal.  We are going to try to support young people in care aged over 16 in semi-independent living by providing accommodation and supporting services.  We have just recently opened this pilot project.  We have four people there, but there is capacity for nine.  </p></speech>

I have not yet managed the ability to bilocate and I was speaking during debates in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p> <p>  I read the opening statements before I came in.  I have also listened to what I could of the meeting.  One area I wish to focus on especially is that of the challenges encountered in accessing mental health supports by young people who leave care.  This problem has come up regularly.  Most young people experience mental health difficulties between the ages of 16 and 25.  Some 75% of people experience their first mental health difficulties between those ages.  The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, now only provides a service for moderate to acute mental health difficulties up to the age of 18.  There is often then a cliff edge for young people in that service.  They are either referred into the adult mental health services and left waiting for those, or sometimes the care they might receive in the adult mental health services is not the same as what would have been received in the CAMHS system, if those young people were lucky enough to be able to access it.  Is this something the witnesses may have experience of?  I will have a second question on this topic as well.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.983" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#O01500"><p>I need to be fair.</p><p>I addressed that here previously.  I want to make two distinctions when we talk about mental health and well-being.  Mental health and well-being need increasing attention, certainly, for every young person we encounter and perhaps for many more we do not encounter.  All of us as a society have become attuned to the pressures on young people.  I agree with all the strategies for trying to support people wherever they gather, whether that is through schools or youth clubs.  The maximum training we can give to people who interact with young people around mental well-being and those types of issues is something we should continue to pursue.</p><p> With regard to mental health, when it moves somewhat more into the sharper phase and, potentially, with mental illness, there is no doubt that there are challenges for young people who experience difficulty having, as it where, a diagnosis which allows them access to services under the Act, be it with CAMHS or with the transition to adulthood.</p><p> As stated earlier, when young people are leaving care and when they leave care, there are probably two significant challenges they face.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned the interagency requirement causing us all to be on our game much more than perhaps we are at times.  Those challenges are with regard to mental health support and sustainable accommodation, which very often go hand in glove with the young people I meet.  I meet young people who have left the care system who tell me categorically that the worry and difficulty and the additional pressure on them partly comes from that pressure around sustainable accommodation.  As the Deputy knows having long been an advocate for it, sustainable accommodation does not just mean a dry, warm place to put one's head at night.  It is a whole community and set of supports.  Therefore, I cannot but agree with the Deputy that it is a challenge for us.  It is one we must keep pursuing, and we do keep pursuing it and trying to find strategies to help young people.  To be fair to colleagues in the mental health services, they do try to help as well.  I do not think people turn their backs.  However, there are limitations to the mental health legislation that certainly do not help with some of the situations to which we try to respond.</p></speech>

Mr. Gloster touched on the alignment of services, which is really important.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that CAMHS should be extended to young people right up to the age of 25 to stop that kind of cliff-edge scenario about which I spoke.  In that context, will Tusla ever be in a position to extend that aftercare service to young people up to the age of 25 to have that joined-up thinking about which Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke that will help stop young people falling through the cracks?  What barriers would Tusla face in bringing that forward?  Is a cultural shift perhaps needed in how we provide care for young people?  What resources would Tusla need to provide that service?  I know it is a big shift.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.986" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#P00300"><p>There are two parts to that.  The first thing, and I genuinely say this from anecdotal evidence as well as from all the data we collect, is that I am enormously proud of the aftercare workers we have throughout Ireland both working for Tusla and for funded partners.  Many of them form relationships with the young people that go well beyond the limitations of the formal 23 years of education.  Sometimes, those relationships can be so important for many years after.  I am so enormously proud of that, and I could never say enough about it.  We must do more of that, however, and perhaps enable it to be formalised more.</p> <p>  During Covid-19, we introduced a system whereby anybody who was turning 23 and about to formally leave aftercare could stay in the provision and support system if he or she wished.  That was one of the things we learned, which I believe will help when we come to produce the aftercare plan at the end of this year, just like the foster care plan.  The Minister has really indicated a very strong commitment to trying to look at that and ask about the totality of government; not just Tusla but the totality of government in our social welfare, housing, childcare and education systems.  What is the totality we can do that recognises the importance of the challenge for people who grow up in State care and who leave State care?  One of the natural conclusions to that will be an extension of that very strict limitation that is in place the moment on formal supports stopping at the age of 23.</p></speech>

I attended a conference last week in Denmark on youth mental health.  One of the recommendations in Tusla's report is with regard to a pilot programme to explore new models on international best practice.  What areas of best practice are out there at the moment that Mr. Gloster thinks would help?  I heard numerous ideas at the conference I attended that I was able to bring back to my team.  I would be interested in this particular area.  What best practice is there internationally at the moment?</p></speech>

In some countries, we almost see a professionalisation of foster carers in terms of them being employed as full-time carers providing a foster care service.  In other countries, we are looking at a much more significant wraparound service to foster carers where key workers go into the home to support foster carers, especially where young people are presenting with more complex needs and more challenging behaviour.</p> <p>  We have set out a plan and certainly, colleagues who work with me in the areas of policy and practice look at taking the best of those models and working with foster carers.  That is what is really important.  This plan was developed in consultation with a couple of hundred foster carers.  It is about working with those foster carers and piloting models.  There are models around peer support where we employ foster carers to become peer supporters to other foster carers.  I do not think it will be one size fits all.  A the moment, we are looking at maybe piloting three of those models with foster families to see whether they make a difference in the context of what foster carers are telling us they need and what we know the children and young people in their care need.</p></speech>

Ms Duggan spoke about the professionalisation of foster carers, which reminded me of something several foster carers said to me to the effect that if the weekly allowance were to be turned into an annual salary, it would amount to approximately &euro;18,500, which is not much of a salary given the level of work they do.  If we are going down that route of classifying them as professionals and acknowledging their work and professionalisation, the level of allowance they get speaks volumes.</p> <p>  I would like to drill into one thing and then I have another question.  Ms Duggan spoke about the rising complexity, which is something that has been acknowledged a variety of times.  Does Ms Duggan have any insight or research into why that is?  A couple of things come to mind that I would like to explore.  One is that we have anecdotal information about, say, children coming into care later, which breeds more trauma and gives rise to more complex needs.  Equally, science and safety say that we should have family support plans.  The children coming into care have already had this and had it not work in terms of meeting their needs.  Obviously, those needs will be more complex further down the line.  What is happening outside Tusla's control that is contributing to that?  I appreciate that there may be plenty of things Tusla does not have control over that contribute to the complexity.  These would be important for this committee to know about to raise with the Minister or for us to raise in other ways.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to consistency.  One piece that came into my head was foster care committees.  I could open up a can of worms here and go off in all sorts of different directions but I will try not to.  However, one of the issues with-----</p></speech>

One of the things we spoke about at the foster care hearing was with regard to private arrangements and these sorts of things.  They sometimes come up because a child can be in a good enough place but we know the person will not pass the committee.  Are the committee or Tusla's internal politics becoming roadblocks to recruitment?  We might look at, for example, how some foster care committees place great weight on a potential carer's body mass index, BMI, as part of the assessment, and really spend much time thinking, talking about and considering the foster carer's BMI whereas other committees do not.</p><p>I am not sure BMI is a reflection of the ability to parent; I certainly hope not.</p><p> My other point concerns the policy on needing two parents.  One must be at home and two cannot be working.  Given the wider demographic changes impacting recruitment, should we be trying to be more flexible in this regard?</p><p> Why are things more complex?  What is going on both inside and outside?  What is the position on consistency across foster care committees?  Have internal policy roadblocks to recruitment been identified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.998" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022101100002#Q00200"><p>On the question on the foster care committee and consistency, I will ask Ms Murphy to respond in a moment.<br/><br/>On the issue of complexity and the context, as referred to by the Deputy and me earlier, it is important to deal with the matter in a fairly stark way.  I will do so if I can.  When children enter care in an unplanned or emergency way, through a Garda section 12 arrangement or the out-of-hours team at night, we have a number of standard placements available to them.  We have about 25 foster care families and about 16 residential care beds.  These comprise our standard emergency provision.  Unfortunately, we now have the context of what we call the special emergency arrangement.  Today we have 40 young people in this category.  There were 35 last May and the number rose to 60 during the summer.  There were 44 last week.  Today we have 40 young people whom we are trying to safely connect to placements from one day to the next.  They are in care placement arrangements, be it in a holiday home, hotel or any other type of arrangement we can come up with, with two or three staff, depending on their needs.  We should leave aside the issue of the cost because I believe that is the last consideration.<br/><br/>On the research, we drilled very carefully into what in the lives of the young people has meant nobody else could safely care for them.  Residential care staff could not cope and those involved in foster care placements could not cope.  The factors in the young people&rsquo;s lives were drugs, crime, suicidal ideation, mental health issues, emotional issues, behavioural issues, trauma, domestic violence and multiple placement breakdowns.  Ten had six of these factors in their lives at the time of the special arrangement.  One had eight, and one had all nine.  This reflects the immense challenge in the context I talk about.<br/><br/>I did an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i>two weeks ago.  I am not a social worker, as members know.  In the interview, I was asked what the answer was.  I have to be very clear that I do not know what it is.  I know what my professional staff tell me is necessary to try to keep the youth safe today and ground them in such a way that we can hopefully reconnect them to a placement.  I have no doubt that coming into care late would be a feature somewhere.<br/><br/>The other shocking thing we saw was that 77% of the young people were volunteered into care as teens, usually well above 14 or 15 years of age.  Some 76% of them went into care during the Covid pandemic.  The Deputy referred to the circumstances right at the height of lockdown and other limitations in life.  With probably stretched families who were just about holding it together, things fractured and broke.  The factors are quite significant.  It is important that we do not stereotype the young people or demonise them in any way.  The factors in their lives were factors that were imposed on them; they are not factors of their own imposition.<br/><br/>Let me refer to the supports for these types of people this year.  Let us say there is a consistent number requiring care of 40 to 45, with some going out of the system and some new ones coming in.  There were about 900 admissions to care last year.  While the number of cases in question might be small, it is very significant in the sense of how all State agencies are challenged to respond.  My concern with regard to the special arrangements is that we have spent &euro;22 million so far this year.  When I part with the money, my question concerns the outcome for those concerned and the value of the intervention.  Right now, it is just about keeping the young people safe.  When the Deputy asks me about the context from which the kids are coming, that is it.  I realise it sounds brutally raw to say it and that the Deputy will understand the spirit in which I am saying it.  We have to talk about what life means for some young people today beyond the scope of our traditional child-protection understanding.<br/><br/>Ms Murphy will discuss foster care committees.</p></speech>

Mr. Gloster is talking about very extreme, complex needs.  The number of youths in question, 44 out of 6,000 or so, is a reflection of the extent of the issue.  It is similar to the number in special care, who would have similar complex needs and a similar history of presentation.  From the way Mr. Gloster talks &ndash; he should correct me if I am wrong on this &ndash; the typical caseload of a typical social worker in a typical local office is also becoming more complex.</p></speech>

He will know that, from the commencement of the Child Care Act 1991, public policy and professional discourse and all that go with them reflect the view that, where at all possible, a child should be maintained in his or her own family and community.  Sometimes supporting the family and community involves taking a mature risk.  Sometimes that will work and sometimes it will disrupt or break in the teen years.  There is always a debate over whether a young person should go into care a lot earlier.  Practitioners always raise it with me.  It is a very hard question to answer because the fundamental aim is to try to keep a child or young person at home with his or her family.  The extent to which this can be done while at the same time avoiding complexity is a feature.</p> <p>  Beyond the 50 or 60 special emergencies, Ms Murphy will refer to the complexity that the Deputy is talking about in respect of the general in-care and child-protection population that we respond to.  Certainly, we have seen substantial increases in the past two years in the context of mental health issues and disability that is not responded to or not responded to early enough.  Domestic violence has also been an issue.  Referrals owing to domestic violence are growing exponentially.</p></speech>

Traditionally, they had to be married and own their own home.  We definitely have moved from that.  We have just come off the back of a campaign to recruit a diverse range of foster carers.  We were very clear that carers could be married or unmarried, own their own homes or not, be working or not, be in same-sex relationships or be foreign.  We are looking for a more diverse range of foster carers.  We absolutely accept that the traditional model is not what we are using.</p> <p>  On foster care committees being diverse, the first thing I would say about the BMI is that most foster care committees have a GP or medical adviser.  Having been on foster care committees, I hope that is the person who should be speaking about the BMI.  We strive for consistency and standardisation.  When HIQA inspects us, its representatives sit at a meeting of a foster care committee and give us feedback.  We have the means of doing that.</p> <p>  On the diversity and complexity of the cases of young people, I believe hidden harm is a significant issue.  I refer to the hidden harms of addiction and domestic violence.  Whether there are more of these or whether we know more about them, I do not know the answer academically.  Anecdotally, however, I believe it is a combination of both.  On the basis of a number of public incidents or tragedies, I believe we are seeing an increase in violence in society.</p></speech>

We are considering widening the front door of Tusla in terms of the multidisciplinary workforce that Mr. Gloster referred to.  In five of the areas where we are quite concerned, where we had unallocated cases regarding which we knew there were significant needs, particularly owing to hidden harm and domestic violence, we established a new care pathway for the children.  The children might previously have been described as &ldquo;high need but low harm&rdquo;.  Those are often the children to whom we did not get to respond in a timely way and whom are now seeking to respond in a much more timely way with new teams to keep them safer at home.</p></speech>

The point on domestic violence speaks to the need for something I have advocated for a long time, that is, the secondment of duty social workers to the Garda district protective services unit.</p><p>We can go down the route of discussing Barnahus another time.  A direct link to a duty social worker sitting in the Garda office at least once per week will help with these issues.  I thank the Chair for her indulgence.</p></speech>

While I do not believe any of us have the answers, there is much more awareness, and people are encouraged more to report it.  Where it is being reported, one comes across people who are able to deal with it.  It is terrible that this may not have been the case years ago.  Many Garda stations now have protective services units and an entirely different approach.  This is one of the key issues.  I sometimes wonder whether there is an increase in domestic violence or whether people are reporting it more.  It is probably a combination of both.  It is good that people are reporting it more where it is happening.  Do the witnesses have any final comments?</p></speech>

Today's meeting is the first in a series of meetings where we invite local authorities to discuss their projections on delivery of housing from various different strands of housing that they engage with and the historical numbers of housing they have produced over the past couple of years.  The committee intends to bring in a number of local authorities to examine this so that we can see where the progress has been made and identify some of the areas where there are difficulties or blockages and ways that we can assist with that.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Owen Keegan, Mr. Coil&iacute;n O'Reilly and Ms Helen McNamara, Dublin City Council, DCC, and Mr. Frank Curran and Ms Catherine Keenan, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, DLRCC.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the opening statements they have submitted to the committee in advance.  </p> <p>  I will begin with a note on privilege.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For witnesses attending in the committee room, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses to make their opening statements.  I will first call Mr. Keegan and then Mr. Curran.  The format we follow is a seven-minute segment for each member.  The seven minutes consists of time to ask the question and receive the answers.  If members want to direct a particular question to a particular local authority that would be helpful.  I invite Mr. Keegan to make the opening statement on behalf of Dublin City Council. </p></speech>

I set out in the opening statement our delivery over the three years from 2019 to 2021.  We delivered just under 1,200 new social housing units.  We had just under 1,200 acquisitions and a more than 10,100 rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing agreements, the majority of which were HAP.  The past few years have been challenging in regard to social housing delivery.  Covid-19 lockdowns, curtailed supply chains, high construction price inflation and general market uncertainty have all disrupted new housing delivery.</p> <p>  In regard to projected social housing delivery, DCC is conscious of the State&rsquo;s requirement for public housing and we are supportive of the targets set out under Housing For All.  We recognise and accept the need to significantly increase new build delivery and to move away from delivery via leasing and other arrangements.  DCC has a strong pipeline with designated sites that cover the delivery of more than 15,000 social, cost rental and affordable sales homes that we plan to deliver in the coming years.  In 2022, we are confident of meeting our delivery target of 895 new build homes.  We have diversified our delivery methods, which now include direct build, public-private partnerships, the housing land initiative, competitive dialogue, partnerships with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the Land Development Agency, LDA, turnkey acquisitions and Part Vs.</p> <p>  The environment for new housing delivery, both public and private, is particularly difficult at present.  There are many issues, including labour, construction inflation and supply chain issues and in regard to the private housing market affordability and restricted access to construction capital.</p><p> I will say a few words on Part V.  It has been very significant in terms of our housing delivery.  Over the past three years, 309 units were delivered via Part V and this year we are forecasting 306 units with approximately 350 in pipeline for 2023.  Part V delivery is fully reliant on overall private market delivery and any downturn in the private market will affect the supply of Part V units.</p><p> Reference was made in the request to attend this meeting to vacancy and dereliction.  We are very conscious of the issues surrounding vacancy and dereliction and the importance of bringing unused housing back into the housing stock.  I appreciate it is a great frustration to members, public representatives generally and, indeed, to the general public to see unused properties at a time of major demand for housing.  However, it is important to recognise that every derelict home is vacant but not every vacant home is derelict.  There is significant confusion in people&rsquo;s minds between legislation dealing with vacant sites and derelict sites and the powers local authorities have to deal with vacant housing units that are neither derelict nor a site.  Dealing with vacant or derelict housing units must be seen as a social intervention rather than a purely economic intervention.  There are significant complexities and costs in acquiring and redeveloping these housing units.  Frequently the rehabilitation of vacant units does not offer value for money in strict financial terms.</p><p> There are various interventions available to deal with vacancy and dereliction.  The repair and leasing and buy and renew schemes and the Living City initiative all provide support to citizens and the local authority in bringing derelict and vacant units back into use.  We are very committed to co-operating with these schemes.  We welcome recent changes, particularly to the Living City initiative and the recently announced vacant homes tax, which will certainly assist in dealing with vacancy and dereliction.</p><p> The issue of vacant commercial and retail units being repurposed for housing is being considered by the city council but there are very significant difficulties in terms of compliance with planning and building regulations.  I can confirm we have a full-time vacant homes officer and dedicated vacant homes team and have identified approximately 650 vacant homes with potential for redevelopment.  To date, approximately 48 of these have been redeveloped and returned to use.  We will be expanding that team in 2023. </p><p> The city council currently has 77 sites or properties on its derelict sites register.  The vast majority of these are residential with the remaining being mixed-use industrial development type sites.  Sites can remain on the derelict sites register for a significant time despite the imposition of a levy with interest.  So far over the past two years, we have acquired 35 properties that were on our derelict site register.  Some 34 of those properties have been repurposed as social housing units and one has been sold on.  We have a big programme of acquisition under the Derelict Sites Act and repurposing of properties.  We will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Catherine Keenan, director of housing.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is firmly committed to increasing delivery under Housing for All.  Table 1 highlights our delivery from 2018 to 2021, that is, a total of 888 units, 119 acquisitions, 361 build, 206 Part V and 202 leasing.  Table 2 shows the expected delivery over the five-year period in our Housing Delivery Action Plan 2022-2026.  That consists of 14,059 build, 859 Part V and 1,549 affordable.  </p> <p>  The housing delivery action plan was developed in line with the commitment in Housing for All and highlights a significant increase in projected delivery over the next five years.  The agreed funding of additional posts by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will assist with this ambition.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is active through all options in housing to deliver for Housing for All.  The remainder of my statement will highlight some of the delivery methods mentioned in the invite letter we received from the committee.</p> <p>  In terms of housing for older people, we are committed to increasing the provision of older persons accommodation through our own build programme, through partnership with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and through Part V.  Specific schemes delivered include Rochestown House, The Brambles and Broadford Rise.  We consider an element of universal design in our own housing schemes.  Examples include 60 universal design, UD, homes provided at Shanganagh and 40 in Stillorgan.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council also works to promote the development of lifetime homes by the private sector and engagement with developers commences at pre-planning stage.  This proactive approach has led to a Part V project which is currently on site consisting of 43 homes, 23 of which are designed to Part M compliance for general allocation, 16 designed to UD standard and four bungalows specifically designed for wheelchair users.  The continued promotion of right-sizing and development of specific schemes for older persons will enable the best use of our housing stock.</p> <p>  In relation to vacant homes and vacant homes officers, due to a high demand and very high rental income that can be achieved in the private residential sector in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, there are very few vacant properties or properties available for rent in the market.  The vacancy rate for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is 5.5%.  This is the third lowest in the country and is consistent with that of a normal, functioning housing market.  However, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown continues to maximise the use of vacant properties and is very active in this area.</p> <p>  The buy and renew scheme has proved to be very effective for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Examples include the purchase of a small housing estate of 12 vacant homes in Churchtown, retrofitted to improve building energy rating, BER, ratings of E to G, to a range from A2 to A3.  We continue to optimise the potential of this housing estate and are currently on-site with the construction of four new in-fill homes.  Similarly, a block of eight homes in Deans Grange was purchased and refurbished under the buy and renew scheme in 2020.</p> <p>  A key objective in Housing for All is to unlock the potential to utilise vacant heritage building stock.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council purchased a turnkey development of five apartments living over the shop in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in 2021.  The restoration of this Victorian building also resulted in the occupation of vacant retail units underneath.  We are currently on-site developing our own vacant building, formerly our office, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to provide four homes and a retail unit underneath.  Similarly, we are on-site refurbishing four vacant coastguard cottages built in the 1800s that came into our ownership when the harbour was transferred to the council.</p> <p>  Over the last few years, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has carried out a deep delve exercise of vacant properties based on the GeoDirectory data.  It was possible to eliminate a large number of properties, such as those under construction or business premises or due to size, location, sold, planning permission, etc., which resulted in 77 possible vacant properties for more detailed follow up.  These were followed up with the owners resulting in two properties acquired under the repair and leasing scheme and a further two that are under refurbishment.</p> <p>  In January 2022, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council appointed a full-time designated vacant homes officer, VHO.  The VHO follows up on any vacant properties brought to our attention, either through the vacant homes site or through direct contact, and actively engages with our property management section.  There are currently eight properties that are of active interest and being pursued.</p> <p>  In relation to dereliction, the key barrier to the council acquiring sites or houses under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 is the high cost of the land and property in this county.  Consequently, over the past three years, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has carried out extensive work on retrieving levies under the Act in an effort to bring sites back into productive use.  In many cases, sites have become derelict while they await demolition and redevelopment through the planning process.  Persistent pursual of and engagement with the owners has expedited many of these and brought cases to a successful conclusion.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has succeeded in reducing the average number of sites on the register from 22, at end of 2019, to ten currently on the register.  Of those remaining on the register, three have recently been sold and we expect works to start immediately to render them non-derelict, and two have applied for planning permission.</p> <p>  A total of 206 homes were delivered through Part V between 2018 and 2021.  Projected delivery for 2021 to 2026 provides for delivery of 859 homes under Part V.  Predictions for Part V are difficult and are under constant review.  Significant delays have occurred over the past few years due to the impact of Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and subsequent supply chain issues.  There are planning permissions in place that carry out a Part V obligation but remain inactive.  In addition, some proposed developments are new planning applications, or sites have been recently sold, so it is uncertain if developments will progress under existing planning permissions, or when they will be advanced.  A number of projects are currently subject to judicial review.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has contacted and engaged with the majority of the developers operating within our area with a view to activating sites for social or affordable purposes.</p><p>The Government calls under Project Tosaigh and Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities may also assist in this regard.</p><p> Regarding the 10% of affordable housing under Part V, 130 homes are predicted based on known applications.  However, as they are subject to planning, An Bord Plean&aacute;la etc., predictions and timeframes cannot be applied with accuracy.</p><p> The council is progressing a programme of affordable housing with projected delivery of 1,059 homes to 2026.  Our commitment is already demonstrated in two mixed-tenure schemes.  The first at Enniskerry Road in collaboration with Respond and Tuath, is providing 50 cost-rental homes in the first construction project of its kind in this country.  The second is Shanganagh, a partnership with the Land Development Agency, which is also a first for this country and will deliver 306 cost-rental and 91 affordable purchase homes.</p><p> I hope this gives members an overview of the quantity, quality and ambition of the work being undertaken in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to deliver under Housing for All.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I feel like a poacher turned gamekeeper with the colleagues from Dublin City Council.  My first questions are for Dublin City Council and I may come back in the following rounds.  When I was a member of that council, we had many debates on how to increase housing delivery.  With Housing for All, the Government has made a number of very significant changes again giving the local authorities the power to deliver affordable homes to purchase for the first time ever and affordable cost-rental.  It is also ending co-living, committing to ending leasing and putting a significant emphasis on increasing the number of builds.</p> <p>  The Dublin City Council report refers to the historical social housing figures over recent years.  It does not give a detailed projection for the next five years.  From a city perspective, homelessness is the acute end of the problem and that is not captured at all in the report.  I absolutely acknowledge Dublin City Council's role in its leadership of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  Certainly, in Dublin Central where more than 60% of the emergency accommodation is provided, I am acutely aware of how important it is and what a priority it is for Dublin City Council.</p> <p>  However, to fix homelessness we need to increase the number of social houses.  I genuinely welcome Dublin City Council's doubling of new builds for next year.  If it is to reach the target of 15,000, it will need to double that every year for the next four years.  Every year it will need to double what it did the year before.  Is it geared up to do that?  Does it have the resources?  Mr. Keegan very accurately called out the external challenges.  I ask for a detailed projection on that.</p> <p>  Once the social side of things is fixed, affordability is a major issue in the city.  The introduction of affordable cost-rental is a game-changer for people who do not qualify for social housing by giving them access to affordable secure rental accommodation.  What are Dublin City Council's plans for the roll-out of affordable cost-rental?  What is Dublin City Council doing or what can it do to accelerate delivery?  O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin Central has planning permission for more than 1,000 units.  That is a mixed development of social, affordable purchase and affordable cost-rental.  Planning permission was granted many months ago.  While Dublin City Council has delivered its first phase, construction has not commenced on the second phase, the bigger portion of that site.  Similarly, St. Finbar's Court, St. Mary's Place in Dorset Street and Matt Talbot Court are all planned Dublin City Council developments.  When will construction commence?</p></speech>

On the resourcing issue, funding is available for all the resources we need to deliver the housing programme.  However, housing is no different from other areas.  It is proving very difficult for us to recruit and retain staff, particularly professional staff.  Even though we have the sanction and the funding, in a very tight labour market, Dublin City Council is not the employer of choice because of uniform pay and conditions, much higher travelling costs and housing costs.  It is a real challenge throughout my organisation to retain staff.  That is just the nature of the market.  We have the sanction we need and the funding.  The problem is slightly different.  I will ask my colleague to deal with some specific issues the Senator raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1025" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Coil&iacute;n O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#C00400"><p>I agree totally.  The only way we can deal with homelessness and affordable housing is through the delivery of housing.  The affordable cost-rental schemes have only really come on board in the last year or two.  It will take us time.  We have delivered 37 affordable homes this year, but it will take us time to deliver those other schemes.  At the same time, last week we applied for planning permission for a development on Emmet Road, comprising 578 units with 70% cost-rental and 30% social housing.  We recently achieved planning permission for affordable sale homes in Cherry Orchard and we are moving forward with affordable purchase homes in Ballymun.  We will apply for planning permission for those in the coming months.  It is obviously in our programme.  As it was not what was requested of us in the letter, we did not include it in our response.</p> <p>  We have a strong programme.  The caveat to that is that as affordability and affordable housing has become more of a focus, they will come on board in future years.  It will be more towards the end of our Housing for All programme in 2024, 2025 or 2026 when we start to see more delivery.  We are fully aware of the need to double the figures and we look at them constantly.  We have the projects and the timelines, and we are committed to delivering them.</p> <p>  The judicial review process on O'Devaney Gardens was completed on 16 May 2022.  We are extremely frustrated with the lack of progress on site and we are in constant engagement with the developers on the need to get started on site.  We hope to have builders on site at St. Finbar's Court later this year or early next year.  They are progressing.  Progress in housing is slow.  These are complicated processes for us to work through.  The delivery of housing is not a simple thing to do.  We fully recognise and accept the need people have, but unfortunately, we cannot meet that need in the short term.  It will take us time to ramp up delivery.  I hope I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the very significant work they and their teams do, particularly in the housing and homelessness section.  It is not lost on members of the committee that often that very significant work at the front line goes unacknowledged.  I want to convey my thanks and my party's thanks to their staff.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the targets.  I will have a quick-fire round of questions for both Mr. Keegan and Mr. Curran.  It is important to set both the social and affordable targets against the need.  Part of the problem in discussing housing need is that they are not necessarily universally accepted.  What is the gross current social housing need?  That is the local authority list as well as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, transfer, and how that compares to the local authorities' targets.</p> <p>  For the affordable housing delivery, the local authorities were asked - it is in their housing delivery reports that I have here - to undertake housing needs demand assessment, HNDA, to determine the level of affordable need.  For both local authorities, what was the HNDA and what are their targets?</p></speech>

The projected need for affordability is 3,124 for the period 2022 to 2026 and our estimated total affordable housing delivery is 1,549.</p></speech>

For D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, it is a little higher for social housing.  If there are 25,000 households in need of social housing, and the target is higher than the 9,000 set by the Department, it will be significantly shy of the overall need.</p></speech>

As we said, the target is challenging as it is.  In the interim period, we will deliver that number and we will then continue into the future to deliver for the rest of the people.  I accept that the short-term delivery number does not match the need but, as a longer term list, we are hopeful we can deliver into 2028 and 2029 and clear the overall waiting list.</p></speech>

Therefore, while something will be taken off the HAP transfer list, gross need could be not far off where it is today, even with those targets.</p></speech>

That is up to us and that is why we are significantly ramping up delivery to almost 10,000 units over that period.  If we had delivered, over the past five years or the five years before that, what we plan to deliver over the next five years, we would be in a much better position than we are now.  There is a commitment there and a significant number of units are coming on board.  We know it will not solve all the problems of housing need from a social housing perspective, but it will allow us to begin to solve it.</p></speech>

I mentioned the figure 2,352 which was at about 5,000 a number of years ago.  The list is coming down as delivery is ramped up.

I will ask my final question because I am almost out of time.  On the affordable target for Dublin City Council, between it, the approved housing bodies and the LDA, the figure is 4,000 affordable homes to 2026, or 800 homes a year, although they will not get to them until 2024 or 2025.  The figure for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is 1,549.  Given the affordability challenges in both local authorities, will that come anywhere close to having an effect on the number of affordable homes that are needed?  In both cases, the targets are significantly lower than the councils&rsquo; HNDA assessments.  That is not a criticism, but it is a small number even if those targets are met.  That is a fair assumption, is it not?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the Shanganagh scheme, which is on site now, involves 200 social, 306 cost-rental and 94 affordable, while in Enniskerry Road, 50 cost-rental came through this year.  Projects are coming through from the likes of the LDA and there is a strategic housing development, SHD, for the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum of 900 affordable units.  The voluntary housing bodies are looking at credible opportunities, while the Land Development Agency, through Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, is looking for various opportunities.  We may well exceed the target and we will certainly try to do so but, as my colleagues have said, we need a realistic target.</p> <p>  There are people coming to us in the context of apartments that were originally intended for the private residential sector and asking whether there are possibilities with regard to social and affordable, whether through us, the approved housing bodies or the Land Development Agency.  More opportunities may come down the track and if they do, we will be there to take them up.  The affordable housing fund increased recently from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000 per unit and that makes a huge difference in the likes of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where prices are higher.  It will enable the cost-rental and affordable schemes to work in our area.</p></speech>

We must not forget that it also has a significant factor and it adjusts private prices.  If somebody can rent a cost-rental unit in Emmet Road for &euro;1,100 or &euro;1,200 a month, that will mean a load of people will leave private provision to try to go there.  The reality is that it will adjust the overall market figure, and that market adjustment has to be borne in mind.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council's targets for 2023 and 2024 are significantly below the target set by the Department.  We have national targets but Dublin City Council has a large part to play in meeting those targets, given the volume of units to be delivered.

Their statements were insightful.  I have a number of questions.  I will see if I can get through all of them.  Have the witnesses been approached by landlords wishing to sell properties with tenants <i>in situ</i>?</p></speech>

We currently have 87 processes in train where tenants are <i>in situ</i>.  Tenants being <i>in situ</i>is rarely as simple as it sounds.  There can be issues with extensions, with building regulations in the property, title issues and encroachment issues.  When anybody comes to us with tenants <i>in situ</i>, as I say to our councillors all the time, we are more than willing to look at it.  In fairness to the Minister and the Department, they have given us the imprimatur to follow up on anything that comes through with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  We will, because when people receive a notice of termination, they come through the front door of Parkgate Hall, seeking homelessness services, which is also our headache.  We take tenants <i>in situ</i>at any opportunity we get.</p></speech>

If there is a risk of homelessness, we are interested in finding a solution.  We have to go through the process of valuations, inspections, title and so on, but properties are starting to come through.  As Mr. O'Reilly said, I think they will be approved by the Department.  There will be funding for them.  It will be a focus between now and the end of the year.</p></speech>

I am interested in vacant units.  I know a Senator already discussed it.  There was a good scheme for over-the-shop units on Capel Street some years ago.  Have the councils' vacant unit officers been assessing such units?  Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire probably have the largest number of vacant over-the-shop units.  Are the councils' officers looking into that or assessing the potential?</p></speech>

We have identified those, as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did, through reports from Senators, Deputies, councillors, members of the public and surveys.  The vacant homes website has been a significant asset to us too.  We are assessing and going through them.  In our statement, we said that delivery of over-the-shop units is more difficult.  It entails fire regulations, multiple users and somebody running a retail premises below it.  In many cases in Dublin city, there are not two access points.  Access is through the shop.  If the Deputy is familiar with shops on main streets, access is through the shop's front door.  Shops would have people entering and exiting their homes through the shops.  We will deliver anything that we can.  We are taking these units on board and assessing them.</p></speech>

It will have a retail unit on the ground floor which will be available to rent.  As Mr. O'Reilly said, one of the biggest issues is fire regulations and a separate means of access.  It makes this difficult.  Premises abroad, particularly in Europe, use sprinklers and similar systems, so particular means of access are not required.  The County and City Management Association, CCMA, has a housing, building and land-use sub-committee, which asked the Department to look at the fire regulations to see if we can get more units to be compliant with them and to see if the regulations can be more realistic.</p></speech>

Have the local authorities been given cost-rental targets by the Department?  Is it meeting these targets, considering the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war?</p><p>If the local authorities have not been given targets, what process do they use to decide how many units they will develop?  That is a kind of long-winded question.</p></speech>

At the moment, we have 1,802 affordable purchase and 2,514 cost-rental homes in our pipeline.  The Deputy mentioned Covid-19 and Ukraine, both of which are the causes.  The biggest worry issue for us around affordable delivery is construction inflation caused by both Covid-19 and Ukraine.  As costs go up, therefore, it becomes more and more difficult for us to use the affordable housing fund to bring the cost down to make it affordable from a sale point of view or from a cost-rental point of view.  That is the essence of the difficulty with affordable delivery for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#F00300"><p>The target for affordable is combined affordable and cost rental.  We have not broken it down specifically.  We will see what comes in.  I mentioned that Shanganagh is on-site with 306 cost-rental and 91 affordable homes.  Enniskerry Road will have 50 cost-rental homes delivered this year.  We will see what we get in the private market then through the cost rental equity loan, CREL, the LDA, and the turnkeys that come our way.  It is a combined target for affordable and cost rental, however.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#F00400"><p>My final question refers back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's with regard to the housing list versus targets.  Does the capacity issue relate to funding or the targets the local authorities have been asked to deliver for the State?  Do they just not have the capacity to deliver?  That workload would be difficult to process.  I am curious; if the Department told the local authorities to double their delivery, would that be possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Owen Keegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#F00500"><p>It would certainly not be possible in the short term.  We have a situation where, effectively, social housing delivery ceased as a consequence of the financial difficulties.  Gearing up has taken time and it has not been helped by extensive Covid-19 lockdowns.  We will certainly strive to exceed our targets but we must be realistic.  Doubling them or unilaterally increasing them in my view will not work.</p> <p>  I cannot speak for D&uacute;n Laoghaire but in the cities, almost every site we have is now in the process and will contribute to that figure of 15,000 units.  If somebody said we need 30,000 units, land acquisition becomes a big issue for us in terms of how we can, and where we want to, acquire it.  At the moment, we have sites for those 15,000 units covering social, cost-rental and affordable purchase.  Any increase on that will be difficult unless we buy in from the private sector, however, which is certainly a possibility.  Land acquisition will become a constraining issue.</p></speech>

There are 27,600 houses in the delivery pipeline.  That is divided among all the local authorities.  I think our target is realistic.  There are issues, however.  I mentioned earlier that Covid-19 caused an issue with the supply chain and that there is a skill shortage.  Apartments being slow to get off the ground is also a big issue that affects turnkey, matters relating to part V and approved housing  body, AHB, delivery.  There are, therefore, many issues in that regard.</p></speech>

I was watching the meeting from my office.  I may, therefore, go over some questions others have asked, particularly with regard to some of the queries and figures about which Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked.</p><p>I pay tribute to some of the staff I deal with in the housing section of DCC on a daily basis.  Ms Aisling Browne in acquisitions helped me with a difficult query over the summer and went above and beyond what she needed to do and Mr. Tony Smithers and Ms Sandra Barry did likewise.  Staff in the housing section work hard day in, day out, and have huge empathy for the people who bear the brunt of the housing crisis.  I include Ms McNamara and Mr. O'Reilly in that as well.  I passed Springvale today, for example, which is currently going up.  That is a great example of DCC's direct-led delivery.  Dolphin House is also an amazing example of good, well-planned delivery.  I will come back to some of the delivery problems, however, shortly.</p><p>I want to come back to some of the questions Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked in terms of what is planned and in the pipeline and how it is simply not meeting the targets.  Another hidden part is the number of people on the transfer list within DCC who are housed through HAP and who are on the transfer list.  We must take them into account.  Many of them are in overcrowded housing and inappropriate accommodation in the insecure private rental sector.  The witnesses do not have to have it with them today, but do they know how many council HAP tenancies have entered or are at risk of homelessness?  How many of those have there been within the council over the past year?  Of that number, how many tenant <i>in situ </i>purchases were there?  Mr. O'Reilly said there are 87 but there are some issues with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  I do not understand how people can be housed in the private sector in those houses, yet the alternative is for them to be homeless, even where there are issues.  An issue was raised with me regarding an attic being converted and used as a bedroom.  How can we achieve flexibly on that to stop people and families entering homelessness?  That needs to be our big stop point.</p><p>I will come back to Dolphin House, which is an amazing development that has been social housing for a long time.  Between 2018 and 2028, it looks like we are going to have 28 homes delivered in phase 1A and phase 1B, and 16 three-bedroom houses for senior citizens.  That is 44 homes in ten years, which is simply not acceptable.  That is a drop in the ocean.</p><p>I want to ask both local authorities this question.  Local authority housing lists and income limits have not been revised since 2011.  There is a pent-up demand of people who do not meet the social housing threshold, which is currently very low.  Do the local authorities have any expectations that if that was raised to &euro;40,000 or even &euro;50,000 per household, of how many additional households would join the city council housing list?  While the targets are all well and good to meet a low housing need that exists, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the reality is that many more people are caught in that affordability trap.  They cannot afford to buy in places like Dublin city, and it blows my mind how expensive D&uacute;n Laoghaire is.  People cannot afford to buy in places like that yet they do not qualify.  Crucially, however, they also do not qualify for HAP and supported housing, which is one of the big and important issues.  It has been ten years since they qualified.</p></speech>

To go through it again, our total housing list is 13,377 and our HAP transfer list is 10,670.  Our internal transfers number 6,000 but those people have a home.

For instance, with an attic conversion that does not meet building regulations or fire regulations, it is difficult for us to purchase that property and then say we are very happy for a social housing tenant to live in that property.<br/><br/>How the HAP system works is that people rent on the private market. There may be a requirement for a private rented inspection, if the tenant requires it, or people like environmental health officers go out and inspect and then give recommendation notices.  The other issue with a tenant <i>in situ</i>is that sometimes the landlord does not wish to sell to the local authority.  Another issue is encroachment or irregular title whereby the title of the land on which the house is built is not properly registered, which is very difficult.<br/><br/>I fully understand because as I said, when those people end up in homelessness, they come in through the front door of Parkgate Hall and they are our issue.  From our point of view, however, we also cannot buy other people's problems and create more difficulty for ourselves or leave people in a situation we know to be unsafe.  I fully understand the frustration with Dolphin House.</p><p>There is potential for 500 units at the site.  A significant number of environmental impact assessment reports must be done.  We are looking to expedite this process.</p><p> With regard to the timeline, the local community asked us for an honest assessment of what would be delivered.  We were not going to over-promise and under-deliver.  We tried to give people a realistic timeframe.  I accept that it is a long time.  We will do what we can to expedite it.</p></speech>

It is out of our control because it is a national issue.  What is available once people go over the limit is cost-rental.  We will prioritise cost-rental over the coming years.</p></speech>

Most of them are no strangers to me.  They are welcome.  I always make the point that witnesses before the committee are our guests.  They have been invited here as part of a process of engagement.  I acknowledge this and thank them for coming.</p> <p>  My questions will focus on Dublin City Council.  I thank Mr. Keegan for his concise paper.  I have a number of questions arising from it.  How many people are on the social housing list today?  It is difficult to get details on this.  I want to spend the rest of my time focusing on vacancy and dereliction.  This is referenced in the fourth paragraph of the written submission to the committee.  Does Mr. Keegan believe that local authorities should have powers, or additional powers, to deal with long-term vacant housing units that are neither derelict nor a site?  If so, will he elaborate?  I am picking up this point from what is in the submission and what has been said.</p> <p>  We know that various interventions are available to deal with vacancy and dereliction.  There is the repair-and-lease scheme, the buy-and-renew scheme and the Living City initiative.  All of these provide support for citizens.  More importantly, they provide supports for local authorities in bringing derelict and vacant sites back into use.  Mr. Keegan stated that in the past the buy-and-renew scheme proved the most popular and effective.  He also stated that there are problems due to delays in the recouping of the capital outlays associated with the Living City initiative and the repair-and-lease scheme.  Will he give the committee some examples of the issues he has identified with the two schemes?</p> <p>  The use of vacant commercial and retail units for housing has been investigated by Dublin City Council.  These conversions can create major difficulties with regard to planning, retrospective issues and compliance with building regulations.  Will the witnesses from Dublin City Council touch on this and suggest to the committee how we can overcome these challenges?</p> <p>  According to the submission document Dublin City Council has identified approximately 650 vacant homes with potential for redevelopment and to date 48 have been redeveloped and returned to use.  I would like more detail on how the figure of 650 was arrived at.  Are any of the properties in the ownership of Dublin City Council?  I do not have the exact number but I am told that a number of derelict properties are in the ownership of Dublin City Council.  I am not sure whether they are on the derelict sites register.  Will the witnesses confirm this?</p> <p>  When we look at the audited reports of all 31 local authorities, we see constant criticism of how the property assets register balances.  In addition, there are issues about how local authorities handle their commercial and residential real estate.  According to Dublin City Council, it has 77 sites on the derelict sites register.  Do any of the properties belong to Dublin City Council?  What action is it taking?  I would have thought it would be a key priority for a local authority if it had derelict properties.  These are just a few questions that might be addressed.  They are specifically focused and targeted towards Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

The number of people on our housing list is 13,377.  Vacancy comes up constantly.  I get asked about it every month at the council meetings.  It is an emotive topic.  It drives people crazy to go by vacant homes and see them sitting there.  Sometimes people take an overly simplistic view of how easy it is to bring them back into use by putting in new windows and kitchens in order that people can live in them.  Much of what Dublin City Council ends up dealing with is more complex.</p> <p>  What the Senator is asking about is the powers local authorities have.  It really is a matter for local government.  The new vacant site tax introduced in the budget is certainly a stick that might encourage people.  We also need to look at some of the reasons properties are vacant.  We have done research on this.  There may be unclear title, ownership disputes or wards of court involved.  A property might be for sale.  The owner might be in long-term healthcare.  The owner might not be able to afford to bring the property up to building standards.  It may be a second property for temporary use.  It may be an investment property.  All of these reasons need different carrots and sticks to get people to activate them.  Each reason for vacancy would probably need a different action.</p> <p>  We have brought forward 48 buy and renew properties to date.  Under the Living City initiative, we have received 108 applications in the context of owner-occupiers and 77 for rental residential.  We have certified 61 for owner-occupiers, which is just over 60%.  We have also brought forward 44 rental residential, which is 60%.  The point with regard to the Living City initiative is that it involves a tax rebate over ten years.  People must have the capital to be able to do it.

This figure has been arrived at through reports from Deputies, Senator and councillors, members of the public phoning our customer service and surveys conducted by our local area staff.  We have a very good local area structure.  We have also received referrals from the <i>vacanthomes.ie</i>website run by Mayo County Council.  Members of the public upload information to the website and we get referrals from it.  The Senator asked about derelict units and whether they are ours.  Some of the units on the derelict sites register are ours but that is only because we put them on it.  We used compulsory purchase orders and now we must renew them.</p></speech>

I thank the teams who are at the coalface of the crisis.  They are doing great work.  We know more has to be done as quickly as humanly possible.</p><p>I thank the witnesses because I know many people put a lot of time, effort and expertise into this area.  I have four questions for both of the witnesses and then one for each council.  I would like both witnesses to talk us through the affordable housing pipeline and what balance they aim to strike in terms of cost rental and affordable purchase.<br/><br/>In terms of voids, are the councils utilising the full budget and what is the average turnaround time?  I think somebody else touched on this earlier.  How many new staff have the councils taken in under the Housing for All allocation?  They would have got approval to hire planning staff and inter-housing delivery teams.<br/><br/>I would also welcome a comment on an article today in <i>The Irish Times</i>about an unwillingness among developers to collaborate with local authorities when it comes to public housing.  Do the witnesses find any particular roadblocks in that regard?  I know the expressions of interest do not necessarily materialise.<br/><br/>The overall figure for Dublin City Council is 15,000.  Could I get a breakdown of that by year?  I note the reference made to the accessible homes being delivered in a scheme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That is very important.  Is there any information on the number of people on waiting lists who require accessible homes?  Is information available on whether people who are on the waiting lists are in hospital or in rehabilitation and are waiting for accessible homes to be made available, either through the AHBs or the council?  There are five questions for each of the witnesses.  Five minutes should be okay time-wise.</p></speech>

The pipeline for affordable purchase is 1,802 and cost rental is 2,514.<br/><br/>In terms of voids, we are probably at about 16 weeks at this stage.  We currently have 505 voids, which is 1.9% of our overall stock.  That sounds like a lot, but out of an overall stock of 26,000 it is relatively low.  We do have a lot of churn in our system.  Some 245 of the voids are currently with contractors and 128 are with our own direct labour.  We are hopeful of bringing a lot of those back in before Christmas.  We are drawing down all the budget and any extra budget is always helpful.  I might as well say that while I am here.<br/><br/>In terms of new staff, we have taken on eight what we are calling housing delivery managers.  They are programme managers who will deal with a lot of the paperwork, process and decision-making and put it all into a format so that we can streamline our housing delivery processes.  We have eight coming in to assist with the delivery of affordable housing.<br/><br/>The article in <i>The Irish Times</i>is probably based on our competitive dialogue process.  We were very disappointed.  At this stage, I think we have nearly 21,000 inactivated planning permissions in Dublin city.  We saw that as an opportunity.  We tried to work out how we could unlock this conundrum of why there are people who have invested in planning permission but they are not delivering homes.  We have to work out what the barrier is.  We went out.  We had 44 expressions of interest and we only had one submission.  We are out again now looking for turnkey delivery and we are hopeful to go out again to look for a development agreement with people to deliver on our behalf in the near future.  That is a conundrum we have to work out.  As interest rates start to go up, there might be more opportunity if people who have leveraged themselves, who have borrowed money to purchase the land and for the planning, come under more pressure and that might create opportunity.  It is incumbent on us as local authority officials to continue to go back to that market, engage with it, try to unlock the conundrum and create opportunities for people to come in to us and see if they will partner with us for the delivery of homes.</p></speech>

I have just a few quick-fire questions because there are a few issues I want to address.  The first question is whether both local authorities believe they will meet their social, affordable and affordable cost rental targets for this year?</p></speech>

Some of our schemes have gone into next year for various reasons.  There have been various challenges in recent years, some of which I mentioned, in terms of Covid, the supply chain and skill shortages.  In terms of some of the turnkeys and Part Vs, we will be shy of our target this year but we will make it up next year.</p></speech>

We are projecting 102.  There is a shortfall of 194.  Next year, our target is 364.  We are projecting 454 minimum, and it may be higher.  There is a surplus for next year of 89.</p></speech>

With a lot of the projects in both witnesses' local authorities there are now much more, larger, more complicated projects where there is a mixture of tenure types.  It just seems, however, that delivery is very slow.  Earlier in the year a report was carried out about having maybe one single point of contact in the Department when trying to get these projects delivered in a timely fashion.  What is the hold-up?  Is it bureaucracy?  Is it because the local authorities are dealing with mixed-tenure sites?  What can we do, or what can the Department and the Minister do, to help deliver these projects more quickly?</p></speech>

In recent times I have been engaging with a private developer on Part V in the north city.  The developer was very happy to be able to deliver 400-odd apartments in three years and seven months from planning through to completion.  We have to remember that the delivery of apartments is a long and complex process.  That private developer did not have to go through all the process we have to go through with regard to the four-stage process, business plans, feasibility studies and procurement.  I understand the frustration - the frustration is ours as well - but these projects do take a lot of time, and apartment complexes are particularly complex to deliver.  The number of things that can go wrong is also much higher when delivering apartment complexes rather than houses.</p></speech>

Are there actions the Department could take to help?  I understand that these are really complex, major developments, but we need housing delivered.  My disagreement with the Minister all the time is that, while we can talk about planned housing and commencements, delivery is the key.  What can the Minister or the Department do to get these developments delivered as quickly as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Owen Keegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#J00400"><p>In fairness, the Department has been very supportive.  What has really held us up is two lockdown periods, which have caused real difficulties with our delivery.  There are other market realities we have to acknowledge.  As a consequence of Covid and building inflation, we are getting very little interest, much less interest, in our developments.  It is a matter of trying to interest contractors to take on this work and, once they get the tenders, to get them to start.  There are factors like that.  This is as much a challenge to us as it is to the Department.</p></speech>

I do not mean to badger.  This is the housing committee.  We have input into the Minister and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  What can be done to help speed things up?  Does Mr. Curran wish to respond?</p></speech>

Every public sector project does.  It has been very helpful that we have got approval for extra staff.  I know there are challenges in recruiting, but we are getting there.  We have got the staff up to speed now.  Something that we will need to look at and on which the Department can help is acquisition of land into the future.  We need to plan now for the next seven-year to ten-year period, go out there and buy land.  Traditionally, when local authorities buy land, which is very expensive in the likes of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, we get recoupment only when the houses, the units, are complete.  If we could buy land and bring that recoupment of the money back earlier in the five-stage process, that would help in that we would have a supply of land and then could plan the infrastructure into the future.</p></speech>

Vacant homes officers are like sites officers.  Was it Mr. Keegan who made the point earlier about having additional staff?  As for vacancy and dereliction, in my constituency of Cork North-Central and Cork city and county we have 7,000 vacant properties.  In the areas I represent there are 20, 30 or 40 buildings, former homes, lying idle.  Even from an environmental point of view, it is a matter of delivering housing that is already built.  I do not think the staff are there.  We need teams, not an individual or a part-time officer.  How many full-time vacant homes and derelict sites officers have the local authorities now to deal with those sites?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Coil&iacute;n O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#J01000"><p>We have one vacant homes officer.  We have six working in the unit, but they also draw on the significant resources we have internally within city architects and city quantity surveyors, so our city architects division does not work on one project but on many projects all at the one time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1453" speakername="Thomas Gould" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#J01100"><p>Does Mr. Curran wish to comment?</p></speech>

They have identified eight properties that are of active interest and are being pursued at the moment, so it has been very helpful to have somebody working full-time on that.</p></speech>

As Mr. Curran said, this is quite complicated, with the titles, people being sick and not knowing who owns the property.  If the local authorities had a team working on that, would it speed it up?</p> <p>  My last question - I thank the Chair for his leniency - is about when people go into rehab and are taken off or suspended from the social housing list.  I have seen that in some local authorities.  Does that happen in the witnesses' local authorities?  If a person goes into residential rehab, let us say for six months, is he or she taken off the social housing list?</p></speech>

If we had extra staff, we would probably look at following through on that, acquiring the properties, the design process, getting the scheme on site etc.</p> <p>  We have a property management section working through dereliction.  It has made great progress in recent years.  The number on the register has gone down from 22 to ten, with a significant increase in the amount we collect in levies.  That section works through each and every one of those properties.  Three have recently been sold.  Works will start immediately to render two of them non-derelict.  Planning permission has been applied for in respect of two of them.  That property management section has helped with dereliction.</p></speech>

We all have the habit of calling Mr. Keegan the manager.  It shows the length of time some of us have been on local authorities.  Some of us have come from local authorities in just the last D&aacute;il term.</p> <p>  The pipeline both local authorities have put in front of us is interesting.  There is often a suggestion that nothing has changed in terms of housing.  Three or four of us here left local authorities at the beginning of the D&aacute;il term.  For both pipelines there was no legislative basis for anything other than social housing.  All of the pipelines now involve mixed income and mixed tenure.  There was nothing approaching the instruments for dereliction and, with the speed and the multi-annual budget that is there with Housing for All, they are all now in place.  It is very obvious when we look at the list the witnesses have presented to us that that is having an impact.  It is hard to see it yet at the stage where people are putting keys in their doors, but I looked at the latest Dublin City Council list for my area, Dublin North-West, and there are 29 different sites across my very small three-seat constituency.  It is worth reflecting on them.  We have Kildonan; the Church of the Annunciation; Carton; local area plan, LAP, sites 13, 8, 11, 9, 5, 15, 16, 17 and 18; Barry Avenue; Meadow Court; Wellmount Road; Balbutcher, site 14; LAP sites 21, 22, 23 and 25; High Park; Prospect Hill; Hampton Wood; Collins Avenue; Thatch Road; LAP site 19; Casement Drive; Casement Road; Barnamore; Berryfield; LAP 10; Collins Avenue; and Oscar Traynor Road.  Anyone who says local authorities are not back in the business of building housing is just not looking at the reality.  The question the previous speaker posed was if the local authorities will be able to deliver in a timely manner.  That is the concern I have now.  It falls into two areas.</p> <p>  I will first deal with staffing.  The number of additional staff both local authorities have got is a bit underwhelming.  I note Mr. Keegan's wording, that they have all the sanction for what they want.  Should the witnesses be looking for more staffing for both local authorities?  Considering even just all those sites I listed, the idea that 16 or 20 staff would be enough to help the local authorities with that seems on the low side.  Am I wrong?</p></speech>

I was asked if there is one thing that would help.  One flexibility we had in the past is that when we were recruiting people from outside, particularly professional staff, we could give them incremental credit for years of service.  Back in about 2014 we lost that power so if someone comes in from the outside they go right back to the start of the scale.  We are very uncompetitive, therefore.  We set up panels now and we get high refusal rates.  We are running competitions-----</p></speech>

No more than 20 staff have been requested between them.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

We have a big enough architect section that is constantly working on designing schemes.  We then have a housing section with technical people.  When the scheme came out it was for what is needed over and above that, and that is fully funded, but we still have all our previous staff in place.</p></speech>

We procure integrated design teams that would have quantity surveyors and architects on them to design and manage those projects for us.  The days of local authority architects and quantity surveyors holding the pen on every single project are more or less gone.  The other thing to look at is that the processes we use and how we do it is also much more efficient than it was in the past.</p></speech>

There are many people out there who just do not understand how that works.  From an empty site to the point where somebody would purchase an affordable home, what is the financial calculation for a local authority in doing that?  Where is the money coming from and what is the final input into the final price?</p></speech>

I said earlier that the fundamental worry for us is construction cost inflation.  The point I have been making to some people in recent days is that what used to cost &euro;300,000 now costs &euro;400,000 and what used to cost &euro;400,000 now costs &euro;530,000.  It is difficult for local authorities to make that work, with the affordable housing fund, to what people deem to be affordable.  A lot of times in people's consciousness the figure for an affordable three- or four-bedroom house would be between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000.  It will be difficult from DCC's perspective to deliver three-bedroom homes at those sort of prices.</p></speech>

If the cost comes in at &euro;400,000, DCC will be selling them, with the affordable housing fund, at &euro;300,000.  Is DCC's concern how much it can procure houses for, even before the higher discount?</p></speech>

There is a significant gap between what one would have to be earning to purchase that at &euro;300,000 and the &euro;38,000 social housing income limit.

We have to look at our construction methodologies and how we do it.  We have to see if we can improve those methodologies, make it cheaper, absorb some of the land costs and things like that, and some of the land has already been acquired.

As Mr. O'Reilly says, if we are delivering something that will cost &euro;450,000 because of the increase in prices and all the associated costs, bringing it down to &euro;300,000 helps.

We should be building properties everywhere.  It is difficult to make it stack up with apartments in DCC's area.  In Ballyfermot we built houses.  A lot of the criticism is that we should not be building houses these days, given the proximity to public transport and the need for densification.  It would not have added up had we built apartments so it is a real challenge.</p></speech>

Something that has been spoken about for decades is living over the shop becoming popular again.  It is not that simple and it is complex, which we all acknowledge.  For many years we were able to spread out greenfield site after greenfield site and sprawl with new builds and it was so much easier to do, and it still is.  We have this imperative of carbon emissions as well, which means we have to focus and concentrate on the existing stock and the infill and densification of those sites.  I refer to vacancy and vacant homes officers and I am glad to hear that both local authorities have full-time vacant homes officers.  I am aware that some local authorities do not but they have all been given sanction and funding to do so.  I am sure one finds out about vacant properties from various sources.  The councillors report it, there is the <i>www.vacanthomes.ie </i>website and there is local knowledge.  When the vacant homes officer comes up against the obstacle that a house is vacant for a certain reason is it then crossed off the list or is there an opportunity to go further to engage with the owner and ask if they can assist?  Is there a reach out to bring people in?</p></speech>

You get a call that No. 1 The Orchard is vacant, you send somebody out to inspect it and they find out it is vacant.  Then it goes on the to-do list so that it will be looked at.  You go out again and do a title search to see who owns the property.  You try to engage with that person and if they are willing to engage that is great and if they are not then you start writing letters to people.  You have to do a number of inspections and from our point of view a property has to be vacant for over six months before we start to do that.  This example is not a derelict property; it is a vacant one.  It is about engaging with the individual but if people do not want to engage or if there is a contested title it is complex.  It is a long process.</p></speech>

There is a lot of confusion among dereliction, vacant homes, vacant sites and derelict sites.  We need clarity on that, including to assist the local authorities.  There is a vacant homes tax; it is self-declared that the house is vacant and it is based on the local property tax returns.  In that situation would compulsory purchase rights to that vacant home be of assistance?</p></speech>

There are issues with it and that is something we need to address as legislators.</p> <p>  There is a derelict sites register in all local authorities and then there is a derelict sites levy but there is an appalling collection rate on that of less than 10% across local authorities.

We may run into the same situation in going from a levy to a tax but when compared to the vacant sites, the owners tend to be in a different category.</p></speech>

If there was a derelict sites tax, would that act as a stronger activation measure, where someone would say that, as there is a tax and it is going to be collected by Revenue, &ldquo;I will try to sell it or refurbish it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I will reach out to the local authority rather than have them chase me&rdquo;?</p></speech>

Over the years, we have gone into the District Court and cases were lost because they were able to prove they just do not have the means, or their representatives were able to show they were not capable of doing the works.  That is why it was left to be a charge on the land.  It is registered in the Property Registration Authority as a charge on the land and it comes through when the property goes for sale.  The compulsory purchase acquisition of those derelict properties has worked quite well for those properties because we can turn them over and hand them over for housing, and it takes out those issues of there being title difficulties because it is a freehold title that will vest in the council, so that deals with it well.</p></speech>

The derelict sites register currently has ten properties.  A big effort has been put in since the end of 2019, when there were 22 such sites.  A team was put in place to deal with this and of those ten, none of which is a local authority property, three have recently been sold and we expect works to start shortly, two have applied for planning permission, and one is a hardship case and we are working with the HSE in that regard.  In addition, the team has been very successful in collecting levies and issuing notices, in many cases multiple notices.  During the period I mentioned, and in 2020 and 2021 in particular, the council obtained more in levies than in the previous ten years, some &euro;77,000 in 2021 and &euro;171,000 in 2020.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, there are issues with regard to the living over the shop scheme.  It is difficult from the position of fire regulations, in particular because of the requirement for separate means of access.  We have asked the Department to look at this in terms of the possibility of the use of sprinklers and so on, as used in other European cities, but it is difficult to bring them up to the building regulations and fire regulations.  We can obviously look at other uses, for example, community uses.</p></speech>

Someone suggested to me that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had recently purchased a house for in excess of &euro;600,000 in the town.  I do not know if that is correct and I am asking Mr. Curran.

I would like to know that about every local authority but, as the witnesses are here today, I ask them to provide the committee with an overview of the amount of land that is in the ownership of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and how much of that is zoned residential.</p><p>It would be helpful in the context of the ask for additional lands to be zoned residential because the OPR tells us we have far too much land.  We are asking local authorities to dezone land zoned residential, while in today's paper I read local authorities need more land zoned residential.  We are getting mixed messaging about residential zoned land.  Will the witnesses supply the committee-----</p></speech>

All our properties are what we see as low-hanging fruit.  One of the things we have been working on this year and have had engagement with the Minister on is the need to try to reduce our standing void number.  That number in Dublin city has been around 500.  We are trying to get it to 400 or below because it is in essence building 100 new homes if we bring that number down.  The issue is we get an awful lot of churn in the system with people transferring, passing away or for whatever reason.  We will always have voids.  Part of what drives people crazy is driving past a local authority house in Finglas, the central area or wherever it happens to be and seeing it boarded up.  They say it is an absolute disgrace.  The issue is getting that activated, getting contractors or our staff in there and getting it turned around as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  We have an active voids programme.  It is top of my management list on a weekly basis with my housing operations manager.  Where are we at?  What are our numbers?   What is on-site?  What is coming back?  We also have that conversation with our allocations team to make sure that team has the allocations done and we are not waiting to allocate them.  </p></speech>

It is under development or in the pipeline.   Some 95% or 96% of all land we own that is available for housing is in the pipeline.  We have small pockets around the northern fringe that will come in post 2026 and we can use around there.  We do not have huge swathes of land anymore.

There is a narrative out there that council targets are too low, that they are underdelivering on them and that they will fail to address the housing crisis, which is destroying people's lives.  There is also an accusation regarding the commitment to move away from private contribution and private developer involvement in the delivery of social housing.  On the suggestion that we do away with private developers, what impact would that have on increasing the delivery of housing and the supply of social and affordable housing and affordable cost rental?  People are desperate for an end to the housing crisis and it is tempting to think if it was taken out of local authorities' hands and those of private developers supplying local authorities, it could be solved.  What impact would it have on the witnesses' ability to deliver?</p></speech>

In the Enniskerry Road scheme, in partnership with Tuath and Respond, 50 of those are cost rental.  The delivery mechanism will be the AHBs operating through CREL, ourselves in the mixed-tenure units and the LDA.  The LDA has applied for planning permission for 900 units on the Central Mental Hospital site, the intention being affordable as well.  The LDA will be a big provider of cost rental as we go down the line.</p> <p>  Similar to Dublin City Council, we went out a year, a year and a half or two years ago looking for turnkey opportunities for social, affordable and cost rental.  There was very little interest from the market but many people we spoke to are now coming back because of the changes and asking are there possibilities now for turnkey cost rental and affordable.  That change in the market presents opportunities.  </p></speech>

The market to sell apartments is even worse because of the cost and particularly in the city area.

The opportunity with the private residential sector, PRS, not activating its existing planning permissions is there.  The impediment, as I see it, is that X + Y is equalling market rent and not that X + Y is equalling 25% discount on market rent.  I understand the Land Development Agency is doing work on the possibility of some form of subsidy fitting in there so that it would be X + Y - subsidy equals 25% discount on market rent.  Will the representatives comment on whether that is the model that will unlock a lot of this PRS stock?  My view is that it would.</p></speech>

I think there is clearly a role for the LDA to perhaps take the lead here rather than have individual local authorities and approved housing bodies all competing.  The State would be better if one agency took the lead and I personally think it might be the LDA.  But there will be a need for a significant level of subsidy if we are to achieve appropriate rents.</p></speech>

That is the ideal situation for the LDA but there are issues around state aid.  It is examining those and getting advice on that.

Things have changed dramatically in the market since April, as the chief executive said.  Since I returned from annual leave after the summer we have had ten to 11 approaches from people with properties who are looking to talk to us.  That was not happening before the summer.  The market has changed.  Thinking back to April, we were in a position where the war in Ukraine had begun.  There was an awful lot of flux around trying to deal with the initial humanitarian crisis.  That has settled but the reality is that this may be quite a long situation with interest rates and global markets.  That has all changed really quickly.  Even the percentage interest rate increases have changed.  Hopefully, if we can get the approach to the market correct, we will see an uptake and hopefully we will see delivery of the units based on that.</p></speech>

There is probably an element of properties that are no longer voids but are going through an allocations process.  I do not have an exact number but I can get it if the Deputy wants.  Sometimes the allocations process takes a little time with refusals, engagement with people on the list, trying to get them across the line and then to get them to move in to the properties.  That can take three to four months after it has come back as a void, depending on the property and the location.</p></speech>

It is only a very short time before we can get people into them.  As I said before, it falls on me and the team in the excellent team in the Dublin Regional Housing Executive to find emergency accommodation for people who do come in.  The importance of bringing new units in as quickly as possible and getting them used is huge.</p> <p>  Construction inflation is a major conversation piece with all projects.  Even when trying to get people to tender for projects now it is a question of where construction inflation will be in six months or a year.  It is very difficult to know.  A builder who has been asked to tender must have a serious think about that and what is happening.  It is changing so quickly.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#O00400"><p>That is good to know.  On affordable housing, I am open to the idea of availing of opportunities in the market, subject to value for money, location and proper design style acquiring.  The challenge, however, is that at the moment it is virtually impossible to do affordable cost rental as turnkeys in Dublin city or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown as prices are just too high.  Even in O'Devaney Gardens, unless a magic deal is done between the Department and the AHB in question, it will be a struggle.  That means that even where there are those acquisitions - essentially they are acquisitions - it pushes the rents up.  At Shanganagh Castle, for example, the tender prices have come in at more than &euro;400,000 per unit for construction.  That will push the cost rental up to approximately &euro;1,500, higher than it is on Enniskerry Road.  Likewise, although raising the affordable housing fund to &euro;150,000 brings down the purchase price, it increases the overall purchase price in the end because the affordable purchaser has to pay back his or her mortgage of &euro;280,000, &euro;300,000 or &euro;320,000 and the &euro;150,000.  This is not a criticism of anyone in this room, or of the Department in this instance, but one of the things that is happening is that the ultimate cost of what we are terming "affordable housing" is rising significantly.  Affordable rental projects in Dublin city or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown could come at &euro;1,500, &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 per month, which is going to cause difficulties for delivery.  Likewise, for affordable purchase the all-in cost to the purchaser will exceed &euro;400,000.  Is that not the reality of what we have been discussing?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022101100002#O00600"><p>Mr. Keegan should not take this as a criticism, but that is getting lost in our conversation.  When it started, the affordable housing fund was the serviced sites fund, with all its imperfections.  The assumption was there would be all-in delivery costs of &euro;300,000, &euro;40,000 would be knocked off with the equity share and someone would be able to sell the property at &euro;260,000.  We are now in a world where a three-bedroom property at the upper end of the affordable housing fund limits of &euro;320,000 could cost the purchaser &euro;460,000, ultimately.  That person could work his or her entire life paying off that mortgage and still owe an equity share back to the local authority.  That does not have to be paid until the person dies or passes the property on, but it is another &euro;150,000.</p> <p>  As regards CREL, is there any prospect in either local authority of delivering cost rental, either from turnkey or new builds, in the context of inflation, at rents below &euro;1,300, &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500 per month?  Is that on the cards in the coming years?  Given what has just been said about construction inflation, what rents are expected on St. Michael's Estate, for example?  It was &euro;1,300 under Mr. Keegan's predecessor.</p></speech>

We still have to tender for these projects and see what the price comes in at.  Without predicting where construction inflation will go in the next year, we will probably have a year of planning and will be tendering six months or a year later.  It is very difficult.  As it sits, we are at approximately &euro;1,300 per month.  The target is to be 25% below market rent on cost rental and 15% below on affordable sale.  We are aware of those targets and that we have to make them.  It is not an issue of affordability; it is that the cost of delivery has a knock-on effect.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be difficult.  Brendan Kenny gave a figure of &euro;1,300 per month for St. Michael's back in 2019.  Knowing what we know about cost inflation between then and now, we are probably looking at &euro;1,500, depending on what a tender would come in at today.  That might go down at a later stage but we are not expecting construction sector inflation to go down.  Likewise with turnkey properties, or even O'Devaney Gardens, are the witnesses optimistic that affordable cost rental, as people call it, could be delivered at &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 per month in O'Devaney Gardens, given what they currently know?</p></speech>

We are conscious that we have to deliver 25% below market rent.  We have to take all the input elements - all the financial and cost elements and the affordable housing fund - and see if we can continue to do it.  The &euro;50,000 additionality will help, but it is challenging.  That is not a secret.</p></speech>

On Enniskerry Road, they were coming in at approximately &euro;1,200 per month.  That was developed a few years ago, before the construction price inflation.  On the likes of Shanganagh Castle, which the Deputy mentioned, prices are coming in at in excess of &euro;400,000.  With the subsidy, one would be seeking to bring that down to approximately &euro;1,500 per month but what one has to look at then-----</p></speech>

My point is that we started off at &euro;1,200 per month and we are now at &euro;1,500.  That might be 25% below market rent but, in terms of affordability for those people above the threshold for social housing, for whom cost rental is key, &euro;1,500 is prohibitively expensive.</p></speech>

The local authority of Mr. Curran and Ms Keenan is going to deliver 2,318 new social homes by the end of 2026 but it has 2,458 households currently on the housing waiting list, another 1,768 that are in RAS or HAP tenancies and on waiting lists, and it projected as of July that a further 2,825 will join the list in the next five years.  Therefore, on a simple calculation, in 2026 there will be a worse housing crisis in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and a bigger waiting list than there is now.  How is that an adequate response to the housing crisis there?</p> <p>  How many housing applicants have been removed from the housing list because they have exceeded the housing threshold in recent years?  Do the witnesses have those figures?</p></speech>

There are 27,000 in the delivery pipeline.  The targets for each county were set out.  For us, it was 1,994 in terms of social housing.  We project that we will deliver more than that.  That is a realistic target based on the staff and resources we have, the money we will get from central government and the money the AHBs in our area will get from central government.  The Deputy mentioned the lists.  The figures I have are broadly similar to those to which he referred.  There are 3,700 on the waiting list, with D&uacute;n Laoghaire being the primary local authority for 2,352 of them.  There are also 1,500 people on HAP.  It is still a significant delivery in the period 2022 to 2026.  There is a lot of resources and work going into that-----</p></speech>

There will be 4,400 households on the list at the end of this plan whereas, according to Mr. Curran, there are currently approximately 3,000 households on it.</p><p>That is a grim scenario.  I do not blame Mr. Curran, but it is just not good enough.  We have a flipping disaster in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The suffering it is causing to people is beyond what is acceptable.  We have a plan that is going to leave us in a worse position in four years than we are in now.  I feel like pulling my hair out when I hear it.  This must be called what it is, and this is what the figures are telling us.  Let us be clear what we are talking about.  I understand the difficulties involved and that this is more than we have done before, but it is a fact that we are going to be in a worse position in four years than we are now.  That is going to be the case, unless someone is going to tell me I am missing something in the context of these figures.</p></speech>

What I will say, though, is that the Deputy is right in that 1,564 people are receiving HAP and are on a transfer list.  They are housed, however.  Difficulties do exist in this regard.  Some of these people have received notices to quit or whatever, but they are housed.  Some people are quite happy to be on HAP.  This aspect must be considered.  The State is paying for them and they are housed.</p></speech>

If you add to that the 2,825 people expected to be added to the list in the next few years, it means we will be in a worse position at the end of this period, with thousands of extra people on the list.  Something must be done about this.  We have to do more.  The Government needs to know this, but we must do more.  I presume we do not have an answer as to how many applicants were removed from the housing list between 2018 and 2021.</p></speech>

The Government has been stating that its policy is shifting on this issue, but the witnesses are telling us that the council is not actively in the market.  We need clarity on this.  Is there an active policy to purchase houses in light of these shortfalls and the number of people going into homelessness?  Specifically, what is happening with the St. Helen's Court complex?  There are 15 empty units there and several tenants are still threatened with eviction after several years.  Are we going to buy that apartment block?</p></speech>

Do we have any idea of how much the affordable and cost-rental units will cost in Shanganagh when they are constructed?

There is certainly interest as well in the new schemes we spoke about earlier and where we see units coming through from the local authorities, as turn keys, the LDA and the AHBs via the CREL scheme.  All that is ongoing and many units are coming on stream.  Work is either underway or planning permission has been obtained for 3,700 units, with more to come.  Approximately 10,500 units will be built in future years.  There will be the minimum of 10% social and affordable housing, but then we will also have the other units that will come on stream as well.</p> <p>  Turning to the rent levels in Shanganagh, and we spoke about this earlier, these have not yet been calculated.  If I were to estimate it, I would suggest the figure will be around &euro;1,500.</p></speech>

I would say this, being in Dublin.  We argued with the Department that it must be recognised that 9% of units being built in the Dublin City Council area are apartments.  Apartments are just much more expensive.  We must consider this fact when we are designing housing interventions.  If we want people to live in the city, then the cost of housing is important.  Largely by State diktat, because of the requirement for a higher density, building apartments is more expensive.</p></speech>

Are there potential pockets in this regard concerning infill that can be targeted in the context of delivery?  In the housing action plan for the area, there is an ambition to deliver 10% of the stock for people with disabilities.  Where does this process stand?  What is being done for future years?  Have sites been identified for three and four units, for example, to cater for people with intellectual disabilities?  I refer to working with agencies such as the HSE, the Brothers of Charity Services or whatever organisations may be operating in this space in the local authority area to deliver these units.  </p></speech>

We have a very active disability steering group with all of the local providers on that, including St. John of God, which is probably the most prominent one in our area.

These grants are important to allow people to remain living independently in their own homes as they deal with a disability, an acquired disability, old age or infirmity.  I understand in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that &euro;2.5 million was allocated for 2022.  However, as of September, only &euro;1 million has been drawn down.  I will just give notice that this question is actually coming from Deputy Cormac Devlin.  He is concerned about it and would appreciate if Mr. Curran could give a reaction to that.  Is he happy that the full allocation will be drawn down by the end of the year?</p> <p>  I also want to ask about the financial contribution scheme.  I do not know if D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council operates it, but Dublin City Council&rsquo;s financial contribution scheme is a very valuable housing supply mechanism.  It takes existing housing stock where there are elderly people living in the community who are living in a home that is beyond their needs.  In return for them surrendering and selling the home back to Dublin City Council, the council increases housing stock and provides the sellers, in return for a financial contribution, with adequate purpose-built and appropriate housing.  Does D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown operate the financial contribution scheme?  What can Dublin City Council do to accelerate and increase it?  I know there are significant waiting lists in Cabra and Drumcondra.  People want to remain in the community and continue to live among the people with whom they lived all their lives, but they need city council to deliver the option to them.</p> <p>  In the case of St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Court,  two years have passed and people are scratching their heads.  Two years on from the planning permission, and given that the land is owned by the city council and the site has been completely flattened and demolished, why is it taking so long for the builder to get on-site and start building?  </p> <p>  Could our guests reply to those questions, starting with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council?</p></speech>

We did a new allocation scheme last year and for the first time it has been provided in that.  However, we do not have a financial contribution scheme, but it is provided in the allocation scheme so that we can do that.</p> <p>  On the housing adaptation grants, we are conscious of what the Senator saying.  Deputy Devlin is correct in terms of the amounts drawn down.  Sometimes we get applications that do not proceed, perhaps because somebody could not get a person to do the work, so that might lap over into the following year or whatever.  We definitely progress with the applications that come through to us.  I am confident we will get most of that through, except sometimes there are some issues around that.</p></speech>

The question on the financial contribution scheme is a great one.  It leads to many other topics, such as the need for one-bedroom accommodation and one-bedroom older persons&rsquo; accommodation.  Of the 13,377 people on our housing list, 9,069 have a one-bedroom need.  That is a narrative that sometimes does not get out there.  We hear much about the need for three-bedroom family homes and stuff like this.  However, the reality is that the vast majority of people on our housing lists and our housing assistance payment, HAP, transfer list need one-bedroom units.  That also leads into right-sizing, which is the financial contribution scheme.  The scheme is hugely popular, but we have to have the units on the other side to put people into.  I am not being flippant, but if we do not have the one-bedroom units, there is a bit of a moral hazard element as well with queue-jumping and stuff like that with it.  We have to be very careful how we do that.</p> <p>  It comes back to the need for significant developments within our programme of older persons&rsquo; accommodation.  Even within our own housing stock, we would have large numbers of people who have two more bedrooms than they need for their current situation in life.  That, yet again, is a complexity.  People who have raised a family in a three-bedroom home for many years are now just living there by themselves.  How does one engage with that person?</p><p>It just goes back to the need for one-bed accommodation for older persons to meet the downsizing need and the financial contribution scheme.  A focus on that on our part will help.</p></speech>

However, there is an element of the process that we have to go through with defined design in order to get it ready to go to tender.  Then there is the tender process and assessment of tender.  It takes a period to go through stage 3 to get to the final product.  That is a difficulty but we have to do undertake that process.  It ensures value for money and that we are doing things in the right and transparency and oversight within the public good.</p></speech>

I also appreciate that Dublin City Council and all of the other local authorities have that challenge in dealing with the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  I appreciate the due diligence, cost-benefit analysis and all of the feasibility studies that have to be done.  They are all really important steps in the process but they are taking too long.  Sr. Stanislaus launched a Focus Ireland report earlier.  That report notes record levels of homelessness.  Sr. Stanislaus made the point that what is missing is a collective sense of urgency.  She said to us, the politicians, that we need to work collectively but she also said that all of the arms of the State need to work with greater urgency.  I very much appreciate Mr. O'Reilly being here today but when he engages with those Departments, I ask that he push them because we are pushing them too.</p></speech>

Obviously Cork City Council will have to answer that when it is here next week, but it relates to the point we made earlier about affordability that is unaffordable.  We are looking at people now who are buying houses that are not affordable.  How do we solve that?  I know there are considerable issues with the cost of construction, land, materials and labour but, what I am hearing from listening to the witnesses is that people in Dublin will not be able leave rent because it will not be affordable.  Is that a true statement?</p></speech>

If those houses are costing &euro;450,000 to build and the &euro;150,000 is only bringing it down to &euro;300,000, that is still a hefty price.  The Deputy mentioned that cost rental is bringing it down to &euro;1,500, which is significantly less than the market rent but it is still significant.  That is the reality of the market, construction inflation and the prices we pay.</p></speech>

A number of the witnesses made a point about older people who are living in two-, three- or four-bedroom houses.  Every one of us knows people like that.  We need more of a roll-out of that type of one-bed accommodation.  We have some very successful ones in Cork and probably in other areas, but we need more of them.  Are councils looking at upping the delivery of that?</p> <p>  I am my party's spokesman on addiction, recovery and well-being.  We are dealing with people in recovery who are trying to come out of homelessness.  They are looking for accommodation where they will not be around triggers or be made relapse into addiction.  Are the witnesses looking at delivering that kind of housing more local authorities?</p></speech>

At Tiglin, accommodation is provided for people coming out of addiction.  They will stay in that accommodation for perhaps a year.  The chances of relapse are much lower, needless to say, by staying there.  After that year, they go into the community.  We have had a number of opportunities with that type of model down through the years.  It is definitely worth looking at.  I agree with the Deputy that we need more one-beds for homelessness, single people and downsizing.  When we build a scheme of housing for the elderly, we always allow for downsizing in order to make other properties available.</p></speech>

We have nearly 3,600 units which are very well done, successful and popular.  It is part of the financial contribution and people want to get on board.

I mentioned the Shanganagh scheme which has worked out very well for us.  The Central Mental Hospital is part of a strategic housing development application which, if successful, will deliver a further 900 affordable units.  That is very significant.  Other State lands in the county will deliver very significant numbers of affordable units.  Our concentrating on social housing and the LDA's concentrating on affordable housing could work out really well for us.  The engagement has been fine.  If opportunities have come through for the LDA in Project Tosaigh or Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, it has made contact with us.  It is working out fine.  The delivery is starting now that the sod has turned on Shanganagh and I hope that will continue.  We mentioned earlier the opportunities that will arise because of the downturn in the private rented sector market and developers' interest in turnkey housing and the possibility of a Project Tosaigh phase 2.  These will enhance the co-operation and delivery from the LDA.</p></speech>

In the course of the discussion, somebody texted me to say that the costs are exorbitant.  They really are.</p><p>That is something we are going to have to examine.  In a position where the State is effectively acting as the developer, where there are no land costs and no developer's premium, where the State is also subsidising the price of the home up to &euro;150,000, we are still at a point where we are stretching the parameters of affordability.  The issue there has to be the spec.  It is either that or there is a restrictive tendering process that we are not getting full value for money for.  It is certainly one or the other.  If a community organisation came to the witnesses looking to build a community centre and it was coming in at twice the budget, all four of them would tell it to reduce the spec.</p><p> What I am taking from this session is that we are coming in at increasingly higher prices for the construction costs.  If we are going to look at affordability, we are also going to have to look at the specs we are putting out to the market.  That is a bigger question than the witnesses can answer in five minutes but I would appreciate if they could talk about the tendering process.  Do they feel they are getting value for money?  How many players are operating in any one tender?  Senator Fitzpatrick and I are both very proud of having worked in Dublin City Council and we are both particularly proud of the financial contribution scheme.  It is a no-brainer.  It is an income stream and it allows you to pepper-pot social development in existing communities.  It has higher densities, which allows you to deliver more units.  Nobody ever objects to senior citizen accommodation.  Is something we should be building more of.  In my area, for example, some of those 28 sites that were mentioned include housing for senior citizens and I welcome that.  I ask the witnesses to talk about the costs.</p></speech>

Talking to any builder, they will say that materials' price inflation is a real issue.  The cost of timber, rebar and ceramics has gone up.  It is running anywhere between 15% and 30% up on the last year or two.  The supply of labour is difficult.  It is expensive.  Building in city areas is particularly expensive in terms of access to sites and getting people in to work there.  It is a real issue.  Going back maybe two years ago, we were getting very few tenders back.  Builders were afraid of committing to fixed-price contracts.  There has been some movement around that now because we can look at construction inflation and provide some compensation for that through variable price contracts and so on.  That has helped but there was a stage when they were very fearful of committing because it is a high-risk business.  Now at least people are tendering.</p> <p>  Regarding value for money, it is a competitive tender process.  What we get in is the value of the work and there is very little we can do about it.  On the spec, we have to build to building regulations.  We have to build to an A rating and the NZEB so we are kind of tied with those.  To reduce the spec we have to look at the likes of kitchens and stuff like that, which saves very little money.  It is a difficult process.</p></speech>

We have to be careful not to accept that some of the tender prices the local authorities unfortunately have to sign up to are actually the real cost of building.  As far back as 2019, Dublin City Council, through no fault of its own, was effectively having to sign contracts where a very small number of contractors were bidding for large, complex urban developments.  There is a widespread belief in the industry, not among politicians but among other builders, that those costs are inflated.  The local authorities have to work with the public procurement process and with the tenders.  If there are only two tenders in the end and they both have very high prices they have to live with that.  I do not accept, for example, that the tender the LDA has signed in Shanganagh is the actual cost of building those houses.  I know it has a district heating system and that is going to add &euro;20,000 per unit or something but I have a problem with the idea that just the hard costs and compliance come to &euro;420,000.  I agree with Deputy McAuliffe that there is a need for the committee to come back and look at this.  I am looking at private sector developers doing similar sized projects in my constituency and they have the same development costs and sale prices as what the LDA has signed in Shanganagh.  That is no criticism of the LDA or the local authorities but let us not assume that just because that is the price a developer or building contractor gives, that is the actual market value.  I have talked to building contractors that are doing medium-sized apartment developments in Dublin city and in my own local authority area and they are coming in with hard costs that are substantially lower than that, even though they are fully compliant, A-rated and all the rest.  There is work for the committee to do on what the actual cost is because that needs to be flushed out.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Reilly will roll his eyes at this because I say it every time.  It is terribly short-term for local authorities to offload cost rental onto others.  St Teresa's Gardens is a good example.  One of the great values of cost rental is that when those loans are paid down, it generates a revenue surplus.  If the landlord can access that revenue surplus that then assists in the future management of the stock when we are all long gone and retired.  One of the reasons Dublin City Council is in such difficulty with housing stock from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s is because it never had an adequate mechanism, through no fault of its own, to finance the ongoing management and maintenance.  If the cost rental and social rental are kept under the same landlord, whoever the landlord is, there is a long-term benefit to the financial sustainability of it.  I understand there are all sorts of reasons why Dublin City Council made that decision on St Teresa's Gardens but it is giving up a long-term revenue stream and I think that is unfortunate.</p> <p>  The one area we have not really talked about, which is within the scope of today's meeting but not the primary focus, is homelessness.  We had a very difficult couple of months at the end of the summer when, on any given night in Dublin, emergency accommodation was full.  That is according to a good report from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  A significant number of single people and families from Dublin are currently in emergency accommodation in Meath, Kildare and elsewhere.  Given that we know from the DRHE's report what the immediate problem is, which is a rise in presentations, particularly due to notices to quit, and a dramatic fall-off in exits, is there anything giving the witnesses the impression that things are going to change or improve over the next number of months?  Is this going to be the dynamic from now until the end of the year?  If all other things stay as they are, are we likely to see continued increased presentations and a continually low level of exits?  That is what we are all looking at to see if those homeless numbers continue to increase.  What is the witnesses' read of where we are heading over the next couple of months?</p></speech>

It is tight all the time.  The number of families who are what we would call self-accommodating, which is when they go to a hotel, is unfortunately increasing.  We got it down to an all-time low of 147 in August 2021.  In 2022 we were up to 214.  Our ability to provide bespoke family emergency accommodation is dwindling rapidly.  It is hard to predict where this will go.  The essence of the issue, as the Deputy mentioned, is that 50% of people who came into homeless accommodation in August came in through notices of termination.  It is difficult to know where that goes, where the endpoint is and where it stops.</p><p>From our point of view, what we can control is bringing those voids back into the housing stock, bringing those new units in and trying to make allocations from the small percentage that goes directly to the homeless and those homeless people who are on the list.</p></speech>

We are fully aware of the trauma those families are going through.  We are working to try to get a number of exits.  Mr. O'Reilly is right.  There are difficulties in respect of self-accommodation and the emergency accommodation we can provide at the moment, for a variety of reasons that are probably well documented.  Our team is working to try to increase the exits between now and the end of the year.</p></speech>

When someone is in crisis, presents as homeless and no emergency accommodation is available, suggesting that they then go and ring around hotels to self-accommodate is a particularly punitive thing.  I do not mean that as a criticism but I note it considering the stress they are under.  We had done away with that self-accommodation option and people got their emergency accommodation through the central placement service.  How many families are currently trying to source self-accommodation?  Many of those people will be over-holding and, therefore, putting themselves and the owners of the properties in an even more difficult situation.  Do we know how many households are in that position?</p></speech>

We are joined by a member of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who is very welcome.  All participants are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name in such a way as to make them identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>I am pleased to welcome Vice-President Jourov&aacute; to our meeting today. <i>Vitajte</i>.  She is joined by Mr. &Aacute;lvaro de Elera, who is a member of the Vice-President's cabinet.  <i>Bienvenido</i>.  She is also joined by Mr. Jonathan Claridge, who is deputy head of the European Commission representation in Ireland.  They are very welcome.</p><p>I understand the Vice-President is interested in discussing a number of matters with us today but particularly the European Commission's Rule of Law Report, which was adopted in July of this year, and the rule of law situation in Ireland.  I also understand that a copy of our report on civil liberties during the Covid 19 pandemic was sent to her and I hope she found it interesting.</p><p>I invite Vice-President Jourov&aacute; to make her opening remarks, following which we will have an engagement with the committee members.</p></speech>

I am always very honoured when I can visit a member state and have a chance to speak to the member about rule of law issues but also other things which might be of interest for the members of the parliaments.  I am responsible for the rule of law principle and strengthening the principle for media, for the fight against disinformation and for digital regulation.  I am also responsible for fundamental rights matters and electoral integrity.  It is a very broad portfolio.<br/><br/>Let me start by expressing my deepest sympathy with the families of those who died in Donegal because I know this is a terrible tragedy for Ireland.<br/><br/>Coming to the agenda, I am sure members know of the Rule of Law Report recommendations for Ireland.  For the first time this year, we issued the recommendations.  In the previous two reports, it was more or less descriptive.  We described how we saw the situation in the spheres of judiciary, media, anti-corruption and the institutional checks and balances.<br/><br/>We started this Rule of Law Report annual exercise because we were asked by several member states to focus on all member states.  You can imagine there were strong calls from Malta, Poland and Hungary and several other mainly eastern European countries that we should do this overall mapping and I was very much for that.  I was previously the European Commissioner for Justice, <font color="#202122">Consumers and Gender Equality,</font>so I have lived this for many years.  I was in favour of this because it is good to have the overall picture of the whole system.  We have 27 unique systems in our 27 member states.  That is why when I sometimes hear arguments from some countries that the European Commission is criticising them for having some elements of the system and when they say other states also have them, I always say we have to look at the whole system with all the elements and then make a judgment or make an assessment that there are some gaps in the rule of law system.  I am sure members know the recommendations for Ireland.  There are recommendations regarding judicial appointments, the number of judges, the efficiency of the Judiciary, the cost of litigation, and the prospect for more efficient Judiciary functioning, including digitalisation, which I will not go into further here.  In the anti-corruption sphere, we have some very positive assessments, such as strengthening the existing ethics framework and so on.<br/><br/>Regarding media freedom and pluralism, we note that preparatory work is ongoing for the establishment of a new media regulatory authority.  The general scheme of the defamation Bill to update aspects of the defamation law is expected to be published in the first quarter of this year.<br/><br/>These are very important matters for me because as members might know, we are working on the media freedom Act and I would like to receive support from the Irish authorities.  We have also proposed the anti-SLAPP legislation, which is very close to what Ireland is doing.</p><p>I have just spoken to the Minister for Justice and I believe we are on the same page with the plan that there should be stronger protection for journalists.  We have also included in our proposal human rights defenders when they are facing litigation.</p><p> We are very much convinced that our Rule of Law Report reflected Ireland as a country with many positive features and this is why I am very glad that today we can discuss the situation.  I want to clarify that this is not an inspection trip to Ireland.  This is a very welcome opportunity for a discussion.  The Rule of Law Report is meant to be a preventative tool and an invitation for well-informed and thorough debate with the national authorities, including the parliaments.</p><p> Today I discussed with the Minister for Justice the European arrest warrant and I understand the European Arrest Warrant (Amendment) Bill 2022 completed its passage through the Lower House of the Oireachtas in June this year.  I was given the assurance from the Minister that the legislators have given it high priority and will prioritise this process to ensure the concerns as set out in the infringement proceedings will be addressed as soon as possible.</p><p> I would also like to hear the committee's views on European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO.  I have a history with this institution because I inherited this file from my predecessor in 2014, Viviane Reding, who I replaced in the position as the European Commissioner for Justice.  We had to modify the model of EPPO from a centralised one into a decentralised one, because otherwise it would not gain support from the member states.  At this moment we have 23 member states on board.  Sweden is signalling it will join.  Ireland and Denmark are out due to the opt out.  Hungary and Poland are out due to their own reasons, which is they simply did not want to join the EPPO.  I have one comment in this regard.  I am convinced that if Poland Hungary had joined the EPPO, it would not have come with the conditionality regulation, which gives us the possibility to freeze the money of a country that does not respect the rule of law principle.  There is a connection between the EPPO and the conditionality regulation, which we triggered for the first time in the case of Hungary.</p><p> I will speak on the electoral package but I will not go into details as I am aware I had five minutes to speak here.  We have a deep conviction that we must do much more to protect elections as a strong pillar of European democracy.  Before the elections in 2019 we established the European electoral network.  We invited representatives of all member states and we discussed risks we had identified.  These risks included cybersecurity risks and the stealing of private data from people for the purpose of hidden manipulation - we recall the Cambridge Analytica case - which we believe is a clear risk because this information is a problem for free and fair elections.  Other risks discussed were the lack of rules that reflect the fact that advertising has shifted to the online sphere.  Since 2017 and over time, we have developed stronger instruments to protect elections and protect the autonomous vote of voters.</p><p> We have proposed, among other things, regulation on political advertising as specific to the Digital Services Act.  By this law we want to increase transparency so that when people read some content, they know it is fake content that has the purpose of influencing the political preference and voting preference of the individual.  We want more transparency in that regard.  The second thing we did was to prohibit micro-targeting on the basis of sensitive data such as race, sexual orientation, religion and political opinions.  This is very much consistent with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, because GDPR defines the sensitive data.  We also proposed new rules for European political parties and for better possibilities for mobile citizens to cast their vote.  These are our contributions to strengthen the electoral system in the EU.  Of course, this is not an easy field because the regulation of electoral regimes stays mainly with the member states.  This is why we identified the layer where we can do our part of the job to strengthen the electoral systems.  This is it.  All of these three things I have mentioned, the political advertising, the European political parties and the voting rights of mobile citizens, are now in the legislative process.  On the first element especially, I believe the Irish contribution will be interesting and useful within the Council because Ireland is advanced in many aspects we govern in the legislation.</p><p> That is the contribution from my side.  I went quickly through all of the items I had prepared for the committee, but of course I am also available for any questions the members may have.  I came first of all for the committee feedback and information, and especially on how the committee members see the relevance and opportunity of our Rule of Law Report.  It is always important for us to understand, from donations of parliaments, whether they find it useful and whether they think the Commission came with relevant and trustworthy assessment.</p></speech>

I have not heard the term "mobile citizens" used before.  I like it.  I thank Ms Jourov&aacute; for her presentation.  So many areas of the Rule of Law Report touch on much of the work I do but I will try to home in on two particular areas, one of which is the Electoral Reform Act 2022 in Ireland.  I authored legislation here some years ago around the Electoral Reform Act.  Ms Jourov&aacute; mentioned elections, election advertising and trying to do elections well.  Sometimes, in trying to do elections well, we have actually hindered other types of work around civil liberties, community work and advocacy that does not fall within the realm of elections.  Based on Ms Jourov&aacute;'s experience and the work and findings of the report from across the EU, do any equivalent obstacles exist in other countries as do in Ireland in the context of the framing of political purposes?  This framing in Ireland has actually hindered normal activism work.  This applies to everything from residents associations up.  Ms Jourov&aacute; may be aware that, given the way "political purposes" is framed in Ireland, it falls outside of the regulations of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.</p><p>Even when no general election or referendum campaign is ongoing, normal civil society activism is shut down because of the definition of political purposes in our legislation.  Has that come up at all?</p><p> I will ask a few questions first and then the witnesses can come back in.  I think there was an ECJ finding in respect of Hungary that might be similar to the situation in Ireland in that it involved violation of EU regulations on privacy and Single Market governance.  There might be some relation between the two.  Based on the witnesses' engagement with the Irish Government, are they confident that legal obstacles which restrict the work of civil society will be addressed and in a timely manner?  I know that they cannot be critical of the Government and that they are here for different reasons.  My fear, however, is that we have slowed down the process of addressing the issue of the electoral legislation due to the setting up of a commission, which means that, while it is said that everything will be dealt with within the commission, many civil society organisations are not able, while the electoral commission is being developed, to do the work they set out to do for fear of being caught in this kind of rigid definition.</p><p> As for the review of the Electoral Acts, do the witnesses feel that those Acts are the appropriate forum in which this legislative anomaly should be addressed or are there alternatives?  If the witnesses do not have answers to these questions, there is no need to worry.  I can send the questions on to them afterwards if there is anything they cannot answer now.</p><p> The rule of law report also expressed concern about the tight timeframes in which new legislation is debated and scrutinised in the Oireachtas, especially during the weeks leading up to the recess periods of summer and Christmas.  As an Independent Senator who is quite active, I believe that this is a huge issue because, especially in the Seanad, we work very hard to amend and to review every single piece of legislation that comes before us and we feel that the railroading of legislation really negatively impacts democracy.  I know that the report looked at that.  Is parliamentary scrutiny undermined, do the witnesses believe, in a similar way in any other EU member state?  On our side, the Government has been somewhat quiet in response to widespread domestic criticism of how it has tried to do parliamentary business.  Do the witnesses feel that the Government has responded in any such way to the concern expressed in the rule of law report in this regard?  Has it responded in any satisfactory way?</p><p> I am happy to have the Chair send on any of the questions on which the witnesses would prefer to come back to me.</p></speech>

We had a really big headache when working on this regulation.  There were four things we had to decide how to formulate.  One was time and whether to cover the whole time or to accept the fact that there is now permanent political campaigning.  The experts in marketing, political marketing especially, tell us to forget about covering only some campaign time or three weeks before elections.  The campaign is permanent.  We agreed and we do not define any special rules for the time before elections.</p> <p>  The second thing was the microtargeting.  I have spoken about that.  There was a big discussion between "let us not touch it" and "let us ban everything".  Now among the voices from the European Parliament are those who would like to go farther.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about civil society organisations.  We scrutinised very well what the reality looks like and found that in every member state there are civil society organisations which try to influence electoral preferences.  It is legitimate, so we said it was okay and that we would not narrow the space for such organisations.  We just want full transparency.  When an NGO runs a political programme with the aim of influencing elections, we want such actors to be transparent about who pays for that, how much and in which elections.  They are the parameters for transparency.  That is it.  We are not banning or shutting down anything.  I expected very assertive or negative reactions from the side of civil society, but when they read through the text and found out that the only thing we require is transparency, they welcomed that.  This legislation is still a work in progress, however, so we might see some changes proposed from the side of the member states.  It is, however, already at an advanced stage, and the Commission, represented by me, will insist that we propose something which is balanced and which seeks to increase the transparency of advertising.</p> <p>  Coming to the Senator's second point about the legal obstacles, we have seen over years the trend of shrinking space for civil society.  It can be a somewhat slow process, even an unintended one or one caused by financial pressure, or it can be intentional in that the leaders of the state are not comfortable with the people, the activists, the representatives of the NGOs.  I will not name and shame, but members can use their imagination.  There are ways to intentionally shrink further that space, including by legal obstacles, as was the case in Hungary, which we put to the European Court of Justice, which in turn has already given the decision that Hungary should change the laws which impose obligations on civil society organisations, obligations which have led to a very difficult existence and functioning for such organisations in Hungary.  ECJ rulings have the power of precedent, yes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jonathan Claridge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101100002#C00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

The court ruling is here, including the parameters for setting the rules and conditions for civil society, which will be proportionate and necessary.  There are some benchmarks in the ruling.  One way is to bring legal obstacles.  There is a reflection already in the ECJ ruling in that regard.  The second is financial pressure or decreasing budgets.  That is happening in several member states and we have real concerns about it.  It is also reflected in the Irish rule of law report that we see some negative changes in that way.  The third way is hostile and hateful rhetoric of the leaders of the countries against activists, human rights defenders and journalists.  I would not underestimate that because it is one of the factors also contributing to the shrinking of the space for civil society.  Once the people, the citizens, believe that the NGOs are public enemies, for the parliament it is easy.  It does not lose anything when the budgets go down.  There is a clear correlation.  That is why we are also working on harmonising the rules against hate speech online.  I think that is one of the factors which influence civil society.</p> <p>  As for the timeframe and the fine-tuning of the rule of law report with the parliamentary work, we have a very stable schedule so we now have time to digest the report.</p><p>That is what I am here to discuss.  From January on, we will start to collect the data and, between February and April or May, we will be able to reflect the legislative changes happening in the member state.  As I said to the Minister earlier, we will reflect as much as we can the positive things which come, especially as a reaction to our recommendations.  The timeframe is stable and we will publish the report again in July.  The methodology is stable, transparent and predictable, and we do not want to change it too much - perhaps just some details.</p><p> What has been criticised heavily by many governments is that we are listening too much to the NGOs, although I am simplifying the point.  After the first rule of law report, we got many questions as to what are the channels of information from which we are collecting.  However, we are very transparent about these channels and it is publicly known who is contributing to the rule of law report.  What was the third question?</p></speech>

In Ireland, the definition of political purposes is causing issues with the Standards in Public Office Commission in regard to funding.  Ms Jourov&aacute; spoke about the shrinking of funding.  Through her experience of doing the report, does she have any alternatives for Ireland to be able to address this anomaly in the Electoral Acts so civil society organisations are not judged in the same way as politicians or parties regarding civil society work?</p></speech>

We made that choice.  With regard to political advertising, we recognise that some civil society organisations are pushing a political programme and it should be known by the public.  Perhaps if the Senator was to formulate a country-specific question, we will deliver a country-specific answer.</p></speech>

People are falling into political definitions who should not be doing so.  I can send on the legislation that I have authored in order to give Ms Jourov&aacute; more context.</p></speech>

It is not just governments; there is a huge move among those who want to take the freedoms and liberties of others away and to push back against civil society.  Maybe I am a little na&iuml;ve, but it seems to me that most of the rhetoric against NGOs and civil society is outside.  There is some of it in this building; we hear it, and it is often a reflection of those wider currents of those who want to tear apart the fabric of society, but it is a growing problem and the fact we are hearing it in here more is concerning.  As Ms Jourov&aacute; said, this is a general problem across the Union.</p> <p>  The fundamental rights of European citizens are absolutely worth protecting but the challenge is that, quite often, we need to see greater enforcement.  In this committee, we have spoken a lot about GDPR and in regard to data protection.  There are those of us on the committee who are constantly beating that drum and expressing our concerns about the undermining of European Union citizens&rsquo; fundamental rights because of a failure of enforcement of the GDPR.  I do not know if this made it into the rule of law report or not, but one thing I would like to flag up is that going hand in hand with this issue of GDPR privacy and fundamental rights are issues relating to data gathering and real-time bidding, which is something the Irish Council of Civil Liberties is campaigning against and I believe it has some court actions in that regard.  Real-time bidding has the potential to be a huge engine for disinformation and manipulation.  For me, it comes down to enforcement.  Anything that can be done to improve the issue of enforcement or to highlight the weak areas of enforcement within Ireland is fundamental for me.</p> <p>  It was positive to hear Ms Jourov&aacute; talk about defamation and strategic lawsuits against public participation, SLAPP, and that the Minister is in a similar place to her.  This is something we have seen a lot of here.  I ask Ms Jourov&aacute; to talk more about the moves afoot in that regard, which would be very helpful to us, as a committee.  One of the things that is worth flagging up is that one of the recommendations was around the strength of our ethics legislation and the strength or, in reality, the weakness of the ethics enforcement of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We see this today.  We have news today that a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, one of our national bodies to do with planning and development, is to have criminal sanctions brought against him, and I will say no more about that.  At the same time, there are court cases collapsing because An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not contesting claims that it made its decisions in an inappropriate manner.  This flows directly from those weak ethics and weak ethics enforcement.  I will say no more about it lest I get myself or someone else in trouble.</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear more about the challenges of enforcement and, in particular, recommendations for Ireland in regard to improving enforcement in general, and some more information in regard to SLAPP and that kind of work.</p></speech>

Deputy Costello has triggered a lot of ideas of a more conceptual character.  I will restrict myself to saying that the longer I work in this field of protecting democracy, the more I am convinced that active citizenship is the key thing.  Without having people who care, who are demanding and who push governments to be transparent and accountable and to deliver, we cannot have better and more robust democracy.  The Deputy referred to the cases which collapsed in the process.  These are exactly the moments when the trust of people goes down, and we do not see much space for the dropping of trust in democratic institutions in Europe.  In Ireland, of course, the situation is much better than in some other member states.  However, we see that more and more citizens in different surveys are announcing doubts as to whether democracy is delivering for their lives, their security and their perspectives, and it will be even worse now when we are all under the new and horrible threat of the war and its consequences for Europe.</p><p>Active citizenship means that the individual citizens, who have and should be aware their rights, will not be transposed into some kind of crowd which is easy to manipulate.  Here comes the influence of digital media: there is this idea of making the people the crowd for them to be more easily handled.  That is why in GDPR we came back to old, good respect for individual rights - it is still early - and we gave the citizens many rights which they should use as informed people.</p><p> We have to work on what was mentioned about enforcement and gaps in enforcement.  At the same time, people are still missing the knowledge that GDPR is protecting them and that they have rights which they should have enforced.  They should complain.  That is active citizenship.  We cannot invent magical legislation which will protect the people from the top down.  There has always been bottom-up care and this is still missing, but here I am more focused on digital and media literacy and this is the long distance around.</p><p> GDPR had a brilliant idea of one continent, one law, one method of implementation and equally strong enforcement.  That was the theory at the beginning.  Over time, after five years of implementation of GDPR, we see that there are still gaps in some member states.  We have a very demanding task for the Data Protection Commission with regard to the magnitude and all those big fish.</p><p> I spoke yesterday to Helen Dixon who showed me the statistics and all the Data Protection Commission is doing together with other data protection authorities, because there are an incredibly high number of cross-border cases which have to be tackled in co-operation with others.  Our problem is that in the member states we do not have comparably favourable legislation which enables speedy processes.  However, we are aware of that.  Enforcement is key and we are in constant dialogue with the European Data Protection Board about how to improve the overall situation in the EU.  There is always the same set of problems for individual states, that is, underestimated staffing, low budgets and slow procedures.  It has to be difficult on the member state level.</p><p> With regard to strategic lawsuits against public participation, SLAPP, we proposed legislation which would make it more difficult to sue somebody in another state and not just a member state but a third state.  I have in mind mainly the UK because it is a big fashion to go the UK courts.  We proposed a cross-border regime where the judges should look into the case first to make an assessment of whether the case is real or purely "a case for the case" and whether the nature of the litigation behind it is abusive.  We had also recommended the member states adapt the internal system of litigation in order that it should not be that easy to sue somebody for defamation or some wrongdoing.  We mean "somebody" to be journalists and human rights defenders.  That is how we define the targets in our legislation.</p><p> The ministers of justice gave me the first feedback on this proposal.  A big number of them are for the legislation, including the domestic legislation.  However, they always tell me we must be cautious not to create some kind of impunity because, even when somebody is rich and powerful, they should have the right of access to the court when somehow harmed by the unprofessional performance of a journalist.  We created a balanced proposal which is now in the legislative process.  I wonder when we can expect a result because a big number of the member states said it is useful but there are some member states who said they did not have any cases like that.  I will have to act mainly in that direction.</p></speech>

I do not know whether she has had a chance to speak to civil society groups.  I can recommend a few.  Our committee made a report where it took in statements from civil society groups.  I am sure the clerk can provide a copy of that to Ms Jourov&aacute;.  There are a few interesting people to follow up with.  I wish to correct the record.  I misspoke when I said "criminal sanctions".  There are no criminal sanctions, only criminal charges.  We are at the very beginning of the process and not the end.  It would be unfair of me to say "sanctions" when they are criminal charges.</p></speech>

Ms Jourov&aacute; said that more judges were needed to deal with the backlog of cases and that we had the lowest number of judges, per head of population, in the EU and that there have been some other concerns expressed because following Covid there are backlogs, especially in family law cases.  Citizens' access to justice is obviously affected by that.  She added that there is a perception that the State is not prioritising this if we are the lowest.  Do she wish to expand on that?</p> <p>  Some concerns have been expressed to the committee that the cuts which were imposed on criminal legal aid, especially after the financial crash ten years ago, have not been removed.  There is now a considerable shortage of lawyers with experience in crime, because the remuneration has not been enough to keep them in it.  There is a statistic that two third of barristers who commence a career in criminal law leave after only six years in practice.  That is obviously a concern for the defence of the individual before the courts.</p> <p>  She made other interesting comments, one of which was on mobile citizens.  Would a mobile citizen be someone who did not necessarily have an address in, but was a citizen of, that state?  Does she envisage that there may be facilities made available to those citizens, if they were citizens, to vote without an address?</p> <p>  My other question is on types of legal aid for dealing with the courts with regard to domestic violence, landlord and tenant or a work-related dispute.  Could or should legal aid be expanded in this State?  I apologise for the number of questions but I am especially interested in mobile citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vra Jourov&aacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101100002#F00100"><p>This is about people who have a residence permit in another member state.  It is not those who have citizenship, but those who have a residence permit and the status which would enable them to cast their vote in European and municipal elections.</p> <p>  It may be a horrible simplification of our story of the Judiciary but what we hear from people is that they want to see a speedy, accessible and fair judicial system.  As regards it being speedy, they want to see their case resolved relatively soon.  I am not referring to criminal proceedings, although I should also perhaps speak about them because when a person is convicted, it is already a problem for the person and such proceedings should not last many years.  In civil matters and family matters, people expect the Judiciary to be speedy and efficient.  We have never pushed for extremely short deadlines because we understand that the speed of the litigation always reflects the complexity of the case.  We are aware of that.  As regards accessibility, I was surprised to learn from a survey I saw today that 80% of respondents stated that participating in civil law litigation is very costly and demanding, even for small and medium enterprises or people who are not very poor, as well as the middle class, perhaps.  I did not see the details of that but 80% of respondents is a rather high figure.  This is connected not only with official legal aid but also with fees, which we discussed today with the Minister.  As I stated, it needs to be speedy, accessible and fair.  The judicial system will never be fair to all; there will always be somebody who is unhappy.  Objective fairness and trustworthiness has been built through decades in every member state.  That is why it is such a fragile sector.  If something is built up through several decades but there are then several cases involving corrupt judges or judges who make bad judgments which the people do not understand in terms of a general feeling of fairness, the trust will go down.  Trust is key.  We have data which show a correlation between low trust and easy attacks on the Judiciary from the side of politicians.  It costs nothing to attack judges if society has low trust in them.</p> <p>  I do not know if I have addressed the Acting Chairman's questions.  Of course, for the rule of law report next year we will again look into the development in Ireland of the respective things that he mentioned.</p></speech>

We look forward to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-11a.1529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022101100002#F00300"><p>I echo some of the points raised by the Acting Chairman.  The statistic that we have approximately 3.3 judges per 100,000 of population, compared with the European average of 18 or 21, is one to which I often refer.  The recently retired President of the High Court, Ms Justice Mary Irvine, has looked for more judges, as has the current President of the High Court, with both making the case that the administration of justice is slowly grinding to a halt without further judges.  We must bear in mind, however, that approximately 80% of cases in the country are at the lowest level, that is, in the District Court.  That is where family law cases are being taken and it is where we also do not have enough judges.  It is a drum I have been banging quite a lot.  I do not know what consultations Ms Jourov&aacute; has had on the matter but members of the Judiciary and recently retired superior court judges such as former Chief Justice Mr. Frank Clarke have spoken eloquently and publicly about the challenges to accessibility that are caused by a lack of judges and funding.</p> <p>  Another issue is that civil legal aid is very restricted in this country.  I do not know how it compares with other jurisdictions but, within the legislation for civil legal aid, there are plenty of areas where it cannot be granted, depending on the nature of the action.  That limits it.  Through the years, a wide variety of community NGOs, free legal aid centres and community law mediation centres have called for reform of civil legal aid.  Even before we get to the matter of funding and budgets, which is always a more difficult issue, the basic structure of civil legal aid is not good enough.</p> <p>  There is a tendency to keep creating new quasi-judicial bodies - I do not know if that translates well - such as an arbitration board to hear a particular issue or right.  I refer to the Workplace Relations Commission, for example.  Quite often, these bodies are heralded as taking decisions away from the courts and, therefore, making them quicker, cheaper and more accessible - all the things Ms Jourov&aacute; spoke about.  In reality, however, it is often the case that they do not so or that their procedures are limited and do not deliver fairness.  A recent big case here will have significant unintended consequences in that context.  It is said that the justice administered in these bodies cannot fall below the standard that pertains in the courts.  That creates a significant problem because if sworn testimony, cross-examination and public hearings must be allowed, then it is logical for free legal aid to be provided as a shield for those who do not have the status to hire an expensive lawyer.  It is a shield for their fundamental rights.  If that legal aid is being provided in the courts, why is it not being provided at those other bodies?  The Chief Justice has a juicy quote in his decision in this regard.  That is an interesting precedent, the consequences of which are yet to play out, particularly in terms of all those judicial bodies, complaints boards and the Data Protection Commission.  I believe that it will also start something in respect of civil legal aid.  I stress that when it comes to civil legal aid, it is not just the issue of funding; it is the breadth of it and what is excluded and what is not.  That needs fundamental reform.</p></speech>

I am more than happy to send through our seminar reports and link with her office and recommend some of the people here.  Mr. Justice Clarke and the superior court judges have been clear on the issue of the Judiciary and how accessibility is not just about the number of judges and the number of courtrooms.  There are fundamental issues that we need to work on.</p></speech>

This belongs to the latter.  When accounting the number of judges per head, one has to understand the system.  In many member states, there are many matters that in other member states belong to the table of judges and higher judiciary officers.  Suddenly, there is some kind of deformed picture and, therefore, sometimes we are comparing apples and pears.  Of course, the sufficient number of highly professional and well paid judges is the goal in every country.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Ms Jourov&aacute; said not to reduce it to arithmetic.  However, I am concerned because some people are using that here as an excuse to say we are all good, when in reality we are not.  Senior judges are at the heart of this along with the Bar Council telling us we need more judges.  We have practitioners sitting on the front line describing the journeys they are walking with their clients and how, quite simply, they are not getting justice.</p></speech>

One is a justice scoreboard, which is more or less arithmetic, including how many days, which kind of file, how many judges and so on.  We were aware that this cannot be sufficient for assessing the quality and robustness of the judiciary system in a member state.  That is why we complemented it with this rule of law report, which is going more after the unquantifiable factors.  We try to capture or cover complex systems through the report.<br/><br/>However, it is big difference from when I started in the Commission.  The rule of law principle was in the Lisbon treaty but, honestly, there was not much care about that.  We were convinced that this is something like <i>perpetuum mobile</i>and it will function well forever.When Poland announced and introduced judiciary reform in a political campaign and then implemented it, it was a big wake-up call for the whole of Europe.  I am grateful to all the partners in the member states who will co-operate on the rule of report, because I feel this is a common work.  The final word is for the Commission, but we can together make the system much more robust in every state.</p></speech>

There is also much to be said about the separation of powers.</p> <p>  Ms Jourov&aacute;'s report included the appointment of judges, the composition of the judicial appointments commission and looked at other European standards related that.  She defended the idea that a majority of judges be represented on the commission.  There has been a contentious issue here about the inclusion of the Attorney General on the judicial appointments commission.  Does she have a view on that?  Looking at her report, perhaps she is suggesting that the Attorney General should not be involved.</p></speech>

I always say that judiciary systems cannot be one-size-fits-all.  However, more or less, we would like to see member states have something that would follow the Council of Europe standards, which state that judges should be appointed by a judiciary body that is majority judges, for the system for appointments, career decisions and dismissals.  That is the very simple standard or principle, which I am in unease to sell in many member states, not only in Ireland.  It is about the status of the Attorney General and whether they should be a full-fledged or observer.  The committee will have to discuss this further.  In several other member states, I hear, &ldquo;Well, we have a tradition and system that lives over decades and the system is enshrined in the constitution.&rdquo;  It is not easy, therefore, to sell this standard of the Council of Europe.  However, the Commission is of the opinion that it is useful to have such a structure as protection against politicisation of the processes of appointments and dismissals.  By &ldquo;politicisation&rdquo; we mean excessive power of executive or legislative branches.  That is the one-size-fits-all.</p></speech>

Perhaps we can all consider one, which will remain nameless before the clerk to the committee gives out to me again.

Yesterday, I was at its headquarters and this morning we saw the journalists and the experts working under the European Observatory structure, who are the fact-checkers.  We discussed the influence of Russian aggression in Ukraine on the overall feeling in Europe and our positioning towards truth and lie and Russian propaganda.  It was interesting to hear both the journalists but also the managers of Twitter talk about how the situation is newly bringing additional demands to fact-check and deliver the facts to the people.  In the country that hosts 52,000 refugees, which I thank Ireland for, it may be especially important that citizens get trustworthy information about the war and are not brainwashed by Russian propaganda.  Russians are masters in that.  They have been improving the method of how to brainwash people since Stalin.  It was interesting to hear how disinformation is being tackled here.</p></speech>

I hold the Taoiseach responsible for that.  I thank the witnesses, particularly Commissioner Jourov&aacute;, and I acknowledge her kind words about the tragedy in Creeslough.  Ireland is a small place and the Europe we are now in is also a small place and we are connected in many ways.</p> <p>  A consistent argument would have taken place on the issue of the rule of law and, fairly or unfairly, it would have been argued that the rule of law only applies when it is Poland or Hungary.  It is vital that it applies across the board.  If we look at the specific recommendation on Ireland it is not anything that a sensible person should have a particular difficulty with.  We all know about the issues we have had in recent times with judicial appointments and around litigation costs.  One must have access to justice.  If justice is not affordable and timely then one does not have access to justice; it is as simple as that.  There has already been mention of the issues with An Bord Plean&aacute;la but we have the ongoing reality or perception in this State of the revolving door between big lobby groups and politics and we need to be able to break that.  We need to be able to break it in reality and we even need to be seen to break it because it is one of those scenarios that does not help with the continuity of democracy as sometimes others can use that notion and make an attack.  Sometimes there is a case where there is a greater level of connection for those who are perceived as the elites.  On some level we need to remove that and we also need to remove the argument on it.  All of us have spoken many times about what needs to happen if we are talking about SIPO.  There is no difficulty there and we know what the issues are, including ensuring we have the proper media framework and protection for journalists in place.</p> <p>  I have no difficulty with the proposals and it is necessary that we follow through on it.  The Commissioner's remit is quite wide so I will throw a number of questions at her and as soon as she gets fed up answering them she can just stop.  I will accept that seeing as the committee was good enough to facilitate me in going away and not getting my answer.</p> <p>  I will start with the rule of law issues.  These are the rule of law issues that probably held up until we entered a new phase with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  It seemed to be the case that until the rule of law issues were dealt with accession was off the table.  Whatever people may have said publicly that was the name of the game.  We also have the conditionality regulations and now we have some leverage in ensuring we have compliance.  I also accept that countries have to make a determination on whether they want to be part of a European Union that has to be about fairness, democracy and all those societal improvements that have been made in time, or whether they want the alternative, which is plain to see on the international stage.</p> <p>  Where does Ms Jourov&aacute; perceive the conversations and relationships as being?  I imagine they are still particularly bad with Hungary.  Where are they with Poland?  There has probably been a considerable amount of exchange over and back at this stage.</p></speech>

Chapters 23 and 24 in the negotiations are more demanding and rigid when it comes to requirements.  It now also covers the media sphere and so on.  It is not easy for the countries which want to join the EU but they became kind of used to it.  The western Balkan countries were upset because there was an impression that we were giving Ukraine some fast-track regime for accession, which is not true.  At the same time we have to look at the reality in Ukraine.  The country is fighting against the aggressor and at the same time it is announcing to us its progress in working on different files, laws, institutional changes and so on.</p> <p>  The rule of law, as a principle, is heavily present in it, and we are aware that by pushing the accession countries to meet high requirements from the EU we have to put our house in order.  That is why we strengthened the tools in this respect.  The rule of law report is one of the new instruments and the other is the conditionality regulation.  The Deputy asked about Hungary and it permitted the introduction of rather vast and broad changes in its anti-corruption system and it partly introduced changes in its judiciary system.  Hungary has made 17 commitments and the Commission accepted that Hungary should carry these commitments out, introduce several things, establish the integrity body and make stricter the assets declarations system and so on.  These 17 points are very concrete.  Hungary accepted this proposal.  In spite of hearing a strong voice from Hungary to do all of that, which it can do because it has constitutional majority-----</p></speech>

In spite of that the Commission said that Hungary should do that and that it wants to see it done in practice, not only on paper or at the level of promises.  The Commission then put the case on the table of the member states.  Now Hungary has until 19 November to have everything under that roof for this new legislation.  As I said, we believe they will manage.  Then the Council has an additional one month, or until 18 December, to decide whether the ministers for finance will be satisfied and close the case or whether they will accept the proposal of the Commission to freeze 65% of the cohesion funding.  The process has strict deadlines, which is a good thing.  The Commission also felt strong pressure due to these deadlines and so we had to decide, which we did.  I am glad that the final decision does not stay with the Commission.  It should be down to the member states to decide on that because it is their taxpayers' money.  Who says now that this is weak and easy for Hungary to fulfil?</p><p>The regulation is what it is and the process became, rather than the protection of the rule of law, the protection of EU money.  That is why it goes to the table of the ministers of finance.  This is not a complaint.  I am glad we have this leverage but, as the rule of law person, I would have loved to see a stronger set of rules.</p></speech>

That is vital.  The western Balkans and others have a fair argument in saying nobody was considering them in recent years.

We are in an age of asymmetrical warfare, hybrid operations and cyber.  The Russian state has always had a particular relationship with certain actions.  We have all had to access our personal security and those pieces need to be dealt with.</p> <p>  It crosses over into the two other things Ms Jourov&aacute; spoke about earlier: how we secure the electoral process and how we deal with the age of online media.  We all know what was thrown out in relation to the election in America and Brexit.  When you are down to small figures, it does not take a huge amount to get somebody across the line.  We have also seen state and non-state actors being able to use online platforms, particularly Facebook.  It is almost there.  It is not that they have to weaponise it.  They can use it.  We have the Digital Services Act and Ms Jourov&aacute; spoke about the European Media Freedom Act.  We have in this State the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, but I do not know that it sufficiently gets into dealing with the issue of the algorithms which sometimes suit certain people of confrontational politics.  Beyond that, there is the spread of misinformation, which is everything from information that can be harmful to young people who have issues with eating disorders right through to negative politics that lead to a really bad place.  We need to defend that.  I ask Ms Jourov&aacute; about that, and if she can answer in two minutes, I will be impressed.</p></speech>

I will lose one minute in reacting.  We discussed in the Commission last week that, when we look at the Gauss curve, we are with our communication addressing 2% or 3% of people.  Those who are convinced already that the EU is a good thing are those reading our websites.  On the other side of the Gauss curve, there is an increasing number of those we will never convince and those we are losing.  It  used to be 15% or 20%.  Now in some member states, we are above 40%.

That is why I think, as the Deputy said, we have to think about how to get people back.  We cannot use populism, simple methods, propaganda or brainwashing.  We have to play with clean hands.  This will not be easy.</p> <p>  On algorithms, the Digital Services Act is for the first time addressing this issue.  We want to have the algorithms auditable by the enforcers so once we have a suspicion the algorithms go against people and simplifying and enable the company to make money on dirt, crime or some horrible content or method, then the enforcers should knock on the door and ask to be shown how the algorithm works.

We will have a similarly difficult task here because we will need well-qualified people in each member state who are able to go into the system and understand what is going on there.  I cannot imagine how to do that, but that is why we introduced the legally binding rules that oblige the digital systems to disclose the algorithms and let the enforcers understand whether they go against the rules or are Digital Services Act-compliant.
