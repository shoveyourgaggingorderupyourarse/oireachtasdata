Deputy McGrath's amendments, which cannot be moved, deal with some of those concerns as well.  There is a concern from those in the sector that leases cars that this will have a detrimental impact on them.  I am aware that this was a temporary measure that has lasted a quarter of a century, as only Ireland does.  I want to know the Minister's opinion and his views on the concern that has been expressed by a section of the industry about not being able to claim back the VAT on the vehicle registration tax, VRT, as will be the case now with this section.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#D00100"><p>In fairness, I should acknowledge that this is a matter that Deputy McGrath has raised with me and I note that he has just joined us now.  I am sure he will be raising this on Report Stage as well as he has related amendments.  I will say a word about the section and my approach to it.</p> <p>  On the section itself, a partial repayment of VRT has been available since 1993 on certain vehicles acquired by vehicle leasing or hiring businesses or for providing driving lessons.  This repayment reflects the VRT charged on the VAT element of the vehicle and currently represents 18.7% of the full VRT charge.</p> <p> This repayment is a legacy from 1993, when vehicle excise duty was being replaced by the VRT to ease the transition for car leasing and hire companies by ensuring their costs did not increase under the new VRT regime.  This repayment can no longer be justified as a tax expenditure which is not available to other sectors and in the context of typical VRT charges having reduced very substantially since the introduction of the CO2-based VRT charging in 2008.</p> <p>  I have decided that the repayment will not be available for vehicles registered on or after 1 January 2019.  However, until 1 April 2019, it will be possible to make claims for vehicles registered up to and including 31 December 2018.</p> <p>  I will make two broad points about this.  First, When I became Minister for Finance, the main piece of work I asked my Department to do was to come back to me with tax and policy changes that were made across the period of our greatest economic difficulty that were no doubt justified then - we will begin debating another one of these measures later on this morning or tonight - in order for me to reassess them now in the light of where we are now.  If we do not do this now we are going to end up with a tax code that is full of exemptions and changes that were made at a time that they were needed, and we will not be able to do something similar when we face another need in the future.</p> <p>  What I also asked them to do was to come back to me with different matters within our tax code, changes made even before the crash period that are still there.</p> <p>  This is a transitionary agreement for a transitionary policy that has now been in place since 1993.  If we do not become more focused on ensuring that changes that we made when they are needed are re-examined at a time when the need is less, then two things are going to happen.  The first is that our tax base will become narrower and we will only appreciate how narrow it becomes at a time of need again.  The second thing is that interests and groups come looking for changes that at times are justified.  We have to be willing then to hold the line and make the case that if that change was made at a time when it was needed, if the need is no longer there and the time has passed we should be able to undo it.  If we are not willing to do this change by change, then the role of my Department, and the State overall, becomes progressively challenged.  I do not want to see that happening.  I am going to go through all of these changes, both big and small.  This is one of the smaller ones but I believe its time has passed.  We will examine whether it is needed and make a case accordingly.  As to whether it will have an effect, the honest answer is it probably will have an effect on some companies that are involved in this sector.</p><p>For example, it may have an effect on the availability of cars and what fleet companies have available.  They should be able to manage this change as the relief has been available for a long time.  We should be clear that, if we are to make changes such as this, we will undo them when the time is right.  The time is now right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#E00200"><p>I agree with the vast majority of what the Minister said.  A tax relief introduced at a certain point in time should always be automatically reviewed within a short period, by which I do not mean 25 years.  I welcome the Minister's approach of reviewing these reliefs and questioning whether they are still warranted.  It is the appropriate approach to take.  My concern is that this change was not flagged to the industry.  Last night we discussed betting duty at length.  It was clearly flagged that there would be some change, given the tax strategy papers, as well as the Minister's comments that the industry needed to pay more.  However, this change has come on the sector suddenly.  The relief was meant to be temporary, but having been part of the tax code for 25 years, there was probably an expectation that it would not be changed.  I am not arguing that it should not be changed; rather, I am questioning whether sections of the industry have involved themselves in the practice of leasing fleets in the belief there would be tax relief.  They would have taken the decision on that basis.  Of course, we can change, introduce and abolish rates and reliefs at any time - I do not wish to take away from that - but there was a genuine expectation surrounding this relief and a genuine practice was employed as a result.  The change is sudden and the Minister has acknowledged that there will be an impact.  I am concerned that it will be felt more by smaller operators in rural areas.  Should it be implemented now or should there be a delay of one year to give the industry the clear signal that, although it will be part of the finance code, it will take effect from 1 January 2020, as opposed to 1 January 2019?  Perhaps there could be a commencement order or something of that nature.  Significant concerns have been raised.  While these reliefs need to be reviewed, re-evaluated and, where necessary, ended, it is also important that we not do anything that will cause a sudden shock that will not allow the sector to rearrange its operations in order that it can continue to provide services for the tourism industry, to which this sector primarily relates, and employment in many of the more rural parts of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#E00300"><p>It is important to outline the position of the sector because, to the best of my knowledge, there was no consultation between it and the Department.  I am concerned about the impact on the tourism industry which has already seen an increase in the lower VAT rate.  This change will mean a difference of &euro;600 to &euro;700 per vehicle, a cost that will be passed on to the person who is renting a car.  The view in the sector is that this will impact on the supply of cars to the car rental fleet and car rental rates for tourists and may impact on the regional spread of tourism.  The refund scheme never represented a cost to the Exchequer; rather, it was a VAT equalisation policy in the pre and post-VRT eras to maintain parity, with the full cost of the vehicle being VAT deductible, rather than being seen as a tax expenditure.  It recognised the unique profile of short-term rental fleet movements and the industry's requirement to increase the size of the rental fleet rapidly for the peak tourism season and deplete it rapidly thereafter.</p> <p>  Is there an expected yield from this measure?  It was not flagged on budget day or in any of the budget day documentation.  Is it something the Minister is willing to re-examine?  He views the relief as a temporary measure, just one that still happens to be in place 25 years on.  I do not have an issue with the change, but it needs to be carefully thought through.  Its implications, if any, need to be considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#F00100"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  It is fair to acknowledge that this change was not subject to consultation.  However, we have so many examples of reliefs like this across the tax code that we have to recognise the right of the Government of the day to make changes.  If we are to be guided by consultation in every difficult change we make, the bias will always be towards not making the change.  I feel strongly that we have to be willing to consider how incrementally the tax base has become compressed owing to there being reasons for us to be unwilling to undo changes.  I have acknowledged that this change will have an effect.  As I said on another matter last night, there are few opportunities available to me to make or undo policy changes that do not cause difficulty somewhere.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Michael McGrath's point about cost, I can only provide a speculative yield at this point because the relief has been in place for a long time.  The figure is based on our judgment of the yield.  It is a big figure.  We estimate that the cost could be approximately &euro;20 million, although we have not included it in our budgetary arithmetic.  Were I to put that figure in front of the Oireachtas and given that it is 20 odd years since the relief was put in place, I would fairly be asked how we could be sure such a yield would accrue.  It is a significant figure.</p> <p>  We had a similar debate last night on the betting charge.  It was pointed out to me that, at the time of our greatest economic difficulty in 2008 and 2009, a change was proposed to the betting levy that subsequently was not implemented.  Were I to take that approach to the current proposal on the betting levy, it means that I would need to find &euro;50 million somewhere else.  That argument does not apply in this instance, as I did not include the &euro;20 million in my budgetary yield figures, but it is a figure the taxpayer has to find and one that has been embedded in the tax code for a quarter of a century.</p> <p>  Will the change have an effect on fleets and the choices companies need to make in terms of the availability and of vehicles and their types?  It probably will.  Such companies should, however, be able to respond to the change.  If Deputies wish between now and Report Stage to flag further difficulties or points of which I might not be aware, I will be happy to engage with the committee on them, but we should be willing to make this change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#F00200"><p>Has there been an economic assessment of the change?  Clearly, many of the representations made raise concerns about its potentially negative impact on the tourism sector and certain commercial sectors which have an involvement in car leasing.  There has been a large amount of advertising of the notion of fly drive holidays in Ireland, particularly in the west in the context of the development of the Wild Atlantic Way and where the tourism industry is significant.  Prior to this arrangement being introduced by, I believe, former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, there were periods when it was almost impossible to hire cars because of how the arrangements in place at the time worked.</p><p>Prices also soared.  This arrangement has stood the test of time, including periods when the tourism business advanced.  To everyone's delight, tourism along the west coast, which inevitably includes a long car drive, is thriving.  Has the Minister done an economic assessment of the likely impact of the measure?  Has he had discussions with the sector about the flow of cars?  As the Minister knows, we are a little in the dark about how Brexit will roll out.  We are, therefore, in a transitory period for the economy.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to do have an economic assessment done and, if so, will he share the outcome with members?  This is an issue where "do no harm" should be a watchword in the context of all the other uncertainties that we face.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#G00200"><p>A figure of &euro;20 million is a lot of money, although I know it is an estimate of the potential yield from this change.  The point I ask the Minister to consider over the next two weeks, before Report Stage, is that it is ultimately a further charge on the tourism sector.  The Minister has already decided to increase the lower VAT rate, which will generate between &euro;400 million and &euro;500 million in additional revenue from the broader hospitality and tourism sector.  This extra money will principally come from tourists.  The Minister says he believes companies will have the capacity to respond.  They will do so by increasing car rental rates and that should be acknowledged.  I understand that this measure was brought in when a new vehicle registration tax, VRT, regime was introduced 25 years ago to compensate leasing companies, rental car providers and driving school businesses for the change in how the excise duty was calculated on motor vehicles.  We are talking about the VAT applied to vehicle registration tax.  We will revisit the issue on Report Stage.  It is a further burden on the tourism sector at a time when a significant change has been made to the taxation code in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#G00300"><p>Deputy Burton asked if we had done an economic appraisal of this beyond knowing what would be the potential revenue gain.  We have not done such an appraisal because I decided we would be better off doing economic appraisals of the much larger decisions we had to make, for example, on the VAT rate applied to the tourism sector.  I do not ask my Department to do detailed economic appraisals of every decision we make because of the use of resources involved and, in this case, the scale of the decision involved.</p> <p>  As to whether we engaged with the sector about this decision before it was made, we did not do so.  As I informed the committee, this measure is part of a process I have undertaken where I asked my Department to examine reliefs that have been in place for a long time and tax changes made during the crash.  I asked it to provide me with a list of these reliefs and changes and an assessment of the pros and cons of changing them.  We looked at this measure as part of that process.</p> <p>  On the tourism impact, which is the point raised by Deputy McGrath, I would hazard a guess that the cost was not shared with him when people came to him seeking a change in this policy decision.  Approximately half of the cost of between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million relates to fleet cars and how fleets are leased, as opposed to tourism.</p><p>Half of it has to do with reliefs that we have in place for the leasing of fleets of cars to companies.  We have to ask if between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million of the State's money is best used for doing something like that.  This was not a policy decision to stimulate the growth of the car rental and leasing sector.  It was a decision made in the early 1990s when we were going from excise to VRT.  Yes, there has been huge growth in the car rental sector since then, but I contend that the reason there has been huge growth and a huge decrease in the price of car rental across that period has been the massive growth in tourism and the rising incomes of people who have been visiting our country, as opposed to this change.</p><p> The view I am advocating to the committee and which I will advocate again on Report Stage is that while this may well have an effect on leasing arrangements that companies make and on the kinds of cars that are being offered to rent by car rental companies, and while it could have an effect on price, this is also a very competitive sector, so should it not be the case that we allow the private sector to work its way through those issues as opposed to maintaining a concession in our system that could have a price of up to &euro;20 million to it?  Over the next fortnight, before we go to Report Stage, I am happy to engage with members on the matter.  The cost of this could be as high as &euro;20 million.  That figure has perhaps not been present in some of the lobbying or advocacy relating to this change over recent weeks.  I note, in fairness to the committee, that nobody to date has advocated that this is a change that we should not make.  I think what colleagues are emphasising is that we should perhaps look at the timing of it or do an analysis of it.  My view is that this is a change that we should make, and we should make it in the way I have prescribed.  As I have said, if colleagues want to make me aware of any more significant issues beyond those of which I am aware, I am happy to engage with people on those.</p></speech>

I am conscious from my experience of the tourism industry that it is very price sensitive.  We have a number of sensitivities that are particularly acute at the moment.  One is the likely impact of Brexit, the immediate significance of which, as the Minister knows, relates to currency fluctuations.  We are talking about the Wild Atlantic Way, which has been significantly successful in ensuring that, while there is a vast amount of tourism in Dublin, a very significant amount of tourism goes outside of Dublin, and it is to be hoped it is high-value tourism.  Many of our tourism plans are posited around that.  It is especially significant for counties from Donegal down to Kerry and beyond.  There have not been large numbers of jobs coming to these areas.  Along with the change in the VAT rate, which may well be and will have to be absorbed by much of the industry, we are talking potentially about two big changes.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister that fleets are also an issue in this, but the primary and immediate knock-on effect is on the fly drive tourism business, into which Cork, Shannon and Knock airports and smaller airports such as in Kerry and Donegal are all tied.  I would like to see some level of assessment of how this would be phased in in a way that would not be negatively disruptive.</p><p>For instance, there is a big development in Longford, Center Parcs, which will not come on stream for some time.  However, given the way it is going about its marketing, it is obviously intended for people who will drive a car and, if it gets the custom it anticipates, it may include people who have hired cars.  In that case, people are not supposed to use a car after getting there but, of course, they have to get there in the first place.  I suggest the Minister has an analysis done and that he shares that analysis with us.  </p></speech>

With regard to what that means from a tourism point of view, let us say all of that &euro;600 or &euro;700 was to be passed on to the tourist.  Most car rental agreements for tourists tend to be over a number of days and they could be for a week or a bit longer.  If the company makes the choice to pass all of this on to a tourist, it means an additional cost of &euro;1.50 to &euro;2 per day.  The question I would put to the committee is whether it is good use of the State's resources to be unknowingly investing &euro;20 million per year in maintaining a discount like this.  My view is that the answer to that question is "No".  We should be willing, area by area, to find examples of things like this that we are willing to change.  Three, four or five changes like this in every budget is &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million extra of base broadening in a way that is sustainable for our country, and I think that is what we should be doing.</p> <p>  Am I willing to undertake a further economic appraisal of it beyond what we have done?  No, I am not.  As I said, given what an economic appraisal looks like and the amount of work involved in doing this, it is good use of my Department's resources to only do this in regard to decisions above a certain level.  I could say, for every single decision I make, that I will not make that decision because it is going to create the potential for cost somewhere.  That is the reason none of these things has changed for 20 years and it is the reason that, in bigger areas, one of which we will come onto later in the day, we have been willing to leave really big issues in place in our tax code for too long.  I believe we should adopt a different approach and this is one example of it.  As I said, if there are any further issues I have missed in this regard which committee members want to make me aware of, I am happy to engage on that.  However, I want to be clear that I believe this is a change that is needed and that we should be willing to make the case for changes like this to be made.</p></speech>

This applies to a small number of microbreweries which are at the point of sustainability and where the extra allowance would add to their sustainability and viability.  We are talking about a very small number of microbreweries which are in an intermediate phase, so the cost to the Exchequer would not be in any way significant and, at a certain stage of development, it would allow these breweries to get an additional advantage.  There are a number of examples of companies that are currently at an intermediate stage and employ up to 100 people each, but they are at their limit.  In addition, there are four or five breweries employing 100 employees or more and, allowing for current trends, they will be at their limit within 12 months.</p><p>I believe the industry favours the incremental increase which has been set out in this amendment so that progress is sustainable and targeted to the domestic brewing industry.  This is an industry that has a vital connection to tourism all around Ireland.  The interesting thing about the microbreweries is that they have brought employment and economic development prospects to areas which have not had much foreign direct investment.  The same could be said, of course, about the distilleries, in particular the specialised brands of whiskey and gin being developed.  They have become very fashionable and have taken off with many younger drinkers, and they are a feature of an Irish holiday for many tourists. </p><p>I can understand that the Minister and his officials might be rather cautious about this but I am sure they have done the maths.  The cost of this change is extremely modest but it would allow developing businesses in the sector which are at a critical development stage to continue to expand and, in that way, to become embedded and to have much stronger prospects for continued viability, growth and success.</p></speech>

The amendment proposes to increase the production ceiling from 40,000 hectolitres to 60,000 hectolitres.  The current production ceiling is 40,000 hectolitres and the claim ceiling is 30,000 hectolitres.  By way of illustration, 40,000 hectolitres is equivalent to 7 million pints or 12 million 330 ml bottles, so it is a very significant amount of production.  In fact, where two or more microbreweries operate in conjunction, the scheme allows that they may produce up to 80,000 hectolitres, claiming excise relief on up to 60,000 hectolitres.  This enables small breweries to work together and produce larger amounts while still qualifying for the relief.</p> <p>  I am informed that increasing the production ceiling as proposed would benefit a very small number of local microbreweries in the near term.  It may benefit microbreweries located elsewhere in the EU which are equally entitled to claim the microbreweries relief for produce sold in Ireland, which is a very important point.  The proportion of relief claimed by microbrewers and claimants outside the State increased from 1.4% in 2016 to 8.5% in 2017.  An increase in the production ceiling to 60,000 hectolitres would likely further encourage non-Irish microbreweries to avail of the relief and potentially compete in the Irish market.</p><p>My Department has not been approached about this proposed change.  I understand the companies supporting it are at the largest end of production.  If we were to bring in this change, it would mean that microbreweries located elsewhere in the EU would benefit provided their products are sold in Ireland.  There is already a very significant relief in place, amounting to 27 cent per pint.</p><p> While I am willing to consider the proposal, I will not give a definite commitment to change it at this point.  That it has not been the subject of broad representations to me gives me food for thought.  Moreover, the benefit would be confined to the larger craft microbreweries and the measure would have a neutral effect elsewhere.  The benefit would also accrue to larger breweries located outside Ireland.  These factors make me wonder whether it is a change worth making.  I am not rejecting it out of hand now because I have great respect for what has happened in craft brewing in Ireland.  While I no longer classify myself as a young tourist, or even a particularly young citizen, the development of this industry is a credit to everyone involved in it.  Whether one is a tourist or a citizen, the industry has brought great enjoyment to those who have sampled the products brewed here.  It is an important area of innovation in Irish food and drink.  That is the spirit in which I view the development of the industry.</p><p> The facts that my Department was not approached on this matter in the run-up to the budget and that the measure is focused on large companies gives me pause.  I will consider this matter before Report Stage but I want to carefully examine who would benefit from it.</p></speech>

Pearse Lyons, who sadly died this year, was doing great work in the microbrewing and microdistilling sector ten or 15 years ago when he came back to Ireland.  He got people to think about brewing and distilling.  Many developments have taken place since then.  It is particularly noticeable that areas which have not enjoyed the kind of foreign direct investment from which the large cities have benefitted are now experiencing a significant organic economic development.  Such development can deliver a substantial dividend in terms of jobs in areas that otherwise have been left behind.  I would be delighted to see more developments at local level similar to the Longford example I gave earlier.  It is interesting to note how the Scotch whisky industry developed on the Scottish islands 100 years ago, particularly in the context of the First World War.  That development left Ireland behind.  I am anxious to ensure we are proactive in assisting these kinds of developments.</p><p>They can add significantly to the economy.  Microbreweries and microdistilleries are fashionable at the moment.  I do not know if all of them will survive, but I certainly think that when they get to critical mass stage, for instance, when they have significant numbers of employees, particularly in isolated rural areas or smaller towns, they will potentially have an enormous role to play in generating the rural economy, allied with the generation of the food economy which has also been progressing.  Places such as west Cork come to mind immediately.  </p><p> I thank the Minister for his comments.  This conversation will continue.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister has indicated that he is open to further discussions with the committee and the industries.  It is important that we maximise their employment potential.  There have been very strong links between them and institutes of technology.  Modern scientific knowledge and qualifications have helped students studying in this area.  Employment opportunities have been created for people who 12 years ago would have moved abroad to gain experience.  Now there are opportunities at home.  The entrepreneurial interests of many younger people have also been stimulated in a very positive way.  I will withdraw the amendment and encourage people to take up the Minister's invitation to have a conversation about how the industries will grow.  We are talking about a tax advantage which, correctly, should be examined and reviewed, as opposed to a grants-based approach whereby very significant grants are given.  The summer festival season in Ireland now runs from Easter.  This time period is really important to rural Ireland in areas outside the big cities.  The opportunity for these businesses to have a presence at these events is enormous and adds to the potential for employment creation and economic development.  Farmers' produce is used in these industries.  It is an important and solid market for them if the industries can reach a certain scale, creating a demand that can be relied upon by those growing crops for them</p></speech>

There is an error in my amendment, of which the Minister's officials have been advised.  It should read &quot;decreasing the floor&quot;, rather than &quot;increasing the floor&quot;.  It is a substantial error, but I know that the Minister is aware of the objective.  There was an expectation that there would be moves to bring diesel and petrol into line in the budget, but that did not happen.</p><p> There is also concern about the operation of the diesel rebate scheme, particularly in the context of Brexit and the resultant longer journeys.  There is still a lot of uncertainty.  Hopefully we will get a deal that will mitigate many of these concerns.  The industry has been arguing before Oireachtas committees in favour of amending this scheme.  Its spokespersons argue that the floor, which is currently set at &euro;1 before value added tax, VAT, should be reduced to 85 cent.  They also argue that the rebate rate should be increased from 7.5% to 15%.  I do not agree that the rate should be at that level, but there is merit in reducing the floor from &euro;1 to 85 cent.  Through the Department of Finance we costed this at &euro;5 million, which is a significant cost but not a huge one in the context of the budget.  The question is whether the industry needs support.  Moreover, is this an industry facing serious challenges, particularly in light of Brexit?  When we look at international comparisons, is the rebate scheme supportive of an industry comparable with other areas?  Is fuel tourism still taking place?  The answer to some of those questions is "Yes".  There are serious challenges and concerns.</p><p> The environment is another issue we have to weigh up.  We know we need to move people to more energy-efficient fuels.  Is that possible at this point for the haulage sector?  The information provided to me suggests that this is not the case.  Other types of fuel would increase the weight load and payload and therefore require hauliers to carry lighter loads in their trucks.  That would require them to make more journeys.  Instead of taking one trip from Donegal to Dublin, they would have to do two because they would not be able to carry as much bulk as a result of having to move to other fuels.  We have not come up with a real alternative at this point.  There have been very positive moves on Euro 6 engines, which are much cleaner than older engines.  </p><p> There is a genuine reason to consider this issue.  The Minister should be open to changing the floor because for some years now there has been no real benefit to the industry because of the price of diesel.  The benefit is now 1.8 cent or 1.9 cent per litre.  Due to the price of diesel previously, there was a negligible benefit and in some years there was no benefit whatever.  The best way of doing this would not be to increase the rate but to change the floor, which would allow more people to avail of the scheme at the same rates.  It would come at a cost to the Exchequer.  I put this forward as a Brexit mitigation proposal regardless of whether there is a hard or soft border.  In the best-case scenario there will be an impact on the haulage industry.  That is without question.  This is one way we can support it.  It is not a huge amount of money, but I am not minimising the amount involved either.  It would be a positive signal on this issue.</p><p> I would prefer if this were in the budget.  We argued for this in our alternative budget.  I am looking for an indication from the Minister that he will consider this issue in the context of Brexit and the challenges this industry will face.  </p></speech>

The scheme offers a partial excise refund for qualifying hauliers and bus operators based on the retail price of diesel.  The repayment amount is calculated based on the average price at which auto diesel is available for purchase during the repayment period.</p><p>Relief can be claimed when the retail price reaches &euro;1.23, including value added tax, VAT, up to a maximum rate of 7.5 cent when the price reaches &euro;1.54.  Despite recent increases in international fuel prices, with a cap of &euro;1.54, the scheme continues to compensate hauliers for such increases.  The current scheme offers sufficient protection against rising costs and the effect on competitiveness and, as such, I do not intend to conduct a review of it, with a view to amending the floor price.  I met representatives of the sector and it appears that there was an expectation that the scheme would change.  That expectation did not come from me or my Department.  I cannot be in a position where expectations are created and imposed on me and, when I do not make particular changes, I am expected to fix the issue.  I never gave an indication that the scheme was going to be changed.  In the engagement my Department has had with the sector we have always been very clear that the scheme is in place.  The drawdown is still considerably lower than we expected.</p><p> The Deputy asked whether there was still diesel tourism.  I expect there is.  However, the plan we have in place is a proportionate response to the challenges the sector is experiencing.  When I met representatives of the sector, I agreed to review the scheme in the context of the Finance Bill and the budget next year.  I am happy to have a look at where we stand and engage with the sector.  That is the appropriate way to look at the scheme.  As I said, the drawdown is lower than we expected.  The pricing and capping of the scheme are still within the realm of what I believe works for the industry.  There are many aspects at which we will have to look if things really begin to change next year and we experience many acute difficulties as a result of Brexit.  In meetings with sector representatives I have said we will review the scheme in the context of the budget next year, like any other scheme we have in place.  In the process of reviewing it, I will meet and engage with representatives of the sector who are aware of my views on the issue.  That is the best way to deal with the matter.</p></speech>

As I said, there are lot of things we may have to do, depending on the outcome of any Brexit deal.  As I have argued, unless there is a complete reversal of the decision taken by the British people two years ago, there is no possible deal that will not have an impact on the haulage sector.  In my wildest dreams I cannot envisage an outcome that will not have some impact.  The question is how significant it will be.</p> <p>  I do not want to rehearse the matter, but there is an issue about the drawdown.  First, for several years the scheme was of no benefit to hauliers.  For about two years after it was introduced there was a benefit.  Because the floor had been set at &euro;1 without VAT or &euro;1.23 with VAT, there was no cost to the Exchequer for two years as the price of diesel was below that figure.  The scheme has only started to be of benefit in recent times.  The benefit is currently in the region of 1.8 cent per litre, but I am subject to correction.  Even with that figure, hauliers who travel internationally fill up abroad.  I talk to hauliers and know people involved in the industry, including family members, and they tell me that that is what is happening.  The rebate schemes available in other jurisdictions are much more generous than for what we are arguing.</p><p>I am not arguing for that.  The industry wants two things.  It wants the floor decreased to 85 cent and the rate increased to 15 cent, which would cost &euro;22 million.  I am suggesting we do just one of those - reducing the floor - and it would amount to less than a quarter of the amount requested by the industry.  It is the best way to capture more people.  It gives a small bit of benefit which I hope would offset some of that fuel tourism in the first place.</p><p> There is the matter, which I will mention again, of equalisation between diesel and petrol.  I agree with the Minister about expectations and I have never heard an expectation created about this.  The only expectation I understood relating to this would be that it would exist to offset an equalisation measure.  What is the Minister's opinion on equalisation of diesel and petrol?  It is a matter of concern and it would require mitigating factors for the industry.</p></speech>

It is very evident from people we interact with and know.  The diesel rebate scheme for the haulage sector is approximately five years old at this stage.  Will the Minister confirm, if he has not already done so, whether he intends to do a review on the matters raised by Deputy Doherty?</p></speech>

I only make that commitment in the context of the normal reviews that we would do of key schemes in advance of the budget.  A change through this scheme was put in place in recognition of the challenges faced by the sector.  I am being careful currently as many different needs are being advanced to me under the heading of "Brexit" or precautionary measures to be taken in advance of Brexit.  I am being careful about what we do as all of this has consequences elsewhere.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty as no scenario is likely beyond the British people making the decision to reverse Brexit that gets us to a place in which trade and contact with the UK would be identical to what it is today.  That is because of the simple reason that the UK will become a third country.  It is the choice it has made.  We will work very hard to mitigate the effects of this and we hope we can get through the current phase - which we will - so we can play our part in seeing that agreement is reached between the European Union and the UK, respecting the importance of trade between both.  There will be change and this will have consequences for different parts of our economic sectors.  We will have a look at this scheme in advance of next year's Finance Bill and we will engage with the sector as part of that.</p> <p>  In responding to Deputy Pearse Doherty, it is fair to say that I am informed the price of diesel went as high as &euro;1.50 in the early years of the scheme, although in subsequent years it has dipped.  That has affected the drawing down.  As we can see, changes in the price of diesel now should affect use of incentives available to the sector and I expect to see more drawing down through the scheme than we have seen recently.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about equalisation and I decided not to do it in this year's budget for many reasons.  For one, I am conscious of the tremendous importance of diesel in how we fund access in and out of our country.  With the nature of Brexit becoming clear in a few months, I decided to take this decision at a future point, when I will be clearer on where we stand on big matters of transit.</p><p>To be honest, if I was sitting before the committee having made a decision on equalisation or carbon taxation, it would have been fair to ask me why I was making those changes.  As I did not make changes in carbon taxation or diesel equalisation, it is a fair enough position to advocate leaving the scheme unchanged.</p></speech>

While there will be an uptick in drawdown because of the price of diesel, it will not be at the level it should be at because the practice is that when a haulier goes abroad, he or she fills up before coming back.

First, it provides that from 1 January 2019, as announced in the budget, the second reduced VAT rate of 9% will increase to 13.5% on goods and services predominantly in the tourism sector, with the exception of newspapers, periodicals and the provision of facilities for taking part in sporting activities, which will remain liable at the 9% rate.  The 13.5% VAT rate will apply to supplies of catering and restaurant services, tourist accommodation, hotel and other holiday accommodation.  It will also apply to admissions to cinemas, theatres, museums, certain musical performances, historic houses and open farms, fairground and amusement park services and hairdressing services.  The supply of live horses not normally intended for use in the preparation of foodstuffs or in agricultural production, greyhounds, the hire of horses and the supply of certain printed matter will also be liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate.</p> <p>  Second, it amends Schedule 3 to insert a new definition of electronically supplied publications, which are e-newspapers, e-periodicals and e-books.  It provides that the 9% VAT rate will apply to such electronically supplied publications from 1 January 2019.  These publications are currently liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.</p></speech>

I have argued that the VAT rate should be restored for the hotel sector, and there is clear evidence for that.  Nonetheless, there are differences throughout the regions and we do not have in some areas the same kind of occupancy and rates being charged in some of the urban areas.  We need to formulate innovative ways to support the sector in this respect.  Even the Department's report indicated that this was not being passed on.  We have some of the highest occupancy rates in Europe and the revenue per available room metric for Irish hotels indicates they are among the busiest and most lucrative in Europe, notwithstanding my comments on regional disparities.</p> <p>  The concern I have and my objection to the section relates to the increase in the VAT rate for the other parts of the tourism sector.  It is not warranted at this point.</p><p>At the very least, it should have been increased incrementally as opposed to going from 9% up to 13.5% in one fell swoop.  It would have been more appropriate to have increased it in a number of steps over a couple of years to help the sector.  We are talking here about hairdressers and others in the tourism sector.  While the tourism sector is doing well, it is not doing well everywhere.  There is an uplift in many parts of the country but there are also major parts of this State that have not seen the economic recovery that is taking place in other parts, particularly in our capital city.  That is why I oppose this section.  In opposing the section I want to make it clear that, as Sinn F&eacute;in has argued, it was remiss of the Minister not to get rid of the relief for the hotel sector at an earlier stage.  That being said, I acknowledge that he has moved on that now and I welcome that.  However, it should have been done by way of separating hotel beds from the rest of the sector and then restoring the rate in an incremental way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#R00200"><p>My argument could be summed up by, if not now, when?  Yes, we do have parts of our country that are not doing as well as others, which I fully acknowledge, but we have an economy overall that is seeing very strong income and employment growth.  The reality, as I look beyond this point, is that if we had made the choice to split the two and not to increase the rate for restaurants, then despite what the Deputy has said, it would never happen.  If we had separated the two of them and made a move on hotels but not on other sectors, we would be breaking a link that has always been there.  The Deputy may feel differently about it, and he clearly does, but I go back to a thread I have had in many of the different changes that we have argued.  If a change is made that benefits many different sectors and we say that change is going to be temporary, if the change goes in one way, affecting all, then the logic I am now establishing is that it has to go in the other way, affecting all as well.  If we end up in a place where we are happy to make changes that benefit all, but when we undo them, we are willing to allow the costs to be distributed in a different way, then the changes will never happen.</p> <p>  Yes, I acknowledge that, for those who are working in food or restaurants and some in tourism, this could have a different effect outside of the larger cities.  I am aware of that.  It was, however, because all of these arguments were put with regard to this relief that it did not change in the past.  It is because all of these arguments are continually put with regard to different parts of our tax code that we have not been willing to make changes to reliefs at a time when changes should have been made.  It is for that reason that the appropriate way to do this is to undo this change in the way that it was made in the first place.  As I have said, if we do not do this now, in a few years&rsquo; time, we will still have different VAT rates in place in different sectors and with the same issue existing.</p></speech>

The reduction from 13.5% down to 9% had that impact, it has worked, it was successful, and it was a good initiative.  Fair play for introducing it at the time, notwithstanding how it was funded.  When it is reversed, however, it has the other impact on the way back up.</p></speech>

The Minister should take it when it is given to him.  The issue is, when it is reversed, the impact is the same.  The question is whether the industry is robust enough to withstand that impact.  Of course the hotel sector, where many of the beds are located, is robust enough because of all the metrics about which we have talked.  The issue with the other sector is that there are parts of it that are not able to withstand it or on which it will have a detrimental impact.</p> <p>  The Minister summed up his question as: if not now, when?  Let me sum up the answer for him.  In this Finance Bill he could raise the rate on the other sectors to 11%, taking effect from 1 January 2019, and increase it in this Finance Bill to 13.5% in the subsequent year.  It is not the case that if he does not do it now, he will never do it.  He can take these steps now, as we have done in respect of other legislation with which I do not agree.  For example, mortgage interest relief is being stepped down every year for a number of years.  When we dealt with mortgage interest relief for landlords, it was being increased by 5% every year.  That was put into our legislation.  We did this in a number of other areas as well.</p> <p>  It could be done like that if the Minister so desired, given he has clearly acknowledged that the sudden impact of a 4.5% increase in VAT may not be as easily absorbed in the sectors in question as in others.  The Minister should legislate for the increase in a stepped way, which allows the sectors a bit of breathing space in that, while they would take a hit because the rate would increase next year, it would allow them time to factor in that it will increase to the full 13.5%.</p></speech>

The first is that those in the hotel sector would ask why they were not getting the same treatment as those in the restaurant sector.  The second thing is that we would be back here in a year's time with the case being made to me that the next phase of the increase in the restaurant sector should not happen.  We would be having that debate then.</p> <p>  This was well expected.  It has been debated publicly over the past two years since I have been in this role.  In the tax strategy group papers we published earlier on in the year, we gave a very clear indication that this was a very live option for budget day.</p></speech>

I know Ministers for Finance are very reluctant to talk about VAT on children's footwear and clothes but, in essence, what I am seeking is an update, if there is one, as to whether or not the Revenue Commissioners have had any engagement with trade associations in this regard.  In summary, the position is that we cannot change the relevant age of the child at which zero-rating ceases to apply, which is currently 11.  The question, however, is what the relative sizes are.  According to the Revenue and the Department, &quot;The practical application of the measure is that zero rating applies to children's clothing of sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest, a 26 in. waist or 152 cm in height; and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5 or 38.&quot;</p><p>We had a good discussion on this last year, primarily with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I asked that Revenue would engage with the trade associations again and undertake some consultation on whether the sizes that are deemed by Revenue to be appropriate for children under the age of 11 are still applicable or should be reviewed.  That was the thrust of the conversation last year and hopefully there will be an update.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#V00200"><p>As the Deputy stated, this issue was discussed in the debate on last year's Finance Bill and relates to the application of the VAT zero rating that applies to children's clothing and footwear.  Under Article 110 of the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services that were in place on and from 1 January 1991 but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services after that date.  As the Deputy is aware, the zero rate of VAT applies to clothing and shoes for children and this is possible under EU VAT law because the zero rate applied to these goods on and from 1 January 1991.  It is not possible under EU VAT law to extend the application of the zero rate by raising the age limit of children to whom the zero rate could apply in respect of articles of clothing and footwear.</p> <p>  Since the mid-1980s, Irish VAT law has defined children&rsquo;s clothing and footwear as that not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build and foot size of ten years of age.  This includes clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age.  The practical application of the measure to date is that zero rating applies to children&rsquo;s clothing of sizes up to and including 32 in. chest, 26 in. waist or 152 cm height and children&rsquo;s footwear up to and including size 5&frac12; or 38.  These sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels and, at that time, were considered to be generous.  A further review of the average size of footwear for children was carried out in 1997 but there was insufficient evidence at that time that would warrant a change in the 5&frac12; limit.</p> <p>  Following last year&rsquo;s debate, the Revenue Commissioners recently completed a review of the average shoe and clothing sizes for ten year olds.  This review produced no evidence to support a change in the existing guidelines.  Revenue approached a number of experts including in the ESRI as well as academics in the field of nutrition and children&rsquo;s health.  These experts told Revenue there was no data that would enable them to complete the study that Revenue was seeking.  Revenue then reviewed information publicly available from a number of businesses, including the largest retailers in Ireland, on clothing sizes for ten year old children.  All of these measurements, with one exception, indicated that the current clothing sizes for chest and waist were below the current published Revenue guidelines.</p> <p>  I would add that Revenue has not received any submissions or contacts from Deputies, businesses or representative bodies in this regard following the discussions last year.  As matters stand, I have no basis on which to alter the guidelines but I remain prepared to do so if data becomes available that would support a change.  I reiterate that Revenue would welcome submissions from interested parties in this regard.  I hope the work we have done to date on this demonstrates to Deputy Michael McGrath that we have taken the matter seriously.  We have no evidence to support the change and for that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

To be clear, I am not advocating on behalf of any sector or trade interests but on behalf of consumers.</p><p>I welcome the fact that Revenue has undertaken some work in this area.  To recap, the Minister mentioned that contact was made with the ESRI and academics in the area of children's health and nutrition.  I think he went on to say contact was then made with businesses in the clothing trade and that, with one exception, they did not indicate that the measures used were inappropriate.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We approached the ESRI and then academics in children's health and they advised us that the data to enable us to do this in the manner the Deputy describes were not available.  We then reviewed the information on sizing available to us from the largest retailers.  The one exception referred to measurements rather than a retailer, so the vast majority, with one exception, of the work we did indicated that the measurements available in the tax code correspond with children's sizing.  I imagine there must have been just one outlier in this regard.  I ask the Deputy to bear with me for a moment while I consult my officials. There was one brand whose sports trousers appeared to be out of kilter for certain sizes with what we have in our tax law.  For all other brands across the retailers we checked, however, sizing was consistent.</p></speech>

When a child is not of average size, for example, he or she is aged ten years, going on 11, and requires size 6 footwear, whether trainers, football boots or whatever else, VAT is paid at the full rate even though the child is under the age at which such products should cease to be zero-rated.  On the basis that the child is not of average measurements, the 23% rate applies.  The issue here is that the retailers, in pricing these products, have completely separate price ranges.  Taking the example of footwear, there is one price range up to size 5.5 and an entirely different price range above that.  The problem is that the difference is not just in the VAT rate.  Rather, adult footwear is marketed as a completely separate stream of product and at an entirely different price from children's footwear.  What might be &euro;40 for a size 5 or 5.5 could be &euro;70 or &euro;80 for a size 6, 7, 8 or 9.  This is the reality that parents and families face when it comes to this issue.  This is why it needs to be examined.  I think what the Minister is essentially saying is that we are in a straitjacket because of EU VAT law, that the age cannot change because it is the age that was set when the directive came into being and that the only flexibility we have is in respect of what the average sizes are for children in that age bracket.  It would appear, therefore, that we have very limited flexibility.  I acknowledge that some work has been done in this regard but, from what the Minister says, no change will come of it.</p></speech>

As someone who is a regular purchaser of football boots in particular, I am well aware that once one goes beyond a certain size, the price can increase from &euro;30 or &euro;40 to a multiple of that.  The Deputy is 100% correct about this.  The larger driver of this, as he just said, tends to be the price at which the manufacturer seeks to retail the product rather than what is happening with the taxation on it.  I take his point but, from our point of view, we do not have flexibility in respect of age.  The only flexibility we have is in respect of sizing.</p><p>The Deputy is correct about us basing this on average sizing, which is the only way we can make such a decision.  We have to have a reasonable average on which to anchor our decisions.  We have used websites and publicly available information to go through the sizing that we know to be available to Irish consumers.  We believe we are in a reasonable place.</p></speech>

I engaged on it with some people in my area.  The view of someone in this sector whom I know is that, since 2012 when Revenue decided that it was no longer acceptable for all food supplements to continue to be supplied at the zero rate applicable to foods, we have had six years of highly disruptive and costly VAT disputes, with some products remaining VAT free while moves were made to apply the 23% rate to other products.  The system has lacked clarity, is laden with disputes between companies and Revenue, and has become dysfunctional.</p><p>I acknowledge that this is an area of great change and that change has happened rapidly in recent years.  The issue of food supplements and nutrition is evolving quickly.  The application of our tax code to it needs to be considered carefully.  If the Minister has a note on this amendment, he might place it on the record and we can proceed from there.</p></speech>

However, there is a Revenue concession that allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT on 1 November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small.  However, this concession is proving to be problematic.</p> <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry have made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to certain food supplements.  There are concerns that, while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% rate.  The crux of the argument is generally that the products concerned are similar and compete with other products that are zero rated.  Protracted correspondence on the issues has raised concerns regarding possible non-compliance in the sector, in particular the zero rating of products that should be standard rated, which may result in a degree of unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p> <p>  Revenue's position is that food supplements are not food and, as such, are not entitled under VAT law to the zero rate of VAT.  Therefore, the standard rate of VAT applies.  The concession outlined in Revenue guidance is no longer tenable.</p> <p>  After consultations between Revenue, the Department of Health and my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018, reservations were expressed by the Department of Health as to the implications that a change might have on the promotion of food supplements in certain circumstances.  For these reasons, I decided not to make any change in this year's budget and Finance Bill.  I am advised that Revenue will now consider how to proceed based on the existing legislation, including whether any change to its guidance is necessary.</p></speech>

To clarify, will the guidance that is currently in place continue to apply in the absence of any change under the Finance Bill?  When referencing the concession on vitamins, minerals and fish oils, the Minister stated that it was no longer tenable.  However, he also stated that there would be no change in the Bill and that Revenue would consider what changes to its guidance might be needed.</p> <p>  I want to be clear on the position for 2019.  Is it that the concession will continue to apply?  The Minister stated that food supplements were not food and, generally speaking, are not zero rated.  Will he provide clarity on the situation for 2019?</p></speech>

A Revenue concession is in place regarding vitamins, minerals and fish oils, but it has proven difficult for the reasons outlined.  It is the view of Revenue that the concession is no longer tenable and it will have to make decisions on how to interpret the legislation.</p> <p>  From a legislative point of view, this is a matter that we considered.  Following the views put to me, particularly regarding public health, I decided that no change in legislation was required.  This is an important matter and there are public health considerations to it.  The Revenue Commissioners make decisions independently of me regarding how legislation is interpreted.  I must respect that, but there are some policy decisions at stake that merit consideration.  If the Deputy withdraws the amendment, I will give a commitment to deal with this matter in the context of a specific paper of the tax strategy group, TSG, during the summer period.</p></speech>

It is a Revenue interpretation as such.  Is my understanding correct?  I welcome the Minister's statement that the issue will be examined in the context of the TSG, but will he also give a commitment that there will be no change in Revenue practice or interpretation until this issue has been examined by that group?</p></speech>

How is it decided whether VAT is applied?  Is it ultimately a matter for the retailer to decide whether the concession applies or is it a matter for Revenue?  From the great deal of correspondence I have received, it seems that the area is riven with disputes.  The position is unclear.  I am concerned that some retailers may be building up potential liabilities by not charging VAT correctly.</p></speech>

This is mainly within the area of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The position in this regard is not clear.  The Revenue guidance to date has been that there is a concession in place but due to the implementation and other issues, Revenue will now have to review the guidance in place.</p> <p>  I know the Revenue is aware of the issues raised.  The challenge we now have is that we find ourselves receiving representations from manufacturers and retailers, some of whom believe they are correctly implementing the law.  We have to ensure we have a level playing field.  I want to be crystal clear on this point and I realise the Deputy is not challenging this.  This is one of the areas in which I have to support the work being done by the Revenue.  It will issue guidance in this area based on its interpretation of the law and this will have my full support.  I will work in parallel with that but it is the right of Revenue to issue guidance before my work potentially concludes.  If Revenue does that, I will support it and issue a paper on some of the broader policy issues.  If the Revenue advises me of issues that I need to clarify to help with the implementation of law, I will be guided by that advice on the matter.  Above all, I want to see a level playing field for retail products.  I want to see clarity regarding how the law is being implemented.  A growing body of evidence is being presented to me to the effect that this is not the case in the sector.</p> <p>  I was concerned that if I made a legislative change at this point, it could compound difficulties that exist.  The Revenue will decide how this needs to be implemented.  It will issue further guidance in this area, which I will fully support.  While Revenue is looking at this, I will review our policy in the area and the question of whether we need to make changes in next year's finance Bill.  Everyone needs to know where they stand, including manufacturers, retailers and consumers.  When this clarity is available everyone will have to implement the same law in the same way.  That is not happening at the moment and we need to address it.</p></speech>

He will be aware of the pre-budget submission by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the new tool used in the submission, which in essence is a heat map.  It shows that the area at risk of overheating in the coming years is the non-housing construction sector as opposed to the housing construction sector.</p><p>I want to have a brief conversation with the Minister about the risks in the non-housing sector.  IFAC has been clear in stating this sector poses a significant risk to overheating in the economy.  How is it proposed to dampen down the risk?  This is relevant, especially given that we have a housing crisis and a housing shortage and, according to the IFAC heat map, there is no risk to overheating in the housing construction sector.  Deputy Pearse Doherty is looking for a report within six months of passing the Finance Bill on the impact of increasing non-residential stamp duty by 1% and how that would or could dampen down the non-residential sector.</p><p>Not only that, I imagine both the Minister and I would agree that capacity and labour shortages in housebuilding are relevant.  Even if we put all the money in the world into housebuilding tomorrow, only so many houses can be built given the labour available.  Would this not be a way of redirecting some of the labour from the non-housing construction sector, which is going ahead too hotly, into housing construction?  I am seeking some brief comments from the Minister on that point.</p></speech>

I believed there was a risk of overheating in the sector.  In particular, I believed that we were facing an issue because, from the point of view of the Government, we had a preference for economic resources and human capital to be deployed in supplying homes but instead it was being absorbed into the delivery of commercial property.  We reviewed the position on rates for commercial property.  We went from 9% to 6% to 2%.  I decided, in the context of the evident risk, that it was appropriate to return the rate to 6%, which is where it used to be.  This has meant that we have delivered a significant increase in the yield on stamp duty on commercial property.  We are behind target compared with the figures we had.  My expectation is that we will catch up on that target in the remaining months of the year.  However, at this point it is likely that we will miss it.  The question of by how much will become evident as we move into the end of the year.  The way the tax operates means that it tends to be influenced by a small number of high-value transactions.  As we move through the year we believe it is likely that the figures will increase beyond where we are, but maybe not come in exactly as we forecasted.</p> <p>  Given that I made such a significant change last year I decided it would not be the appropriate stance to take to change it again this year, especially given where we were with yield.  It is a sector in which we have already made a large change in recognition of the risk that Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and IFAC have identified.  Given the tripling of the rate last year I decided that a further change this year would not be appropriate.  Is this something that we will keep under review?  The answer is: "Yes we will."</p></speech>

The Minister said that we tripled the rate last year.  In August of this year, IFAC was still looking at 2019, 2020 and 2021 as a period when that sector will overheat more and more.  This is despite the tripling of the rate last year.  Has any analysis been done on the impact that the increase last year is likely to have in the coming years?</p></speech>

Given these factors it is still too early to be able to evaluate the effect this measure has had apart from the additional yield it has brought in.  I expect that by the time we get to next summer we will be in a position to assess whether it has had the kind of effect on yields and commercial duty pricing that we are keen to see.  That would be the appropriate point to make a call on whether the level of stamp duty should be reviewed further.  Of course by that point we should be clearer on where we are from the point of view of Brexit.</p><p>That, in turn, will feed into decisions I will be able to make.</p><p> In summary, by the middle of next year we will be in a position to assess whether this has had the desired effect on yields and price levels.  It remains open to me in the Finance Bill 2019 to decide whether I want to change it again.</p></speech>

The judgment call I made was that to make a further change so soon after tripling this rate might be counterproductive, but I am open to changing this again.  It was at 9%, which is higher than it is now.  The sector should be aware that this is a decision that I will be reviewing next year.</p></speech>

It is an issue raised with me by a tax practitioner and it relates to the application of agricultural relief in the context of Brexit.  Under the definition of &quot;agricultural property&quot;, it relates to agricultural land and pasture woodland situated in a member state.  The question that has arisen is in the context of Brexit.  When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, what will be the status of land in Northern Ireland in the context of agricultural relief in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#BB01900"><p>I want to first set out the current position on capital acquisitions tax, CAT, agricultural relief.  The purpose of agricultural relief is to encourage the productive use of agricultural land and to prevent the sale or break-up of farms to pay a CAT liability.</p> <p>  Agricultural relief operates by allowing the value of agricultural assets received to be reduced by 90% of its value for the calculation of the CAT liability.  This is a key relief in ensuring the inter-generational transfer of farm assets and plays an important role in farm succession planning.  To qualify for the relief, certain conditions must be met.  The first condition is that, following the inheritance or gift, at least 80% of the property owned by the farmer consists of agricultural property.  A second condition, known as the active farmer test, is in place to ensure that the farmland will continue to be actively farmed following the inheritance or gift.</p><p>Agricultural land owned by the farmer and located either inside or outside the State can be used to determine qualification for this relief.  Equally, the agricultural land which is inherited or gifted to the farmer, on which CAT is relieved, can be inside or outside the State in any part of the European Union.</p><p> I want to reassure the Deputy that the possible impact of Brexit on this specific relief is something of which I and my officials are fully aware.</p><p> An agricultural relief for CAT has been in place since CAT was first introduced and I am conscious of the importance of this relief to the farming community.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that Brexit negotiations are still ongoing and there is a very wide array of issues that we will have to deal with, particularly in our tax code.  At this point, it would be inappropriate and premature for me to comment on the future of this relief until a clearer picture emerges from the Brexit negotiations.</p><p> I hope the Deputies will appreciate that there is sensitivity regarding elements of our tax code that prevent me from giving a further commitment on that point now.  However, I want to emphasise the importance of seeing a successful outcome from the negotiations centring on Brexit.  I reiterate that given the implications of this particular relief, it is something of which I am very much aware.  It depends on the outcome of Brexit negotiations that will take some time to complete.  </p><p> Before I comment any further on this relief, there is a broader set of principles on which we will need to get agreement.  I reiterate for Deputy McGrath's information that I am aware of the importance of this particular relief.  The safest thing to do would be to allow us continue with work that we have on the outcome of Brexit.  Much of the work that will need to take place on this is still some way down the road.  We have a set of other issues that we are trying to get resolved.  The wisest thing for us to do will be to look at this relief at a later point in the context of a set of other decisions rather than me committing to a report on it now that will only restate what I have just said to the Deputy.  For that reason, I would ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing this amendment in light of the fact that I recognise the importance of this issue, but there are many other issues we need to get resolved first.</p></speech>

I understand the predicament the Minister is in, namely, that this is one of a great many issues in the mix in the Brexit negotiations.  However, is it not the case that, at its simplest level, this will require a change in our legislation because agricultural relief currently relates to agricultural property, which is defined as being property within a member state?  If the UK is gone from the EU by the end of March 2019, it will no longer be a member state.  Is it not the case that a change in our legislation will be required?  Given that that timeline is only a number of months away, we could have a situation where a small number of individual cases could arise in the first half of next year.  That is the reality.  I acknowledge that the Minister recognises the importance of the relief but there is a degree of uncertainty on this, as there is on so many other issues in the wider context of Brexit, which I understand.  However, the legislation that currently underpins this vital relief provides for the application of it to property within a member state.  As things stand, the UK will not be a member state in a short number of months, therefore, this relief will not have a legal basis for land outside the European Union.</p></speech>

The UK will no longer be a member of the European Union.</p><p>That means that we will have to change our primary legislation but before I get to the point of being able to make that change there are other issues with our tax code that need to be settled.  We need to do that work first and that is the issue we have to deal with.</p></speech>

I assume that will not be allowed to happen.</p></speech>

All I can do at this point is reiterate my understanding that this is an important matter and that I will do my best to resolve it in an orderly and fair way.  However, before we can get to that point we have to conclude some other issues.</p></speech>

I know we all hope that will last as long as possible but many agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom will clearly be fundamentally changed when the United Kingdom formally and fully exits the European Union as they have suggested they will do.  Does the Minister anticipate that emergency legislation will be required to cover a transitional period and are he and his officials preparing same?  It would not just relate to agriculture but I anticipate that it would relate to a wide variety of areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#DD00500"><p>If the UK leaves with a transitionary period in place, legislation will be needed.  The importance of having that period means that the legislation will not be emergency legislation because the great benefit of having a transitionary period is that it will give us and the UK the time that is needed to settle a vast array of issues.  In the event of the UK leaving without a transitionary period we are looking at our options but we would face an immense number of issues were that to occur.</p></speech>

Have there been discussions about what such people will be required to do because there will definitely be changes in legal status and potentially in taxation status also?</p> <p>  Many people are trying to make a living and we already know what happens when there are delays in British ports.  I am sure that the Minister has seen the work that is ongoing with a lane in the motorway being reserved near the ports in the south east of England.  It would be useful if we could have advice and discussion on this because tens of thousands of people's livelihoods are at stake once the transition period comes in.  I hope the transitionary period could last until the end of 2021 as the Minister does.  Nonetheless there needs to be a lot of legal clarity because otherwise the people driving trucks could be faced with unexpected demands regarding their data, documentation or clearances in a changed environment.</p> <p>  I wish it was not so but that is how these things work.</p></speech>

The Government order which gives effect to the multilateral convention has been discussed primarily in this committee and has been approved by both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Government.  The additional reference to the order in Part 5 of Schedule 24A to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is the final legislative step in the process which will ensure that the multilateral convention will have the force of law.  Once the Bill becomes law, Ireland can then deposit our instrument of ratification together with the list of reservations and notifications to the OECD depository.</p></speech>

This article is not a minimum standard under the multilateral convention so signatories are free to opt out of this article.</p> <p>  I am not adopting this provision but I am committed to keeping it under review.  It is open to Ireland to lift our reservation at a later date.  The reason I am not adopting Article 12 at this time is that there is significant uncertainty as to how the test will be applied in practice.  Similar to Ireland, the majority of signatories to the multilateral convention, including Ireland's major trading partners such as the UK, Germany, Canada, Italy, Sweden and many others, are choosing not to adopt this article due to continuing uncertainty.  Ireland's position is in line with the majority of EU member states, the majority of OECD member states and the majority of our tax treaty partners.  I will keep it under review and get a clearer sense of how it is being applied.  It is open to us to include this article in treaties bilaterally, on a case-by-case basis, should a treaty partner seek to do so and should there be a sufficiently strong case for both partners.  On the basis that Ireland will deposit our notification and reservations with the OECD on 19 January, a report delivered in the timeframe suggested in the amendment would not illustrate any sufficient developments in this space.</p> <p>  However, I will have officials include further analysis on this as the position on article 12 develops as part of the tax strategy group papers for next year.  On that basis I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the Commission might pursue a number of inquiries relating to Ireland.  I have been a very strong supporter of the BEPS process for many years.  It seems to have partly reached the end of the road.  The BEPS process would suit Ireland very well.  That is not the approach many member states are taking, as the Minister is aware.  Where does the Minister stand with regard to Commission inquiries into Irish activities that are tax related?  Could the Minister enlighten us as to whether one or more fairly significant investigations are under way?  My understanding is that some may be as significant as the Apple inquiry.  Again, all of this is complicated by Brexit.  Could the Minister enlighten the committee as to where Ireland is at the moment.</p></speech>

I know Christian Aid, among others, is very unhappy that the Minister is not doing so.  I cannot remember all of the detail but broadly speaking, its concerns are that, if adopted, this measure would tackle some of the disadvantages that developing countries face relating to profit shifting and base erosion; that our failure to do so hurts developing countries because profits that should be booked in these countries are not booked because of profit shifting manoeuvres by multinationals; that this measure is an effort to address that; and the fact that Ireland and others are not willing to adopt Article 12 is because we do not want to do anything about this unfairness.  Could the Minister explain his reasons?</p></speech>

Interestingly, the most recent set of US corporate tax changes contained a number of features that were strongly related to BEPS.  In the recent paper I published on corporate tax reform, I outlined work that needs to be done across the next two to three Finance Bills to implement a BEPS process in our tax code.</p><p>We have an amount of work to do with regard to this.  The next area to which we must move for next year concerns our transfer pricing rules.  </p><p> With regard to our engagement with the Commission, I and my Department receive ongoing inquiries from the Commission regarding an array of different matters.  This is a constant area of engagement with the Commission so, yes, we are in ongoing contact with it but any inquiries it has declared or anything that is ongoing are in the public domain and Deputy Burton will be aware of them.  The most significant one is the Apple investigation.  </p><p> With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, Article 12 deals with the artificial avoidance of permanent established status.  This means that a proposed new test in Article 12 looks at how much presence a company must have in a country before it has to pay corporation tax.  It provides that an enterprise of one country is deemed to have a permanent establishment in another country if it operates through a dependent agent in that other country.  I am not saying that we will not sign up to it.  I have met Christian Aid on this and I can see the role it could play in the future either on a bilateral level or through the OECD.  However, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding how it would be implemented and a lot of jurisdictions with which we have significant trade have not yet implemented it.  I will keep it under review.  I am not ruling out the possibility of it forming a part of our tax code in the future but until I see how it is implemented and until I see a number of other countries participate in it, I think it would be too early for Ireland to move to implement it.  </p></speech>

In this very complex area, it is worthwhile talking to organisations like Christian Aid that are trying to pursue an approach to global tax justice.  Obviously, that means global tax justice for the developing world as well for a country like Ireland.  I acknowledge that the Minister met Christian Aid and thank him for doing so.</p></speech>

A number of countries are moving to adopt this tax.  Most surprisingly, in his most recent budget, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer moved to a digital tax proposal of around 2% to 3% - presumably with rebates relating to tax paid in the UK.  I am sure the Minister and possibly his officials were a bit surprised by this proposal by the UK Chancellor.  I think this move by the UK is indicative of where the digital tax proposals stand.</p><p>It is genuinely difficult for many countries, and it will be even more difficult in the future, to be able to secure additional tax flows and revenues from the very big IT and social media multinationals that are immensely rich and generate vast revenues, that all of us use in our daily lives, and about which there is no global agreed approach as to how they should contribute their fair share of taxation in the different countries in which they sell their products.  It is a real problem for national exchequers to have vast economic activity that contributes no taxation.  In many ways, Ireland was an early starter in the development of employment and industry in this sector.  As a consequence, we have significant numbers of people employed in the sector and very valuable economic activity on which tax is paid in this country.  As we move increasingly to automation and robots in the sector, however, we all have to look at how we generate tax flows for national revenues from this vast area of economic activity.</p><p> This proposal is very simple.  It is to ask the Minister to report to us within a short period after the introduction of the Act to indicate how a digital tax might operate, the likely tax rate and whether the tax paid can be offset against tax liabilities.  I have chosen these three points because of the French proposals.  By the way, the French made the Minister a very good offer not too long ago and asked for his co-operation on it.</p><p> A similar situation is occurring in Italy and it is also happening in Austria.  The Germans are actively examining this, and the Spanish, and possibly the Portuguese, have indicated that they are following in the same vein.  In terms of our future in the European Union, particularly post Brexit, it behoves us to be as informed as possible about this form of taxation that is coming down the line.  While we can decide to stick our heads in the sand and pretend it will not happen, it is already under way.  This simply asks the Minister to publish a report that would be made available to the committee and the public in general on how this tax might operate.  It may end up being in effect a form of sales tax with abatement for taxes paid in the country.  I am sure the Minister's officials have attended discussions on this.  I do not know whether it will be abated by other taxes paid by the entities in particular countries, for instance, employment taxes, possibly other contributions such as PRSI and employment and social insurance levies and corporation tax that may or may not have been paid.</p><p> I noticed that the British Chancellor, in his statement about this commencing, I understand in 2020 as a fact, pencilled in a couple of billion pounds on an annual basis to the British Exchequer.  It is time we had a serious examination of this.  The amendment is very simple.  It just asks for the Minister's co-operation in having a review of where these proposals are at so that we can all examine them and see how the D&aacute;il might like to proceed in this respect.</p></speech>

The profits and revenues being generated by these IT companies are absolutely staggering and they are not properly taxed.  These companies are leading the charge on aggressive tax avoidance and we must find a way for them to pay their fair share.</p> <p>  In the Minister's comments on this yesterday, he stated he is concerned that if fewer profits were made because of the imposition of a digital tax on sales that may happen elsewhere in Europe it would mean fewer profits declared here and less tax revenue.  There may be some discussion about what type of digital tax would be applied and how it would be fair and would not overly disadvantage a country such as Ireland, but the general principle that these people should be taxed to a far greater degree than they are is, to me, a no-brainer.  It has to happen, it will happen and it is right that it should happen.  We need at the very least to start to have a detailed debate about it.  The proposal for a report in these amendments is entirely appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#JJ00200"><p>The reason I will not accept the amendment, but I am open to looking at how I can provide further information if Deputies so require, is because of how much work we have already done with the Oireachtas on this issue.  When the issue first developed the Department, as it is required to do, sent a comprehensive set of scrutiny notes to the Oireachtas.  Subsequent to this, officials from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the committee to outline how the digital sales tax would operate.  We have already submitted a report to the committee on this issue.  We have already done what the amendment is asking me to do.</p> <p>  Committee members may be aware the Houses of the Oireachtas, following us submitting the information the amendment is looking for, issued reasoned opinions on the draft directives that they breach the principle of subsidiarity.  In terms of providing information and reports, officials from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners have come before the committee.  We supplied all of the information asked for and subsequently we supplied that information in written format.  We have done what the amendment asks us to do.  If there is further information that committee members want me to supply I am very happy to do so because this is a very important area.</p> <p>  Before we get into a debate on the substantive issue itself, I want to correct the record in several important areas.  The only French offer I received is that issued in public to me on Tuesday morning when the Minister, Mr. Le Maire, invited me to go for a beer with him.  That is the only offer I have received.  I want to be very clear about this because there has been a lot of speculation about it and I want the committee to be assured of this.  Deputy Burton said this measure would raise many billions of euro.  She used the word "billions" in respect of the UK.  The amount of revenue the UK Government has put against this for 2020 is &pound;400 million.  That is not billions.  To put this in context, for us &pound;400 million is roughly equivalent, for the sake of argument, to the value in euro of between &pound;30 million and &pound;40 million.  It is very important that we are clear on the scale of revenue the UK Government is looking to raise through this measure.</p><p> I also acknowledge that the taxing landscape for digital companies is going to change.  I expect that will happen.  The question is the safest way in which that will happen.  From my point of view and from our point of view as an open, small economy, when we have seen major change like this happen in the past, it has been through the OECD.  This has happened in terms of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process for other major corporate tax changes that have taken place.</p><p> It is my strong view that if a digital tax were to happen, with Europe making changes in isolation without a global consensus on the issue, there would be the potential for trade consequences from this, and there would be the potential for international tax co-operation in this area to be affected.  If either of those two scenarios were to happen, this would pose very significant challenges for Ireland.</p><p> I believe change will happen and, as part of that, there could be various consequences for Ireland.  The safest way in which this can happen is the way it has happened in the past, which is through the OECD.  The committee may be aware that the OECD has indicated that it will be publishing a report on this area sooner than it had originally indicated.  Intense work is already going on in this area as we speak.  Deputy Burton will be aware, if she looks at all of the issues that were navigated via the OECD in the past, that this offers the best vehicle within which we look to see change happen in this area.  I believe change will happen, and the safest way through which that change can happen is through the OECD.</p><p> I note that in the debate on the matter last Tuesday, and I have been involved in this for more a year, we saw a number of other countries express opposition to the current Commission proposal for the reasons I outlined.  Significantly, we saw countries that were in favour of this proposal being implemented begin to outline a whole array of technical issues that they wanted to be resolved.  For those of us who have been involved in this before, those technical issues are considerable and would have significant consequences for us.</p><p> To reiterate, this is going to be a new area of change.  As Deputy Burton was talking about the area of artificial intelligence, I was reminded of what the founder of Microsoft said recently that robots should be taxed.  These are the kinds of debates that are going to happen.</p></speech>

I think that was the one that we discussed in May.  In that report, we looked at what the European Commission was proposing, which was 3% on amounts over a certain value, which I think was &euro;750 million and &euro;50 million within the EU.  If the Minister were to implement something along those lines, given that there could be a case where tax is deductible, he could actually see a net loss from the introduction of a digital tax in Ireland.  I am trying to remember if that is the same report to which the Minister is referring.</p></speech>

Okay.  A lot of discussion has taken place at this committee and in the D&aacute;il Chamber on digital taxation.  That does not go then, however, to say that we should not have a further detailed report on the subject, because there are a number of proposals on how it could be implemented.  Would it be levied on the service users in a particular country or on the intellectual property that is onshored?  I believe some countries at this stage are taking different approaches to how they could possibly introduce a digital tax.  We do not seem to have any indication of how we would proceed with one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#LL00100"><p>That was a fairly extensive commentary and one of the first that the Minister has made on this issue.  It is useful that he has opened a conversation about digital tax.  There is a need for a fresh report because since the previous report was issued there has been an enormous change in the landscape and in attitudes.  The Minister is correct that certain countries have identified difficulties.  Sweden, for example, has expressed concern about its gaming industry.  That is true and I completely accept that point.  However, it would be really helpful to this committee to get an updated report.  As the Minister has said, departmental officials have all of the data and have been involved in all of the discussions and the conferences.  I see no reason the information they have collected and of which they are aware, which has not been the subject of much commentary in the Irish media, would not be shared with us by way of a report, given the significant implications for this country.  The approach proposed here is completely reasonable.  Shying away from dealing with this will not do Ireland's case any favours.  Obviously all of us here would seek to maximise the possibility of a fair and just taxation position for Ireland.  Other European countries have historic advantages that we do not enjoy in the context of taxation issues.  What we are seeking is tax fairness and justice in this area.</p> <p>  Why is the Minister refusing what is a completely reasonable and standard request for a report on an area of taxation that is changing?  I am glad that the Minister gave the example of the UK because in his report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Hammond, indicated that within a number of years he would be expecting a net digital tax take of between &pound;1.5 billion and &pound;2 billion.  As the Minister said, this is not an enormous sum, given the size of the British economy and I agree that in the context of the Irish economy, the sum involved could be a lot less.  On the other hand, however, countries like Italy have been telling IT companies that unless they have a presence in Italy, then Italy will pursue Ireland with regard to earlier cases.  Officials here today know the cases what I am referring to.  I have asked many questions of the Minister and of Revenue with regard to back cases that are being pursued and the back payments that Ireland has made.  Giving bland, brush-off answers does not serve Ireland or the Irish economy well.</p> <p>  Is it the Chairman's intention to take amendment No. 160 with the amendment relating to domicile?

As Deputy O'Brien said, this has already been the subject of debate in the Oireachtas.  My officials were in front of the committee and this is the report that we produced before the summer.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton said at the start of her statement that I gave an extensive answer to the questions she raised and at the end she said that I had given a bland response, looking to brush away issues.  I hope the first part of her statement is correct and not the second part.  I am not shying away from anything.  I have been involved in this issue for over a year, trying to deal with the different issues that are at stake.  These are not discussions but negotiations on two different things.  The first is a matter that Deputy Burton called out well, which is the design and implementation of a tax like this.  As the Deputy acknowledged, the yield involved in such a tax is in many cases much lower than people might expect for a number of reasons.  In the UK example that the Deputy used, where billions of pounds were talked about being raised, it was across a five-year period.  Per year, it is a measure worth &pound;400 million sterling.  It is entirely possible that if this tax was implemented in the way currently proposed, it could represent a loss in some jurisdictions such as ours.  For other jurisdictions, the compliance involved in implementing it and some of the things that would need to be done would mean that the revenue brought in would be lower than expected.  Once the compliance costs were baked into it, the return that the exchequer in other countries would get would be much lower than people expected.  The journey that the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, George Osborne, went on with what he referred to as the "Google tax" was an example of this.  The yield was much lower than had been anticipated.</p> <p>  I have been substantively involved in this matter over the last year.  In one area, the figures and yields involved in it from our point of view and that of other countries would be much lower than people might expect.  The area of greatest concern for me is the many principles involved in this.  If the principles are reapplied for open service exporting economies, they could be very significant.  The principle of a group of countries or the European Union as a whole going down this path while we do not have agreement with other trading partners regarding how it should be implemented is a concern.  If that happens, those other trading partners could make decisions on trade and tax co-operation that would have very serious consequences for the European Union and could be difficult for Ireland.  For those reasons, I acknowledge that I expect to see change in this area but think Ireland needs to be clear regarding the best route in which we believe that should happen.  It is notable that across the last number of weeks, we have seen a number of other economies which are small, open and service-oriented say the same thing as Ireland has said.  I will not agree to a report because I would ask Deputies to be aware that I am involved in negotiations on this, not discussions, and if this committee wants information or clarification on any negotiations under way, I will supply it promptly.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister is familiar with the concern raised in the amendment about section 110 tax relief which I see as a national scandal in that foreign companies essentially came here to speculate on Irish property having been invited by the Minister's predecessor in 2013.</p><p>A total of 65 meetings were held by the Minister and officials with Cerberus, Apollo Global Management, Lone Star, Kennedy Wilson, all those guys who came as bottom feeders to cash in in a distressed property market and who were actively courted by the previous Government to do so.  They availed of a tax break, which means that if they maintain their investment for a few years, they will not pay tax on rental income or capital gains, which is quite extraordinary.  If people really understood what was going on, they would be shocked.  What happens is that, apparently, small items in Finance Bills pass a lot of people by because they do not understand what is going on.  For that reason, it is important to shine a light on the issue.  When one considers by how much rents have increased since those guys bought into the Irish property market and by how much property prices have increased, the value of their investments has gone through the roof.  That is the other side of the coin in dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis that such entities are making obscene profits and will walk away without paying almost any tax.  That is something about which they boast when they produce their annual accounts.  Every year they record bigger profits than in the previous year and pay negligible amounts of tax which, to my mind, is shameful.</p><p> It is equally shameful that when the Minister is asked parliamentary questions by me and others about how much tax is forgone through this tax relief, we cannot get answers, which is beyond extraordinary.  We need a detailed report.  We need to know how much tax revenue is being forgone to the benefit of the property speculators who have come into the country to profiteer on the back of the housing crisis.  Over and above what is in the amendment, even at this stage, given what has happened in the property market and the extraordinary profits being made by the people concerned, any Government interested in fair taxation and generating revenues to perhaps be put into areas such as public housing would be looking at how we could increase the tax paid by such entities and put the revenue into public housing and other areas to address the housing crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#XX00200"><p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose vehicles set up to securitise assets.  Securitisation is useful, both for banks in freeing up capital to allow them to continue to lend to all taxpayers and for the productive economy, as it can underpin the supply of capital marketing finance to industry and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  We are not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations.  The importance of securitisation has been recognised, for example, by the European Commission through its work on capital markets union, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.</p> <p>  Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets.  Real property is not an asset a qualifying company can hold.  However, it can hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value therefrom.  Following concerns raised by the Revenue Commissioners and subsequently Deputies at this committee about the use of section 110 companies to hold debt secured on Irish property, the Finance Act 2016 made changes to the taxation of section 110 companies to ensure the profits which derived from Irish land and buildings were subject to tax in Ireland.</p><p>These changes took effect from 6 September 2016.  With regard to the specifics of the report proposed by the Deputies, I am advised that Revenue does not and could not collect the type of information that would be required to calculate the tax that would have been paid had section 110 not existed.  That is for two reasons.  In the first instance some of the business carried on through section 110 companies simply would not be carried on here or would have been carried on differently.  There is no method to take account of how behaviour would have changed had the regime not been existed.  Second, in the case of activity that would have taken place in Ireland, absent section 110, the hypothetical alternative tax would depend on exactly what the underlying business was and how it might otherwise have been funded - as a company, a partnership or investment fund, for example.  Any of those estimates would be highly subjective and could not be presented as an accurate assessment of the tax impact of section 110.  I therefore cannot accept the Deputy's amendment but I can accept that Revenue continues to keep the activities of the section 110 companies under review.  Where Revenue identifies misuse of the regime it will continue to bring them to the attention of my Department and I will act to close any gaps identified.</p></speech>

We both acknowledge the complexity of how that would operate and wanting to ensure that it was robust and doing what it was intended to do.  At the conclusion of the discussion on Report Stage the Minister acknowledged that Revenue would continue to assess the situation, as he just reiterated, but he said that he wanted further analysis and that when he received it he would answer questions on it.  Did the Minister receive further analysis in writing from the Department and could he share that analysis with the committee?  He could do so even at a later stage or before Report Stage, as it may not be appropriate to the Finance Bill, to assure us that there is no issue in terms of how some of the companies might be operating?</p></speech>

They were effectively invited in by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Department in the meetings which were held.  I think there was an understanding that if they came here and bought into Irish property that they would pay very little tax.  The logic at the time, which was fairly explicitly expressed by the then Minister, was that we needed to reflate the Irish property market.  I think he argued at the time that it would professionalise the rental sector because we would have corporate entities as opposed to the small-scale landlord.  We were going to bring in the big guys.  It has self-evidently been a disaster.  It has not done anything to make the rental sector better.  It has done a hell of a lot to make it worse.  The Minister said in his response that if we did not have this relief certain activities might not have happened.  Yes, exactly.  I am sorry those activities did happen.  It is a matter of extreme regret that we brought such entities in here to gain such an important foothold in the Irish property sector.</p><p>It is obscene that those who benefited from the window that was opened in terms of section 110, even if it was closed subsequently, will continue to benefit from it and will walk away paying little or no tax on their investments.  I do not understand why Revenue cannot estimate how much tax is foregone.  When one looks at what has happened to the property market, the value of the investments that these persons made has gone through the roof.  The Irish property market, including the rental market, is generating staggering profits.  We know from the announcements of annual profits that they are going up and the companies in question are paying pitiful amounts of tax.  It is a scandal.  I do not see how it could be justified at any level.</p><p> There was something the Minister did not answer in his response.  If we were to debate what was done in the past, why it was done and whether it was good or bad, it would be self-evident given where all of this has led that the Government made a bad and disastrous mistake.  One does not have to be a tax expert or a financial whizz-kid to conclude that those who invested in property are making a fortune because it is obvious.  When one considers the 60% or 70% increase in the value of those investments and similar increases in rents, one would expect the Government to think of some way, perhaps through a levy or tax, of clawing back some of the money these companies have made on the back of a dysfunctional property sector.  This could be used to deal with the costs of the housing crisis that their activities helped to generate.  Given the housing crisis and the direction in which the property sector has gone in recent years, would that not be a fair and reasonable course of action?</p></speech>

To deal with a commitment that I made last year, in the tax strategy group, TSG, papers of this year we dealt with some of the issues that were raised.  To respond to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question, what I did in the aftermath of last year's Finance Act was ask for an appraisal to be done on the effects of the operation of these companies in the economy.  That work is being done.  By the end of quarter 1 of next year, the tax returns for these companies will have been filed.  My Department will then be in a position to make an appraisal of the operation of the IREFs and some of the section 110 organisations to which Deputies referred.  My plan is to integrate the analysis that we make of that taxation data with 18 months worth of information we will have on the property market at that stage and address this matter more substantively in the papers we will publish next summer.  This year, we began work on examining trends in the property market.  We need more data on that.  More fundamentally, the filing of tax returns by these companies will give us the opportunity, on an aggregate level, to better examine some of the issues raised.</p></speech>

The issues are well ventilated.  Rents have increased by 22% since 2016.  Rents have increased by 7.8% in the past 12 months in Dublin, despite the rent pressure zones of 4%.  The average rents in the State are &euro;1,060 and in Dublin, they are &euro;1,527.  Student rents are out of control and there is major pressure on these individuals in terms of having money at the end of the week to meet their needs.</p><p>The Minister will be aware rent relief was introduced in the State a number of decades ago by a previous Minister for Finance.  The interesting proposal at the time - neither of us were around - focused on pressures on the elderly in meeting rent payments.  It was designed with different tiers, but particularly with higher thresholds for the elderly.  I merely make the point that rent relief was a factor of the taxation code up until the crisis in 2011 when the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister, removed it through the Finance Act.</p><p>This would have an immediate impact.  For example, for somebody who is paying the average rent across the State of &euro;1,060, the benefit would be &euro;1,060.  Those living in areas with lower rent pressures would receive relief of one month's rent.  My party argues that this should be brought in over a three-year period.</p><p>Obviously, a rent relief such as this without a rent freeze would be foolish because all that would happen is the rent relief would be sucked up in an increase in rent.  This would have to go hand in glove with a rent freeze which, I believe, is required.  Yesterday, the Minister answered a question from one of our colleagues on whether rents are too high.  They are too high but the law allows them to continue to go higher.  What we need is for them to go in the other direction.  The least we should do is ensure that they are frozen.  Alongside those two measures, we would need to see an increase in planned capacity from State investment.</p><p>I believe this measure is warranted.  It would cost &euro;250 million over a three-year period.</p><p>Let me mention the discussion on intangible assets that we had last night.  We dealt with that and it is disposed of.  The Minister is not amenable to accepting that amendment and implementing the policy of Mr. Seamus Coffey but if he was, even the revenue that would be generated in one year from that proposal could fund this for the next three years at which point it should be phased out.</p><p>I have made my point.  I would imagine that the Minister is not amenable to it but it is worthy of consideration.</p></speech>

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief had an effect on the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.</p><p>Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.  In addition, a tax credit of this kind would be of little benefit to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax.  Finally, at the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum.  On certain assumptions, it is likely that the annual cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal, if introduced, would be even higher.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>

This relates to a report.  I am sure the Minister is aware of our full proposal, which is that rent relief would be introduced and there would be a rent freeze or cap at the same time.  The argument that this would go directly into the pocket of landlords would not hold as rents could not increase over those three years.  The Minister is correct about what would happen if this was non-refundable, which is not the case.  The proposal we have is that this would be a refundable tax credit, meaning those on low incomes that do not have a tax liability would still be able to avail of it.  This is particularly pertinent to students, as the Minister mentioned.</p> <p>  The cost would be significantly increased from the previous scheme based on the Residential Tenancies Board number of tenancies and average rent, leaving the figure just short of &euro;250 million.  This is an emergency and this is a time for emergency action.  This rent relief could not sit on its own without a rent freeze.  Even with those two elements, it would make no sense unless we ramped up serious capacity within the sector.  That is why we in Sinn F&eacute;in argue that an additional &euro;1 billion should be invested in social and affordable housing.  If that does not happen, after the three years the assistance would be turned off but we would still have the same problem if supply did not increase in the sector.  This is a response to the Minister's comments, while acknowledging that the form in which we must submit amendments cannot deal with a rent freeze or the tax-refundable nature of the proposal.  The report would establish that.  We are not really seeking a report but rather for the Government to take serious action to help the 240,000 renters out there who are finding it difficult to make ends meet.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the introduction of a new threshold for High Wealth Individuals defined as persons in possession of net assets of the value of &euro;10 million and above.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>This is a simple amendment dealing with criteria to assess high net wealth individuals.  It does not call for additional taxation or anything like that, although we have dealt with matters like that in previous amendments.  Emerging from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was a reflection on the Irish threshold for high-worth individuals with assets of over &euro;50 million, indicating &quot;a high threshold compared to other jurisdictions&quot;.  We can look at international experience and the thresholds applied and see that is very clearly the case.  The threshold of &euro;50 million is high.  In Spain the threshold is &euro;10 million and in Britain it is &euro;11.4 million approximately, or &pound;10 million.  In Portugal it is &euro;25 million and in Australia it is the equivalent of &euro;18.5 million.  This amendment seeks to deal with a matter in which we seem to be out of kilter.  It is the definition of high net worth individuals as people with assets in excess of &euro;50 million.</p><p>I appreciate there has been restructuring with the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with large case divisions and high net worth individuals.  Perhaps it is something we will deal with on another day, particularly allocated resources to each division.  There may be a bit of an issue with regard to alignment.  If we brought down thresholds to be more in line with other jurisdictions, it would capture more individuals.  There is no common definition across different jurisdictions on assessment - it is up to each jurisdiction to determine a threshold - but our threshold, in the words of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is high compared with others.  That is not warranted.</p></speech>

As the Deputy mentioned, Revenue indicates that it currently has three units in its large cases division with responsibility for both the tax affairs of high-wealth individuals and for challenging tax avoidance schemes.</p><p>I am also advised that the Revenue's criterion for identifying high-wealth individuals is individuals with net assets of over &euro;50 million.  There is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of net worth on their returns of income.  Accordingly, Revenue does not have the data required to estimate the number of individuals with assets of more than &euro;10 million.  On foot of the recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, I understand the topic may now be discussed at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts with the Accounting Officer and Chairman of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as part of that committee's work programme.  For those reasons, I do not plan to accept the amendment.  The committee will be aware of how important it is to acknowledge the independence of Revenue in its dealing with the tax affairs of individuals and that this is critical for maintaining the integrity of our tax system.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know, landlords receive tax relief for management fees and service charges paid to the owner company, which is usually the residents' group or apartment blocks.  This relief, however, is paid whether or not the fees are paid.  That issue has been emerging recently.  Many managing companies that are residence owners are facing financial difficulty partly as a result of landlords not paying these fees.  Landlords are collecting rent and not paying the management fees.  Those not paying the management fees should not be able to claim the relief.  In my view, they should also have to register with the PRTB.  That is also how we could deal with the issue of compliance.  These conditions should be added to the relief.</p></speech>

To clarify, this is in the context of the local property tax, LPT.  It is not clear from the amendment but it is in the context that I am raising this issue.  Does the Minister believe there is any overlap between the management fees paid by apartment owners in respect of the complex in which they live on the one hand and on the other hand the local property tax that they pay to Revenue?  That is going towards the local authority for services to be provided in the local authority area.  The Minister is doing a review of the LPT and there will be an announcement in due course because of the impending re-evaluation in November 2019.  There has been a period of consultation, etc.  Does the Minister believe any recognition should be given, in the context of LPT, to those also paying significant management fees for the operation of their complex, including the maintenance of common areas and green areas within their developments?</p></speech>

Under section 97(2), however, this interest relief is not authorised unless the person claiming it can show that he or she has complied with part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to register residential tenancies with the now PRTB.  The purpose of this section is to encourage compliance with the PRTB rather than to deny the tax relief.</p> <p>  To that end, the return of income forms for individuals and companies, form 11 and form CT1, both include a tick box to confirm that the tenancy is registered with the PRTB.  If the box is ticked and in an examination of the return Revenue finds the tenancy has not been registered with the PRTB at the time of filling out the return then the interest deductibility is denied.</p><p>Landlords are required to register details of all their tenancies within one month of the commencement of those tenancies.  While new tenancies should be registered within one month of their commencement, provision is also made in the Residential Tenancies Act for late registration at double the normal registration fee.  An acknowledgement from the RTB confirming registration in the case of a late registration will be accepted by Revenue as evidence of compliance with Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  However, a person claiming an interest deduction on an annual tax return must be able to indicate compliance with the Part 7 requirements at the time of making the return.</p><p> If a tenancy is registered late, Revenue adopts the following administrative practice: &ldquo;Interest relief that has been denied for a particular chargeable period because a tenancy was not registered by the return filing date for that period can subsequently be restored if the landlord avails of the late registration facility, subject to the usual four year time limit on claims for repayment of tax.&rdquo;</p><p> Having regard to these points, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

What protections do we have?  The protections are really in regard to the management company.  These payments are not being made by some landlords whereas others are paying them.  This means there is an accrual of charges yet they are getting the benefit of interest deduction.</p></speech>

In 2017, Revenue compliance activity included a focus on the rental sector.  As set out in its annual report, there were 5,332 interventions in that sector in 2017, with a total yield of &euro;44.8 million.  I am advised by Revenue that compliance interventions and yield per intervention are accurately recorded electronically in each case.  However, it is impossible to extract the compliance yield arising from the restriction or the disallowance of specific expenses.</p> <p>  It appears from the information Revenue has shared with me that this is an issue it is aware of and it was prioritised for intervention last year, with the result that it raised just under &euro;45 million from compliance activity in the sector.  I take the Deputy's point.  Relief is claimed for an expense and the point he is making is that if the expense is not claimed, the relief should not be claimed either.</p></speech>

I will engage with the Revenue Commissioners to see if they would recommend any further changes in this regard.  On the basis of the information they have about the compliance activity carried out in the sector, the quantity of checks appears high, at over 5,000, and the total yield that has come out of that is just under &euro;45 million.  Therefore, it would appear their activity has been relatively successful.  Given the logic of the point the Deputy raises, I will engage with the Revenue Commissioners to see if there is anything they would want me to do in advance of Report Stage.  If there is, I signal to the committee now that it is something I can look at making a change to in the Finance Bill, if needed.</p></speech>

To quote from one of the documents, it is &quot;primarily for the purpose of reducing their exposure to income tax&quot;.  This allegation - I stress that it is an allegation - is included in the discussion document being considered by the PAC.  We had the chiefs of RT&Eacute; before the PAC earlier this year.  It has been claimed as late as last night that the use of personal service companies by top earners is entirely legitimate.  It is also common practice across the industry, which I do not dispute one bit.  I am not suggesting there is anything untoward here.  What we are talking about is whether the law should be changed in the future.</p><p>I have raised this on a number of occasions with the Minister, in particular as to whether his attention had been drawn to the work of the British tax authorities, who found against persons who worked for the BBC organisation and used contracting companies to avoid tax, and whether the Revenue Commissioners were investigating how this operates here.  It is provided for in Irish law.  The question is whether it is appropriate or fair, as I believe it is not.  A commitment was given to me at time, as follows:</p><blockquote>I am advised by Revenue that we have no comparable legislation in Ireland governing the taxation of individuals engaged through intermediary companies.  As a consequence, there is no basis for Revenue to seek to ignore contractual arrangements entered into by such a company and to apply the tax treatment that gave rise to the appeal.<br /><br />In relation to the question of an investigation or audit, I am further advised by Revenue that it cannot comment on matters relating to any specific identified taxpayer or narrowly defined group of taxpayers.  However, in the absence of legislation similar to that referred to above, there is no statutory basis for Revenue to take the approach that gave rise to the recent UK appeal.</blockquote> <p>The question is whether there should be a statutory approach and whether we should put something into the law that allows for this.  These types of contracting companies are similar or identical to the types operating in Britain, which has closed them down.  I argue through this amendment that we should look at this in a detailed way, given there could be unintended consequences.  I believe this should be examined by the Department and Revenue officials prior to the Finance Bill next year.</p></speech>

He will also be aware that this report was informed by a public consultation.</p> <p>  The report noted that the development of personal service companies and managed service companies created a triangular employment relationship where the services of a worker are secured through a third entity, thereby distancing the employer from direct engagement with the worker under either a contract of service or a contract for services.  This created complexities in establishing the rights and responsibilities of each of the parties with regard to tax, social insurance and employment rights.  I might add that such arrangements are not peculiar to the entertainment sector.</p> <p>  Some have argued that the avoidance of tax and social insurance obligations is the primary motivation for the use of personal service companies and managed service companies, and that workers are increasingly being directed by employers to supply their labour through these types of intermediaries.  Disguising employment in this manner also enables employers to avoid some employment law obligations and can undermine the employment rights of the workers concerned.</p> <p>  The report found that the majority of the loss to the Exchequer in these circumstances was in the form of PRSI revenue rather than tax and, as Minister for Finance, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that such structures could be put in place for these purposes.</p><p>However, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with their colleagues, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and other agencies, to deal with this issue.  I do not believe the production of a report so soon after the publication of the one I have described would be of benefit.  If the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection recommend the introduction of legislation to deal with a potential risk in regard to the laws on social insurance revenue, I will be happy to act on that recommendation.  To date, no such recommendation has been made.</p><p> The point made by the Deputy in regard to RT&Eacute; is a matter for that organisation.  I am aware that RT&Eacute; has carried out a review of this matter and it has acknowledged that as many as 157 media professionals may have been misclassified.  It has indicated it has new policy and guidelines in place and that it will commence a review of individual contracts, with a view to having this work completed by the end of this year.</p></speech>

Britain had an appeal mechanism to deal with this practice.  Individuals who were working for a broadcaster and claiming this company structure were not deemed to be employed directly by the company.  If memory serves me correctly, they successfully appealed it in 2007 and therefore the issue has been dealt with, by and large.  The problem here is that there is no such mechanism to appeal it.  As there is no statutory provision to prevent this practice, the Revenue Commissioners have no mechanism to appeal it.  The only way this can be ended is if we allow for what is a legitimate practice like this to become an illegitimate practice in the future.  </p><p>The <i>Irish Independent</i>reported on the discussion document of the Committee of Public Accounts, which includes a chapter on RT&Eacute; and draft conclusions and recommendations.  In regard to that document the PAC report states: &quot;On the basis of evidence presented to the committee, the creation of limited companies by RT&Eacute;'s' top earners is used primarily for the purpose of reducing their exposure to income tax, which comes at a cost to the Exchequer.&quot;  One of the draft recommendations is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform &quot;bring forward proposals to address this practice&quot;, with which I concur.  I am not sure those draft recommendations or that section of the PAC report will find its way into the final report.  One source is reported as saying that that wording will not appear in the final report.  However, it gives us a flavour of where the PAC is at on this issue.  This is an issue of tax fairness.  The practice is legitimate and people will obviously use legitimate means to reduce their tax liability if they have the wherewithal to do so.  This scheme is known to the Minister because I previously brought it to his attention.  It is also known to the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand that Revenue cannot address the matter and can only advise the Minister on what needs to be done.  I am disappointed that no action is being taken in yet another Finance Bill to address this practice.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they can examine and act on any relationship brought to their attention to establish whether there is a contract for service in place and if it is being used appropriately.</p> <p>  As I said, if the Revenue Commissioners advise me of a requirement for a change in law to deal with the evasion of PRSI obligations, I will act on that advice.

We have already dealt with mortgage interest relief for landlords.  Fine Gael, its Independent colleagues in government and Fianna F&aacute;il are supportive of an increase in mortgage interest relief.  It will not be lost on mortgage holders that this comes as a reduction in mortgage interest relief is being introduced next year for those who are in a position to avail of it.  The amendment asks that this relief be maintained at the current level, at a cost of &euro;46.5 million per annum.  While that is a sizeable amount, it also points to the benefit that a large number of people have been able to avail of.  It is not a perfect policy but it provides some relief and helps to reduce the high cost of living for many people.  </p><p>During our earlier meeting with the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, we discussed the high cost of interest rates in this State.  The current plan is to phase out mortgage interest relief over the next three years, which I do not support given the current environment.  The amendment asks that the Minister keep mortgage interest at the current rate until such time as mortgage interest rates are equivalent to the European average.</p></speech>

The relief has expired for mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and ceased for new borrowings from January 2013.  This mortgage interest relief is, therefore, only available on qualifying mortgage loans taken out between 2004 and 2012 and is being phased out for the remaining recipients on a tapered basis to alleviate the potential financial difficulties of the cliff that may arise if the relief was removed in a single year.</p> <p>  The rate in 2018 is 75% of the rates that applied in 2017, namely,  15%, 20%, 22.5%, 25% and 30%, with the application of these rates depending on an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  The rate of relief will be reduced to 50% of the 2017 relief in 2019, and 25% of the 2017 relief in 2020, as legislated for in last year&rsquo;s Finance Act.  In 2018, the estimated cost of mortgage interest relief is &euro;124 million, reducing to &euro;78 million in 2019.  If the 2018 rates and qualifying interest levels continued to apply from 2019, as the Deputy has suggested, the cost would be an additional &euro;46 million per annum.</p> <p>  There were 292,448 mortgage holders in receipt of this relief in 2015, including those who purchased at the peak of the property market and also those who bought during the subsequent trough.  There is, therefore, an equity issue around any further retention of the relief in the current form beyond 2021 as not all mortgage holders can avail of the relief.  The decision to abolish mortgage interest relief was prompted by the view that relief effectively becomes priced in to the purchase price of the property.  Research by the ESRI contends that demand side oriented tax incentives that target home buyers are likely to result in increased house prices, with a limited increase in supply and, thus, the home purchaser is unlikely to be a net beneficiary.</p><p>For these reasons, I am not in a position to commit further resources to continuing the relief beyond the current end date, let alone extend it in the way the Deputy has suggested.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We have seen a slight drop in the number of claims for this credit in the past year.  We can see from the latest data available that &euro;523 million of the amount of &euro;670 million claimed went to very large companies in 2016.  We have evidence from the reply given under a freedom of information request that there is concern that the scheme is being used to reduce tax liabilities through the inflation of expenditure on research and development.  The figures tell us that 78% of the cost of the credit was accounted for by large companies or companies in the large cases division.  Huge companies are soaking up the the cost of the credit and, potentially, there is concern that some of them are inflating their expenditure on research and development.  On the other hand, we have SMEs that do not bother availing of the credit, do not know about it or think it is not worth the hassle because of their experience or the risk in applying for same.  Therefore, we need to seriously consider providing this tax credit.  A substantial report on research and development was carried out two years.  Unfortunately, quite a number of its recommendations were never implemented.  They considered how we could make sure the spend on research and development was curtailed.  The report made some interesting proposals in that regard.  </p><p>Research and development are vital and play an important part in business and the economy.  They allow companies to be at the cutting edge.  Therefore, we need to promote research and development and encourage far more companies to become involved.  The problem is that only 22% of the cost of the tax relief is accounted for by small and medium-sized enterprises.  As many as 300 companies - the larger companies - account for 78% of the cost, while fewer than 1,200 account for the the remaining 22%.  I genuinely believe we must consider how SMEs are treated north of the Border.  I am not saying the situation there is perfect or that we should mirror the scheme in place, but there are people who work on both sides of the Border and make applications on behalf of businesses.  They can verify the differences for SMEs in the North and the South in terms of the challenges faced in the South.  As recommended by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC; the Irish SME Association, ISME, and others, there would be merit in considering the SME light research and development tax credit available in the North in terms of the protection provided and all of the anti-avoidance issues that arise.  We must consider introducing a separate rate in the South.  We have argued, for example, that the 25% rate should be reduced to 20% for non-SMEs but increased to 30% for small and medium-sized enterprises to encourage research and development.</p><p>Let us consider where we are in the economy and business and strip out multinationals which I acknowledge create employment and provide a tax base.  I will not go into all of the issues concerning some of them but will park them to one side, although I know that the Minister does not have the luxury of doing so.  The SME sector is not as profitable or productive as it should be.  There is a serious issue because the level of foreign direct investment mirrors something.  If it was stripped away and we just compared the SME sector with others, we could see we have an issue.  One of the ways by which we could invigorate the sector is by providing support for research and development.  That is why I think there would be merit in considering ways to encourage more businesses to avail of the research and development tax credit and thus participate in research and development.</p><p>There are two deterrents, the first of which is the bureaucracy involved.  The application process for the tax relief has been christened by the likes of IBEC as &quot;SME R&amp;amp;D light&quot;, which is what the tax relief has been called in other jurisdictions.  The second deterrent is the current rate.  Obviously, in increasing it to 30% a cost would be incurred by the Exchequer, which is why I suggest the rate for larger multinationals be reduced to 20%, which would still be generous.  Let us recall that &euro;523 million of the total cost of &euro;670 million was claimed by about 300 companies.  Unfortunately, I do not have figures in front of me.  The rest - about &euro;150 million - was claimed by 1,200 SMEs.  I suggest we use tax policy to encourage placing the focus on SMEs.  Perhaps there are better ways and solutions, but I offer my suggestion as a way to improve things as we cannot just kick on.  The cost of this tax credit is huge; &euro;500 million goes to multinationals.  I am not saying they do not engage in research and development because obviously they are, as the report has shown.  However, there are concerns within the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, or at least among certain people in the two organisations, that the spend on research and development has been inflated.  We need to encourage the sector - SMEs- that needs the biggest helping hand at this time.</p></speech>

Earlier in the year my Department published a paper, in conjunction with the OECD, in which we analysed productivity levels in the economy once we had stripped out the very large companies integrated into global supply chains.  The analysis showed that we had productivity levels that were lower than they should be for smaller companies.  The initiative announced by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the future work programme which will gradually replace the Action Plan for Jobs looks at the quality of work and productivity levels within all areas of the economy.  It is fair to acknowledge productivity levels as an issue.  In addition, when we talk about multinationals broadly and the changes that have happened within the country, one issue on which I think we do not place enough emphasis is the number of Irish companies that, with great success, diversified into overseas markets and managed to scale up very quickly when the domestic economy was going through a great difficulty.  I point to companies as Glanbia and Cement Roadstone Holdings as excellent examples.</p><p>On the specific amendment the Deputy has put to me, I will cut to the chase.  Like my Department, I am conscious of the need to evaluate regularly the research and development tax credit.  In line with my Department's tax expenditure guidelines, a full <i>ex post</i>cost benefit analysis and evaluation of the credit will take place next year.  While I cannot accept the amendment, we will substantively review the operation of the credit next year.  It will be fully in place in advance of the budget next year.</p></speech>

The report will examine the desirability of a vacant property tax and a land value tax among other proposals.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>My amendment relates to a vacant property tax.</p><p>This amendment calls for the preparation of a report on the introduction of measures to combat the hoarding of land needed for development and to examine the desirability of a vacant property tax and a land value tax, among other proposals.</p><p> The Government could move beyond incentives and bring in a tax on units that are unoccupied.  A tax on vacant property based on the value would encourage owners to put it to good productive use.  We can see that in the midst of a housing crisis in Vancouver, properties deemed empty are now subject to a tax of 1% of the value of the property of the 2018 assessed taxable value.  Most homes are not subject to the tax as it does not apply to principal residences or homes for at least six months of the year.  All home owners, however, are required to submit a declaration.</p><p> On the vacant residential land tax, almost 200 sites and properties, worth millions of euros, were identified as lying empty in Dublin city and county as per data from the authorities.  These vacant sites are worth more than &euro;400 million and have been identified in 114 locations across Dublin city and county, the vast majority of which, almost 90, are in the Dublin city area alone.  This has been recorded by the vacant sites register.</p><p> From 1 January a residential land tax was applied to homes in inner city Melbourne that were vacant for more than six months in the preceding calendar year.  A vacant residential land tax can be assessed by calendar year, from the start of January to the end of December.  The six months do not need to be continuous.</p><p> There is a need for such a measure in the light of where we are at this time with a significant housing crisis and all of the factors that lead to that.  Within the cost of construction, land value is one of the major issues which we need to deal with in a very robust way.  The measures which are outlined in my amendment No. 171 are to combat the issue of land hoarding.  There is an incentive for individuals to hoard land because the increase in the value of land makes it profitable for them to sit on land that should be released for development.  There is a genuine need for some type of taxation proposals that would encourage if not force these land hoarders to release this property onto the market, whereby there would be a negative economic impact on them if they were to continue to carry on the practice of hoarding.</p></speech>

The independent Indecon consultants report on the taxation of vacant residential property presents a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.  This assessment suggested that the vacancy rates in these areas is significantly lower than the national average and indeed has fallen in recent years.  The report also suggests that the vacancy rate is likely to continue to fall.  The report did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax at this time as it did not indicate that it would be an effective response to deal with housing shortages.  The report's view is that low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium-term vacancy, indicate that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply is limited and could indeed represent a distraction from the need to accelerate significantly the building of new social and affordable housing, and the facilitation of other housing supply.</p></speech>

The other report that is being called for in amendment No. 174 is a report on the ability of investors in real estate investment trusts, REITs, including pension and investment funds, to neutralise their tax liability in both income and gains from Irish property held by REITs.</p><p>The Irish tax code has created a very unlevel playing field for ordinary families and individuals who are trying to get onto the property ladder.  There is an incentive here where we allow for fund structures, in a very tax-efficient way, to buy up property.  We can see from all of the data published by the CSO that cash buyers, of which these fund structures make up the significant part, are competing in a very aggressive way with families, newly-weds and individuals who are trying to acquire their first house, especially here in Dublin city.  Figures show that close to 50% of sales are cash purchases at certain times.  There is almost &euro;17 billion of IREF assets in the State.  That is the quantum that we are told in the tax strategy papers.  We know that the average yield in rent in the State is 7.5%.  How did they pay only &euro;9 million in tax on more than &euro;1 billion of income?  I have discussed this with the Minister before.  The accounts of these funds are available.  One can see the actual tax that is being paid because of the tax efficient ways in which they do not have to pay it.  It is appalling.  The tax rate of some of these funds is 1.8%.  This is the kind of structure that we have put in place.</p><p>I can remember when some of these structures came in.  It was a time when there was a very dampened property market.  That is not where we are at this time.  I recall the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, saying that we needed to get a floor and to get people in etc.  Things have moved on.  There needs to be an assessment done on the impact that these structures are having on property prices because they are able to push up prices because they have the availability of funds to set market prices.</p><p>There is an issue as to the supply of residential properties because these funds are able to compete with individuals.  It is ridiculous.  Some of these funds are landlords.  Some of these tax-efficient funds are charging outrageous rents which are among the highest in our capital and they then pay 1.8% in tax on their income.  There has been some work done in this area but it is time to go back and look at it all again because they are clearly not paying a reasonable amount of tax.  These amendments are sensible.  They are asking the Minister to look at these structures and to look at how they are impacting on property prices, at the supply of residential properties in the State, at the structures themselves, and at how they are allowing for a very small effective rate of tax to be paid on income.</p></speech>

I agreed on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year to conduct a report on the impact that REITs and IREFs are having on the residential property market.  The limited availability of data from the Revenue Commissioners on IREF returns inhibited the ability to undertake the report this year.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue that as all Irish real estate funds, IREFs, must file accounts with Revenue by 30 January 2019 we will have enough data available at the end of the first quarter of that year to provide a complete picture of the activities of these funds in the Irish market.  I want to inform the committee, as I indicated earlier, that work has already started on this report.  In particular we are looking at the activities of these funds within our larger cities regarding different forms of property.  I want to gather more data on that, then integrate that data into the tax information that would be available at an aggregate level to me at the end of the first quarter of next year.

This work is on-going and is a matter I want to look at personally and to understand any effect it may be having.  One of the issues I have been looking at is that a large number of these funds act as both buyers and sellers of property.  I need to better understand the net effect of their activity on different forms of property.  It is my intention that, if I allow for this to be done as part of the tax strategy group, at that point I will have a number of years worth of robust information on the impact they are having on the property market.</p> <p>  The point raised by the Deputy on tax brings me back to the point I made earlier to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  It is difficult for me to have a counter-factual against which I can evaluate the operation of these funds from a taxation point of view.  At an aggregate level I want to see if any conclusions can be drawn from the level of tax and from the impact of tax policy on the operation of these funds.

I heard different views as to what can be done.  It is wisest for me to say at this point that I am acutely aware of differing issues that can contribute to trends in our property market that might be different to the last property cycle we went through.  I am aware of the scale of operation that is under way from some of these funds.  I believe the scale of operation is lower than has been attributed to date, and that is why I want to ascertain the facts.  We will be looking at the role the funds play in the property market.  I am not in a position to tell the committee whether it will deal with effective tax rates for those funds.  That can be worked out by looking at their accounts.  On the other hand, the funds create returns and tax can and is paid on them, depending on who is receiving that return and where they are located.  I want to try to get the most comprehensive analysis of this issue possible in order to see if further policy action is required.  It is helpful that I can indicate that publicly this evening.</p></speech>

I brought this point up in the Chamber last year.  I have the accounts here for the different REITs; they are all published.  We went through this with accountants.  The funds are paying an effective tax rate of 1.8% because of the structure they are operating under.  It is not acceptable, and it is not good that we have created a tax efficient structure that is allowed to compete with Tom and Mary, who are trying to set out on their own life, trying to buy a house in Dublin, queueing up to view houses, but a structure can swoop in and outbid them because it can rent it out and will only be paying an effective tax rate of 1.8% because of the structure of the company.  That is not right.  Others have called for a complete ban on these structures in the market at this point in time.</p> <p>  I am glad that the Minister is going to be looking at the property prices and the supply of residential properties in the State, but a lot of damage has been done and a lot more can be done between now and the end of the year in terms of these funds in competing with a very scarce amount of properties out there.  One of these funds is the biggest landlord in the State and also charges the highest rents in the State.</p></speech>

However, I would like to hear the view of the Minister on amendment No. 177 which seeks a report setting out the possibilities of an ambitious tax or set of taxes on the use of plastics to reduce the overall level of plastics used in our economy and to incentivise widespread re-use and recycling of plastics.  We know that taxing plastics can have a big effect in reducing the overall level of plastic use in the economy, incentivising widespread use of recycling and re-use.  Such taxes can be designed in a way that can specifically aim to curb the production of virgin plastics and incentivise recycling plastics and renewables.  This is something that should be considered.  The amendment here is asking for consideration of this suggestion and a report.</p><p>I am not asking for a commitment to any such tax, but I think there is merit in considering this in advance of next year's Finance Bill.</p></speech>

Ireland has supported the ambition of the recent EU proposal on the reduction of the impact of plastic on the environment.  The Council of the European Union recently agreed a text to bring to negotiations with the European Commission and the European Parliament.  It is only by acting collectively and collaboratively with all member states that we will achieve the best outcome in this area.  The Commission has cautioned that acting individually may compromise the effect of the proposal currently being negotiated by member states.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding this, actions taken by the Government to date to address the issue of plastic waste include the use of an extended producer responsibility model to deal with waste packaging, the funding of education and awareness campaigns and the provision of &euro;2 million of annual funding to the Environmental Protection Agency's national waste prevention programme.  Ireland is committed to the reduction of the impact of plastic waste on the environment and to encouraging increased reuse and recycling of materials to limit such waste.  We will continue to actively engage with the EU Commission on this matter.  Tax can be a blunt instrument in bringing about changes in behaviour and it is not always possible to target tax measures accurately, leading to dead weight in certain circumstances.  While it has been possible to successfully implement very targeted measures such as the plastic bag levy, wider-reaching initiatives can give rise to significant collection and enforcement concerns.  Sometimes regulation can provide a more direct approach but as I have said, my preference is to continue to engage collaboratively at EU level.</p></speech>

I raised it last year so I do not intend to labour the point.  For a period of almost 20 years up to 2016, exit tax and deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rates were aligned.  They were identical throughout that period.  Since 2016 there has been a divergence, as the Minister will know.  He has programmed in a 33% reduction in DIRT by 2020, but the exit tax remains at 41%.  Within a couple of years the difference in rates will be 8%.  As the Minister knows, the exit tax applies to certain investment and savings products, generally long-term investment products.  His answer last year was along the lines that it came down to the fiscal implications of moving the exit tax rate in line with DIRT.  There is a significant difference already and it is going to grow to 8% by 2020.  I am seeking to establish what the policy is at this point.  Is it now policy that there will continue to be a difference of that order between the exit tax and DIRT rates?</p></speech>

The reason is exactly the same as the one I gave Deputy Michael McGrath last year.  Every 1% reduction to the rate of life assurance exit tax will cost approximately &euro;4.7 million.  Therefore, reducing the latter to align it with DIRT rates from 2019 would result in a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;28 million in the coming year when it would be reduced to 35%, and &euro;38 million in 2020 to further reduce it to 33%.  While I am aware of the policy value in doing this, in the context of other choices I had to make I was not in a position to do it this year.  I also considered removing the 1% life assurance premium.  However, the cost of removing it entirely was &euro;18 million, while reducing it to 0.5% would cost &euro;9 million.  For those reasons, it was not a decision that I was in a position to make in this year's budget.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have any thoughts on the fact that the scale of the difference will encourage savers to put their money in a certain direction, that is, into products that are subject to the DIRT rate as opposed to the exit tax rate?  Very often the products subject to the exit rate of tax offer higher returns.  They are generally longer-term products.  As we know, deposit rates in retail banks are close to zero at the moment.  I know it is because of money that the Minister cannot align them, but it has a consequence in that it gives people a financial incentive to put their money into one form of savings product rather than another.</p></speech>

This is in response to the number of times this issue has been raised, particularly by Deputy Michael McGrath.  We hope to be in a position to publish the report in a few weeks.  It does not take away from the cost issues I have raised, but section 3 of the report in particular looks at comparisons between products that are subject to DIRT and life assurance exit tax.  We then draw some conclusions in that regard.  It is currently in draft form and I hope to be in a position to sign it off.  I am sure I will be able to do it quickly and the Department will publish it in a few weeks, or even sooner, and share it with the committee.</p></speech>

I understand that Revenue issued an e-brief in May declaring that the requirement to withhold tax of 20% of interest applied to all peer-to-peer loans.  As the Minister will appreciate, peer-to-peer lending provides vital access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and the implementation of this brief could have a very significant impact.  My understanding is that a loan provided through peer-to-peer lending has an average of 245 lenders.  Each SME under the Revenue's brief would have to manually fill in 245 R185 forms each year of the loan.  We are not talking about rates, but about the method of tax collection.  Given that this is an important source of funding for SMEs and that it is a form of non-bank funding, which is to be encouraged, I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on it.</p></speech>

I understand that this is an important source of investment and credit for SMEs and I think it is likely to grow in the near future.  In my budget day speech I said that I am willing to look at how we can tax this sector and how this could be done in a way that is effective and deals with issues that Michael Deputy McGrath and representatives of the sector have raised.  I want to do this in parallel with the regulation of crowdfunding within Ireland, in particular peer-to-peer lending.  As we stand, peer-to-peer lending is unregulated in Ireland.  I will look at this in a phased way.  I will look at how we can regulate the sector and consider any changes that need to be made.</p><p>As we look at how the sector can be regulated as opposed to being better regulated, I am open to looking at whether an appropriate tax policy needs to be put in place.</p></speech>

I have an ambition to do this in advance of next year's finance Bill.

If the Minister is talking about that number of forms having to be filled up, it is unworkable given the nature of these loans under peer to peer lending.  The present position is that withholding tax must be applied and these forms must be completed so-----</p></speech>

The sector is eager to see this withholding tax regime change and therefore I hope that as the sector begins to get a sense of how we believe it can be better regulated that the sector's views on withholding tax will colour its enthusiasm for participating in how the sector can be regulated.</p></speech>

I refer to its relationship with a pension adjustment order which is common in legal separations and divorces.</p><p>As the Minister is aware, as part of many divorce settlements which become court orders, a pension adjustment order is made which transfers the pension benefits from one of the ex-spouses to the other.  However, the party who originally earned the pension is obliged to include that pension amount for the purposes of calculating their standard fund threshold even though they would no longer be the beneficiary of that pension and the person who is benefiting from the pension adjustment order does not have the value of that pension count towards their standard fund threshold.  It only counts once but it is fully counted in respect of the person who, for example, paid into that pension and accumulated that pension pot and as a result of the breakdown of the relationship, the settlement that has been agreed and this pension adjustment order being made, their standard fund threshold is effectively reduced.</p><p>It is a quirky one but it can have serious implications for those caught up in it.  I went through one particular example in detail and I could see that the consequences of it were pretty significant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110800002#JJJJ00900"><p>They are.  I advise the Deputy that Revenue has published a considerable amount of information and detailed guidance about the standard fund threshold regime.  Therefore, there is no requirement for an additional report as has been suggested and the policy position on the matter is well settled.</p> <p>  The State offers extremely broad pension relief to encourage individuals to save to ensure they will have sufficient income for use in their retirement.  The standard fund threshold operates to cap the amount of tax relief for pension savings that are utilised by high earners.  In this way it targets excessive pension accrual and the overfunding of supplementary pension provisions on values over &euro;2 million.  </p> <p>  For example, in the event that a married couple gets divorced, there may be a court ordered legal division of their assets.  In the case of a pension, there could be a pension adjustment order that sets out the terms of how the pension benefits are to be apportioned between the now divorced individuals.  When applying the standard fund threshold to determine whether a chargeable excess exists on the pension fund, in accordance with section 7870 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the pension fund is treated as a single asset and the pension adjustment order is to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether the standard fund threshold has been exceeded.  The order is, however, taken into account when determining the portion of any chargeable excess that is payable by each spouse.</p> <p>  To give the full picture of the types of relief beyond the standard fund threshold, I also note that where married couples divorce or separate and civil partners separate, each former spouse or civil partner may be entitled to a separate and distinct tax free lump sum of up to &euro;200,000 in respect of a lump sum which is the subject of a pension adjustment order, something that may not necessarily be available to a married couple or civil partners.  The specific disregard of the pension adjustment order is a justified anti avoidance measure that is designed to prevent an individual whose pension is subject to such an order from availing of further tax relief at significant additional cost to the Exchequer.  It has never been the case that a divorce or separation would lead to each former spouse or civil partner getting a standard fund threshold in cases where there was previously only one.</p> <p>  This would lead to a significant cost that would benefit a very small number of individuals who, in the eyes of many, would be seen as being wealthy.  The funding for and accrual of pension benefits for the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements are unaffected by the standard fund threshold scheme.  Given that we need to concentrate our resources to deal with many of the issues that will arise from the road map of pension reform, that is where we should put the resources of the State as opposed to dealing with this matter.</p> <p>  For that reason I do not accept the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

Is the Minister saying that we cannot then calculate what the related standard fund threshold amount is and allocate that to one ex-spouse while the other ex-spouse keeps the balance?  Is the Minister saying that cannot be done and setting out the policy grounds from his perspective as to why that would not be desirable?</p></speech>

We are saying that the standard fund threshold is applied to the fund itself rather than the income so that is why there is only one of them.  That is the reason we cannot divide it but I have been informed that it could lead to a situation where if we did divide them, people would be better off after the separation or divorce than when they were married.</p></speech>

There is only one of them and it is applied to the fund rather than the income.  If we came to a point where there were two different standard fund thresholds it could create perverse incentives, although I take the Deputy's point that it is unlikely to change people's behaviour and create a reason why a marriage or relationship would break down.</p> <p>  On the grounds of equity and given the other issues that we will have to deal with in our pension code, it is only fair that we leave this policy unchanged.</p></speech>

These have been welcomed, especially income averaging and step-out measures and so on.  Further proposals have been made, as the Minister is aware, by farm organisations.  These include different strands of suggestions around a farm management deposit scheme to address volatility.  We have seen in recent years how incomes can be directly affected by weather events, commodity prices and so on.  Did the Minister give serious consideration to those proposals?  Why has he decided not to make further moves in this area?</p></speech>

The proposed amendment is technical in nature and is intended to clarify that pension payments to be made to former civil servants under that Act are to be made by the Minister for Finance rather than the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I fully recognise that farm income volatility is a prevalent feature of the agricultural sector.  In response, targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging scheme.  The scheme provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  Initially, farm averaging was only available over three years.  Then, in the Finance Act 2014, the time was extended to five years to assist in ameliorating volatility.  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility my Department has sought to enhance and introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to recognise the reality of income volatility in the farming sector and to maximise the number of farmers who wish to level out volatile income through the averaging system.  Different measures have been put in place.  In the Finance Act 2014, the Finance Act 2016 and in this Bill I have made further changes relating to income averaging.</p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department conducted an agri-taxation review update.  The review analysed the progress made in implementing the 25 recommendations in the 2014 agri-taxation review.</p> <p>  As there is already a targeted tool available to farmers in the form of income averaging, I decided not to go down the farm deposit route.  As already mentioned, I have sought to further enhance the existing targeted income volatility support this year by opening up income averaging to all farmers.  On the basis that a targeted scheme is in place, I consider that I have already conducted a review of agricultural taxes.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  However, I will keep this matter under review.</p></speech>

The Minister has made some moves on the options set out.  I realise these were not recommendations but they were options and they were costed.  It is important and timely, given the housing crisis, for the Minister to clarify the intention with regard to the remaining options that have not been implemented.</p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party welcomes the acceleration of mortgage interest deductibility for landlords.  During our discussions with the Fine Gael Party in advance of the budget, we discussed other options, in particular, encouraging longer-term tenancies.  This is a real structural issue in the Irish rental market.  Tenancies are too short-term in nature.  We need to get to a point where people have far longer security of tenure.  This could include rental agreements for ten, 15 or 20 year periods.  We need to recognise and accommodate this in our taxation system.</p><p>The other issue we discussed was the possibility of incentivising the purchase of a property with a tenant <i>in situ</i>.  In the current market, where an owner is selling a property with a tenant, the tenant is often served with notice because the prospective purchaser wants vacant possession, even if the prospective purchaser intends to let out the property again.  There is also an issue with regard to incentivising the purchase of properties where transactions are going to happen anyway.  In certain cases it may be beneficial to incentivise a purchase where a tenant remains <i>in situ</i>so that the tenant avoids the disruption of having to leave a property because the home is being sold, perhaps even to another investor.  Not all these options were in the initial report but I believe they should be considered.  The Minister indicated to us that he would consider further options in the context of the Finance Bill.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath and his party called for these options to be implemented as part of the budget.  As the Deputy is aware, for reasons primarily relating to cost I was not in a position to put in place the two additional measures outlined.  I continue to have concerns regarding some perverse incentives that might have been created, in particular in respect of long-term leases and possible unintended consequences.</p> <p>  As Deputy McGrath will know from some of the engagement we have had, the issue that has emerged is that the purchase of a rental unit with a tenant would likely cover the majority of purchases of rental accommodation.  The costs of some of these proposals would be significant.  For this reason, I was not in a position to proceed with the options.  What I will do in the context of next year's budget and our continued efforts to look at how we can improve our rental market is continue to keep this matter under review.  For reasons of cost, I was not in a position to undertake the two additional measures specified by Deputy McGrath.  I will examine the matter during the coming year.</p></speech>

Does he believe it is good for our rental market to provide longer-term certainty to tenants?  Would this help to get away from the current cycle whereby people are being served with a termination notice and have to try to find alternative accommodation in the market at a time of terrible crisis?  Does the Minister believe we need a structural shift and that the taxation system has a role to play in that regard?</p></speech>

However, I need to be careful not to put in place measures that absorb large amounts of resources.  For example, the proposal to grant tax relief to any long-term leases within the State has the potential, in the most extreme scenario, to provide that tax relief would be available to a large number of rental agreements throughout the rental market.  I have to avoid that.</p> <p>  Deputy McGrath asked specifically whether I believe tax policy has a role to play.  The short answer is "Yes".  As Minister for Finance, I have made several decisions reflecting that.</p></speech>

I attended the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection today and someone was there from the Department, speaking about this issue.  What she said indicated that the Government has its head in the sand on the issue of bogus self-employment.  The main line the Department had was that there was an issue but it was not as much of an issue as was anecdotally indicated, and that the Department does not keep records of bogus self-employment.  It does thousands of inspections a year but does not keep records at the end of the process.  It is not a serious approach to this issue.</p><p>Approximately 12% of workers in this State are self-employed without employees.  It does not mean they are all bogus self-employed but it certainly opens up the possibility that some of them, potentially quite a number, are.  The evidence from trade unions and other sources indicates that there are areas of the labour market where there is extensive bogus self-employment, in construction, delivery, courier companies etc.</p><p>Some of that is not really the business of the Minister's Department but it relates to his Department and Revenue with regard to the question of the loss of income to the State.  There is a substantial saving for employers who use bogus self-employment, in the region of 30%, as a result of not paying PRSI etc.  That saving for them is a loss to the State.  Different figures have been produced about how much there is.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has a figure based on the construction industry of &euro;80 million a year or &euro;600 million since this became very widespread in the construction industry.  I have heard bigger figures than that but in any case there seems to be a significant issue here.  The State is losing out on at least some money, arguably quite a substantial amount, and it also has a negative impact on the quality and decency of employment because people who are working in these conditions end up having worse terms and conditions and fewer rights.  That is the idea behind a report on the scale of it.</p></speech>

I spoke on this in a related section earlier today.  I do not propose to accept the amendment mainly because my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection published a report on this a number of months ago.  We have already done it.  I know there are differing views on the conclusions that we reached and the data in them but such a report was done.  As the Deputy has said, this becomes an issue for my Department if any revenue is forgone, particularly PRSI revenue.</p> <p>  As I said in response to Deputy Pearse Doherty this afternoon, if the Revenue Commissioners informed me that they believed that any legal changes were needed to strengthen their compliance activity, I would certainly do it.  As I indicated to the Deputy in debates in the D&aacute;il Chamber, the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection take part in compliance activity relating to this.  In 2016 alone, they conducted nearly 11,699 interviews on this area which resulted in the reclassification of a number of subcontractors as employees and in 848 individuals registering as PAYE employees.  We published a report on the area.  I believe a large amount of compliance activity is already taking place.  If the Revenue Commissioners or Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection were to advise me that further legal change is needed, I will make it.</p></speech>

Its conclusion states these data indicate that the potential loss to the Exchequer for a person engaged in work at a rate equivalent to the average industrial wage of &euro;37,500 amounts to &euro;5,000 per annum under self-employment, rising to &euro;8,000 per annum at a payment level of &euro;60,000, and that these losses are in the range of 30% to 45% of social insurance contributions.  The report provides that information on an individual level.  Aggregating that information to a total level is where the difficulty is.</p> <p>  If the Department was aware of this as an issue through its compliance efforts, it would intervene, thereby reducing the loss to the Exchequer.  The view of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is that this issue is not occurring on the scale that I think the Deputy believes it is.  The report goes on to try to estimate the number of people who may be involved in intermediary arrangements.</p><p>The report reads:</p><blockquote>Estimates by Revenue suggest that the number of people employed under PSC and MSC arrangements is of the order of 15,000, with average annual receipts per contractor of &euro;60,000.  If the relationship between the end user and say 50% of the individuals involved is effectively in the nature of a contract of service, and if the PAYE system was applied by the end user, the estimated gain to the Exchequer would be of the order of &euro;60 million per annum.  If the figure was 25%, the estimated gain to the Exchequer would be of the order of &euro;30 million per annum.</blockquote><p>These are a range of outcomes that depend on a level of activity.  It is the Department's view that the level of non-compliance is significantly lower than the Deputy believes it to be.</p></speech>

That is just maths, not a report.  We are supposed to have a report to find out what the problems are.  The Minister does not have an estimate of how much money is lost by the State.  He is only able to tell me that if it is this, then it is this.  That is fine, but it is not much of an answer.  It is illustrative of the fact that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not keeping records of bogus self-employment.</p> <p>  The committee might address this issue in future.  If the gain was &euro;60 million per annum, which is close to ICTU's figure, then it would be a substantial amount in terms of what could be done with that money.</p></speech>

That said, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection is examining this matter.  It held its first hearing on the issue today.  If it is aware of different data that the Department has not been able to establish, then I hope that it will provide for a way in which that can be done.</p></speech>

and<br /><br />(IV) alternatives to the termination of pregnancy;</blockquote>(ii) the probable gestational age of the foetus at the time the termination of pregnancy is to be performed; and<br /><br />(iii)the probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the foetus at the time the abortion is to be performed.</blockquote>(b) a suitably qualified person has informed the woman, orally and in person, of:<blockquote>(i) the supports and benefits available for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care;<br /><br />(ii) the fact that the father of the foetus is legally liable to assist in the support of the child, even in instances where he has offered to pay for the termination of pregnancy.</blockquote></blockquote>(3) Where it is intended to perform a termination of pregnancy on foetus who is twenty weeks&rsquo; gestation or more, the health care professional intending to perform the termination of pregnancy or a qualified person assisting the health care professional shall, orally and in person, offer information on foetal pain to the pregnant woman.<br /><br />(4) The information offered in accordance with subsection (3) shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:<blockquote>(a) that, by twenty  weeks, the foetus possesses all anatomical links in his or her nervous system (including spinal cord, nerve tracts, thalamus, and cortex) that are necessary in order to feel pain;<br /><br />(b) that a foetus who is twenty weeks&rsquo; gestation or more is fully capable of experiencing pain;<br /><br />(c) the steps in the termination of pregnancy procedure intended  to be performed and at which steps in the termination of pregnancy procedure the foetus is capable of feeling pain;<br /><br />(d) that maternal anesthesia typically offers little pain prevention for the foetus; and<br /><br />(e) that an anesthetic or analgesic is available in order to minimise and/or alleviate pain to the foetus.</blockquote>(5) Where it is intended that a termination of pregnancy be performed using abortion-inducing drugs, the health care professional who supplies the drugs to the woman intending to have the termination of pregnancy shall, orally and in person, inform the woman of the following:<blockquote>(a) that it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion-inducing drugs should she change her mind, but that time is of the essence; and<br /><br />(b) that information on and assistance with reversing the effects of abortion-inducing drugs is available in the  printed materials and DVD offered to her.</blockquote>(6) For the purposes of this section, the phrase &ldquo;abortion-inducing drugs&rdquo; means a medicine, drug, or any other substance prescribed or dispensed with the intent of terminating the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman, with knowledge that the termination will with reasonable likelihood end the life of the foetus, other than drugs that may cause such a termination, but which are prescribed for other medical indication.<br /><br />(7) The Health Service Executive shall cause to be published printed materials and an informational DVD and shall develop and maintain a secure internet website, which may be part of an existing website, to provide the information required by and described in this section.<br /><br />(8) No information regarding persons using the website referred to in <i>subsection (7)</i>shall be collected or maintained.<br /><br />(9) The Health Service Executive shall monitor the website referred to in <i>subsection (7)</i>on a weekly basis to prevent and correct tampering.<br /><br />(10) The materials referred to in <i>subsection (7)</i>shall include:<blockquote>(a) information to  a woman contemplating abortion of public and private agencies and services available to assist a woman through pregnancy, upon childbirth, and while her child is dependent including, but not limited to, adoption agencies;<br /><br />(b) information as to available medical assistance, supports and benefits for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care;<br /><br />(c) information on the support obligations of the father of a child who is born.</blockquote>(11) The materials referred to in <i>subsection (7)</i>shall also include the following statement:<blockquote>There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you to carry your child to term, and to assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or to place her or him for adoption. The law requires that your health care professional give you the opportunity to call agencies like these before you undergo an abortion.</blockquote>(12) Nothing in this Act shall operate to create an entitlement by a pregnant woman under the age of eighteen years to consent to medical treatment.<br /><br />(13) A medical practitioner who carries out a termination of pregnancy in accordance with <i>section 11 </i>shall certify in writing in addition to the matters referred to in <i>section 11(1)</i>:<blockquote>(a) the nature of the medical emergency; and<br /><br />(b) in cases where the voluntary and informed consent of the woman concerned was not obtained, the reason for its not having been obtained.</blockquote>(14) The failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall provide the basis for:<blockquote>(a) a civil action for damages (including aggravated and exemplary damages) by the woman concerned for breach of statutory duty;<br /><br />(b) professional disciplinary action against the health professional concerned.</blockquote>(15) In any matter referred to in<i>subsection (14)</i>the court shall, upon application by the woman concerned or of its own motion, allow a woman to proceed using solely her initials or a pseudonym and may make such other protective orders as it considers necessary and appropriate to preserve the privacy of the woman concerned.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>I made the point yesterday that information was key in any decision a person made and that the more accurate the information provided, the better for the individual in making the decision.  I also made the point that I opposed the situation in bygone times where information on abortion was legally withheld from women.</p><p>I thought it should never have been the case.  Everyone should have full information when making a decision, and that information should be medically accurate.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  It seeks to ensure there is informed consent.  I have had experience of people who have had abortions and who have said to me that there was information they wished they had at the time which would have helped them in making those decisions, which is not to say they would have made different decisions, but it would have improved their ability to make the decisions.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  The amendment takes into consideration the fact that, because there is an element within the Bill that allows for emergency abortions and other provisions that allow for elective abortions, such consent and information can obviously be impossible to deliver in cases of emergency, such as a risk to life or a serious risk to health.</p><p> I am not a big fan of the term "cooling-off period", but it is interesting that the Minister mentioned it yesterday and said it was a disgusting term to use.  "Cooling-off period" are actually the words the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, used in the campaign, and I do not think Deputy Coveney is disgusting when he-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste mentioned at the time that there would be, as he said, a cooling-off period in order that people could have counselling and full information provided to them to be able to make informed decisions.  I do not fully see where this counselling or full information is provided for within the Bill.  If it is the case that it is not in the Bill, the commitment the T&aacute;naiste gave was obviously not real and is missing.</p> <p>  Again, this is a pro-choice amendment because a people can decline to have the information given to them if they so wish.  They can choose whether to have the information provided to them.  Again, the amendment does not restrict access in any way.  That is the important point.  It is not in any way against the spirit of the heads of the Bill that were provided.  In fact, it is a codification of the commitments that senior Ministers and the T&aacute;naiste gave during the referendum campaign.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#D00600"><p>I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I have great difficulty with this amendment for quite a few reasons.  The first and the broad reason relates to our good discussion yesterday, which was of considerable length, about the issues of consent and of clinicians fulfilling their duties under the Medical Council guidelines.  I struggle to believe that Doctor, or rather Deputy, T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - a Freudian slip - would believe that a doctor would not, before carrying out any procedure, discuss it with the woman, seek her consent and make her aware of her options.  In the proposed subsection (2) of his amendment there is the idea that a doctor must give medically accurate information to a woman and describe the treatment and the medical risks.  This is what happens today in our health service.  We do not feel the need to codify this for any other procedure because this is what doctors do.  There is a long-established principle of informed consent whereby doctors set out the facts for Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n or me or a woman when we go to a doctor.  The doctor then ensures that the woman is aware of any relevant information and has consented.  We had quite a lengthy discussion about this, and I read to the committee from the Medical Council guidelines yesterday regarding the principle of consent.  That is the first issue I would raise.</p><p>The second issue is that the amendment seeks to change the principle of consent because it specifically seeks to change the age of consent to 18, whereas the medical age of consent in this country is 16.  This is another change, and it is quite a significant one, but it was not mentioned in the Deputy's introduction to the amendment.  It is a substantive amendment in this regard.</p><p>One of the lines in the amendment that greatly worries me is the proposed subsection (2)(b)(ii), which states:</p><blockquote>(b) a suitably qualified person has informed the woman, orally and in person, of:...<br /><br />(ii) the fact that the father of the foetus is legally liable to assist in the support of the child, even in instances where he has offered to pay for the termination of pregnancy.</blockquote> <p>I am genuinely a little confused about this because the statistics collected by the UK Department of Health show that the majority of Irish women who access termination in Britain are in relationships, that is, they are married or have partners.  This provision seems to suggest or imply something, and while I am not going to use some of the language I think is behind it, it seems to imply that it is only a certain type of woman who seeks a termination.  The reference to the father being liable to support the child's upbringing is quite peculiar.  It is also important to note that in certain crisis pregnancy circumstances in which a woman seeks a termination there will be victims of rape and incest and issues of sexual assault.  The amendment runs the risk of being quite traumatising in this regard.</p><p>I do not wish to be flippant about a serious matter, but the idea that the health service is going to start producing DVDs, handing them out to women before they access terminations and saying, &quot;Go home there now and stick that on and have a look at it,&quot; is really offensive but also entirely unnecessary.  Women are intelligent human beings who will have researched the issue, consulted their doctors and made informed decisions.  The legislation is already quite prescriptive, and in the eyes of some people too prescriptive, in how this deliberative process will be followed.  The idea that a DVD would have to be made available to women seeking terminations is wholly unnecessary, to put it mildly.</p><p>Similarly, as for the issue of a website being available, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will know, the HSE already runs a number of websites concerning sexual health and well-being.  There is also Positive Options and the like.  Since, thankfully, it will soon be legal in Ireland to make this information available because we repealed the eighth amendment, information about the options - all of them - available to women will now be made available.  Legally, we could not make this information available previously.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputy said he did not agree with that position.  We will now make that information available.</p><p>The Deputy referred to counsellors.  I do not think this amendment relates substantively to the issue of counselling but, to be clear about the Government and the Oireachtas fulfilling its commitment, counselling is already available through the HSE's crisis pregnancy agency at locations throughout the country.  Doctors and doctors' practices already know, as I am sure Deputy Dr. Harty will be aware, through their engagement with the HSE, how to access crisis pregnancy counselling.  We will significantly further increase this provision and invest in it.  We are providing a 24-7 helpline that will be operated by healthcare professionals - nurses, doctors and counsellors.  We will also regulate counsellors and psychotherapists so they are real counsellors and psychotherapists and not people pushing agendas that are anti-woman, anti-choice and anti-best medical evidence.  I hope everyone in this House will support me in this regard.</p><p>To return to this amendment, and as I said yesterday on other amendments, the issue of consent is addressed in section 22.  I know that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I have different views on this, which in fairness the Deputy acknowledges, and he outlined his view yesterday.  Termination of pregnancy should be a part of the public health service like other health services.  Therefore, I do not see any reason to differentiate the issue of consent in this legislation relative to any other procedure provided as part of the public health service.  The Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners of the Medical Council 2016, a document I have used and on which I have relied quite a lot in recent days, provides thorough information on the appropriate process to be followed to obtain valid, informed consent for medical procedures.  The HSE has also published a national consent policy which includes detailed information as to what constitutes valid and genuine consent and how to obtain it.  We had a very good conversation yesterday about the issues of consent, parental notification, what one should do in difficult and horrific situations in which something very troubling, for example, a woman having been abused or a child - a girl - having been sexually assaulted and the like, is brought to the attention of a doctor.  Our Chairman, with the benefit of being a doctor, outlined to us the obligations a doctor would have in such a situation, which entirely tallies with what the Medical Council guidelines state.</p><p>I am aware that there is sometimes a case to be made for special provision to be made in respect of consent to a termination of pregnancy in the case of an adolescent.  This is the case the Deputy has been making in recent days.</p><p>I am of the view that issues around consent arise across medical practice and are not limited to this particular issue.  As I said yesterday, one could argue that many of these issues also arise in contraception, gender realignment and cosmetic surgery, but we have not changed the laws or codified it in any other way.  The issue of consent is dealt with adequately and comprehensively in section 22.  Some of these things, intentionally or otherwise, would be viewed as extraordinarily offensive by women who have accessed termination.  The idea that women would have to watch a DVD or that someone would need to tell them about the legal requirements for the father of that foetus or baby and explain to them what is going on in their own body, health and well-being nearly seems condescending.  It is back to trusting doctors and trusting women and I am satisfied to do both and that the legislation deals adequately with the issue of consent.</p></speech>

I think I have the floor.  Part 4 says that consent to a termination of pregnancy is voluntary and informed only and if alternatives to the termination of pregnancy have been advised.  There is only one alternative to the termination of a pregnancy and that is the continuation of a pregnancy.  I do not know why that is there.  I had a read through it.  I note that most of those proposing it will never be in that situation.  I am not sure what the intention of this is other than to say to the thousands of woman who have had to have a termination that they did not know what they were doing.  It seems a judgmental amendment.  I do not mean this in a disrespectful way, but there is something very patronising about deciding that an adult woman who is about to undergo a medical procedure does not know what she is doing and is not able to get the facts.  Anyone who has had a termination, or has accompanied a friend or relative to England to access a termination, will know that all of the information that a person requires and needs to know can be accessed.  Indeed, the desire to be informed as a woman undergoing a medical or surgical procedure is there, and the information is there.  I find it very disrespectful that somebody thinks it needs to be put into law that a woman would be obliged to find out the sort of information that, if she needs it, she will find anyway.</p> <p>  I stand over the comments I made.  This is misogynistic in its intent and there are elements of it that are laughable.  The idea of a DVD is a bit outdated.  Of course there are not alternatives to the termination of pregnancy.  There is only one.  A woman either terminates the pregnancy or continues with it.  There are a lot of factual inaccuracies in this.  I will not support it.  I will vote against it because the intention of it is clear, regardless of whether the proposers want to admit that here in this room.  The intention of it is crystal clear and, as a woman, a mother and a grandmother, I will not stand over that, nor will I support its inclusion in legislation.</p></speech>

When the Minister was speaking on amendment No. 146, he referenced a few examples in the UK.  Yesterday, when I gave a few examples from the UK, the Minister told me we are not the UK.

What is being proposed is forcing any woman who is about to have an abortion to watch a DVD, get a description of the operation and of "the probable anatomical and physiological features of the foetus at the time the termination of the pregnancy is to be performed".  I do not intend to keep coming into this debate, as I said yesterday, but I would like the proposers of this amendment to consider how cruel they sound to the public.  We have all described to them situations of somebody having an abortion because of a fatal foetal abnormality.  The proposers of this amendment want those women to sit and listen to a description of the features of the foetus.  "The Handmaid's Tale" is on the television at the moment.  We are only a breath away from it with the likes of this and references to foetal pain.</p> <p>  I do not know if it is normal for a man who is going in for a cancer operation to be sat down and shown a DVD of the operation, or have it described in detail by doctors.  I do not think that is the case.  I am pretty sure it is not.  It seems to be only when women want to make up their own minds about what they want to do with their lives.</p> <p>  The abortion pill is mentioned and there is apparently a DVD that shows the woman how to reverse the effects of the abortion pill once she starts to take it.  There may be doctors here who can answer that question but, from the studies that I have done of the abortion pill, I do not know what is meant by that.  They are proposing an amendment to a Bill that has no medical or scientific basis.  It gives the impression that the proposers do not have a clue what they are talking about.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in this going back to the 1950s when women were pregnant and had to ring around to public and private agencies that might take the child from them.  That is proposed in the amendment.  That was a golden era in Ireland, apparently, from the point of view of the proposers of the amendment, when women were forced to have their children taken from them and given to public and private agencies.  That worked really well.</p> <p>  The proposers seem to be living in a time warp where, according to this, a woman is a single woman who has made the decision to have an abortion because she is not being supported by the father, or he is forcing her to have the abortion and paying for it.  It would be great if that was always the case.  There are women who make up their own minds without the father of the foetus being the primary focus.</p> <p>  The proposers also do not seem to realise the extent of gender-based violence in this country.  There are many women having abortions because the father of the foetus is violent.  The proposers want them to be consulted and legally forced into their lives.</p></speech>

The proposers of the amendment should just go back to their golden era of the 1950s and leave the rest of us progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#F02000"><p>Following on from Deputy Coppinger, there are a few bits of this amendment to which I would draw attention.  There is factually incorrect information, to my mind deliberately designed to cause hurt and pain to not only the women who have been affected but perhaps the men in their lives and their families as well.</p> <p>  Also, there is some wholly irresponsible language in the amendment with reference to the DVD.  I tried to not read too much into it when I was reading this last night.  The idea that non-medically qualified Deputies would try to prescribe in legislation something that, as a pharmacist, I would say is dangerous, namely, to suggest that women would be given information suggesting that they take a medicinal product somehow to reverse abortion pills that they have taken, in my mind could lead to some very serious consequences.  People need to be aware of the irresponsibility and danger in some of these amendments.</p> <p>  It is part of our job and what many of us are trying to do to get the best legislation possible, but by tabling amendments that are deliberately designed to cause pain to women and families, it is almost implied that there is a necessity to put this in because if we did not, all these awful things would happen.  In this amendment, we have a very good example of the destructive nature of this grouping of amendments.  There are so many parts to it.  On the reference to the pain of the foetus, we heard the evidence from world experts at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that this is not factually correct.</p> <p>  I agree with the previous speakers that it is misogynistic in its essence.  It is irresponsible and dangerous.  It is an attempt to stigmatise women.  As the Minister stated, it all comes down to the notion that the people made a decision to trust women, and these amendments all have that historical contamination of not trusting women.  We would all be, as the public would be, very conscious of what is being tried to be achieved in this amendment, but I do not believe it will not be achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#F02100"><p>First and foremost, our side has never sought to interpret others&rsquo; views in any other way than they have presented them, yet on every occasion there is an interpretation given to these amendments that is not the reason for them.</p> <p>  Second, we have never been condescending to anybody with regard to the views that are validly held on the other side of this debate, and we have never name-called or been ignorant in any way with regard to this, because to do so is not in an effort to have debate but in an effort to close down debate.  Closing down debate is in nobody's interest in this regard.  We are entitled to represent the 34% of the people who voted no on this and the 20% of the people who voted yes but who do not agree with this Bill.</p> <p>  We also have a right to hold the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and others to account on the commitments that they give on this issue.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that abortion is healthcare and is part of the healthcare provisions.  Why then is it illegal to have an abortion in certain circumstances with a penalty of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment?  Is there any other healthcare provision that happens under proper supervision that has a 14 year prison sentence?  This issue is different from other issues.  We can dance around this point, left, right and centre, if we wish.  We have had certain Deputies state that they want the line taken out stating that a termination of pregnancy is the ending of the life of a foetus because they are not comfortable with it, but that line is at the heart of this Bill.  To ignore that line would mean we would have a euphemistic conversation about what is at the heart of this Bill.  This is also a radical departure from where our health service was in the past.  It is a different situation.</p> <p>  Also, the Minister mentioned that in some way we were trying to imply the father's responsibilities legally.  We were not trying to imply that at all.  It is disingenuous for anybody to seek that.  I had a good debate with my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on the parental notification issue for those under 16 years of age where we spoke about the exceptional circumstances that might arise where a minor has been raped by a family member.  When we are dealing with Bills, we deal with not only the core majority of the people who will be dealt with in the Bill but with all of the different parameters that could arise.</p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger stated we are trying to force the woman concerned to pull the father in some way into the debate.  The amendment does not have any responsibility in pulling the father in.  All it does is provide factual information that exists with regard to the responsibilities.  The reason being is that the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution found that the majority of abortions happen because of socio-economic reasons, because many women feel that they do not have the economic resources to continue with their pregnancy.  We want to say that there are responsibilities with regard to those economic resources.  Economic resources are important.  I have spoken to many women who have said that despite the Minister being pro-choice, they felt they had no choice, because of the economic circumstances that they were in, but to proceed with an abortion.  Indeed, 19 women last year who were homeless had babies.  These types of economic issues radically affect the decisions that people take.</p> <p>  The Minister talks about DVDs.  To be honest, the HSE provides information currently in DVD form.  The HSE with which the Minister is involved presents health information now on DVDs.  If the Minister did not know that, that is up to himself.  We are merely saying that the information should be presented in a way that is easily consumable by people, such as in a digital format, by putting it on a memory stick, etc.</p></speech>

It is not something we would necessarily have a massive difficulty with if a change was sought.  This amendment seeks to provide information.  Information should be neutral.  It should not be determining whether a person is pro-choice or pro-life.  Information should be separate from what side a person is on, as long as it is medically factual.  If Deputy O'Connell has a particular medical problem with it, we are again happy to sit down to finesse the particular amendments to fix that, if it is necessary.</p><p> It has been said that this is an effort to force information.  It is an offer of information.  It is a choice for a person to accept or decline that particular offer.  The logic is if we dressed up the legislation in choice, adding an additional choice to the legislation would also be a positive thing to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#G00200"><p>I do not know where to start with this.  I am appalled at the tone of what appears to be an additional part of the Bill that was never flagged to the public at all in the course of the referendum.  When the public voted, they certainly did not do so on the basis of these kinds of conditions.  I have serious doubts about its admissibility because there was no discussion of this nature, nor could there have been one, without causing serious reaction from all free-minded and free-thinking people.  It is extremely old fashioned.  If I were a woman, I would object strongly to being in the control of a system over which I had no control whatsoever.  Going right back to the 1950s or 1940s, not even then were women relegated to the extent proposed in this additional section to the Bill.</p><p>There are references made to a digital video disc, DVD.  I presume it is similar to the DVD sent to all Members of the Oireachtas over the past number of years.  Perhaps it is and perhaps it is not.  If it is, then I object strongly to it because it was obscene in the same way that pornography is obscene.  I could not understand why people would want to send that type of material, apart from frightening the life out of the women of the country.  I cannot understand why they would want everyone to have a copy of that DVD.  If one's own family and children, aged under or over 18, were to receive copies of this kind of material they would be shocked.  It would be psychologically damaging to them to feel they had to undergo this kind of propaganda.</p><p>There is also another element to this with references to adoption.  I support the legitimate adoption societies that have been involved in providing and facilitating adoptions for people for many years.  I do, however, object strongly to a woman being coerced into a situation whereby, at a most vulnerable time in her life, she is being fed information stating she will be looked after and she need not worry if she follows the directions of the DVD and its providers.  That is the message and it is a dangerous one.  It is taking over the souls, hearts and minds of more than 50% of the population.  If people think that is alright, then on their own consciences be it.  It can and will, however, have serious consequences.  It will take the country back 60 or 70 years.  I am not finished yet but I will finish shortly.</p><p>This amendment then goes on to say that the &quot;the Health Service Executive shall monitor the website referred to in <i>subsection (7)</i>on a weekly basis to prevent and correct tampering&quot;.</p></speech>

It also states &quot;that the materials referred to&quot;, which I presume are the counter-abortion materials, &quot;in subsection (7) shall include: (a) information to a woman contemplating abortion of public and private agencies and services available to assist a woman through pregnancy, upon childbirth, and while her child is dependent including, but not limited to, adoption agencies.&quot;</p><p>Let us look at these situations.  During the course of the special committee hearings we studied at great length the situation in which many women found themselves.  They want support and advice of a non-directive nature that would be fair, even-handed and would help them to make the decision in their own interests.  We must remember that they may have a particular medical or mental condition that created an urgency.  I fail to understand how it is intended to be helpful to women to put them through this extra trauma at this crucial and vulnerable time in their lives.</p><p>Someone made reference or objection to the fact that misogyny was part of this.  It may well be or not be intended to be so but it is very anti-women.  It is very anti allowing women to have any choice of their own at all.  It takes out of the hands of the woman who is pregnant, and may have a crisis pregnancy, the ability to go anywhere other than follow the directions set out in this section.  That is appalling.  I doubt if that could be applied to any other element, group or anybody else in society.  I have strong objections to creating the feeling, notion or impression that society should control women in this fashion.  I do not want to go back to the things which we spoke about yesterday but I do want to say this.</p><p>Society has to look at itself very carefully all of the time.  I thought we had come out of this type of amendment.  Society should try to understand situations and make sure that fairness, due process and natural justice apply.  It is important that everyone is treated reasonably fairly.  I know it does not always happen in society.  I mentioned Thomas Hardy's book, <i>Far from the madding crowd</i>, before.  It is a great example of where society chooses to ignore and the tragic consequences that occur.  Those tragic consequences occur, and will occur, because society has decided to interfere in a clumsy fashion in the life of the individual in a way that is oppressive.  I am appalled.</p></speech>

The woman herself decides what treatments or procedures she will have.  She must be enabled to choose her treatment with full knowledge of the material facts.  The Irish courts, as we know, have emphasised the distinction between elective and emergency procedures.  The more elective the procedure, the greater the duty of care on the doctor to warn the patient of potential negative outcomes.  It is clear most terminations of pregnancy, as defined in this Bill under section 13, will be elective procedures.  The law requires that elective procedures require a high degree of disclosure.  The doctor must provide information on benefits, risks and alternatives which will enable a woman to make the best decisions.</p><p>In May, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, said he would support the abortion legislation where it allowed abortion for no reason up to 12 weeks.

The <i>Irish Examiner</i>attributed those words to the T&aacute;naiste some time in May.  This is a simple matter.  We cannot say something today and forget about it tomorrow, even if the Minister would like to do that.  Yesterday, the Minister described those words as disgusting.  The T&aacute;naiste said that the cooling-off period would involve counselling and offers of alternatives to abortion.  We are now trying to ensure that the law reflects what the T&aacute;naiste, the second highest officeholder in the land, said during the campaign.  The Minister will express his usual fake outrage and say this is anti-woman and so on but we are trying to ensure that a full range of information is available to women considering abortion, nothing more and nothing less.  This not only reflects what the T&aacute;naiste said during the campaign but it is also prudent from a doctor's point of view, as the Chairman would know, to ensure full consent is given to an abortion.</p></speech>

I take grave issue with it because it appears that a woman has to be pro-choice in order to be treated fairly and to get respect in this Chamber.  I take great exception to that, and I will follow up on it.  It is disgraceful.  Tens of thousands of women are of the same view as me.  Just because I have a different view from the pro-choice view does not make me anti-woman; far from it.  I take exception to that accusation.  It needs to stop here and now because neither I nor my colleagues will be stifled, and I will not allow the debate that needs to take place here to be stifled because we hold a different view.  I am a woman and I am clearly seen as being on the wrong side, and perhaps a threat to a pro-choice agenda.  I am entitled to my view.</p></speech>

Informing parents is a reasonable goal but not in the way proposed for all the reasons we have discussed because it would include informing a father who raped his daughter and made her pregnant.  Ultrasound scans are a reasonable idea but we should not force every woman in the country to have them when they are not necessary.  Pain relief in an operating theatre is a reasonable idea but legislation does not reach into operating theatres and dictate which instruments, drugs and procedures our surgeons use in any operation in any hospital or in any general practice.  Informed consent is a good idea but that is not what this amendment does.  This amendment states exactly what needs to be printed on brochures.  I doubt there is any other legislation that determines such matters.  This amendment specifies the technology and platforms to use.  It specifies an IT maintenance programme and security for websites.  As the pharmacist in the room stated, this amendment specifies what she believes could be substantively dangerous medical and pharmaceutical advice.  Yet again, we have the kernel of a reasonable proposal, which is informed consent, brought forward in a way that no legislature anywhere in the world could pass in primary legislation.</p> <p>  I want to speak specifically to the start of the amendment because it has been claimed by several of those proposing it that the amendment is nothing more than an offer of information.  That sounds very reasonable.  They are saying they just want to offer women information and who could argue with that?  The amendment states that "no termination of pregnancy shall be carried out without the voluntary and informed consent of the pregnant woman".  It then states that consent to a termination of pregnancy "is voluntary and informed" only if all the following happens and then sets out a list of mad stuff.  That is not an offer.</p></speech>

The amendment is mandatory and forces women because it tells them they will have no access to termination of pregnancy unless we sit them through all of this, unless we tell them things the pharmacist in the room tells us are medically dangerous and unless websites have a weekly security protocol attached to them.  That is what this amendment provides.  I believe some of the proposers are putting it forward in good faith.  However, for what it is worth, it is also my view that others who are putting it forward have enough experience in this House to know-----</p></speech>

Scandal after scandal has been attached to maternity care, childbirth and women's reproductive rights.  Last night, we heard about a case before Mr. Justice Peter Kelly involving a doctor working in a maternity hospital.  What a surprise.</p> <p>  Comments have been made about misogyny.  I am not making an allegation if misogyny but my understanding is that it is a reaction to the fact that these amendments are based on a lack of trust in women and their doctors.  I am not suggesting what is or is not going through anybody's head.  In my view, this amendment will be pushed to a vote and will be voted down, as it must be, after which the members who voted against it will be accused of refusing to offer women information.  That is partly what is going on here.  For all these reasons, I will vote against the amendment.</p></speech>

They are framed in such a way that allows us to be asked how we could be against them.  When I returned home last night, as if I had not had enough of this subject after yesterday's proceedings, I thought about the amendment relating to "dignified disposal".  The wording of that amendment was carefully designed, as Deputy Donnelly observed, to make it sound as though we were in favour of undignified disposal.  We made very clear yesterday that is not the case.</p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to interpretation of an amendment.  I am not sure if he meant my interpretation but if so it was not interpretation.  I have the text before me in black and green.  It is, in my view, an attempt by the anti-choice people to act the victim.  On Tuesday, the first day of these proceedings, we spoke about representing those who voted "No".  We should remind people what the people who voted "No" voted for.  Their vote meant in effect voting "Yes" to people with diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality travelling abroad and bringing home the remains of their much-wanted children in the boots of their cars.  Their vote was against victims of rape and incest, often minors, being able to access termination.  They voted to maintain the position where nine women per day would travel abroad and for the continuation of the pain and suffering inflicted by the eighth amendment.</p> <p>  It was also said that some of us were unhappy with the definition because we were not comfortable with it.  That is completely inaccurate.  I am not happy with it because I believe it is inaccurate and not fully comprehensive.  The Minister has assured us that we will work on this together and I have been working on it to come up with appropriate language.</p> <p>  Today, we heard further references to socio-economic factors and the elective nature of the procedure.  This is another attempt to make it sound as though "on demand" would see a woman having an abortion one afternoon because she had nothing else to do.  The language in this is an attempt to demean women.  </p> <p>  There was a reference to information being medically neutral and factual.  The text of the amendment is not medically neutral or factual.  It was suggested that we could finesse it.  The finesse that I would suggest would be to take a big black marker and score through the lot of it.</p> <p>  The only thing anyone is attempting to tamper with here is the bodily autonomy of the women of Ireland, once again.  That is what this amendment is designed to do.</p></speech>

It is as anyone could have easily predicted, namely, amendments that are full of bigotry and misunderstanding are being presented to us in long texts - reading some of them is like reading <i>War and Peace</i>- and we then bicker and fight over them, thereby delaying what we are here to do, that is, legislate for the result of a democratic referendum that was decisively won and which provided that women should have choice and access to abortion in this country.  That is the issue on which we must focus.  People are arguing back and forth over what the T&aacute;naiste did or did not say.  That does not matter because the Irish people spoke in favour of the heads of Bill which were published by the Minister for Health.  That is what we are trying to deal with and this amendment and many other amendments have absolutely nothing to do with those heads of Bill.</p><p>We should not give the amendments much oxygen because they are full of what we heard over and over again during the referendum campaign and what people of my age have been hearing for 35 years.  I am sick of it at this stage.  I want to move on and I know the women following the progress of this committee want this legislation to move on.  We have been waiting to put legislation through for a long time and each day we waste is another day on which women will be forced to leave this country or, in the privacy of their own homes, to put their health at risk by taking pills without supervision.  I appeal to everybody to remember the outcome of the referendum.  It was decisive and clear and it was the people who spoke, not the Deputies who are having a go at each other in this room, as we have done repeatedly.  The people have spoken and we should give effect to the referendum outcome in legislation that can be brought before the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

We are at risk of rerunning the campaign here, which would not help any woman in crisis today.  We have had two long days of debate and I am sure we will have another intense day of debate today.  There is a duty on us to proceed through the amendments, give them consideration and move this legislation forward.</p> <p>  I will recap quickly on a number of points relating to the amendment.  The title of the proposed new section is "Information and informed consent".  Deputy Donnelly is entirely correct that implicit in that is a suggestion that without this section, there is no information or informed consent.  That is not true.  As I outlined, informed consent is long established medical practice, which is enshrined in Medical Council guidelines, the Medical Council being the regulator of doctors which can strike off a doctor.  Informed consent, consent and information exist.  What the Deputies are trying to do is rewrite what the term "information and informed consent" means to suit a particular viewpoint.  While they are absolutely entitled to hold it, that view is not objective.  Our medics know what to do to comply with the law and their duties under Medical Council guidelines.</p> <p>  Several speakers referred to commitments given by various people.  I gave a straightforward commitment that in the event that the people of Ireland voted "Yes", I would move ahead with legislation in line with the general scheme that was published in March.  There may be ways of technically improving that, and we have discussed this from many perspectives over the past two days, but that was the commitment I gave and the reason I am here today is to move it forward.  We debated the general scheme intensively during the referendum campaign.  I heard it debated on radio programmes when people texted in questions and we had head-to-head debates on it, including one between me and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The debate took place very much in the context of the general scheme and the section proposed in amendment No. 146, or anything resembling it, did not appear in the general scheme for good reason.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan stated the amendment was about giving women choice.  Apart from the irony of that comment, it is also not true.  Amendments matter and, as our President says, words matter.  The words of this amendment are very simple.  It uses the phrase "shall be carried out" and refers to consent to a termination of pregnancy being voluntary and informed "if and only if".  Let us not in any way suggest there is any choice as to whether a woman or her doctor would go through the detailed protocol that those who signed the amendment wish to insert in the legislation.  The amendment does not provide for choice.  If this section is inserted in the Bill, any woman in crisis seeking to access a termination of pregnancy will have to comply with all the various tests set out.</p><p>To be clear, there is no choice.</p><p> I have made my points about the reference to the father of the foetus, and how I genuinely believe that represents a misunderstanding and suggests there is only  a certain type of woman who needs to access termination.  That is not borne out by the statistics.  That is my interpretation of it and it is my job to outline how I interpret it.  It is also factually incorrect, because it refers to situations "where [the father] has offered to pay for the termination of pregnancy".  As we have already discussed at great length, termination of pregnancy in Ireland will be provided for universally as part of the public health service, so no woman will need any man to pay for it.  Let us put that where it belongs.</p><p> I really believe that no woman ever wants to find herself in a crisis pregnancy, and the more I have met women in these situations, the more I believe it.  No woman would want it for herself and I would never want it for a woman in my life.  No one wants to be in that situation.  However, if a woman finds herself in that situation for whatever reason, and there is always a reason, we need to make sure the system we put in place is compassionate, sensitive and effective in how it operates.  I do not attach any value judgment to the Deputy's perspective, but I genuinely believe this does not help in achieving that.</p><p> As much as I oppose every element of this amendment, I am particularly disappointed that when those who drew it up decided to exclude certain groups from having to go through this rigorous protocol, they still chose to include parents of unborn babies with fatal foetal abnormality.  That is particularly cruel.  Subsection (4) of the amendment refers to a "suitably qualified person" - we will get to that point in a moment - sitting down with the mum and going through the features of that foetus and its state of development.  These are people who have experienced fatal foetal abnormalities.  They have probably gone through their 20-week scan, with the great excitement of seeing their baby and looking forward to its arrival, only to find out that their baby does not have a brain or a heart.  It is a particularly cruel aspect that parents like those I have met from Terminations for Medical Reasons Ireland, TFMR, would have some suitably qualified person sit down and explain the features to them in great detail.  I am sure it was not intentional, but it is in the amendment.</p><p> The amendment references a "suitably qualified person".  I am not sure who that is.  The idea here was that a woman and her doctor would have a conversation, a period of time would elapse and the procedure would take place.  Does the phrase "suitably qualified person" mean we are now making it mandatory for a woman to see another person?  She has already sat down and discussed her intimate private life with a doctor.  Does she now have to discuss it with someone else?  I am not quite sure who the suitably qualified person is.  Who Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n would deem to be suitably qualified and who I would deem to be suitably qualified may not be the same.</p><p> It is true the HSE produces things on DVDs.  The HSE does a great job promoting lots of things about the Healthy Ireland initiative, positive health and vaccination.  Regrettably some people, although not Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, have opposed the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  I do not care about the modality of the information.  Whether it is on a DVD, stored on a memory stick or uploaded to Netflix, I think it is offensive.  My problem is not the method by which the information is to be communicated.</p><p> Finally, one of the reasons people in this country voted "Yes" was to make sure that when a woman made a choice she could access the service safely.  During the referendum campaign I heard, as I am sure many committee members did, men and women saying that if it was their daughter they would want her to have support and to be able to talk to her doctor.  They said they would want to know that she was not going on the Internet, ordering an illegal abortion pill and taking that pill in the loneliness of her bedroom or bathroom.  The more hurdles are put in front of women, the more likely it is that the issue of illegal abortions will continue in this country.  I respect all the Deputies here while fully disagreeing with them on this issue.  I do not think any of us can argue it would be a good outcome for illegal abortions to continue and for women to continue to travel.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n should note that 113 women from Meath travelled last year.  We do not want to place challenges in front of these people and I am sure he does not want that either.  We cannot continue to put onerous and unnecessary barriers in front of a service people have told us get on with introducing.  Whether the Deputy agrees or disagrees, I know he respects the will of the people.  We have a duty to make sure it works and is effective, and this amendment simply will not allow that to happen.</p></speech>

However, I note that there are 180 amendments.  Of those, 16 are substantially pro-life.  Most of the amendments seek a deviation from the Bill itself.  During the referendum, much of the debate was consumed by the commitments made by senior members of the Government, as would be expected.  We had a commitment from the T&aacute;naiste that counselling and information would be provided.  They are important things to say.  We cannot discount commitments in that regard.</p> <p>  People have also mentioned their interpretations of this measure.  I sometimes think these interpretations can be strategic.  We have spent about three hours talking about other people's interpretations.  We may take it as read that we do not agree with each other's interpretations and simply discuss the content.</p> <p>  Another Deputy, I think it was Deputy Donnelly, said that these are good things in essence but that someone, somewhere, can do something about them at another stage.  If we look at international comparisons, many of these issues are dealt with in the legislation dealing with abortion.  It is not unrealistic for us to seek some kind of primary legislation guaranteeing that these elements would be provided for.</p> <p>  The last thing I will say is that information is not offensive.  Information is not the enemy.  Information is not a hurdle, and we need to trust women with information.</p></speech>

It does not say it is their choice.  Anyone who has spoken on the amendment has said it is up to the women and that they will not be forced to receive this information.  However, what its proponents are talking about and what is written seem to be two different things.  The wording "if and only if" is very strong.  It indicates that the procedure can only be carried out if the woman receives information from all these sources.</p></speech>

I do not think they constructed the amendments.  I have no doubt about that.  I believe they were constructed by other people with other agendas.  We need to know and acknowledge that.  A deep distrust of women emanates from what is before us.  It is as though one has to watch women.  We have to be careful of what they might do when they are let off on their own.

If people had studied the submissions made at the special committee they would have seen that.  The public have acknowledged that.  That is what they voted on, namely, a recognition that women did not have abortions for the fun of it.  As they saw it, a parental, maternal bond, unique to women was being violated.</p><p>They were concerned about it and they expressed that again and again.  They were traumatised by it but they found themselves in a situation where they were between a rock and a hard place and they felt that it was the only way they could go.</p><p> Reference has also been made to socio-economic reasons for having an abortion.  It was already stated that it was discussed at length at that particular time that we were eliminating that particular ground for seeking to have a termination of a pregnancy, so why is it being raised again?  That leads me to believe without any doubt that the people who concocted this new section were not familiar with what the committee had done, what the people had voted for, or the legislation in general in this country and were more familiar with the legislation that is effective in other countries such as the US and the UK.  We are well capable of governing our own State in every way and we should be left to do that, as we have always done and will do.</p><p> I cannot understand why there should be so much concern about a lack of trust in women.  Those who predicted the floodgates opening in 2014 said that thousands of women would seek abortions but the average number is between 23 and 24 on an annual basis, and only for reasons that were legitimate and within the law.  I dismiss any other speculation that has been put into the ether.  This section has nothing to do with the Bill or what the people voted on and is pure surmise as to what might happen in other jurisdictions but has nothing to do with the legislation in this country, incidentally the heads of which were published before the people made their decision.  This section was not.</p></speech>

He said that during the campaign and he has said it here and then he rejects any reasonable amendments we have tabled.  We might as well have addressed them all <i>en bloc</i>.  It has been said that they are not necessary in primary legislation and that these matters can be dealt with by guidelines.  That is a complete contradiction.  The Minister keeps insisting that we give doctors clarity in primary law.  It looks like he is only interested in clarity when it involves a proposal he is interested in.</p><p>As for what Deputy Durkan said today and yesterday about us hiring people in to draft the amendments rather than looking at them ourselves, we studied this and we also studied international comparisons.  We do not need any lecture from Deputy Durkan.  He needs a cooling off period for being so insulting to us as to suggest that we got the amendments written for us and that we did not know anything ourselves.  We were involved.  I sat through that quango as well.  I will not call it a committee.  It was so exploratory that one could not get a pro-life doctor.  We do not need any lectures from Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>

It states: "Nothing in this Act shall operate to affect any enactment or rule of law relating to consent ...".  Therefore, existing legislation applies.  I am particularly interested in two case scenarios.  One relates to where the pregnant woman is under the age of 16.  My understanding is that when a woman is aged 16 or older consent is not required under law from a medical perspective, as the woman is an adult.  Will the Minister advise how this will work for women under the age of 16?  Will the young woman need to a parent or a guardian to accompany her?  Is it expected that forms will need to be signed?  Can it be done at the time?  How does the Minister foresee that working?  My other question relates to the existing law, which is what we are applying here.  It relates to the case of a woman who is over the age 16 but may have an intellectual impairment, an intellectual disability.  Will the Minister talk us through the way it is envisaged both of those case scenarios will be dealt with?</p></speech>

It will be based entirely on the document, Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners, because it is the job of the Medical Council to regulate this area.  It is not directly my job and it is certainly not the job of this legislation.  Page 15 of that document sets out the general consent principles which the Deputy does not need me to go through because he is familiar with them, but under section 10 it specifically refers to the capacity to consent.  Obviously, the capacity to consent test, if I may call it that, would be the same.  It also contains a section on children and young people and how to interpret consent, which we discussed yesterday, with the basic principle being that if one is under the age of 16, one will need a parent to consent on one's behalf.  As the Chairman outlined to us yesterday, there are situations where if there were family difficulties or very difficult situations, that would have to be reported to the appropriate authorities and could be dealt with through those as well.  The HSE already has a consent policy, and I would be more than happy to share further details on that with the Deputy in advance of Report Stage.  Regarding the principle of consent in the Bill, as the Deputy has acknowledged, there is no difference here other than the normal consent principles that apply.</p></speech>

In page 15, to delete lines 32 to 35 and substitute the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;23. </b>(1) Notwithstanding anything in this or any other enactment and notwithstanding any rule of law, or the terms of any oath or contract (whether of employment or otherwise), no healthcare worker or other person shall be under any obligation to carry out, or to make a certification in respect of, or to participate in carrying out or to make arrangements for the carrying out of, a termination of pregnancy in accordance with <i>section 10</i>, <i>12 </i>or <i>13 </i>to which that person has a conscientious objection.&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>Obviously, the Minister is quite comfortable in that he feels there is conscientious objection or freedom of conscience in the Bill as it stands.  He knows there is conflict on that view not only in this Chamber but outside it among the medical professionals.  This is not something that has been plucked out of the air.  This is a real concern among many doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and medical professionals who work in the hospitals.  The centrality here is that this Bill seeks to bring in a law that allows for the ending of a human life.  That is a very significant thing for anybody to be involved in.  The referendum was dressed up as choice.  If we are going to fulfil that promise of choice we would obviously make sure that nobody is forced into a situation where he or she has to facilitate or be involved in the ending of the life of a foetus.</p><p>Amendment No. 147 states that &quot;no healthcare worker or other person shall be under any obligation to carry out, or to make a certification in respect of, or to participate in carrying out or to make arrangements for the carrying out of, a termination of pregnancy&quot;.  That only relates to sections 10, 12 and 13, and it does not deal with the case where there is a significant threat to the health of the life of the mother.</p><p>There is a desire here not to consider international examples because every time we have suggested an international example we have been told we are special and we should just stick to the Irish situation.  Our next door neighbour, the British, for example, have awful problems with this.  They have a stronger freedom of conscience element within their legislation than we do.  The freedom of conscience states that there is nothing in this Bill that will force anybody to carry out an abortion but it does not look beyond necessarily the horizon of this Bill and, therefore, there could be other contractual arrangements or other unforeseen consequences that forces an individual to participate.</p><p>This amendment also broadens out participation in an abortion rather than the narrow definition with which the Minister has identified.  It reframes the section and, again, offers clarity.  I was involved in the 2012-2013 abortion discussions and clarity was the goal and lack of clarity was the enemy with regard to that.  The British, for example, are laden down with regular litigation involving the state because of certain individuals, healthcare workers, who are constantly battling, trying to protect their freedom of conscience.</p><p>The case of the Greater Glasgow Health Board <i>v</i>. Doogan and another is an example of this.  New Zealand has come to the view it is important to have a gold standard with regard to freedom of conscience and the amendment emanates from its legislation, which states </p><blockquote>Notwithstanding anything in any other enactment, or any rule of law, or the terms of any oath or of any contract (whether of employment or otherwise), no registered medical practitioner, registered nurse, or other person shall be under any obligation(a) To perform or assist in the performance of an abortion ... </blockquote><p>New Zealand is a progressive western democracy where access is not sought to be denied to anybody yet it has managed to process this with an allowance for other individual human beings to have their own choice respected.  I stated yesterday that the limits of my rights end when they start to infringe on the rights of someone else.  I mentioned the 650 doctors who have said they will not participate in the process here.<br/><br/>Will I speak to the other amendments in the group now?  I am happy to do so.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 148 looks to delete "or midwife" and substitute "midwife, hospital or institution".  There is a great argument as to whether institutions have an entitlement to freedom of conscience or conscientious objection.  There are many constitutional reasons to state they do because many of them are run by voluntary organisations that under the Constitution have a right to their particular ethos.  Some might say Fine Gael has an ethos and the question is whether one can prevent Fine Gael from proceeding with that ethos and can force it onto a certain direction.  I would say that should not happen.  Even if we forget about what could happen in the future on this, there is a practical element to it.  Yesterday, I mentioned three hospitals where the majority of health workers have stated they will not proceed.  I will give the Minister more clean information on this today.  The general manager of one of these hospitals has told the CEO of the hospital group it will not participate in the process.  We have the moral argument I am making and we also have the reality in which we are functioning.  To ignore both in the process with regard to institutions would be a folly.</p> <p>  To a certain extent we are all talking about the details of this and how it will work but it will engage with the real-life crisis in every element of the health service.  If we are going to create an abortion service we have to make it real-life-proof.  Obviously hospitals are opting out from this even before meeting Dr. Peter Boylan so there is a difficulty for the Minister that has to be recognised.  This is the desire of amendment No. 148.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 149 proposes to delete a subsection and remove the new obligation in the Bill for a doctor who has an objection to making arrangements.  This is one of the most contentious provisions in the Bill for the medical profession.  As I mentioned earlier, the GP system is stuffed at present and is under fierce pressure.  Nobody can get an appointment with a GP for love nor money.  The GPs in my town are not taking on new patients.  If I were to ring a GP now for an appointment, I would be lucky to get it for next Tuesday or Wednesday.  This is the reality.  What will the Minister do to the 650 doctors?  This is a real question.  What will happen to the 650 doctors if they refuse this?  Will they be stripped of their ability to practice medicine?  Will they be brought in some way to a court?  If they continue to refuse will they end up incarcerated?  What penalties will happen to a doctor who refuses to make arrangements?  Making arrangements is an activity.  It is not a passive element.  Other abortion services elsewhere in the world function without it.  I will leave it at that as I know other Deputies want to speak on this.</p></speech>

Many genuine doctors, nurses and midwives throughout the country have been in touch with the Minister, me and all of us to state they have serious concerns about aspects of conscientious objection.  It is incumbent upon us to treat these concerns with the utmost seriousness.</p><p>I have some questions.  The conscientious objection section essentially states two things.  It states, &quot;nothing in this Act shall be construed as obliging any medical practitioner, nurse or midwife to carry out, or to participate in carrying out, a termination of pregnancy in accordance with <i>section 10, 12 </i>or <i>13</i>&quot;.  The conscientious objection is waived in emergencies, in line with all medical law.  Certainly the doctors, nurses and midwives who have been in touch with me do not have an issue with this part of the section.  They understand they are being given an exemption and they do not have to participate in any way.  I have not had a concern raised with me about this.  The second element is the kernel of where people are looking for clarity.  Section 23(3) states &quot;A person who has a conscientious objection referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>shall, as soon as may be, make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the termination of pregnancy concerned.&quot;  I have several questions on both parts of the section, if I may.</p><p>The first part exempts from participating in or carrying out a termination and we know from the legislation that it applies to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.  Does it include student doctors, student nurses and pharmacists, either here or in other legislation?  As for the transfer of care, the question for a clinician reading this will be what does transfer of care mean.  There may be some out there but none of the doctors, nurses and midwives to whom I have spoken have said they will opt out of it and that is the end of the conversation.  What they are asking me is what transfer of care means.  One interpretation, which we discussed yesterday, is the idea that it is to enable the woman to avail of termination of pregnancy.  This could be in a normal case, and not in an emergency case or exceptional case, where a woman is in with her GP who will state he or she will not participate and will conscientiously object but will provide information on the 24-7 helpline staffed by trained clinicians, including doctors, nurses and midwives, give her the phone number and explain there is an opt-in protocol in place for other GPs and that if the woman rings the number, she will be given details of a number of GPs.  One therefore is enabling the woman to avail of termination of pregnancy services.  We could go to the other extreme, which might be interpreted as stating the GP must contact a colleague, transfer the patient files and discuss the case.  Certainly the medics to whom I have spoken have said they are okay with the first of these.  They are okay with telling the woman they are conscientiously objecting and giving her the telephone number of the 24-7 helpline and explaining all of the supports that are there.  Except in cases where it is medically required, they really do not want a situation where they are heavily involved in transferring case notes and finding colleagues.</p><p>Will the Minister address those two points, as it might go a long way to dealing with some of the real concerns that exist?</p></speech>

There is the matter of transfer of care.  Section 17 of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 relates to conscientious objection, indicating that &quot;A person who has a conscientious objection referred to in subsection (1) shall make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the medical procedure concerned.&quot;  I make this point because the phrase &quot;transfer of care of a pregnant woman&quot; already exists in Irish law.  We have been discussing this quite a bit and when we make law in the health area, the regulators of those professions take the law, interpret it and legally proof what it means from their perspective as regulators before transferring it into guidance.  This has already been done with that Act.  Nobody in these Houses has the ability to discipline a doctor or strike off a doctor.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked what would happen to a doctor and a doctor would want to know how the regulator is interpreting the law.</p><p>The regulator has already interpreted the law on that phrase on page 35 of the famous book, the <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>.  Section 49.1 of the book deals with conscientious objection, stating &quot;You may refuse to provide or to take part in the provision of lawful treatments or forums of care which conflict with your sincerely held ethical or moral values.&quot;  Section 49.2 states, &quot;If you have a conscientious objection to a treatment or form of care, you should inform patients, colleagues and your employer as early as possible.&quot;  Section 49.3 states:</p><blockquote>When discussing these issues with patients, you should be sensitive and considerate so as to minimise any distress your decision may cause.  You should make sure that patients' care is not interrupted and their access to care is not impeded.</blockquote> <p>Section 49.4, which is the nub of the matter, states:</p><blockquote>If you hold a conscientious objection to treatment, you must:- inform the patient that they have a right to seek treatment from another doctor<br /><br />- give the patient enough information to enable them to transfer to another doctor or get the treatment they want.</blockquote> <p>The next point is key.  Section 49.5 states, &quot;If the patient is unable to arrange their own transfer of care, you should make these arrangements on their behalf.&quot;  The Deputy has correctly stated that nobody has a difficulty with section 49.6, which states, &quot;In an emergency, you must make your patient's care a priority and give necessary treatment.&quot;  That is the totality of the guidelines and it is helpful in answering the Deputy's questions on scenarios.</p><p>If a woman cannot arrange transfer of care, and remembering there are many heads and scenarios in this legislation, a medical practitioner must of course arrange the transfer of care.  That is likely to happen in a hospital scenario.  It relates to a very sick woman, who is perhaps unconscious and whose life could be at risk or who could potentially suffer serious harm to health.  To be honest, the bulk of this conversation is coming from the GP community and I accept the legitimacy and bona fides in raising it.  With a GP, a patient would be involved with a medical consultation.  We have discussed the phrase &quot;medical consultation&quot; a lot.  In such cases, the patient will be able to arrange her own transfer of care and the GP is only required to give her that information.  I hope that genuinely helps the debate.  I have discussed this with members of the Medical Council when I meet them in stakeholder forums and I will meet them again next week as part of a broader stakeholder gathering on the matter.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned pharmacists and a 24-7 helpline, and I glad he did.  We discussed this yesterday.  Everybody has been approaching conscientious objection from the doctor perspective but as the Deputy rightly says, we must also approach it from the woman's perspective.  Nobody wants a woman to have to go around trying to find a doctor either.  We have done much work on this outside of the legislation on the 24-7 helpline.  The idea is that doctors will have the opportunity to opt in and have their information available to that service.  A woman needing advice or a service would be able to pick up the phone 24-7, speak to a counsellor, nurse or midwife - a healthcare practitioner - and the woman could be directed to an appropriate place.  I do not see a problem from a legal perspective for the reasons I outlined but there is also the practical perspective.  This legislation should not, in any way, shape or form, be about discommoding women in accessing a legal service.  Nor should it be about catching out doctors who have conscientious objections that they are entitled to have.</p><p>I genuinely believe the balance is right.  What we are introducing in conscientious objection in this legislation is not new or a different construct.  It is not more or less onerous than what has existed.  It is exactly what has normally been done.  I am concerned a little about some of the commentary from some medics raising the issue of conscientious objection because doctors know it is the regulator - the Medical Council - that makes the interpretation and they should be very familiar with what I have just read.  I hope that answers the question.</p><p>The matter relating to pharmacists has come up a bit.  In the primary care setting from an operational and service perspective, the intention is for the doctor to dispense medication to the woman, thus removing the need for the woman to have to make another trip to another healthcare professional, which would be the pharmacist in this case.  In the hospital setting, I am sure pharmacists would be involved with dispensing and, in some cases, supplying the medication to the doctor.  In that sense there is a role that pharmacists would have.  They already have a code of conduct and it states that pharmacists must &quot;ensure that in instances where they are unable to provide prescribed medication or pharmacy services to a patient, they must take reasonable action to ensure these medicine services are provided and that the patient's care is not jeopardised&quot;.  Information is available on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland's website with respect to referendum in May and the next steps, stating:</p><blockquote>The statutory code of conduct for pharmacists sets out the principles for professional practice and behaviour which patients, members of the public and other health care professionals and society generally require and expect of pharmacists who are registered with the PSI.  The code of conduct is intended to provide support and guidance to pharmacists as they discharge their professional duties.  The code requires pharmacists to ensure that in instances where they are unable to provide prescribed medicines or pharmacy services to a patient, they must take reasonable action to ensure those medicines and services and provided and that the patient's care is not jeopardised.</blockquote> <p>These are similar principles to what we have just discussed with respect to doctors.</p></speech>

Many pharmacists will ask if they will be in a position where a woman could comes to the pharmacy seeking an abortion pill that they could conscientiously object to providing it.</p></speech>

Their code of conduct already states that they can do it but need to take reasonable action.  In other words, they might need to identify where the service may be available.  The following may not be well known but it is important for pharmacists from a services perspective; we are discussing the law and this is somewhat separate in that it is the operation of the law.  It is not envisaged that woman will be walking into a pharmacy to access medication, as it is envisaged she will get it through her doctor.</p></speech>

We have discussed general practice but in the acute setting, doctors, nurses and midwives will be able to opt out and conscientiously object.  It is not covered in legislation and I imagine it should not be as it is an operational matter.  Will the Minister speak to the concerns that some may have about concerns relating to rostering, for example?  In a smaller hospital, for example, there may be a very limited number of obstetricians or midwives.  How are they protected in ensuring they are not rostered into a situation if a colleague is on leave, sick or whatever?  Is it possible they may end up being asked to participate in a termination?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#O00900"><p>That is an important point.  One of the reasons it is so particularly important relates to what we discussed yesterday and even the day before about certification.  If an obstetrician certifies a woman for a procedure but goes on leave and the covering obstetrician has a conscientious objection, it demonstrates the importance of rectifying what the Deputy, I and others discussed over recent days.  We will do that between now and Report Stage or we will certainly endeavour to work together to do it.</p> <p>  Regardless of a rostering or staffing position in a hospital, the right to conscientious objection should not be infringed.  We must work together with the HSE and Dr. Boylan to ensure the service is operable but we must also ensure we do not attach disproportionate concerns to some matters.  It is highly likely, based on the trends that we know relating to abortion in Irish women so far, that approximately 80% of Irish women who access terminations will do so in the community setting.</p><p>We should park the issue of the nine to 12 week period, which I accept is different from what I am about to say.  Other than the nine to 12 week period, the women whose medical well-being the Deputy is discussing are very sick in terms of the risk to their health or life and may well have to be transferred to one of the larger tertiary maternity hospitals.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but I heard some obstetricians in smaller units in the country campaigning for a &quot;No&quot; vote during the referendum campaign and saying, &quot;The eighth amendment has never prevented me from providing care for such a woman.&quot;  However, that is because such individuals would have transferred their patient to Holles Street hospital, the Rotunda Hospital or the Coombe hospital.  Therefore, it does not really arise in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality.<br/><br/>The point the Deputy makes is serious and legitimate.  As the HSE rolls out this system, it has a responsibility to work with hospital management to ensure the staff will be consulted, informed and briefed in order that they will be aware of what conscientious objection means.  There cannot and will not be any pressure on staff to in any way negate their conscientious objection which they absolutely have a right to have.<br/><br/>I am somewhat concerned about Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's comments.  I do not doubt his words, but I will not cast a slur on any hospital CEO, anonymised or otherwise, because I need to verify the facts.  A hospital CEO in any voluntary or HSE institution cannot say, &quot;My hospital is not participating,&quot; because it is my clear advice that institutions do not have a conscientious objection.  No hospital will have the right to opt out; certainly no hospital CEO will have the right to say, &quot;My hospital is not doing it.&quot;  I need to ensure we will not exaggerate the significance of this issue.  Prior to the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, we heard many people say, &quot;My hospital will not participate.&quot;  In fairness to the doctors and medics involved, that largely was not the experience.<br/><br/>I will read my note for the purposes of the records of the committee.  I do not want to take too long, but I want to be clear.  This is an important issue on and about which we have all had discussions and questions.  Section 23 of the Bill covers the issue of conscientious objection.  It states that where he or she has a conscientious objection, a medical practitioner, nurse or midwife shall not be obliged to carry out or participate in the carrying out of a termination of pregnancy.  In the event that a doctor, a nurse or a midwife has a difficulty in undertaking the required medical procedure, he or she will have a duty to ensure another colleague takes over the care of the patient.  This is in line with section 49 of the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016 which I have read in full.  That section obliges doctors to enable patients to transfer to another doctor for treatment in cases of conscientious objection.  It has clarified how it is interpreted by the Medical Council.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives, published in 2014, states:</p><blockquote>If you have a conscientious objection based on religious or moral beliefs which is relevant to your professional practice, you must tell your employer and, if appropriate, tell the patient as soon as you can.  If you cannot meet the patient&rsquo;s needs because of this objection, you must talk with your employer and, if appropriate, talk to the patient about other care arrangements.<br /><br />Even if you have a conscientious objection, you must provide care to a patient in an emergency where there is a risk to the patient&rsquo;s life.</blockquote><p>Therefore, both the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, have mechanisms to address non-compliance with their guide or code by doctors, nurses and midwifes.  I am often asked if I am going to sack all of these doctors.  Apart from the fact that it is not my function in law, it is not how the Medical Council or the NMBI discharges its duty.  These things are only said to shock or create a problem; there is not that sanction.<br/><br/>I have discussed the fact that the HSE is developing a helpline to assist women to navigate the service for a termination.  It is intended that medical practitioners will voluntarily consent to have their names released to women who are seeking a termination through this helpline.  That will ensure women will be directed to medical practitioners who do not have a conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy.<br/><br/>Both the Bill and the existing medical guidelines make it clear that conscientious objection cannot be invoked when the risk to a pregnant woman's life or health is immediate.  Any individual's right to conscientious objection is not absolute and obviously has to be balanced against the competing rights of a patient, particularly the right to life in the case of an emergency.  I agree with Deputy Donnelly - I do not believe doctors or nurses have a difficulty in that regard.<br/><br/>I have also outlined what the duty is in non-emergency cases.  There are some amendments tabled by Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Coppinger to this section which we discussed yesterday, perhaps by accident.  They are focused on the definition of &quot;as soon as may be&quot; and my decision based on legal advice that it provides for a greater degree of urgency and immediacy than other phrases that laypeople such as those of us around the table might think are more urgent.  The phrase &quot;as soon as may be&quot; attaches a significance to informing the patient as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>There is no need to make references to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, as covered in one of the amendments.  The right to conscientious objection is clearly set out in section 23 and does not require a reference to, nor interrupt the interaction of, the Protected Disclosures Act which is already on the Statute Book and will continue to operate independently of this legislation.</p></speech>

However, they object to having to actively participate in the making of arrangements.

Is it a leaflet or a website?  That bit is, rightly, not for me.  However, I have heard some doctors suggest that if a woman comes into a GP practice and the doctor is conscientiously objecting, he or she will have to telephone another GP to transfer the woman into his or her care.  That is not the requirement.  The requirement is as set out in the existing Medical Council guidelines to give the patient enough information to enable her to transfer to another doctor.

Conscientious objection appears to be provided for in the Bill, but on closer inspection, it disappears completely.  Freedom of conscience is a vital human right according to the European Court of Human Rights.  A person's conscience claims can be religious or non-religious.  What matters is that his or her conscience may lead him or her to object or refuse based on his or her deeply held religious, moral, ethical or philosophical beliefs to do or assist in certain things.  The best known example is conscientious objection to military service.  During the years many people have objected to serving in the armed services or fighting in wars owing to an objection to taking human life.</p><p>Many doctors, if not most, are guided by the principle to first do no harm.  The idea of intentionally taking human life will be abhorrent for them.  Furthermore, the assisting in taking a human life is essentially the same as directly taking it.  In the case of abortion the process involves the ending of a human life - there is no ambiguity in this - and after more than 50 years of abortion practices in the UK we see that it clearly involves the intentional destruction of a developing life.</p><p> In the Bill the Minister, Deputy Harris, states: "A person who has a conscientious objection [...] shall, as soon as may be, make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the termination of pregnancy concerned."  In effect this obliges the doctor to ensure that an abortion is carried out by requiring him or her to make arrangements with another doctor who will perform the abortion.  The fact that the conscientious objector is obliged by law to set up an arrangement to enable a woman to obtain an abortion has been overlooked in the discussions on the Government's abortion plan, as discussed with the Chairman earlier.</p><p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has made no intent to engage or consult with general practitioners prior to publishing the legislative plan.  Clearly, however, he now wants the new abortion services in Ireland to be GP led.  Abortion is not healthcare in any meaningful sense.  The intentional destruction of an unborn child is not a therapy, nor is it a recommended treatment for any complication that may arise in pregnancy.  Many GPs will be deeply uncomfortable with the ending for no reason of an otherwise healthy pregnancy.  Many Irish people will be deeply uncomfortable with the idea that the local GP practice has developed into an abortion clinic on abortion referral services.</p><p> Irish doctors should not be forced by law to choose between their job, their business and their reputation on the one hand, and their conscience on the other.  These amendments reflect the concerns expressed to us by more than 600 GPs in recent days.  We can look at each amendment individually but the key point is that without removing the obligation to make arrangements for abortions we will find ourselves engaged in a massive attack on the rights of our doctors.</p></speech>

The only thing that is continuing here is a war on women's rights, which needs to end.  Earlier I spelled out very clearly how conscientious objection will work.  I will state it briefly but clearly again for Deputy Fitzpatrick, and it is the same thing I said to Deputy Donnelly.  The provision for conscientious objection exists in section 23 of the Bill.  No "medical practitioner, nurse or midwife" need participate in any such procedure based on their own views.  They have absolutely every right to hold those conscientious objections and I respect that.  The Medical Council guidelines interpret that.  The council is the regulator, not me.  Section 49 on page 35 of the Medical Council guidelines states this.  I have heard from many doctors also, and I accept there are genuine concerns and practical operational questions.  I am sure the Chairman will be aware of these from his own colleagues also.  I hope that the information I have put on the record of this committee can help to allay those concerns.</p></speech>

My amendment No. 157 refers to the issue of conscientious objection.  I believe that we already have comprehensive provision made for any person who wishes to conscientiously object.  I do not hold with the notion that the provision of this specific form of healthcare for women should cause a whole additional layer.  Notwithstanding that, we believe it needs to be codified that there would be consequences for those doctors who refuse care to women.  Asking a doctor to participate in a procedure is not the same thing as asking that he or she ensures that a provision is made for the procedure to happen.</p> <p>  Our amendment asks for a referral to the Medical Council for appropriate sanction in the event that a physician refuses to make arrangements for the transfer of care of the woman who is pregnant.  There should be a sanction because we do not believe there should be an opt out and that Ireland should continue to do what it has done for decades, which is to look at women in crisis pregnancy situations and fold our hands, throw our eyes up to heaven and say, "No, sorry love we are not helping you."  That is not good enough.  There has to be an obligation to make a referral for the transfer of care.  I do not believe telling a doctor to make a referral is the same as forcing a doctor to participate in any procedure.  Any Deputy who comes in to the committee and tries to claim this is being somewhat disingenuous.</p> <p>  The amendment provides for a referral to the Medical Council for appropriate sanction.  Although I may have had my own views about whether or not a criminal sanction would be appropriate, the amendment does not say that.  It states, "shall be referred to the Medical Council".  We are having this debate following on from the referendum, and all of the discussions we had where everybody said there should be no more shame and no more stigma or forcing women to go abroad.  It is about putting the woman at the centre and ensuring she gets the care.  It is about ensuring that if the doctor or physician in front of whom she is sitting does not wish to provide that service then that physician will make a referral onwards.  As I said earlier, I do not believe this constitutes participation in any way, shape or form.  It simply lives up to the obligations to provide care.</p> <p>  The Deputies have called themselves pro-life - the opposite of which is anti-life, which is silly - and I do not hold with their notion that this part of healthcare should be separate or different.  We believe there should be a sanction on any doctor who refuses to make arrangements for the care to be provided if he or she is not willing to do it themselves.</p></speech>

We must recognise they have concerns that are entitled to be catered for, and we must cater for them.  I note the 650 doctors who have signed the petition to the effect that they do not propose to participate.  In his reply perhaps the Minister will give some indication of the impact this is likely to have on the overall service available to women in the State.</p> <p>  Other branches of the medical service such as midwives, nurses, trainee doctors - to which the Minister has referred - are also important enough to be provided for in the primary legislation for two good reasons.  The first reason is to observe the spirit of the letter of what has been said and promised before.  The second reason is to ensure that it is possible to provide alternative readily available services so that women may be able to know where to go without having to make phone calls or do a check.   They may have to go in an emergency.  They should know before they travel to a particular GP practice if they will or will not receive a service.  They should not have to do two or three journeys to find that out.  I am aware that the helpline will eliminate some of that.  Envisage, however, a situation where a woman might have multiple emergencies - for some reasons outside of her control - and her ability to surmise may be compromised.  At this stage it would be better to have a simplified system; a belt and braces system whereby in the first instance the woman would be able to gain access to a medical practice where she knows she will receive the treatment first hand and where she knows she will not put pressure on the conscientious objector or put her own life - or her baby's life - at risk.</p><p>I say that on the basis that people may not have made up their minds about what the procedure should be at this stage, and may change their minds.  The provision of this service is critically important.  I note what the Minister has already said, but it would do no harm to refine it a little to take into account the points I have just raised, with a view to ensuring that the service is available in every region so that the woman does not have to travel 100 miles in order to access basic services.  Some medical practitioners in any given practice might have conscientious objections, but others may not.  I presume that a situation of co-existence will prevail, whereby those who wish to offer access to abortions can and those who have conscientious objections are not forced into providing it.</p></speech>

It is probably the part of the Bill that has been spoken about most.  With my heart and soul I can fully understand why someone would not want to be part of this.  There are many reasons for it.  Some people might be pro-life.  People should not have to explain themselves.  I know that the Minister is aware that the depth of feeling on this issues applies not only to the medical staff but also to the general public.  Everyone believes that nobody should be forced to do something that is against what he or she believes in his or her heart and soul.  The mental health of medical staff is suffering because of the thoughts of what may be, so it is very important that this is clarified very quickly.  Many medical professionals have suggested to me that they would resign if they were forced to do something that they believe to be wrong.  We are facing a potential loss of good, experienced medical staff.  I cannot reiterate enough the trauma that people feel they will go through if they are forced to do something they fundamentally believe is wrong.</p> <p>  One of the main things that helped the "Yes" campaign succeed was the word "choice".  I know of many people who were going to vote "No", but when people started to argue for a "my body, my choice" approach their feelings and attitudes to it changed.  We must give medical staff the choice if they fundamentally believe that they should not have to do something they do not wish to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#R00300"><p>Unlike Deputy Murphy O'Mahony I am not concerned that there will be mass resignations because of this.  I have great faith in the doctors of this country and their ability to deliver this service, and I want to ask the Minister some questions about the doctors who are publicly and vocally objecting.  In the Irish medical profession there is a great tradition of being on the side of women, when it has been allowed.  In Ballyfermot in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s there was a notorious doctor called Paddy Leahy, who has now passed away, who was absolutely brilliant at breaking the law and giving women with 12 or 14 children access to contraception when it was totally illegal.  Dr. Andrew Rynne also faced down the law on the question of condoms and the contraceptive pill.  Doctors for Choice played an amazing role in delivering the result of the recent referendum.  In the 1990s, when it was not popular or profitable to promote abortion services, other doctors really stuck their necks out.  I am not worried at all that we are going to lose medical practitioners over this.</p> <p>  I agree that the idea of choice was a key factor in the referendum, and that doctors and nurses should have the choice.  The issue arises as to what happens if a medical practitioner says that he or she conscientiously objects and what happens next.  That is an important issue because transfer of care could mean that doctors will simply provide the phone number for a 24-7 helpline.  It should mean that an employee of the HSE or someone who works on behalf of the HSE who meets a woman in a crisis pregnancy asking for the appropriate help has an obligation, because of the contract the HSE has with that employee, to ensure that the woman seeking help gets the care she needs.  Ultimately it is the responsibility of the HSE.  The way that is provided for in law really matters.</p> <p>  I want to leave open the possibility of putting in a different kind of amendment at the next Stage on the question of the ultimate responsibility lying with the HSE itself rather than the doctor.  However, I can foresee hard cases here, and the law as it is written at the moment may not deal with those cases.  Transfer of care might be interpreted as merely providing a freephone 24-7 helpline but will do nothing for a young woman from direct provision or from a marginalised community who only knows about a doctor's clinic.  She may be impeded by the use of language, her inability to speak English, or a lack of money to make phone calls.  There may be many reasons a young woman could not independently look for help outside a doctor's clinic.  </p> <p>  We have to be careful not to create hard cases.  Having said that, I am pretty confident that most of our medical practitioners would not be that hard-hearted or so cruel to let somebody walk away in a desperate state.  There may be some such practitioners out there, and we should allow for the possibility of that.  We have to look at how we frame this provision.  We have inserted a clause to say that those doctors must refer the woman on to someone who will treat her.  We do not quite use that language, but it is clear that the transfer of care is the duty of the doctors.  I want to look at inserting an amendment in the future which will make it the ultimate responsibility of the HSE.  </p> <p>  As a corollary to the amendment introduced by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n which seeks to allow an institution access to conscientious objection, we have submitted amendment No. 162 which would insist that an institution does not have access to conscientious objection by inserting into subsection (1) that, "Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed as applying to an institution, hospital or a medical facility".  We could leave that out, but we believe it would be better in the legislation as an absolute guarantee that there will be no chance that a place like St. Vincent's Hospital can refuse to provide abortion care because it has a Catholic ethos.  Some people are terrified that our future national maternity hospital might have that facility.  We want it to be written into abortion legislation that it does not.  I believe that is a reasonable request.  I take the Minister's point that the legislation includes institutions, hospitals and clinics in good faith.  </p> <p>  I have heard that many of the approximately 600 doctors kicking up about this legislation are unhappy because it raises a question about the GP scheme and the payment of GPs in general.  Dr. Carthy would know about this.  GPs lost a lot during austerity; it has been suggested that there were pay cuts of between 26% and 36%.  Those payments have not been restored.  I can imagine that a cohort of GPs would be annoyed that they are now being asked to take on extra work without proper remuneration.  Can the Minister tell us whether that is correct or not?  I do not imagine that there are 600 doctors who are saying that they will not give out the abortion pill.  It makes more sense that there would be 600 people who are discontented about pay.</p></speech>

GPs will obviously have to be remunerated.  There is a broader issue concerning general practice into which I am not going to get today, but the Chairman and I are very familiar with it.  It relates to the ongoing GP contract talks between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, with the end of the year agreed as the date of completion by both sides.  The talks are to address the issues the Deputy has referenced, including the sustainability of general practice, where we want it to be in the future and how we are going to resource it.  On the specific issue of resourcing, with GPs to provide the specific new service, I note that in the coming days we will be in a position to issue a contract for the service.  It will be very clear for all to see that we are adequately resourcing general practice to provide the service properly, comprehensively and safely.  I cannot say any more than that today,</p></speech>

We have come back to the use of inflammatory language.  Perhaps that is the view, but it is not really the place we are in right now.  Previously, people spoke about reasons or offering clarity in reference to these amendments.  The Minister has been very clear.  The amendment is completely unnecessary and already provided for.  As a registered pharmacist, I concur with the Minister's reading of the Bill to the effect that pharmacists have always been allowed to conscientiously object.  During the years I personally have had concerns about the idea that anybody in receipt of State payments has had that option, but that is my personal view.</p> <p>  Some years ago I had experience in a town where there was a pharmacist who was a known conscientious objector and did not stock barrier or oral contraceptives and refused to stock Cytotec, that is, misoprostol, for the completion of a miscarriage.  My understanding is there was no active referral.  However, it was very well known among girls in the town that one did not go to that pharmacy for the contraceptive pill because one would not be given it.  Happily, there were nine other pharmacies in the town that could facilitate.  There is something like 1,800 retail pharmacies in Ireland and I do not imagine this will pose any problem.  However, I do not mean to womansplain anything here, but as the Minister said, one of pharmacist's roles in the community is to complete stock orders for GP surgeries.  As such, a dispensing process will be involved.  In the hospital environment the pharmacy will dispense for prescribing doctors.</p> <p>  I was not going to go there, but there was also a reference to New Zealand.  It is really easy to selectively pluck elements of other countries' legislation and bamboozle committee members as if we would not look it up, but I did.  Under the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977, in New Zealand abortion is available on health grounds up to 20 weeks; therefore, the risks of delay are not as great as under the Bill here.  What happens in New Zealand is not at all relevant to the situation here.  A doctor in New Zealand can refuse to consider a woman but must inform her of her right to seek healthcare elsewhere.  The comparison with New Zealand, therefore, just does not work.  It has been statistically proved - it is not merely my opinion - that terminations in New Zealand tend to happen later in the first trimester owing to that longer period. </p> <p>  Let us remember that at the start of the week we spoke about women being at the centre of our discussions.  We have to imagine a woman with a crisis pregnancy who is looking for a medical professional's help and how she might feel if she was shown the door.  I am of the understanding one can conscientiously object to treatment but not to a person.  That is a very important point to consider.  </p> <p>  The discussion has proceeded as though conscientious objection is a black and white issue.  There is actually a spectrum.  Suggesting an institution could be a conscientious objector represents a complete misunderstanding of the degree of objection within the medical profession.  Let us consider an institution such as a hospital that is in receipt of State funding.  It would be bizarre if it could organise as a collective so as not to provide services for which the people clearly voted.</p> <p>  To my mind, we are yet again seeing a sinister strategy to stigmatise the care required, that is, the procedure of termination of pregnancy; to demean and reduce a woman by suggesting she needs more information; to target the medical professionals who want to be conscientious providers of this service; and to drive willing medical professionals to simply give up.  </p> <p>  As somebody who has worked in late night pharmacies at weekends and on Christmas Day for several years, I would like to make a point that the Minister has perhaps considered.  There is a need for a book of guidelines for community pharmacists to cover situations where a patient, whom one knows, presents on Christmas day or at 8 p.m.  If we cannot get hold of a GP, pharmacists should know the cascade of options to which we refer if we are caught in a situation with a vulnerable woman.  Obviously, referring her to a maternity hospital seems to be the logical choice, but that is fine for me as a person in Dublin.  A booklet would be helpful for those pharmacists who want to hold it.  I am not saying they should be forced to hold them, but there should be some guidelines for community pharmacists in order that we will not be gazing at women in a crisis not knowing what to do with them.</p></speech>

I did not hear about freedom of conscience for people like me when the D&aacute;il prayer was forced on us and we were forced to stand for it, or with reference to the statue of the Virgin Mary one sees in hospitals.  We do not have full freedom of conscience.</p> <p>  I am becoming a little concerned as the debate goes on.  Yesterday I said I was not going to come in, but I am becoming quite worried.  It is being suggested doctors, nurses and, as some would love to have it, everybody else will be able to object to providing abortions.  All they will be required to do is tell somebody about a website or a 24-hour helpline.  That is not what I understood by "transfer of care".  The Minister needs to be a little more specific.  He was very specific when he wanted to include periods and dates in the law, but he is not being as specific in this instance.  I accept the point he made yesterday that "as soon as may be" means a little earlier than we all thought.   However, a specific time should be outlined.  It should be 24 hours, as proposed in one of the motions.  The wording "as soon as may be" is a little too vague.  Notwithstanding all of the great doctors in the country, there are some who will actively frustrate women and pregnant people in seeking to have an abortion in this country.  They certainly will.  Some nurses and midwives will too.  They just do not agree or accept that it is a freedom of conscience issue for the woman having an abortion.  They accept freedom of conscience only in their case.  I have visions of women being passed from Billy to Jack.</p><p>If one goes to a doctor and is told there is a website and that is the doctor's duty done, that is not enough.  We need to be a little more specific.</p></speech>

I thought we would be talking about some kind of referral.  The uninitiated among us would read &quot;transfer of care&quot; in that way, so the Minister must explain this.  I wrestled with this issue and whether I would oppose conscientious objection completely.  There is a case to be made as to whether it should be allowed at all because the way in which it operates in some countries is such that it prevents many people from accessing terminations.  We cited examples in Italy, where a culture has been created in the medical community of doctors not participating.  One can see how, with political and social cultural shift in a different direction, this could start to happen here.</p><p>How onerous is it for a doctor to write a prescription?  One could surely argue that it is still up to the woman and that the doctor is not actually participating in the abortion.  He or she is giving that choice, that freedom of conscience, to the woman in the situation.  I ask the committee to look at it that way.  One would think doctors were actively being forced to carry out abortions, which none of us agree should be the case.  One is still giving the person affected by the decision that freedom of conscience but one is not carrying out the procedure oneself.  All I am hearing about is doctors and nurses.  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that the majority of doctors will participate in this.  Surveys given to the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution showed that the majority of doctors, like the rest of the population, were in favour of such provision.  I will also be balanced, however.  Doctors did not do enough in this country in recent years to actively move the situation forward.  Even Professor Arulkumaran said after the inquiry into Savita's death that he was surprised doctors did not do a little more in the intervening years.  Be that as it may, doctors are now actively taking part.</p><p>I wish to mention some specifics.  Some of the amendments basically imply that this should be broadened to all healthcare workers.  I myself worked in the healthcare system.  If it is broadened, are the Deputies who have tabled these amendments saying a clerical officer could refuse to write a letter of referral for someone or refuse to physically hand a woman a list of doctors in her area?  This seems to be what is advocated in these amendments.  Not alone that, but what if a receptionist in the surgery has a conscientious objection?  There is all sorts of potential here for the matter to be broadened.</p><p>The institutions are another matter.  I agree that amendment No. 162 should be adopted.  We probably should explicitly write this into law and it would be good to do so because there is a serious question mark over it.  No one knows what will happen with the national maternity hospital.  I would like the Minister to make it clear that he will not accept institutions conscientiously objecting.</p><p>Another matter that has come up recently and on which I would like the Minister to give a commitment is the question of an opt-in system.  I have been contacted by doctors who are abortion providers in other countries.  They have asked me to ensure that such a system is not introduced here because having a list of abortion providers could potentially put certain doctors at risk of attack.  We should not be naive.  There are people who actively oppose this law and we know they pick on clinics.  We know that where they have done so in other countries, doctors and healthcare providers have been attacked and killed.  We know they are guilting and shaming women going into abortion clinics in Liverpool today.  If we are to have an opt-out system, it must have a limit such that the doctor must ensure that the woman is looked after.  Furthermore, we should not have an opt-in system or a list of doctors.  I am also worried about this 24-hour helpline, and I mean this for the protection of doctors and staff who work in surgeries too.  We do not have an opt-in system for the provision of diabetes services or other healthcare.  We should not stigmatise abortion if we can in any way avoid doing so and we should ensure that doctors are protected.</p><p>I think there will be enough doctors to provide this service.  I will put this in context because I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who raised the question of how the healthcare service will cope.  We do not know the exact figures, but let us say there will potentially be 5,000 or 6,000 abortions per year, adding up the people who travel and those who order the abortion pill online.  We do not know the exact figure for the latter but we have some idea from the two main providers.  The current number of doctors will be able to cope, particularly because much of the service, probably up to 80%, would be medical abortion, which simply requires a prescription.  I am all for protecting doctors' and other people's rights, but at the same time we must ensure that women, particularly those in rural areas or areas where there are not many doctors, are not left behind.</p><p>I wish to raise one last scenario.  We had a case two years ago in which a psychiatrist sectioned a teenager who was suicidal and was seeking an abortion.  We never heard what happened but this came out in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>a year later.  Doctors who oppose this legislation have a lot of power to frustrate it, so it is important we write into it the limitations of conscientious objection.</p></speech>

Primary legislation trumps medical guidelines.  Furthermore, this is a change to the medical guidelines.  The Minister mentioned the medical guidelines in respect of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  That was a requirement in respect of abortion in cases in which the life of the woman was under threat and had to be protected.  For a start, the level of conscientious objection that would exist in such a case is zero.  Second, the position would be that the guideline would be deleted if that Act were repealed.</p><p>The Chair was very close to nailing it in this situation.</p><p> We are introducing a new law and the language in this particular section is the same language as the particular other law, but it is for a different right, not the right to have an abortion in the case where the mother's life is under threat but the right to have an elective abortion in a scenario before 12 weeks for other reasons, and important reasons they may be.  It is a different right.  Therefore the guidelines designed by the Medical Council on this particular issue will not have to give the same level of precedence to passing information, etc.  In actual fact, I have spoken to a number of barristers on this issue and their view is that the Medical Council could not but develop guidelines that actually reflect the law.  They would have to respect the law.  </p><p> Where the Minister refers to arrangements for abortions up to 12 weeks without indication, the Medical Council would have to implement that.  That is where the doctors are having the real difficulty.  It is not a replication.  It is a completely new situation, under completely new circumstances, where the Medical Council is going to have to follow the law on this.  That is why my request would be that this needs to be put into primary legislation to deal with that.</p><p> On pharmacies, Deputy O'Connell made a point that I wanted to raise.  People do not realise the level of engagement pharmacists have on this.  They purchase stock for their localities but pharmacists in hospitals would have to provide for this situation.  The Minister said that reasonable action was necessary.  Action is not passive.  It is an involvement in a process.  The Bill is forcing the pharmacists to be involved.  We are getting lost in ourselves in a way.  All of this can happen as all of the pro-choice TDs want without forcing one individual to do something that he or she does not want to do.  That is what we are talking about.  We are talking about forcing individuals to do things that are completely against their wishes.  In a liberal democracy, surely we should not be doing that.</p></speech>

I can see why.  I have met a number of GPs and they have genuine concerns.  They do not want to have any hand, act or part in the abortion process.  It is as simple as that.  The legislation as it stands, which my colleague Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n pointed out, does not provide for full conscientious objection.  It was not voted on in the referendum, if we are to be honest about that.  That 640 GPs have signed a petition suggests that this is becoming a major problem that needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  It is appalling that the Minister did not consult with these GPs or sit down with them.  The doctors' group released a statement, which he may be aware of, stating quite clearly that they felt bullied and disrespected; those are their words not mine.  They have been treated in an appalling manner.  Everybody has the right to conscientious objection.  Let us be straight that it is a human right.  These GPs want no hand act or part in this. Their views should be respected.  The legislation is a weak form of conscientious objection.  It is not given full conscientious objection or respecting their rights.</p> <p>  The GPs have also pointed out that as well as the Government the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP,  has also acted in an unfair manner in that it refused to call the EGM until after these amendments are dealt with.  What that effectively means is that the legislators cannot hear the voices of the GPs directly.  We have met them and I know many of the pro-life TDs have had the courtesy to meet them in our clinics and we have been hearing their concerns.  We agree that there is a huge issue here.</p> <p>  If these GPs refuse to participate in this process, and I am totally sympathetic to them, what is going to happen?  Are their licences going to be taken?  Are they going to be locked up?  Are we going to have a flood of court cases because that seems to be where we are headed here?  All this is at the end of the day is upholding a fundamental right to conscientious objection.  If we do not accept this very reasonable amendment here, we are headed to a flood of court cases.  Listen to the GPs and respect them.  We are talking here about different choices and views.  We all have our own views and nobody, whether they be a politician or a GP or a health care worker, should be forced into taking part in a process with which they fundamentally disagree.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-08a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110800002#U02100"><p>We are about to have a vote on one of the most important questions we could ever be asked, as to whether this legislation, as put forward by the Minister for Health, would change everyday medical practice.  It is no overstatement to say that the Minister has proposed nothing short of a radical change in the model of medical practice and care provided by maternity services in Ireland.  We have been contacted by numerous doctors, as has been said, in everyday practice who are shocked that the draft legislation has been proposed without so much as the slightest consultation with front-line care providers whose patients are pregnant women and their unborn babies.</p> <p>  No guidance has been given on the professional liability for the practitioners that may arise in providing abortions under the legislation.  No experts have been consulted on the pathetic conscientious objection clauses that are contained in this Bill which in practice would not protect anything .</p> <p>  Despite what the Minister said during the referendum campaign that the law would protect the right to conscience, the so-called conscientious objection clause in the legislation gives no real protections in law for those who do not wish to provide abortions.  It is as simple as that.  Doctors were shocked to discover that even in circumstances where they object to performing an abortion or prescribing abortion medication, they must make such arrangements to ensure that women requesting a termination are able to do so, which I am quoting from the legislation.  The meaning of this is obvious.  Where a doctor objects to an abortion, he or she must still ensure that one is obtained.  The Government's proposed abortion law goes far beyond the law even in Britain where there is no requirement to make arrangements for abortion access.  The health services are full of doctors who want to care for women and their unborn children equally.  Doctors across the country are not willing or able to become abortion clinics for a Government that has no clear plans or budget to radically change our caring patient-centred medical practice.</p> <p>  The Minister cannot even handle the record-breaking delays in accident and emergency departments.  This abortion will turn into a similarly badly thought-out mess in court cases, as we have in illness litigation.  We are aware the costs of that and the damages involved, with plenty of cases of cervical cancer and God knows what else.</p><p>The Minister has rejected protections for disabled babies from abortion and protections for babies born alive.  He has rejected provisions for ultrasound and the respectful burial of bodies after surgical abortions. </p></speech>

It is a two-way process.  If the Minister starts stripping away licences from GPs or locking them up, as he is threatening if they object, he will go down in history as the most incompetent Minister for Health in this country.  Our amendments will ensure that the right to freedom of conscience is protected.  They will avoid pointless and expensive court cases but the expense does not matter.  They will protect GPs in their work.  I am appealing to the Minister but he has set his face against accepting any of them.</p> <p>  The Minister refused to meet the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and just met the board of directors.  A total of 640 GPs have signed a letter calling for an extraordinary general meeting but that meeting has been put off until after all amendments have been dealt with.  People can see that it is a total stitch up.  They can see what is going on.  It is the silencing of doctors, of people who provide care.  They do an exceptional job in providing that care.</p> <p>  The Chairman knows how tough it is to be a GP.  He campaigned on the slogan, "No doctor, no village".  He knows how much people appreciate, need and love their doctors.  This is upsetting doctors.  A full 640 signed the letter and many more who did not sign it have the same issues with this.  Everyone knows how difficult it is to get GPs for rural practices.  It is a problem in my own constituency.  Are we going to just rubbish them?  Are we going to tell them to eat cake and shut up?  GPs released a press statement today.  They have concerns regarding the total lack of consultation by the Minister and the ICGP board, which is disturbing.  Many GPs on the ground do not believe general practice is the appropriate setting in which to deliver abortion because of a lack of capacity in an already overstretched environment.  They also cite a lack of training, the limited availability of ultrasound and the need to deliver a genuine freedom of conscience protection for doctors who do not want to be involved in overseeing abortions.</p></speech>

I expected more respect and manners but it seems that some people cannot help themselves.  I call on the Minister to enter into talks with the ICGP because 640 members of that organisation want to discuss these issues with him.  We wanted to have discussions with the Minister before we tabled our amendments.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and I sought meetings with the Minister.  We wrote to him on behalf of ten Deputies but he never replied.</p></speech>

The issues that the Deputies are suggesting have been voted against already.  Of course, we have not voted against them but against the amendments as proposed because we are satisfied that the protections and clarity are already in the legislation.  This is no different to the conscientious objection that already exists.  I have explained in great detail and read fully into the record of this committee the Medical Council guidelines, referencing specifically section 46 of those guidelines that outlines how conscientious objection works.  Deputy Mattie McGrath is not going to like my answer, no matter how many times I say it.  I am not going to like his position, no matter how many times he reiterates it.</p><p>Given the lengthy discussion I suggest that we vote.  I have answered all of the questions.</p></speech>

I will discuss them together because they are all about the same issue.  One was ruled out of order but the others relate to the same issue.</p> <p>  I will discuss the technical amendment first, which is amendment No. 170.  Essentially, this section makes termination of pregnancy services free and they would be provided through the HSE.  One of the subsections states that the services referred to shall be provided otherwise than as inpatient services.  This might be relatively simple, but as I read it a concern arose for me.  The preceding paragraph states that the HSE shall make available without charge medical surgical and midwifery services for the purposes of termination of pregnancy in accordance with sections 10 to 13, inclusive.  The paragraph goes on to state that those services should be provided otherwise than as inpatient services.  I may be wrong but my concern is that for an outpatient or a patient in a general practice the services would be free but once the woman moves to being an inpatient the services would no longer be free.  I wish to clarify whether I am correct in thinking that.  I believe the services should be free regardless of whether a woman is an inpatient or an outpatient.  Can the Minister give some clarity on that?</p></speech>

It is absolutely the intention that termination of pregnancy services will be free both in the community and in the hospital setting.  The amendments to the Health Act 1970 mirror the provisions of that Act as they relate to services for attendance to the health of women in respect of motherhood.  Thus, women in receipt of services in accordance with the Act of 2018 are not discriminated against in terms of eligibility.  The proposed section 62A(2) contains identical text to section 62(1) of the 1970 Act.  This is to make it clear that section 62A never applies to inpatient services because inpatient services are dealt with in sections 51 to 55, inclusive, of the 1970 Act and the necessary amendments to those sections are contained in sections 25(b) and 25(c) of this Bill.</p></speech>

If we are to make termination of pregnancy services free - I agree we should and must and I support that being provided for in this section - then we must make all maternity services free at the same time.  They are to a large extent, in fairness, but it is not the case across the board.  Some drugs that can cost a great deal of money can be prescribed.  Sometimes women have to go in and out for intravenous treatment and acute setting services.  In some cases the maternity costs to a woman can end up running into the thousands.  I hope any cost on the Exchequer of implementing this measure would be limited.  Nevertheless, I am keen to see a situation whereby all maternity services are free.  It would be perverse otherwise to have termination of pregnancy services entirely free but not pregnancy services entirely free.</p> <p>  There is a second aspect to this that we should grasp as an opportunity.  We should make all contraception free as well.  For example, some of the longer acting contraceptives are highly effective but can cost hundreds of euro.</p><p>There is the morning-after pill.  We could, for example, have a situation - that no one would want - whereby the morning-after pill might require a visit to a GP or &euro;50 to get it from a pharmacist but a visit to a GP for an abortion pill would not incur a charge.  I am not suggesting those two things are substitutions for each other.  Many different opinions on termination of pregnancy have been voiced at this committee.  I am going to take a punt and assert that pretty much everybody here would like to see crisis pregnancies reduced-----</p></speech>

The relatively high cost of some contraception is acting as a financial barrier.  I would really like to see, therefore, at the same time as we provide for termination of pregnancy services to be free that all maternity cover and all contraception should be free as well.</p></speech>

In respect of the phrase "all maternity" services, people engage in many things during pregnancy that we could never expect the State to cover, such as yoga and well-being classes.  The term "all maternity services" would cover a very broad church.  On the drugs issue, Deputy Donnelly mentioned a particular drug, Cariban, used for some cases of morning sickness.  He did not mention this today but he did reference it in another meeting, I cannot remember which but I think it was the Joint Committee on Health.  It costs money - off the top of my head I think on average it is about &euro;30 for a 21 day supply in the pharmacy.  That drug, however, is not licensed for the indication for which it is being used and it is being prescribed off-licence.</p> <p>  I always caution against the provision of drugs that are licence-free.  We do not often do that in this country.  I want to highlight that.  Regarding reversible long-acting contraceptives such as the coil and implant, it is untrue to state they cost hundreds of euro.  A coil, give or take, costs about &euro;140 on average and there is also an insertion cost.  A coil covers contraception for five years, so when the fee is divided by five it is not that expensive.  From my experience I have found that the combination of the expense of having a baby coupled with the price of a coil and a doctor's consultation means that sometimes the amount of money required is outside of people's limit in a pressured financial situation after having a baby.  I completely support the suggestion of free contraception, as it was my suggestion at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  That was based on the evidence that we saw which, from memory, was that 44% of people said contraception failure was part of the reason.  On the morning-after pill in the community pharmacy setting, I believe that in the early stages the Minister for Health made it available free to medical card holders in the community pharmacy setting at the weekend to avoid people with medical cards being unjustly treated.  My knowledge of the morning-after pill is that it is between &euro;20 and &euro;30 on average in the community setting.  It is means tested as part of the medical card so it is deemed to be for people who have the means to pay, if the committee understands what I am saying.  </p></speech>

There are ancillary recommendations from the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I did not submit amendments to them in the interests of getting this legislation passed speedily.  What is being advocated here is straying into that territory.  I have no problem with that.  This committee has a right to do that.  There are, however, things like sex education on which we have a Bill still stuck on Second Stage.  The Minister might move it along.  I refer also to free contraception.  They are all related.  Perhaps we can reserve the right to put them in on Report Stage, if only for the historical record.  This has to go through the Seanad as well after it comes back here in two weeks or whatever.  Perhaps we can get a timeline.  We did not put in all of the elements referred to in the interests of getting this Bill passed by December.  Can we speed this Bill up in the interests of women and pregnant people who desperately need it?</p></speech>

I can argue, technically, as to whether this should be debated as part of this legislation, but Deputy Donnelly putting these amendments down is important.  All of us here are concerned, as Deputy Donnelly correctly said, about reducing crisis pregnancies.  Commitments, or certainly, recommendations were given in the all-party committee report on the eighth amendment in respect of ancillary recommendations.  I hate the word "ancillary" because it somehow or other seems to suggest they were afterthoughts.  They were not.  They were fundamental to the deliberations of the committee.</p> <p>  All of us who campaigned for a "Yes" vote stated we were going to legalise termination but we were also going to put other supports in place.  I have heard my own position misrepresented on this and I want to be clear.  I want to see free contraception in this country.  Free contraception for women is going to require changing primary legislation.  It is also going to require some clinical advice and guidance for the reasons Deputy Donnelly gave.  There are different types of contraception.  At the moment, many women, probably over 40%, have access to free contraception through the general medical services, GMS, scheme.  Unlike men, women require a visit to their GP, generally, to be prescribed contraception so it is governed under the GMS scheme.  We will, therefore, require primary legislation to be changed and a clinical input as to what is the best thing to do for women.  I am committed to doing both of those things in 2019.  I am also committed to working with the Joint Committee on Health as perhaps the best forum where we can work on a cross-party basis to try to identify how best to progress that.  </p> <p>  The Deputies acknowledged the maternity and infant care scheme does largely provide for free maternity services.  We went through this yesterday and I will not go through it again.  I will just say that there are free visits to the GP, further examinations during pregnancy, free visits to the maternity unit and if a woman has hypertension or diabetes there are additional visits after the birth of the baby.  The GP will examine the baby at two weeks and both the mother and baby at six weeks.  Mothers are entitled to free inpatient and outpatient services in hospitals in respect of the pregnancy and birth and are not liable for any of the standard inpatient charges that the rest of us experience as we go about accessing the health service.  We also have free GP care for under-sixes as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about some drugs.  Cariban was mentioned by my colleague, Deputy O'Connell.  She dealt with the issue that it is an unlicensed drug.  Legislatively, the Oireachtas gave the power to the Health Service Executive to decide on the reimbursement of drugs and not to the Minister of the day in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The long and the short of it is that what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do is good.  It aligns with what I want to do.  I do not think we should put in a report about the broader issues in this legislation but I am happy to give a commitment that I will report to the Joint Committee on Health etc.  I would rather not put it in this Bill because I do not think it is a good fit.  It is, however, important to highlight it.  </p></speech>

To the Minister's credit, he has been very open to a substantial number of amendments to various Parts of the Bill.  It is to members' credit that they withdrew most amendments.  I know we want this Bill passed into law as soon as possible but it must be right.  Based on the three days of debate we have just completed, a great deal of work remains to be done and the Minister has agreed that he needs to consider many issues.  My understanding of what will happen next is that the Minister will consider the three days of debate.  He has offered to provide members with access to clinicians regarding some of the issues and has undertaken to meet the committee informally.  That will probably be a long meeting because a significant number of issues need to be discussed.  I understand the Minister will provide members with his proposed amendments or set out his detailed thinking and we will subsequently have time to craft and submit our own amendments.  As the Minister did not propose amendments on Committee Stage, other than one on reporting, the Committee Stage debate was a little like a pre-legislative scrutiny session in respect of some of the issues.  I guess what we are seeking is a mid-legislative scrutiny session.  Is that the Minister's understanding?  While we want this provided for in law, it must be right. </p></speech>

Obviously, in amending this legislation, we all want to get it right.  Therefore, because of the office I hold, my ability to bring forward amendments will mean that I can have my amendments robustly legally scrutinised in a way that Deputies may not be in a position to do.  I hope that we could net out the issues we want to discuss.  I will go back through the three days of debate.  I ask members to email me their views by close of business tomorrow, if possible, setting out what they consider to be the net outstanding issues.  I suggest that I have an informal meeting with members early next week.</p> <p>  This process will have two parts.  There will be some things that I am genuinely convinced I cannot change because to do so would undermine the Bill legally or from a policy or operational perspective.  I will do my best to have the rationale for that explained by making available my officials and clinicians.  I hope colleagues will accept that rationale on some of the issues.  There will be other issues in respect of which members have wanted me to bring about change and on which I hope we will be able to work out how we can bring about the change in wording that is proposed.  I suggest there will be give and take.  I do not believe we will reach unanimity on all of the issues we could not resolve on Committee Stage but I hope we will be able to net them down.</p></speech>

Of that, there is no doubt.  We are not leaving women from the North behind in respect of this.  Until the North gets around to rectifying the inequalities in that jurisdiction, we will make sure women in Northern Ireland can access health services here.  As the Deputy is aware, there is an issue, which she and I have discussed, about eligibility in terms of cost and whether there is a way of making the service free.  It is a complex issue and I welcome the Deputy's invitation to meet a group of advocates from Northern Ireland, possibly next Thursday.</p></speech>
