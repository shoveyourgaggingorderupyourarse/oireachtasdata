I am not aware of any other apologies having been received.  This session is the start of our engagement with the Climate Change Advisory Council regarding carbon budgets and the first of our sessions to discuss carbon budgets.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Marie Donnelly, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, and thank her for agreeing to attend today's meeting to discuss carbon budgets.  </p> <p>  Before we commence, I will read a few notes on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members of this committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses, or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members prior to making a contribution to confirm that they are indeed on the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms Donnelly to make her opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the Climate Change Advisory Council&rsquo;s proposals for carbon budgets for this decade and a provisional proposal for the first five years of the next decade.</p> <p>  I submitted a document to the committee before this meeting.  I do not propose to read it because I hope that it has been possible to circulate it to members.  I will briefly outline what the council did regarding its preparation of this proposal.  We were strongly guided by the legislation and in that context, our key objective was to achieve a pathway to the national climate objective of net zero emissions by 2050.  We complied with the relevant regulations in this regard.  The main Act commenced in July and the regulations were adopted in October.  That led us to look at how we could make proposals that would achieve the first legal milestone, namely, a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  To do that, the council based its considerations on the science in this regard.  We examined the UN and Paris climate agreements, considered the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report that came out in August and used the most recent scientific data from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  </p> <p>  All that material fed into our consideration of several other criteria.  Those included, for example, biodiversity, land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, and biogenic methane considerations.  In addition, we looked at what kind of impact a carbon budget would have on issues such as, for example, employment, the attractiveness of the State for inward investment, the competitiveness of the State and, ultimately, climate justice in the context of Ireland and its place in the world.  Underpinning all those considerations was an ongoing thread of awareness and sensitivity regarding the importance of a just transition in the context of the journey on which we are now embarking.  It will be seen that this aspect is referred to repeatedly in our text.  There is an ongoing concern in this regard, which means that it is important to ensure that people who are more vulnerable are not left behind and that they are not left to carry an unfair burden during this transition.</p> <p>  All these considerations took place over several months and led us to making a proposal for three carbon budgets.  The first one is for 2021 to 2025.  It is a carbon budget ceiling for the maximum amount of emissions that Ireland can make during that five-year period, and the amount proposed is 295 Mt CO2eq.  For the second carbon budget from 2026 to 2030, the figure proposed is 200 Mt CO2eq, and then for the third, provisional, budget running from 2031-2035, the proposed amount is 151 Mt CO2eq.  We put those figures into perspective regarding what it means for reductions over those five-year periods.  In the first five-year period, it means that in the context of the overall figure of 295 Mt CO2eq our emissions would reduce, on average, by 4.8% annually.  The trajectory of reductions would then become steeper for the second part of this decade, with the target increasing to 8.3% annually.  The level of reductions would then move back down to 3.5% annually for the first part of the next decade.</p> <p>  As we underlined when we made this proposal, however, these numbers and the balance of effort were not devised to give a soft ride or to delay action.  On the contrary, these proposals were developed to allow for immediate and urgent action, primarily in the area of investment, in order that such investment in the first five-year period would deliver reductions in emissions in the second five-year period.  If we do not get the prerequisite investments and activities done now, then we will not be able to achieve the level of reductions in emissions required in the second five years.</p> <p>  Rather than going through everything in this context, I will highlight two specific areas in this respect where urgency is paramount.  The first area is, of course, electricity.  Electricity is a key part of our decarbonisation journey in Ireland for several reasons.  We are fortunate that we have natural resources which allow us to move away from fossil fuel-based electricity generation.  We can use wind and solar energy resources and, in time, we will be able to use our marine resources as well, to produce our own electricity using our own natural resources.  That will allow us to substitute the approximately &euro;5 billion to &euro;8 billion that we currently spend annually importing fossil fuels, including for electricity generation.</p> <p>  We cannot reap those benefits, though, unless we make the required investments now.  In several areas, those investments are time-sensitive, not only because it would mean that we could reduce the amount of emissions in the electricity sector itself, but equally because the electricity sector will also, over time, become the energy vector for heating and transport.  Achieving the objectives and targets in those two sectors will mean that we will need to decarbonise the electricity sector.</p><p>The rate at which we are able to generate renewable electricity, be it onshore or offshore, is in a large measure a rate-limiting step on our capacity to achieve these carbon budgets.  I know the Oireachtas is busy looking at the marine planning Bill and other provisions that will apply in that context.</p><p> I draw attention to the area of land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF.  We spent quite a bit of time looking at that, primarily because for many member states in the European Union, their forests act as a sink and counterbalance emissions coming from land or other sectors.  Unfortunately, the situation in Ireland is not so positive.  We have CO2 emissions from our land of about 9.6 million tonnes.  That is plus-emissions.  On the minus side, we have a sink of about 4.8 million tonnes in our forests.  Projecting forward to 2030, our forests are degrading and that sink will disappear between now and then.  That places us in a difficult position for 2030.  Above and beyond that, if we do not have a well-developed forest sink in place by 2050, it will be impossible to achieve net zero.  As it takes time for trees to grow, the planting rate in this decade will determine our capacity to achieve net zero by 2050.  It is an area of particular concern which we highlighted as part of the technical report.  Urgent and immediate action and investment is required in that space now if we are to get the benefit for 2030 and 2050.</p><p> I wanted to highlight those issues but am happy to cover the other areas we looked at as part of the analysis we undertook in preparing the proposals for the carbon budget.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Donnelly.  I really appreciate that contribution and the elaboration on her written statement.  As the meeting is confined to a maximum of three hours, I propose that each member be given two minutes to address their questions to the witnesses, in order to ensure all members get an opportunity to pose questions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will go first and get the ball rolling.  I am confident we will have time for a second round.  I look forward to this discussion.</p> <p>  I thank the chair and members of the council for the Trojan work they put into proposing these carbon budgets.  I know it must have been difficult and a lot of consideration would have had to be given.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I extend deep gratitude to Ms Donnelly and the rest of the council members for that.  They have proposed a budget.  This is the start of the process of us discussing that and we have a certain period in which to report back to the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  On the profile of the budgets the council has come up with and that 4.8% figure over the first period, many argued at the time it was proposed that it was not ambitious enough or the curve was not steep enough.  At the same time, I feel it is an accurate reflection of where we are, the point we are starting from and the years of lack of investment in reaching these targets.  At last, we are taking that seriously but we still are where we are.  Having a less steep profile in that first period makes sense. </p> <p>  Ms Donnelly mentioned the energy transition and wind being an important part of that.  Last week we passed the marine area planning legislation, which is a key tool in ensuring we can go to offshore and floating offshore wind and make those subsequent periods easier.</p> <p>  I move to my specific questions.  Ms Donnelly mentioned the importance of microgeneration and microgeneration schemes in the early part.  All members of the committee will be aware and supportive of the need to urgently introduce legislation that will facilitate the installing of, for example, solar panels on public buildings such as school buildings.  Will Ms Donnelly comment on the importance of microgeneration schemes and of facilitating the installation of solar panels and other microgeneration equipment in reaching the targets and in getting buy-in from the public and communities?</p> <p>  My second question is on land use and forestry.  Ms Donnelly's comments there were incredibly concerning.  She mentioned that forestry is set to switch from a net sink to a net source.  That goes against what we would have imagined would happen.  Is that inevitable?  With some radical policy change, it is possible we can increase the rate of afforestation such as to see a real impact and keep forestry as a net sink as opposed to switching to a net source?  Land use is a net sink in almost every other European nation.  Why is that the case and why is Ireland bucking the trend?</p> <p>  On agriculture, the council mentioned the pathway Teagasc talk about in reaching emissions reductions.  Will she comment on those pathways, genetics, mixed-species swards and the agri-environment scheme we expect to commence in 2023?  Does she feel there is enough there to achieve emissions reductions in agriculture?</p> <p>  Anaerobic digestion is something I bring up regularly and I see it as a key tool in decarbonising agriculture.  I appreciate concerns around it.  Does Ms Donnelly believe it is important to introduce a policy around anaerobic digestion that will allow a co-op-based approach to decarbonising agriculture where chicken or piggery waste can be brought to an anaerobic digester to produce energy to give renewable energy to communities and leave lower slurry emissions at the end of it?  Will she comment on the importance of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman for those questions.  Starting with microgeneration, the Vice Chairman put his finger on the most important part of it, which is that it allows everybody to participate in this exercise.  It might be only a few panels on the roof of a shed, house or local school, but it allows people to become involved and feel they are taking part in this exercise.  It also introduces people to the concept of electricity.  Having spent many years in energy, I still find myself being confused between kW, kWh, GW, TW and whatever.  It is a new language and methodology of speaking.  It is helpful for people to start to understand that because ultimately it will be the energy vector and we need to be able to manage it.</p> <p>  The opportunity of microgeneration on rooftops is so attractive now because of the reduced cost of the technology.  Over the past ten years, the cost of solar panels has reduced by more than 100%.  The advantage is you have them installed and they are like a light bulb.  They do their thing and you do not have to do anything.  In that context, buy-in is hugely important.</p> <p>  On targets, an interesting issue that came out of the recent EirGrid consultation on shaping our future electricity system was that EirGrid started from a premise of zero power from microgeneration and at the end of the consultation, it has now factored in 500 MW from microgeneration, such was the level of interest expressed during the consultation.  That is about 400,000 homes in Ireland wanting to put panels on their roofs.  It is the equivalent of the two gas-fired power stations that were out of action during this year that caused all of the amber alerts.  It is a significant quantity, in addition to the attraction of allowing people to become involved.</p><p>Microgeneration is a very important aspect of delivering on our journey in respect of participation and delivering on renewable electricity.</p><p> If I do not answer everything, the Vice Chairman might let me know and I will come back to it.  On LULUCF, the surprise he expressed was shared by the council when we started to conduct the analysis on this.  It came as something of a shock that our forest system was in such a bad condition.  It is due to the decline in planting rates.  We have had national targets of about 8,000 ha of new planting for forests every year for the past ten years, and we have not achieved that target in any year.  We are currently at a level of about 2,000 ha or 2,500 ha.  What has happened is we have not replenished our forestry and allowed it to build up.  Over a period, as a tree gets older, it can absorb more CO2 but at a certain point it will be ready to be felled and replanted.  The absence of doing that, consistently over recent years, leads us to having somewhere between 8% and 11% of our land covered by forests.  In other parts of Europe, the figure is at least 20%, and higher in some countries.</p><p> In our technical report, we have examined and included the kinds of numbers and rates of replanting our forests that would need to be achieved to put us on a pathway to net zero by 2050.  We are looking at increasing very substantially the replanting rate.  By doing so, we would get to perhaps 18% to 20% coverage of our land by 2030 or 2035.  As members will see in the papers that have gone to the Minister, this is a biophysical process.  It cannot be sped up, given it is nature and it will take its own time.  Planting a tree today is essential but it will not remove emissions in its early years.  That will happen only as we get into the 2030s.  Nevertheless, it is important there be an incentive for people to move.  We have suggested to the Minister to consider forward-counting some of those emissions.  Of course, they would have to be deducted later, given we cannot double-count, but it is important there be incentives for sectors to move forward.  If all the effort in this decade leads to nothing, it will be difficult to have that as an incentive.  We have set out a possibility, should the Government and the Department wish to choose it.</p><p> On agriculture, the pathways Teagasc has identified will deliver significant results and that is for sure.  Not only will they deliver results in a climate sense but many of the methods and proposals it has come forward with and researched improve the quality of farming, the productivity of our farms and the returns to farmers.  There is a challenge and it is not just in the agricultural sector; indeed, it is in all parts of society.  It relates to how quickly new technologies and methodologies can be disseminated and taken up by people.  How fast can we roll out a system of low-emission slurry-spreading, LESS?  How quickly can that happen on all farms in the country?  How quickly can we move forward with a change in fertiliser to, say, protected urea?  Frankly, with the cost of fertiliser today, that might actually happen much faster than we had expected.  Part of these new approaches are about dissemination and adoption by farmers, and that will be the very important first steps agriculture will have to take, as other sectors will also have to do.</p><p> Anaerobic digestion is an important technology we have not yet really used in Ireland.  It is a technology used in other parts of Europe and it is very successful.  It is not a new technology; it has been well demonstrated and it operates in a commercial sense.  It presents opportunities in Ireland.  It is potentially a new income stream for farmers, who may choose to diversify into that space, and it presents an opportunity to have the circular economy notion, whereby we use our land to produce bioenergy in a sustainable way and then use that for the hard-to-decarbonise sectors, whether for transport or high temperature heat in our industrial processing sectors.  It presents a real opportunity for us but, as with any new technology being adopted in a country, it will require Government supports to set it up and to put it on its way in its early years.  It is an important area and it should be examined in more detail.</p></speech>

Turning to carbon budgets, I am one of those who have a concern about the timing of the two budgets. I am a strong believer of the bird in the hand.  In an area such as climate change, where there is that cumulative impact and we hit tipping points, there is no negotiation backwards.  Given we cannot control what is happening elsewhere, we should front-load what we can.  In the context of the comparatively quite low reductions in emissions in the short term leading to higher reductions later, I wonder about that for some areas.  One sector that was mentioned was that of agriculture.  Ireland has signed up to commit to a 30% reduction in methane emissions within an earlier period.  The council&rsquo;s technical paper acknowledges the fact methane has an earlier and harder impact on warming, even though the long-term impact is very much front-loaded into this period in which, as Ms Donnelly described, many parts of the system will still only be moving towards emission reduction.  The front-loaded emissions, therefore, count more.  Does she expect there to be some revision to the climate action plan and the climate budgets to reflect that ambition on methane to which Ireland has signed up?</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly mentioned the issue of investment in the context of front-loading.  Two issues strike me in the context of our seeking to be prudent, one of which relates to the sectoral ranges in the climate action plan.  It will be only if all the upper reaches of the sectoral targets are reached that we will hit 51%, and that strikes me as very risky.  Even within the past month, two sectors have started pleading special cases, and many others will too.  Perhaps it would have been more prudent to model scenarios the halfway point in each range would get us to, whereby the midpoint would be the scenario that would bring us closer to 51%, which would give space for certain sectors to overperform.  At the moment, it seems the 51% is a harder ceiling.  There is much space for the floor to fail, whereas the ceiling is hard.  Will Ms Donnelly comment on that?  Should it be revised to give more scope and flexibility?  I ask this bearing in mind our ultimate objective of a 1.5&deg;C increase and the fact that, at the moment, the scenarios being considered globally will bring us only to a 50% probability of 1.5&deg;C.  Those are really bad odds.  It is a 50:50 chance of staying within what experts say would be slightly less than catastrophic increases.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of forward-counting.  We should not start to have inaccuracies, maths tricks or incentives built in to our carbon budgets.  If we want to give incentives, there are other ways to do that.</p><p>In terms of forward-counting for a forest that we do not know if it will burn down-----</p></speech>

In areas like transport, for example, the plans do not seem to be a decade down the way.  She might comment if this was something the council looked at.  Given that low-interest capital financing is available with 0% loans from the European Union, should we be front-loading infrastructural investment in areas like transport to deliver those second budget reductions?  I believe the financing needs to be accessed now.</p></speech>

I should highlight how supportive was the analysis and research done by MaREI in University College Cork, UCC, the University of Limerick and Teagasc.  University College Dublin, UCD, Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and Maynooth University also assisted us on the analysis side and the modelling of scenarios that we looked at as part of this process without which we would not have been able to come up with the numbers.  I underline how important that was.</p> <p>  A model is a machine with information in and information out.  The model was constrained on the energy side to limit the expenditure to no more than &euro;2,000 per tonne for the removal of CO2 after which the model basically crashed.  Our graph shows that by front-loading expenditure on the energy side at an early stage, we would exceed &euro;2,000 per tonne because it would mean we would need to spend very large amounts of funding now to try to achieve that, some of which would not be feasible.</p> <p>  I mentioned one at the beginning.  Offshore wind will deliver a very substantial reduction in emissions in our electricity system.  We are still in the process of adopting the legislation that will allow the construction of offshore wind farms.  It is not even a question of money or will; we cannot advance that faster than the legislation, the processes coming from the legislation, the actual purchase of the materials, the ships, the people, the skills and the actual construction of the wind turbines in the offshore sites.  When all of that is added up there is a certain period of time below which it is not possible to compress all those steps.  When we looked at that, we determined that it would not be feasible to get emission reductions from offshore wind in the first budget.  They come with quite a big bang.  We missed that in the first period and as a consequence we needed to take account of the fact that we would not be able to get it.</p> <p>  The same applies to some of the other numbers and policies.  For example, electrification of vehicles in the passenger fleet is a gradual process, which is accelerating.  We are now finding that the purchase of electric vehicles is doubling every year, albeit from a very low base.  Short of actually taking fossil fuel cars off the road and funding at a very expensive rate the purchase of electric vehicles across the board, it would be hard to accelerate that.</p> <p>  We went through each of the areas to see what was achievable in not necessarily a cost-effective way but a realistic way in the period.  Having done that we found that we would be setting an impossible and unachievable target if we had gone for a higher rate of reduction in the first five-year period.  It becomes a disincentive if people cannot meet the targets and they end up throwing their hands up in the air saying that it is not achievable.  The council debated this matter at great length.  We looked at many models and scenarios, permutations and combinations of what could be done to bring forward some of the emission reductions.  That led us to the proposal we have made, including the timing and balance of the two budget periods.</p> <p>  In agriculture we looked at all the research initiatives that Teagasc has prepared.  It has done the calculations as we have shown in our technical report.  If we want to go further faster, we need to directly relate the emission reductions to reductions in activity levels.  That is a nice way of saying reducing the amount of methane emitted, which means reducing the number of bovine animals in the country.  That is an area that potentially might need to be dealt with.  It may well need to be a Government policy in due course.  Certainly, as a first step we need to prevent increasing our emissions of methane; that is for sure.  The rate at which we ultimately address the management of methane emissions will be a key issue for Government policy, agricultural policy, food policy and ultimately just transition.  We are talking about people's livelihoods and their incomes.  Decisions of that nature cannot be made at the stroke of a pen.</p> <p>  The 30% methane reduction that Ireland signed up to as part of COP is a global target.  I looked at the US paper supporting its signing of that.  The word "cow" does not appear in that paper.  It is perhaps in a slightly different position from Ireland in that, of course, it has considerable fossil fuel extraction.  It is looking at mitigating methane release from the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels as a primary targeted area for action.  It also has a much poorer performance on waste, for example, than we would have here or in many parts of Europe.  The United States has not actually considered animal numbers as its contribution to that.  It is something we will need to look at but it is part of an overarching policy that will need to be developed.</p> <p>  The sectoral ranges the Senator mentioned are decisions that the Government will make.  We, the council, do not determine the sectoral targets or the sectoral ceilings.  Those are for the Government to determine.  Of course, once the Government has determined what they are, we have a role in monitoring the achievement of those sectoral targets on an annual basis.  We will do that as part of our annual review starting from next year and we hope these ceilings are in place by then.</p> <p>  We looked at forward-counting, which is a suggestion and not something that must be followed.  It is a way of trying to encourage people to get the kind of planting in place that is essential.  Our policy in this space needs to be revisited.  It has not worked in recent years and we need to revisit the policy to ensure that it will work and be effective.</p> <p>  The Senator is right about investment.  Perhaps the most important message coming from the budgets is that we must front-load investment.  It is expensive but we need to do it.  She is right in saying that we need to use the European Green Deal funds coming from Europe.  We need to use the possibilities that are available today using our own resources and potentially even borrowing if we can get it at a very attractive rate.  We need infrastructure investment in electricity generation.  We need infrastructure investment in transport both for demand reduction and to support the charging points for electric vehicles.  We need considerable investment in our buildings.  We will need investment in agriculture.  On heating, the infrastructure investment in district heating is urgent and needed now to get the benefit in the second period.  The real message we are trying to get across alongside the balance of the budget is the investment needs to take place now.  The balance of investment should be high in the first part and a bit lower in the second part.  The emission reductions will be lower in the first part but will be higher in the second part if we get the investment made in the first period.</p></speech>

She also spoke about the change that will come in people's lives and the social acceptance and engagement that is going to be needed.  As a policy, it sounds very good but I fear that in practice, the vulnerable and those on the margins will be treated in the face of climate change in the same way they are already treated in respect of housing, caring and disability.  There will continue to be a lack of special education places for children and so forth.  What is so special about the climate change issue that the approach by the State in its policy should be so faithfully carried through in practice when it is clearly not in any other area?  Does Ms Donnelly see the Climate Change Advisory Council having any role or oversight in this regard?</p><p> Ms Donnelly also mentioned our greater reliance on electricity.  The council referred to transport, heating, population growth and data centres.  Data centres appear to be accepted as a given, as if they are a fact of life, but the more of them we have, the more energy of any kind we will need to run them.  Is there a desire on the part of the Climate Change Advisory Council to make recommendations on that issue?  A few months ago, we were talking about the fear of blackouts and with the amount of data centres we have, does the Climate Change Advisory Council have a role or advice to give in that regard?</p></speech>

It is not for the council to propose policies but to review policies to see are they effective and achieving the objectives on the climate side.  It is quite evident that some of the policies that need to be pursued are good for all citizens.  I will take one example that is quite evident, that is, improving our housing stock.  When one looks at our housing stock, consider the number of houses that have a building energy rating, BER, of less than C3.  People are living in houses that are cold, draughty and damp with mildew on the walls.  We still have houses in Ireland where people are using one open fire as their only source of heat in the house.  In this day and age, it is almost incredible but a few of them exist.  Retrofitting our housing to make our houses comfortable, warm, healthy and safe places to live and work, which is now the direction of travel, is a policy area that will benefit all in society.  From the point of view of the council, we see it as the Government's role and responsibility to target the most vulnerable in that context first and to ensure they will get the benefit of a secure property and a warm house, and the removal of damp and the consequential removal of illnesses, respiratory and others, that come from it.  Such a policy will not only deliver comfort but will reduce expenditure for people because they will not have to spend as much on heating their houses, going forward, if the house is energy efficient.  That is an area where climate policy and just transition policy come very closely together and work hand in hand.</p> <p>  I will move to consider other areas of policy.  Take, for example, transport.  We are looking at transport from the perspective of reducing demand in the first instance because as they say in energy efficiency, the cheapest energy is the energy that is never used and that is, therefore, the optimum way to do it.  That means providing the options to people to have alternative forms of transport.  It can be public transport, buses or trains, as the case may be.  It can be walking or cycling paths that allow everybody to use them.  It is not dependent on people having a lot of money to use them.  It opens the possibility to everybody in society to benefit from that.  Of course, assistance will be required for some of the new technologies in the transport space, including electric vehicles and whatever else.  That is, of course, part and parcel of the policy, going forward.  A key issue is that we must allow everybody, regardless of income, to benefit from the demand response opportunities of readily available public transport at an affordable cost outside their doors in order that they can avail of it.  </p> <p>  In that context, we looked at climate policies and how they will have an impact on people.  Indeed, we looked at the agricultural sector, as I have mentioned already.  Agriculture is not only a business.  Of course, farming is a business but it is also a way of life that is intrinsic to our rural communities.  When we look at the measures we can introduce in the agricultural sector and what can be done in that space, it is important that income sources in rural communities are protected and maintained.  That might happen through different kinds of activities, and that is all well and good.  The key message in our report, what we are emphasising, is that the income stream to farmers should be maintained and protected as we go forward.  That is an illustration of how we are looking at the just transition concerns.</p> <p>  That is before we get to the whole area of employment and jobs.  Some people will be negatively impacted by this transition.  It is essential that we are honest and make it clear to people that there is a change coming down the track.  It is also essential that we make available supports through training systems and entrepreneurial activity, if that is what people want.  We must support alternative areas where people can work and train them for the new kinds of jobs that will be coming down the track, as part and parcel of the just transition.  The 2021 climate action plan includes a plan to establish a just transition commission.  It is specifically foreseen in the text of the plan that the council and the commission will interact on each other's recommendations on this issue.  That is important.</p> <p>  I will go back to the first question about microgeneration and the buy-in, and understanding electricity.  Looking at electricity as an energy vector, it is different to oil or gas in that it is time sensitive.  Oil and gas flow in pipes.  The demand profile for electricity is different during the day.  Demand is very low at night and peaks at breakfast time, lunchtime and dinner time.  There is an opportunity, going forward, not only to produce our own electricity from our own natural resources but to use smart technology to allow us to use that electricity at smart times.  That is why allowing people to understand electricity and microgeneration is an important facilitator.  The roll-out of smart meters, which perhaps we could accelerate, will combine with tariffs that allow people to use electricity, for example, at night.  Some EU member states, for example, have free electricity at weekends or between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at which times people can charge their cars or run their heating, or whatever, for free.  We need to avail of those smart technologies that will allow us, as consumers, to get the benefit.  </p> <p>  The role that data centres need to play in this context is as a part of the energy flow.  Denmark uses the surplus heat coming from data centres as a source of heat for the district heating systems to heat houses.  It sounds like space age stuff but it is happening.</p></speech>

I believe we can, and need to, do it.  It makes sense.  There are possibilities for, for example, Dublin city.  It is not just the cities because there are also possibilities for some of the big towns.  There is the possibility of capturing surplus heat.  It is crazy.  The incinerator in Ringsend uses the River Liffey to cool.  The surplus heat is just going into the Liffey and out to the sea.  Why are we not using that to heat the houses in the locality?  Joined-up technology is available to us but, as Senator Higgins mentioned, we need to make the investments now to allow that to happen.</p></speech>

I wish her very well in what is a critical task.</p><p> I have several questions.  Ireland has been remarkably successful in its ICT transformation and becoming a smart economy, and that increasingly seems to be the direction of travel.  We have also been remarkably successful in having our food sector catch up to be a significant international player and that has helped us through the recession.  There is a sense out there that people are now saying we need to curb very crudely both the growth of ICT and the associated data centres and the food sector.  It strikes me that this is a dangerous path to go.  We have invested a lot of time and effort in trying to establish a foothold in these sectors and, in my view, with the help of the Climate Change Advisory Council, we have to find a way of protecting those leads while we address climate.  I would be interested to hear Ms Donnelly shed light on that.</p><p> My second question is in regard to the measures being proposed.  I know the Climate Change Advisory Council proposes measures and the Government is independent in selecting what it does.  It is said that about 60% of the measures pay for themselves and the other 40% do not.  I heard Ms Donnelly say that the Climate Change Advisory Council sets an outer limit of &euro;2,000 per tonne but how does it select or how does it advise the Government or the Oireachtas to select?  Is it that we look for the least expensive?  Is it that we look for the areas where it is easiest to mobilise investment?  Is it that we look for areas where there are tried and tested policy tools that will work?  It seems to me that what we have to do is to take a punt on policy tools.  While the Climate Change Advisory Council does not want to enter into the political battle lines that are raging around data centres or carbon pricing, it needs to give us some guidance as to how we choose policy tools for the good of everyone.</p><p> On a last point, when compared to the plan I was involved in putting together, the big areas where new ambition is set out are in regard to the rewetting of bogs, district heating, taking carbon out of construction materials, diversifying land use, biomethane and afforestation, where the ambition has been there but the reality has not materialised.  Can Ms Donnelly guide us on what policy tools we need to be adopting in some of these new and ambitious areas?  They seem to be relatively untested and it would be good to see what work the Climate Change Advisory Council is doing in those new areas.</p></speech>

We are seen as a major hub for data centres in Europe.  It is perhaps an issue that, like electricity, is another language and is another form of metrics that we do not use on a daily basis.  Data centres are, in a way, the lifeblood of our new digitalised world.  We tend to think of data centres as Microsoft, Facebook and all of these very large companies, but our local health authority operates a data centre and our local wholesale distributor of food operates a data centre.  Data centres are part and parcel of everything we do because we have moved into the digitalised space.  The challenge we have is how we ensure they become part of the system rather than working outside it.  As I was expressing to Deputy Cronin, data centres take in very large quantities of power and they reserve very large quantities of power because they cannot afford to go down.  The challenge we have is how we ensure a data centre, which has a surplus at any one point in time of up 25% of its power, can use that surplus to benefit the grid and benefit the system, rather than locking it up and never using it.</p> <p>  The second part in regard to data centres is how we take the surplus heat and use that to the benefit of society in heating our homes and our offices.  It is the joined-up approach.  There, we need to look at what they have done in other countries, and I have already mentioned Denmark, which is one illustration of where they are specifically doing that.</p> <p>  In the area of food, the key issue that we need to keep on top of is what is the market demand.  For food, in particular the food we export, we respond to consumer demands.  At a point in time when consumer demand wants low fat or high energy, or whatever it might be, as producers of food, that is the market giving us signals and we need to respond to those signals.  In our very successful food industry, our challenge, which was addressed in the food paper which came out from Bord Bia not long ago, is to increase the value of our food, to move our food exports up the value chain and not remain at the bottom of the low value side of the chain.  We need to be able to go up the chain in terms of high-value proteins, specialist foods and nutraceuticals, for example, in order to be able to protect that industry but also to respond to consumer demand.  That is the challenge but I believe it is also the opportunity for these very successful sectors.</p> <p>  Looking at some of the core measures that have been identified, and some of them were already in Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s own climate action plan in 2019, depending on who one talks to, people will prioritise one or other of the criteria first.  From the council's perspective, our first criterion for investment is emissions reduction.  We are looking for emissions reduction coming from the investments that we make.  We accept that, sometimes, that reduction might not come immediately and it might be a delayed reaction but, ultimately, what we are looking for is emissions reduction.  The second criteria we would apply is energy efficiency, that is, managing demand, be it in transport, in heating, in construction or whatever the area might be.  These would be the overarching criteria or metrics that we would use in terms of identifying preferential expenditure going forward.</p> <p>  That is why, if we look at some of the activities that are taking place now, they are not cheap.  Offshore wind is not cheap but it will deliver very substantial emissions reduction and allow us to manage the flow of electricity, which will be our electricity from our natural resource into the future.  We can ask what is the easiest, and we should do what is easiest anyway.  We should ask what is least cost, and we should probably do it in any event.  We should ask what is tried and tested, and we should benefit from that.  We earlier discussed anaerobic digestion, which is already established in many parts of Europe, and we can benefit from that experience and do it in Ireland.  District heating is the norm in Scandinavia and in all of the eastern European countries.  Again, it is not a new technology and we can benefit from that and take on board something that is tried and tested elsewhere to our own benefit here in Ireland.</p> <p>  In terms of the actions that are taking place and coming through, rewetting bogs is a big issue and a big activity, and I know Bord na M&oacute;na is already well advanced in its efforts in that respect.  That will deliver results for us.  We tend to think of the very large bogs when we talk about rewetting bogs but, of course, we need to analyse and look at our land map because there are many parts of the country where we have peatlands that have been desiccated and that need to be rewetted.  That is going to be an ongoing role for agricultural policy with Teagasc in order to be able to support farmers in the management of the land to get the right balance for their piece of land.</p> <p>  In construction, I believe the opportunities for green building in construction are huge.  We really can do so much more.  It is an area where I believe that the industry itself, which is now developing the plans to do it, can deliver for us.  It is a question that we can fairly ask.  Although I am not talking about high rises, when we look at construction today and look at construction 100 years ago, it has not actually changed that much.  There are very few industries that operate today in the same way they operated 100 years ago.  Therefore, the opportunity for innovation and for new ways of doing things is very substantial in the construction space.  Ireland can be a leader in that space because we have a real demand for construction going forward.</p><p>There are opportunities from biomethane - we have both biogas and biomethane - and longer term, if there is an industry in that space, using that in conjunction with the potential of hydrogen, for example, coming from floating offshore wind will give us an opportunity to move from electrons, that is, our renewable electricity side, to molecules, which can be used on the island, can become a significant export product and can be used in the generation of new industries.  The potential is very useful and we need to look positively at it into the future.</p></speech>

She has a very practical approach and that is welcome.  This has been a broad discussion but I will focus on the potential of offshore wind.  Ms Donnelly rightly identified that comprehensive legislation is going through the Houses and was debated in the Seanad today, namely, the Maritime Area Planning Bill, which will, I hope, set out the important credentials that will be necessary to provide some clarity on planning for those offshore developments.  Because I come from County Clare and have represented that constituency, I have met a number of investors, for want of a better word, and operators, who are concerned at the pace the Government has in mind for offshore wind development, particularly on the west coast and in the form of floating technology.</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly identified the great potential for the decarbonisation of our energy mix and the cost, of which there is no doubt, but there is an opportunity we are missing.  Because it is relatively nascent technology, it would be ahead of the curve.  There is an opportunity for us to develop a long-term base for the construction and development of the technologies that might ultimately be transported and exported throughout the world.  By developing the know-how in that regard, there is potential, which I do not see costed in to any of the other discussions.  Will Ms Donnelly comment on that?   She might indicate her knowledge on or information about the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in regard to whether it is possible for it to include in the various bid processes the opportunity to bring to the market more quickly offshore floating wind.  We know what is happening on the east coast, but my question relates to the more expensive west coast.  EirGrid has indicated it is looking at 2030 and beyond, yet investors are champing at the bit and believe they can make this happen more quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#G00300"><p>That moves into my area of activity because, as the Senator will be aware, I was in renewable energy for years.  Among the natural resource maps of Europe, Ireland and the north of Scotland stand out as having enormous resource possibilities.  We are very fortunate in that respect.  The advantage of the east coast is that it is a shallower sea, so foundation offshore wind farms are possible there.  Legacy locations have been established and we can move there fairly quickly.  We have opportunities moving down the south coast and certainly on the west coast.  Floating is probably the appropriate technology for the west coast because the sea there is quite deep.  Building foundation turbines there is probably not an option, so floating turbines would be a more suitable area.</p> <p>  The technology is moving very fast.  About eight years ago, I took a small boat out to an offshore floating wind platform off the coast of Porto, Portugal, which was being funded by the European Union.  I got very seasick in the process, I have to say.  These are enormous projects.  What is in question are the shape, the size and the combination.  When we put one of these rigs in the ocean, although it is anchored to the ground, there is the question of whether it is one wind turbine or more.  Should there be anchor issues out of it to allow you to get some wave movement as well, whereby there would be not just wind but also wave and, potentially, even solar?  What is the best mix of shape and size of these structures?  It is still a little bit away from commercial but not far.  </p> <p>  Ireland is perfectly located in this regard and the opportunity exists for us because we have the wind that is required and some of the deepest ports in Europe.  We have the capacity, therefore, to take the ships we will need for this.  We need, however, a very clear plan in order that individual investors can come along and say they can provide one aspect and somebody else can say they can provide another.  It needs an holistic plan.  For example, we have deep ports but they are not large enough for the size of the turbines.  I apologise for again raising Denmark, but I had the opportunity to visit the ports there, where the harbours were lengthened to enable them to take the long turbine stems.  We have to think about that as one of the aspects.</p> <p>  Do we have the ships and the skills?  We have a fishing fleet in Ireland but we have not traditionally had a great seafaring skill in the country.  We possibly need to enhance that and to link it with the engineering side in order that we can get the benefit from it.  We need also to think about whether we are going to go with mesh or radial connections.  Radial is one to one, while mesh is a more connected processing.  If we are going to do that, we have to design it in advance and doing that is at the forefront of technology.  It is being considered for the North Sea and we should be part of that discussion because we will have the same issues in our offshore construction as we go forward.</p> <p>  Another question, for example, relates to where we will land the power and what we will use it for when it lands.  Will we have multiple electrolysers or perhaps just a few very large ones, given we will need storage capacity if we are to produce hydrogen, for example?  Where will we locate the storage capacity?  In fact, it will require a national strategic plan for the development of that resource.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct; bringing together all the expertise is the kind of step we need to take now.  There is much expertise on the policy and academic side, who have conducted the modelling as to what is involved there.  EirGrid and ESB Networks also have experience in that space.  We need to bring together that expertise to decide what the picture will look like, to make it public and, ultimately, to be able to commit to that.  It will take a few years but, as the Senator said, we need to start working on it now.  I understand that in Clare and Mayo, he is taking the lead in that context.</p></speech>

Strong engagement is taking place, to some extent without that central co-ordination.  I am certainly heartened by what Ms Donnelly is saying.  I hope that, through her good offices, she can steer the Government in a way towards developing that strategy sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

It has been a really interesting conversation and there is so much to go through.  Senator Higgins spoke about the range of the targets and how the ceiling is the top of the range we are considering.  I understand Ms Donnelly's point that sectoral targets are within the remit of the Government to set and that the council has set the overall target and given a pathway towards that.  As we start to review that work, examine the sectoral targets and make recommendations to the Government, how important will it be to have sectoral targets that go beyond the top of the range to provide a buffer?  We are considering a number of targets spread across a number of portfolios, each with its own potential, risks and challenges.  Should we go beyond the top of that range in order that if one sector fails, another can meet that shortfall?</p><p>I do not know whether the climate change committee undertook a risk analysis of the different measures and how likely they are to facilitate meeting a target, but it is an area we might need to look into.  It seems we are relying significantly on the transition to renewable energy.  What is the risk in that?  What is the likelihood of that renewable energy being in place in time?  Did the Climate Change Advisory Council do a risk analysis of all the key policies the Government could put into play?  Which ones are feasible and which are more risky, or is that something which should be done as part of the committee's work in making recommendations on the climate targets?</p></speech>

When we did our analysis, we did not have sectoral ceilings.  We did not even have sectoral ranges.  It was not for us to do the sectoral ranges.  That will ultimately be a decision for the Government.  Whether it decides that sectors overlap and achieve 110% at the high end and 90% at the low end is obviously a Government decision.</p> <p>  We looked at the kinds of policies that could be adopted, including, for example, some of the core measures that are in the climate action plan 2021.  The Department shared some of that information with us.  We looked at it.  We discussed the issues around it.  It was not for the council to say if something was a good idea or a bad idea, or if this would work and that would not.  The key single message from the analysis we did is that there is a sense of urgency and that we pretty much know what needs to be done but that we need to do it now.</p> <p>  We will publish our annual review tomorrow, which will look at Deputy Bruton's climate action plan 2019.  There are actions in that which still have not been achieved or have been delayed.  The Deputy asked what the risk is.  There is always a risk.  The advantage of the legislation adopted in July is that it states we need a budget, sectoral targets, a climate action plan that states what we will do, and that the Climate Change Advisory Council needs to monitor whether we are delivering on the policy.  That is the key issue.  When the Deputy refers to risk, that is where the risk issue is dealt with.  What we see as being our job going forward is to say, in the context of sectoral targets, what the measures are and to ask if the measures are happening on time.  If they are happening on time, the second question to ask is if the measures are delivering enough, and maybe they need to be strengthened.  The first requirement is to deliver the measure on time.  That is the serious challenge we must look at in terms of the initiatives and delivering on these numbers.  We can do it if we deliver on time.  Unfortunately, we have seen again and again that deadlines have been missed or have slipped and it has delayed things.  That is the risk management we see ourselves having to play an important role in going forward.</p></speech>

We have had so many plans and so many policies, but implementing them quickly or at all is the issue.  At what stage does the big alarm bell start ringing?  Hopefully, we are at that point now.  I thank Ms Donnelly for her answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#H00400"><p>I wish to touch on a couple of points that were raised.  I welcome Ms Donnelly to the committee.  She highlighted how essential public participation was in the transition.  From my point of view, that is why the design of the schemes we have is critical.  She referred to the importance of microgeneration and of allowing people to be part of the process of transition and understanding the energy system.  However, the Government's own analysis of the model it proposed scored zero in terms of equity when it came to microgeneration and, likewise, with the retrofitting scheme.  Retrofitting should not only reduce emissions but it should also reduce energy poverty.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's analysis of 2020 of the current Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, scheme stated that it did not have sufficient data to determine if the scheme is making an impact on energy poverty.  I would like to hear Ms Donnelly's comments on how climate justice has factored into the Climate Change Advisory Council's analysis and deliberations, and the importance of getting those schemes fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Second, I wish to pick up on the issue of data centres.  Ms Donnelly said that data centres were the lifeblood of our future modern society.  That is correct; we need data centres but, surely, we need an analysis of what type of data centres we have.  Ireland is an outlier when it comes to the number of data centres it has.  The biggest user currently in Ireland is not the HSE or people working from home; it is Amazon Web Services.  Some would argue that Amazon Web Services is not exactly critical infrastructure.  Its current model helps fossil fuel companies extract fossil fuels faster and more efficiently.  We need to look at exactly the type of data centres we have.  It is now accepted by the CEO of EirGrid that we are inviting the seven power plants to establish in Ireland to feed the demand from the data centres.  He said that to a data centre lobby group.  How does that square with the Climate Change Advisory Council's analysis?  Ms Donnelly said that the greatest reduction of overall costs of transition is reduction in demand.  We have to get that.  That is the hierarchy here.  We have to reduce that demand.  Do we need a more nuanced approach to data centres?  We know we need certain data centres but it is the type of data centres and what they are doing.  Moreover, although we signed up to the Beyond Oil &amp;amp; Gas Alliance at COP26, we are inviting in these seven new gas power plants.  Surely, that poses a risk to our targets.  Has the council looked at that?</p></speech>

At the end of the day, when we are talking about the targets, trajectories and policies involved, they will come to nothing if we do not successfully engage the hearts and minds of everybody in the country because this will impact on all of us.  It will mean a change in our behaviour and our working and living patterns going forward.  In that context, the extent of public participation is fundamental.</p> <p>  There are two issues that I would like to address.  I already spoke about retrofitting and how essential it is to target, as a priority, the worst-performing houses, particularly those that have either fuel poverty or are socially owned.  They are priority target areas for retrofitting; that is absolutely clear.  The second area I wish to refer to in terms of public participation is the extent to which people can feel the benefits of this will be spread equally and that we know that in advance.  In a way, that goes to the extent to which we have citizen dialogue around this, with citizens who are in a position to participate when they want to have their views knows and their voices heard, to see the consequences of what they say being taken into account.  That is part and parcel of the process we need to have going forward.  Some people will go with it while not really having a view.  When people have a view, they must have an opportunity to express it.  That is where the national dialogue is hugely important in outreaching to people, listening to what they say and ultimately responding to them.  I listened to Mark Foley on his consultation results on the microgeneration.  EirGrid went out with microgeneration not even on the page.  At the end of the consultation, as a consequence of listening, it came back and said that it was looking at 500 MW of microgeneration.  That is what real consultation is about, that is, where you go out with something that is not even there and you come back with a whole new section because you listened to what people said.</p><p>That is the delivery of the just transition.  It is when you listen to everybody and allow them to have their voices heard and see their voices are having an impact.<br/><br/>On climate justice, we had a full section on the just transition.  It is not to carve it up and put things into boxes but on the one hand there is the just transition, which is to ensure nobody is left behind.  The social justice then goes beyond Ireland into our role in the world and how we see our participation in the global effort in this space.  We are a small country.  Our emissions of themselves are not causing climate change.  However, just because we are a small country does not give us the opportunity to opt out.  Our emissions <i>per capita</i>, are 12 tonnes per year; the EU average is 8 tonnes.  Even in comparison to other EU states, we emit more <i>per capita</i>.  Moreover, for some poor and developing countries, we are seen as a rich, developed nation and therefore need to take our share of the effort and burden of reducing emissions.  Out of that, perhaps we will develop new techniques of doing it and sharing them with others.  We were looking at social justice in the country, leaving nobody behind, and in a global sense with regard to where Ireland fits on the global stage.  <br/><br/>It is a point of discussion about data centres.  As for my understanding of the consultation that took place, one of the questions was whether we should generate renewable energy where it is best and most cost-effective to do it, which makes sense.  It was then whether we should have the high-use demand side located close to where the power is generated or do we allow it to separate.  An important issue that came out of the consultation is an awareness that maybe we do not have to bring every electron from Donegal to Dublin for a data centre.  Maybe we can think about proximate location of data centres beside power sources to reduce grid construction, for example, and interventions in that space.  It is part and parcel of the fabric of what we are doing.  When we look at data centres, it is not just power, which is important, but also the fibre-optic cables they use.  It is a question of planning the infrastructure to combine the benefits of the natural resources we have with the opportunities we can get from data centres, as well as from manufacturing facilities, some of which might need large quantities of power.<br/><br/>Energy efficiency is clearly the way forward.  The concept that the council is thinking about and pushing a little bit is our need to tie energy efficiency to emissions reduction.  It is a double metric to apply to the initiatives and policies we put in place.  It would be unfortunate, for example, to retrofit a house, taking it from a D to a B1 or B2, and then find it is still using a fossil fuels heating system.  That sounds like a contradiction in terms but it can happen if policy is not constructed in the right way.</p></speech>

Starting off with the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, itself, in earlier stages it was insightful to get the perspective of former chairs on the working of the group.  After Ms Donnelly's initial experience, are there ways she would improve the CCAC?  Is she happy it is sufficiently resourced, has access to the necessary information, data and expertise or is that a gap that Government and others should look at?</p> <p>  This is a new process for everybody.  The council has a particular role.  It feeds into the development of the climate action plan.  There is the scientific and technical aspect and the political aspect, with a big "P" or small "p".  Ms Donnelly touched on it earlier.  How does she feel that is working, particularly from the perspective of stakeholders or the public?  Does she think local government plans or the national dialogue is the way to enhance public engagement?  This committee is about to embark on a job of work to consider the carbon budgets and is likely to hear from a very small group of people, again experts or departmental officials. </p> <p>  I share the concern of others on the emissions ranges and the potential for a combined effort not meeting 51% by 2030.  I am sure Ms Donnelly is aware 4 million tonnes are unallocated in the climate action plan.  The Government points towards the Danish approach.  Does she see that as a risk in itself?  Does it add to the other risks already there which she has mentioned?  I am interested in Ms Donnelly's perspective on that.</p> <p>  What role does Ms Donnelly see for hydrogen in supporting the transition, particularly in terms of storing offshore wind and transport?</p></speech>

I will start on the issue of membership of the council.  We have 14 members, comprising seven women and seven men with a diverse and extensive range of experience across many aspects relating to climate.  That has been a positive development that brings a lot of experience to the debate and discussion in the council.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about resources and whether we have access to data.  I have mentioned that we benefited enormously from the support of MaREI in Cork, University of Limerick, Maynooth University, UCD and TCD.  That was hugely useful.  If I may make a digressive remark, many of the models we used were built as a consequence of successful competitive bidding where they would get funding for, say, three or four years.  It is probably something we need to think about.  If you are in competitive bidding you cannot retain staff, PhD students and others.  You need a constant source of funding to do it.  That is an aside I bring in because it is important to mention it.  </p> <p>  On data generally, in the early part of this year there was a memorandum of understanding set up by the Taoiseach's Department and signed by seven other Departments and us to share data.  That is a useful initiative because we are a small island.  It does not make sense to have people going in different directions and not sharing information.  Being able to do that is a big factor and an important step forward.  </p> <p>  On resources generally, I do not suppose anyone has ever come to the committee and said they have more than enough resources.  Likewise, I will not say that.  The resources of the Climate Change Advisory Council are small.  We have recently had some supplements coming through but we need additional resources.  We have five or six sectors that we will monitor on an ongoing basis and to do that we need sectoral expertise within the secretariat.  Then there is the general overarching type of construct and legal and communication issues to look at.  Resourcing is an issue and the secretariat of the council delivered the budget on a shoestring this year.  They worked days, nights and weekends.</p><p>There were no holidays for anybody in the council secretariat until we got the budget out.  I would like to mark the contribution its members made because they worked above and beyond the call of duty.  I know they were all personally committed to delivering the budget and they did so.</p><p> In terms of other stakeholders, this is a challenge going forward.  In some councils or their equivalent in other member states there is a role for outreach to stakeholders.  It is not clear whether that is part and parcel of our role, although it is clear we should not be closed.  However, it is a small group and the resources for constructive outreach do not exist within the secretariat.  We are debating this issue.  One of the items on the agenda of our next meeting is how we will ensure, given that the annual review will comment on sectoral targets, we are able to monitor and understand what happens within each sector and how we will interact with the sectors, the relevant Department and its agencies as well as the industry and consumer groups.  What is the mechanism for doing that?  One of our current challenges is identifying the most efficient mechanism.  Do we use an existing structure and build on it or should we have our own structure?  That is one of the questions we face and the Deputy is quite right in that context.</p><p>  That is before we get to discussions with local authorities.  We have had good discussions with the local authorities on their adaptation plans but as members will know, they will now do mitigation and adaptation plans.  I presume the climate action regional offices will support them in that context as well.  The local authorities are on the ground.  They can see this happening and can support people in making the change.  Their role is hugely important in this context.  The extent to which they are integrated into the policy and the dialogue will probably be one of the most important elements going forward.  That is certainly an issue that we are considering.</p><p> The Government, rather than the council, proposed the sectoral ranges.  Like the Deputy, we would ask the question as to whether the overlaps are sufficient to ensure that in the event of failure on one side, we would get compensation on the other side.  It is an ongoing question.</p><p> The Danish black box is a question.  We know there are technologies in development and we hope they will deliver.  If we consider wind-generated electricity in 2010 versus today, it is simply not the same thing.  There is some justification for thinking we will have innovation that will help us and make things easier.  We will look carefully at the black box of 4 million tonnes because it is not an opt-out.</p><p> We need to think about hydrogen.  It is the new natural gas, if you wish.  It is currently expensive to produce and more difficult to store and ship.  However, it is flexible as a back-up for electricity and a back-up source for heat.  There is also potential for hydrogen to be the route forward for transport, particularly heavy duty transport.  The challenge is to get some sort of pan-European view because we have manufacturing facilities in Ireland where the goods are delivered to consumers on the Continent.  They are placed on a truck in Ireland and then delivered by truck.  Irrespective of which low or zero emission fuel we ultimately use in heavy-duty transport, we need to ensure it ties in with whatever happens at a European level n order that we are on board.  We also need to identify what we will use for ourselves.  Hydrogen presents a real opportunity.  There is a lot of talk about it at the moment but perhaps not enough strategic planning around it.  As I said to Senator Dooley, we need a plan.  We need to get the picture on the page so that we can see what it looks like.</p></speech>

Ms Donnelly stated that all voices needed to be heard, we must listen to everyone and a just transition and the move away from the fossil fuel industry should not involve loss of income and should involve retraining people properly and the provision of jobs.  How does the experience in Bord na M&oacute;na tie in with the climate action plan and what the CCAC would like to see happen?  Does the council intend to review that whole experience?  I ask because I view it as the first real litmus test for the Government in just transition.  I ask Ms Donnelly to comment on how this matter has been dealt with.</p> <p>  On meat production, I am also concerned about how Government policy fits in with the views of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We know the beef sector is effectively controlled by a handful of very profitable companies.  Over the years, we have heard so much about beef barons while at the same time many small farmers struggle to get by with the low prices they are paid at the farm gate.  Subsidies favour larger producers to build a model the Government has promoted to export beef and dairy to new markets.  Has the council seen a change in Government policy towards a just transition for smaller farmers and reducing emissions?</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly spoke of the need to be energy efficient while having a target to reduce emissions.  Having listened to many questions and answers about the data centres and the commitment given by the Government to develop a further 2 GW of gas, I am still struggling.  As Senator Boylan mentioned, at a recent industry conference EirGrid confirmed to the data centre industry that this 2 GW of gas-fired power is to allow them to develop and prevent them from shutting down.  Does this not contradict the ambitions of the plan and the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council?  If we adopt this policy, Ireland will lock itself into another 20 or 25 years of gas infrastructure, which flies in the face of the idea that we need to move away from this energy.</p> <p>  I am very glad to hear that Ms Donnelly described as a policy failure the shocking fact that our forestry sector has become a net emitter of CO2.  Given the repeated failures to meet the afforestation targets along with other climate-related issues such as biodiversity loss, is it now time to review the role of Coillte and revisit its mandate?  Under its current commercial model, Coillte does not favour or prioritise the environment or manage and maintain what will be valuable for us in future in terms of climate emissions?</p></speech>

It is the first really big experience in Ireland and the first lesson that the council took from that is honesty.  The situation with Bord na M&oacute;na should not have come as a surprise to anybody.  The timing was faster than some of the rhetoric had been.  However, honesty is the key issue here.  It has been known for many years that continuing to produce electricity from peat was contradictory to our climate policies.  That was known.  The extent to which honesty came into play, in terms of telling both the workers and management of the company about the reality of that and providing them with alternatives early enough, is perhaps the single lesson that must be taken from that.  We need to be honest.</p><p>We cannot hide these things or shy away from them.  In being honest, we need to put the measures in place that will support people.</p><p> The Bord na M&oacute;na case is an illustration of why we need to do it that way and how we can best do so and get it right, because similar situations, which may not be as large, will come up again in which fossil-fuel based activities will be negatively impacted by this transition.  We need to be honest with workers, their families and their communities about the long-term trend in order that they can prepare themselves and find alternative sources of income, activities and jobs.</p><p> On meat production, one of the interesting aspects, which is shown on some of the slides linked to our technical report, is we looked at where the beef industry is located in Ireland.  The Deputy is right that the dairy industry is very much to the south and west, and the beef industry is west and east but in the top half of the country.  It is not exclusively located there, of course, but a large portion of it is.</p><p> The Deputy is also right to say that we have many small farmers who are in beef production.  Many of them do not make any money from that activity.  This again comes from the Teagasc figures from the farm surveys it does every year.  The issue we need to deal with in this context is income streams for farmers.  Farmers need to be able to run their farms in a way that is profitable for them, their families and, ultimately, their communities, that is consistent with our climate action and that allows them to be innovative in the environment in which they find themselves.</p><p> For some of the small beef farmers who currently do not make money from beef and are surviving from Pillar 1 payments coming out of CAP, we should be looking at how we support them into income streams that are more beneficial for them.  That is part of some of the initiatives Teagasc has mentioned in its listing of things going forward.  I will not make comments on the structure of the industry, because the council has not discussed that in any detail. </p><p> When we look at the question of the double metrics of energy efficiency and emissions reductions, we can see that there is a challenge.  There has been much discussion about data centres and many fingers have been pointed at data centres in terms of why we had amber alerts.  We had those alerts this year because two gas-fired power stations were out of action.  This meant that we did not have the back up we would normally have had from those two stations.</p><p> We are moving forward to a very high level of renewable energy, which is a variable power source with stability and frequency challenges for the grid.  When I look at other countries that have an 80% target for 2030, such as Portugal, Austria and Denmark, all of those are interconnected with large energy markets which provide balancing services to the grid.  We do not have that.</p><p> We have, basically, the east-west interconnector the UK.  Greenlink is potentially coming on stream and, ultimately, we will have the Celtic interconnector.  We have connections with the North of Ireland, one of which has still not been built.  We do not have sufficient balancing support from outside of the island for the volume of renewable power planned in this process.</p><p> We need to develop our technology and capacity to mains stability in the grid over the decade in order that we can achieve it.  The system non-synchronous penetration, SNSP, needs to move from 75% to 90%. and even higher, in order to make it possible to have that level of renewable power in our grid.  That is why the gas-fired powered stations are being proposed.  It is stability of the grid.  Yes, we have a volume increase.  We have that increase because our economy, fortunately, is doing very well.  Our population is growing and we have data centres that will consume more energy.  However, it is not only data centres.  We predict a 20% increase in population between now and 2040.  I hope our economy will continue to do well, which is also likely to require electricity.  We are moving heating and transport into electricity.  Electricity demand will go up over the period, but we are at the forefront in respect of coping with the stability of the grid with renewable energy.  When we get it right and we will get it right, we will be the living lab for the rest of the world, as to how to integrate renewable power into the electricity system.  This is a short-term fix for the technology gap we have, which needs to be plugged at this time.</p><p> The issue with forestry is that private planting rates have fallen off.  Part of why I say the policy needs to be addressed is because the incentives for farmers and landowners to invest in forestry are obviously not working and need to be adjusted to make it attractive.  It is a source of carbon farming for farmers, but they need to get the income stream and the reward out of it.  They also need the incentives and structures in place that will allow them to devote parts of their land to forestry development over the period.  This is one of the issues that has been identified in the climate action plan, but the new policy is only foreseen for 2023.  Perhaps that could be enhanced in the context of timing.</p></speech>

We will be locked into fossil fuel use for at least 20 years if we increase our gas production.  We have been told in replies to parliamentary questions and by meeting industry representatives that private planters of forests cannot get licences.  The size of the backlog shows that they are not the problem.  There are so many applications for private planting of forests that people are screaming at us to do something about it.  I do not think that is the problem and I am surprised by a few of Ms Donnelly's answers on those issues.</p></speech>

That was not the intention and it is certainly not the message I would like to portray.  What I am saying is we need to ensure an income stream for small farmers who currently are not making money out of beef.  That is the message we have.  We need to look at the alternatives available to farmers in that context.</p> <p>  On the forestry, when I say the policy is not working, the policy is holistic and if the policy does not allow licences to be issued, we need to revisit it.  The implication was not that private people were not doing it.  The issue is that if our administrative structures are not able to deliver the volume we need, we have to revisit our administrative structures, including how we issue licences, in what form and how long it takes.  Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear on that one.  That is the message.  It is not a criticism of Coillte or private landowners.  Our system is wrong and, as a result, we need to revisit it.</p></speech>

It is lovely to see her here.  I thank her for taking so much time over our questions.  I have a few specific questions.  I will start off by asking what Ms Donnelly's thoughts are on the issue to the effect that we have to have a transition.  Some of these measures we are talking about are in the context of wind energy but there are also some other transitions required in respect of other areas, such as horticulture.  How important is it to give a clear message that we cannot just turn off the lights and that we have to have transitions?</p><p>I refer as well to communicating that the rhetoric about this process locking us in is not correct, and that it will, instead, enable us to achieve energy and food security for our island in future.  My first point, therefore, concerns the importance of communications and the language we all use in this context and of not scaremongering.  </p><p> Turning to results-based schemes in agriculture, we had a session on that topic previously.  Ms Donnelly spoke earlier about the importance of farming paying.  It clearly is not doing so now for many farmers.  We must consider a move to a form of agriculture that not only protects the environment but that also gives more to farming families than they receive now.  I refer to there being opportunities in this regard for farmers, and young farmers in particular.  At another session, we had representatives from Macra na Feirme before the committee.  They said that access to ecologists is something that would support them.  Therefore, I think people, including farmers, are coming on board with this process.  It is good to hear that.  They must, however, be supported through this process of change.  We are a leader when it comes to results-based schemes, albeit that only a small part of our land is involved.</p><p> Moving on to the cost of renewables, and specifically regarding the cost of the energy coming from renewables, is it true to say that, over time, it will be the cheapest possible form of energy we can provide?  Investment is required at this stage to bring that about, but we will come out of that process without our previous over-reliance on fossil fuels and international markets.  Equally, it is also cheaper to produce renewable energy.</p><p> Ms Donnelly spoke about my final point already, which concerns the importance of our ports infrastructure.  I come from Galway, and the west coast is where the wind is.  We must see investment in infrastructure to enable us to capitalise on our greatest asset for a greener future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#M00200"><p>On the subject of communication regarding the transition, the Senator is absolutely right.  One thing the council is concerned about, as the Senator rightly said, is to move away from constantly conveying a threat or a frightening story about climate action.  We are moving down a trajectory which will deliver a better place.  We are not doing this to bring about more negative lives in ten or 20 years.  We are doing this so that we will have better lives, with cleaner air, clear water, comfortable homes and quiet cities so that we can sleep at night.  From an economic perspective, we will be producing our own energy, be that electricity, liquid fuels or whatever, using our own natural resources.  Our land will be being worked in a circular process, where we can use the products of our land for food, bioenergy or nature in a way that will support the land and those managing it in an economic way.</p> <p>  What we are striving for, then, is a better world.  There are certain things that we must try to prevent and react to on the way to achieving that goal.  Therefore, adaptation will certainly be important.  Overall, however, what we are trying to achieve here is a better world.  Part of the difficulty in communicating that perspective is that we are moving toward significant societal change by announcing it first.  In that regard, let us take the examples of two transitions that societies have gone through in the past.  We went through the Industrial Revolution, which fundamentally changed the world as it was known, but nobody announced at the beginning of that transition that we were about to go through it and that the change would involve X, Y and Z and cost however much.  The Industrial Revolution happened via evolution and we all moved with it.  As a result, we find ourselves in the world we are in today.  Equally, we also went through the process of digitalisation.  Nobody sat down in 1990 and asked if we could afford to undertake digitalisation, did we really want it and what were the negatives involved in such change.  It just happened and that change evolved around us.  It cost a lot of money, but it all happened and now we find ourselves in a world where we see the results of digitalisation as being normal.  It is part and parcel of our world.</p> <p>  Climate action transition will lead us to a world that we will see as normal.  To some extent, however, we are doing this in a planned and upfront way and this is something we are not used to.  Therefore, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly is absolutely right that we need to handle the messaging in this regard.  We need to "descarify" it, if I can use that term, and start to explain why we are doing this and what positive developments will emerge from doing it.  It is going to be an expensive transition.  All these types of transitions were expensive.  However, they lead to a better world.  I can say that with confidence because we as people will ensure that it will be a better world.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in stating that.  The Senator is correct that getting that message across in our communications is a challenge.</p> <p>  When I look at results-based schemes, every farmer I have met has been very pro his or her land, as the case may be, the environment and the protection of the land.  Virtually every farmer I have ever met has said that he or she is only the caretaker for the next generation.  Therefore, farmers are not out to do damage to the land.  They want to do things right and to farm in a sustainable way.  Again, the Senator is correct, however, that, in just the same way as farming technologies evolved over several years, we are now moving into a space where the technologies of sustainable farming will also advance.  That is where we will rely greatly on policies coming from the Department, research coming from Teagasc and on the Teagasc advisers going out and talking to and explaining to farmers what all this is about.</p> <p>  Teagasc's Signpost programme initiative is very good because it involves 100 farms that farmers can visit and see, feel and touch what sustainable farming looks like.  They can ask questions about how it works, what it means and what the differences are.  That is important, and it will not just be in agriculture but in our daily lives and how we live as well.  The role of the public sector, for example, will be important in this regard in respect of buildings.  It will be important that we as citizens can see the benefits of retrofitting in buildings that are owned by the public sector.  In a way, such buildings are the lighthouses that will allow us to see the benefits in this context.  That is also important in respect of communications around this area.  Rewarding that kind of initiative is of course the right way to go forward.</p> <p>  Moving on to renewables, we must be careful to say that the resulting energy will be cheaper.  It will be cheaper, because, logically, when we look at renewable sources of energy, the investment is all on the capital side.  The operational and fuel costs of such operations are very low.  Once the capital investment has been allocated, we will then be in a situation where we will see the benefits of having very low operational and maintenance costs.  Conversely, operational and maintenance costs in energy generation from fossil fuels are more than 50% of the overall costs.</p> <p>  Therefore, the benefits in this regard are very real and they will manifest in future, but there will need to be expenditure first.  We have not done the figures for Ireland, but I have looked at the information that the climate council in the UK has published.  It shows levels of investment continuing up to about 2032.  It then starts to decline and a surplus is being generated by 2050.  We have not done comparative calculations for Ireland, but there is no reason to suppose that we would not have a similar trajectory to what is being forecast in the UK.  Therefore, the Senator is right that these technologies are greatly advantageous, not only due to being sustainable but also because they look to be economical and useful to society in the longer term.</p> <p>  Finally, to address the point about ports infrastructure, we must decide what it is we want to have in the ports.  We must decide what benefits we are going to derive from the great resource that we have off the west coast.  Equally, we must determine how we are going to use it, where we are going to land that power and how we are going to deal with it once we have landed it.  This brings us back to what we were talking about earlier with Senator Dooley regarding getting the picture and presenting it page by page so that people can see what it will mean in future.  </p></speech>

Of all the issues remaining, wind energy is the one that I am most passionate about and intrigued by.  Ms Donnelly has well covered that aspect, though, so I will skip over that topic and ask three questions regarding her views and those of the council.</p><p>Does she believe that hydrogen has any role to play in the domestic heating market?  How long does she think natural gas will play a role in our energy market in the context of wind energy interconnectors and other energy sources?  Is there space in the future for a fact-based debate on nuclear power, given the EU seems now as if it may classify it as a green energy?</p></speech>

It is currently very expensive.  Electrolysers to produce it need to be developed further to become much more efficient than they currently are.  Even with that, it is looking at this stage as if hydrogen will still be an expensive gas.  Domestic heating is currently between 2 cents and 4 cents per kWh.  Hydrogen is likely to cost in excess of 30 cents per kWh.  Economically speaking, to put hydrogen into the domestic heating system would be a very expensive proposition, going forward.  That could change, of course, if we get very efficient and have a lot of green hydrogen but, at the moment, it would be an difficult economic burden for consumers to have to pay that kind of price for their heating systems.  The alternatives of district heating systems using the surplus heat from the data centres that nobody likes, heat pumps and biomass, where relevant, are more economic options for domestic heating systems in our current array of technologies.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the longevity of natural gas and it is a difficult question to answer.</p></speech>

We have fantastic targets for renewable energy that I hope we can achieve.  However, we must keep the lights on and with all the interconnectors in the world, we are still reliant on the energy grids of others and, ultimately, gas from potentially volatile areas.  On that basis, how long will it be before we have to say we cannot necessarily rely on Russian gas or gas fields in our own jurisdiction?  What do we do at that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021120700002#N00400"><p>That is probably more of an issue for the EU than for Ireland.  The Corrib gas field is going to last for another little while.  We have the gas pipes coming off it in Scotland that are largely drawing Norwegian gas.  It is a big issue for Europe right now with Nord Stream 1 in place and a question as to whether Nord Stream 2 will open, and the trans-Ukrainian pipe.  This is likely to become a geopolitical question as much as a climate question.  We seem to be heading in this direction more swiftly now than on any previous occasion.  As the committee knows, in January 2009, the Russians turned off the trans-Ukrainian pipe for two weeks.  It provoked a crisis and then it was resolved.  This time it is probably a bigger crisis and a bigger issue.  Part of the difficulty is that none of us in the EU is in a position to walk away from gas today.  We are working towards that but right now, it is not clear how long that journey will take.  That is part of the reason for the geopolitics around gas at the moment.</p> <p>  I also make the point that if we in Ireland continue to use gas, Corrib may end up depleted in a period of time.  We have two pipes coming off it in Scotland and that is it.  We have no other source of gas in the country.  We have no LNG terminal in Ireland.  The issue of security of supply if we continue using gas is a real issue that needs to be to the fore of our considerations.  While I know the rationale for the gas-fired power stations to maintain the stability of the grid, the Deputy is correct to point to a question mark over the security of the source of the supply of gas over the longer-term for electricity and, ultimately, heating in Europe and Ireland.</p></speech>

Does the council see that as a necessity to mitigate the problems that might arise should something happen, for instance, in the Norwegian gas field to limit supply directly to us via Scotland?  Perhaps it may be redirected elsewhere.  That is, of course, not something one would imagine the EU would permit, but who is to say what might happen in the future.  Should the State, therefore, not be ensuring that we have longevity in that supply, given it is critical for Ireland at present?  That may change, but at present it is critical that we have sustainable energy sources to keep the lights on.</p></speech>

If we were to find ourselves in such a difficulty, I would have thought our European neighbours will assist us with the loan of, for example, a floating LNG terminal.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about nuclear power.  Permit me to be a little impolitic.  It is not a surprise that Europe would accept nuclear power as green.  We have a very large member state that is almost exclusively dependent on nuclear power.  The likelihood is that it would be persuasive in its arguments to include nuclear power on the list.  Nuclear power, of itself, does not emit greenhouse gases but the difficulty is what can be done with the nuclear waste.  That is a serious challenge.  Small-scale nuclear is being developed and perhaps it will be useful, going forward.  We will have to wait and see.</p></speech>

The Celtic interconnector is going to be almost exclusively nuclear power, coming into Ireland anyway.  Is there a place for a debate?  If it were to arise, when would Ms Donnelly anticipate that debate taking place?  Will it be in a decade or will it take longer?</p></speech>

What will they look like?  What will they feel like?  What will they operate like?  What is the implication around them?  We are not there yet.  It is new technology.  It is hard to say whether it will take ten years to develop.</p></speech>

It has been intense and, in fairness, the answers have not been brief; they have been full of detail.  There are members offering for a second round of questioning if she is up for continuing.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the point about LNG.  There seems to be a suggestion that LNG terminals actually increase security, which is not the case because those boats are sailing around and can go where they want.  Surely the point is to reduce demand and the need for the gas in the first place.  We keep having the circular argument that brings us back to the point that we have to reduce demand.</p> <p>  I was going to come in on the nuclear point but I think Ms Donnelly has answered that question.  I just wanted to make the point that LNG terminals do not increase security and it is a bit of a non-argument in terms of energy security.  It would be different if she had a different view on the infrastructure and so on.  Does she support the view that LNG does not necessarily increase energy security?</p></speech>

As I said, it is a very expensive belt-and-braces option.  There are other mechanisms that we could and should use.  It would be at least &euro;1 billion in spending; we could probably spend that in other ways more effectively.</p></speech>

Nowhere is it more apparent than here in Ireland.  There is a continuing debate and some uncertainty about the role of this committee, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, in addressing the biodiversity crisis.  For me and for most people there is a clear link between the biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis as well as the role that biodiversity and nature-based solutions might play in achieving our 2% reduction target and carbon neutrality but also in terms of the budget that the Climate Change Advisory Council has suggested.  I ask Ms Donnelly to comment on the biodiversity crisis and nature-based solutions.  What is the role, if any, of the Climate Change Advisory Council in addressing the biodiversity crisis and advising on the best ways to increase habitats and biodiversity and stop species loss?</p></speech>

We got some very good input from experts in different parts of the country on that.  We have some experts on the council which also helps.</p> <p>  Inadvertently our biodiversity sites are being damaged through lack of awareness.  One of the first things we need to do is increase awareness and sensitivity in not just the commercial sector and development sector, but also in local authorities which are involved at a local level through planning activities.  We have seen that it is possible to marry economic development with careful management of biodiversity if it is done properly.  That was the key issue that came out of the analysis the council did as part of the process.</p> <p>  Our policy on land use in Ireland is possibly the area where the gap is most evident.  Ireland does not yet have a developed land-use policy.  In the absence of that, it would be very hard to address the questions of biodiversity and a species loss.  We would be very supportive of the development of a land-use policy so that we can establish the baseline, understand where we are starting from, understand where the pressure points are and put in place the correct measures to ensure that we get it right with land use, development, maintenance and sustainability to protect our biodiversity.  That will include, for example, what kind of species we should be planting in our forests.  We need to plant more but we need to determine which species to plant in our forestry development.  It is an area of real concern for the council.  We received extensive research input to the discussions before we made proposals for the budget.</p></speech>

The members' comments and questions were most helpful.  We are entirely at the committee's disposal.  That includes me, members of the council and the secretariat.  The committee should let us know if it requires answers to any questions, papers or other information and we will provide them.  We would like to maintain an ongoing dialogue.  We regard the committee as pivotal in this process.  We would like to be able to work with the committee to support it insofar as we can with our scientific analysis and advice.  We would like to see the dialogue and partnership develop.  As I said to others, Ireland is a small island and if we work together, we can really deliver results.  Let us not go in different directions.  I hope we can build on and develop this relationship in the future.</p></speech>

Otherwise we will proceed.  As this is a public meeting the chat function on MS Teams should only be used to advise participants of any technical issue and not for general comments or statements.  I remind members who are participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When people are speaking I ask that where possible they have their camera switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.</p> <p>  I welcome representatives from Crosscare and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  I welcome Sr. Breege Keenan, project leader, Crosscare refugee service; Mr. Noel Neenan, information and advocacy officer, housing and welfare information with Crosscare; and Mr. Brian Killoran, chief executive officer of the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  The purpose of the meeting this afternoon is to engage with experiences of migrant communities engaging with State bodies, the healthcare system and other social services.</p> <p>  Before inviting our guests to deliver their opening statements I will go through parliamentary privilege.  As the witnesses are all appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out there is uncertainty whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  The opening statements will be followed by questions and answers with members.  A speaking rota was circulated to members in advance.  Members will be allocated five minutes of speaking time.  We are low on numbers today so while I will stick with the five minutes we are likely to get through that quite quickly so there will be chances for other members to come back for second or even third rounds of questions if they wish.  There will be some flexibility there.  I now ask Sr. Keenan to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

Mr. Neenan and I work in Crosscare information and advocacy services, CIAS, which consists of three projects: our housing and welfare information, our refugee service and the migrant project.  While the three projects have discrete target groups and areas of expertise, we work collaboratively on crosscutting issues and work towards a common goal of increased stability and quality of life for vulnerable and marginalised populations.  We work with EEA and non-EEA migrants, refugees, family members of refugees and Irish nationals who return with their non-EU family members.  CIAS takes a multipronged approach to addressing the needs of migrants which includes direct information and support; capacity building of service providers and influencing policy through shared learning, networking and advocacy.</p> <p>  Organisations like Crosscare and the Immigrant Council of Ireland are some of the most trusted ones among migrant communities.  While we sometimes have to critique statutory bodies and advocate strongly on behalf of our clients when they cannot access their rights and entitlements, we are involved in many initiatives in partnership with Government Departments and agencies. </p> <p>  From March 2020 we reconfigured our work so that we could support our clients remotely, retaining in-person meetings for clients with literacy, language and digital literacy issues.  This was only possible due to the experience and knowledge gained over years of close work with migrant communities, and a real awareness of their unique needs.  In 2020, more than 11,000 people from more than 5,000 households and from 125 countries benefited from our services.  </p> <p>  Our work is becoming more challenging as State bodies move many services online.  While these are effective for those who are skilled and digitally capable, they can form very significant barriers for many migrants where language, literacy, access to devices and digital skills are not present and the migrant is alienated and left behind.  Migrants who come to work must register online with Revenue and with the Department of Social Protection for a PPS number.  Non-EEA migrants need to register with Immigration Service Delivery, ISD, to obtain their Irish residence permit, IRP, card and for a PPS number, among other things.  For all online services migrants need to have an email address and assumptions are made as to their understanding of English and digital skills.</p> <p>  We are culturally sensitive to the needs of migrants and take an intercultural approach which is about making the unfamiliar more familiar and understanding what it is like to walk in somebody else&rsquo;s shoes.  Many officials fail to recognise the effect migration has on an individual and how his or her experiences in his or her country of origin can impact on his or her engagement with State bodies.  For example, a refugee received a phone call from an official who told her quite simply that if she found a job and was working she would not be depressed.  Many refugees and migrants are victims of unspeakable atrocities which make them vulnerable to depression and post-traumatic stress.</p> <p>  The absence of appropriate levels of interpreter services directly impacts the capacity for certain vulnerable migrant households to engage with and be served by State bodies.  Our 2018 research document, "Do you speak English?", explored the extent to which the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s policy to provide interpreters was implemented and accessed by customers.  It showed limited use of interpreters, and in many cases children effectively providing these services.  It is wrong to have children interpreting for their parents, due the sensitive issues that have to be discussed.  We believe that all migrants should be able to communicate in their own native language.  The Department of Social Protection is one of the few public services that has a publicly available interpreting facility.  For example, local authorities and the Department of Justice do not appear to have any interpreter services.</p> <p>  Evidence shows that migrants are disproportionately impacted by the housing and homelessness crisis.  While making up less than a fifth of the population nationally, migrants represent one third of the homeless population in the Dublin region.</p><p>Non-EU migrants have the additional layer of immigration residency permission that can limit their ability to access social services.  This is most likely to become evident in situations of crisis that precipitate homelessness; for example, family breakdown, domestic violence and family members joining their sponsor under the International Protection Act 2015.<br/><br/>While cognisant of limited resources, we see some concerning evidence of families being split across emergency shelter provision.  A refugee presented to a local authority and there was no hostel available to accommodate the sponsor with his family, who had just arrived in Ireland from a war-torn country and were unable to speak English.  When he contacted the local authority, he wrote in a WhatsApp message:</p><blockquote>	I ring the number.  She&rsquo;s gone mad.  She&rsquo;s telling me that if I couldn&rsquo;t afford then why did you bring your family to Ireland.  I couldn&rsquo;t let them die in...  she said she&rsquo;s gonna speak to someone and she will call me back.  I hope that she will ring me back. </blockquote><p>Later, when he contacted us again, he said: </p><blockquote>	They did find a place for my wife and daughter but she is crying, she doesn&rsquo;t want to go [there] alone.  I am trying to make her understand. </blockquote><p>The above example illustrates to us a service provider under extreme pressure who also appears to have no cultural understanding of what that family had gone through.  Despite migrants being disproportionately impacted by the housing crisis, there is no mention of housing and homelessness in the current migrant integration strategy.  Crosscare has campaigned to have it included in the next strategy and is hopeful it will be given due consideration.<br/><br/>Local authorities' reliance on the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's housing Circular 41/2012, Access to social housing supports for non-Irish nationals, has long been a factor in barring access to social housing supports including emergency shelter for migrants.  The circular is not law but it is relied on by local authorities to assess applications and its guidance is used in an inflexible way to refuse social housing applications, including access to emergency accommodation for migrants who do not fit clearly within one of the categories contained in the circular.  While progress has been made in relation to access to emergency shelter, access routes remain unclear and migrants report a hostile environment when trying to access such supports.<br/><br/>I will now speak on the social protection system linked to the immigration system.  Non-EU migrants applying to the Department of Social Protection for payments must have a right to reside in the State in order to satisfy the eligibility criteria for means-tested payments.  Once right to reside is established, they can proceed to be assessed under the habitual residence condition in order to access assistance payments.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection requests that they provide a permission letter from the Department of Justice detailing the conditions of their immigration permission.  Not all migrants have permission letters because many register directly with an immigration officer.  There may be changes over the years in standard lengths of permission initially granted and in the wording of letters, which can make it confusing for Department of Social Protection staff to ascertain whether a person is able to renew their permission.  This is an example of two Departments having different rules and understanding of each other&rsquo;s processes and the impact is felt by the migrant applicant. <br/><br/>The freedom of movement of workers is intrinsic to the success of the European Union.  EU nationals have no automatic Irish social welfare entitlements on arrival in the state.  Directive 2004/38/EC sets out that EU nationals have a right to reside in another member state for three months, so long as they do not become a burden on the social assistance system of the state.  In order to legally reside for longer than three months, they must be a worker, self-employed person or have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members.  Being recognised as economically active or being the family member of another EU citizen with a right to reside can support more direct access to rights and entitlements without the need to satisfy the habitual residence condition, but difficulties often arise.<br/><br/>Overall, migrants can experience difficulties accessing services in the first instance.  Difficulties with the correct and consistent application of the right to reside and the habitual residence condition are ongoing.  Continuing issues arise due to a lack of front-line awareness of migrants&rsquo; vulnerabilities around culture, language, literacy and digital challenges.  This extends into job seeking and activation supports offered by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>We have the following recommendations.  There should be intercultural awareness training to ensure staff in State bodies are supported and equipped to work with diverse population groups and publicly available protocols.  There should be operational guidelines between all State bodies working with migrants, especially the immigration service delivery of the Department of Justice, local authorities and the Department of Social Protection.  The deployment of digital services must be sensitised to vulnerable groups.  Interpreting services should be readily, widely and on a timely basis available to migrants accessing State bodies.  A professional qualification for interpreters like in the UK where they have a diploma in public service interpreting should be developed.  Department of Social Protection officials, services and supports need more support around migrant rights and entitlements and services need to be sensitised to migrant vulnerabilities and need for targeted measures.  The immigration service delivery in the Department of Justice could provide a clear breakdown of relevant immigration permissions, how permission letters may differ and how permissions can be renewed, including clear references to the fact that some permission letters instruct renewal with local immigration officers and not in writing.  In relation to homeless services, access to homeless services must be aligned with the assessment laid down in primary legislation.  On social housing, housing Circular 41/2012 must be updated to ensure that it reflects the relevant changes in Irish immigration law, such as the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 and relevant case law.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for listening.  </p></speech>

As a front-lline, non-governmental organisation and independent law centre offering services to migrant communities in Ireland for 20 years, the Immigrant Council of Ireland is very well placed to reflect upon the theme of today's hearing and offer our analysis of some of the issues that present to our services.</p> <p>  In 2020 and 2021, we have consistently provided legal representation to over 200 legal cases through our independent law centre function and responded to over 5,000 headline queries to our national telephone helpline.  In terms of our legal representation, the cases that we represent range across the whole area of the immigration system.  We have attained particular capacity for extreme vulnerability within that system, primarily around gender-based violence issues, such as supports to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and victims of domestic violence, as well as issues of unaccompanied minors who are in the State and have legal needs. </p> <p>  The lens of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated impact it has had on both the lives of migrant communities in Ireland and the services with which they interact cannot be overstated and in many ways have magnified and intensified some of the long-standing issues in how we as a State support migrants here.  While I am speaking mainly on the experiences of migrants and interacting with the immigration system, our experience touches on many areas of relevance to the topic being looked at today.</p><p>As Sr. Breege Keenan's opening remarks touched on, immigration status, rights and entitlements constitute a theme that cuts across much integration experiences and rights and entitlements that flow for a person from that immigration status.  In 2020 and 2021, the administration of our immigration system in Ireland has strained under the pressure of its bureaucratic nature.  In some instances it has ground to a halt, not only for those seeking to come to Ireland but for those for whom Ireland is home.</p><p> A prominent issue regards the registration of non-EEA nationals who are legally residing in Ireland on various immigration permissions.  With the closure of the Burgh Quay registration office in Dublin under public health restrictions and the associated closure of registration offices across the country, those who needed to renew their immigration permission were unable to do so.  That situation has resolved somewhat but the impact remains in terms of people's inability to get appointments for registration, as well as the online registration system being difficult to navigate and, unfortunately, still plagued by bots and extreme delays for people renewing and registering initial permissions to remain in the State.</p><p> The Department of Justice correctly issued statements confirming blanket renewals of all immigration permissions for those impacted, but the inability to have an in-date registration card caused and continues to cause huge problems.  Our services have seen people who have lost their job as their card was expired and their employer did not understand the situation and did not want to do anything wrong by employing someone who could not present a valid, in-date immigration permission.  We have seen people interview for roles they were successful in getting but could not take up as they could not convince an employer of the nature of their legal residency without a registration card.  We have repeatedly seen people go to social welfare offices and be asked to produce a valid, in-date certificate of registration, their Garda registration card, which it was impossible for them to do through no fault of their own.  Registration issues have been problematic and the overall processing of applications in the immigration system has slowed down considerably in the last two years.</p><p> While that is understandable to the extent that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all of us, whether individual members of the public or Departments and State services, we are still dealing with the fall-out from that situation and the magnifying effect it had on highlighting the bureaucracy and inefficiency of the immigration system. </p><p> All the issues mentioned are magnified manyfold for those particularly marginalised in the system, namely, those in direct provision, victims of human trafficking, migrant women in domestic violence circumstances, unaccompanied minors and many more.  In addition, those with linguistic, computer literacy or overall trauma challenges, for example, are further disenfranchised. </p><p> We may say this situation is a moment in time but it highlights endemic issues that predate the pandemic.  First, there is the overly bureaucratic and paper-based nature of many of our immigration processes.  Second, there is a lack of clarity regarding rights and entitlements that often accompany a person&rsquo;s immigration status.  Third, there is the issue of communication and co-ordination across Government services and Departments regarding an individual&rsquo;s status and rights.  It is true that the pandemic was and continues to be a uniquely difficult scenario for all, including Departments.  We welcomed throughout the pandemic open lines of communication with the Department of Justice, for example, regarding the difficulties faced.  However, the challenges were huge and persist in having an ongoing impact.</p><p> The issues experienced magnified an existing need for which we and others in civil society have been calling for many years, namely, the need to modernise and reform our immigration system in Ireland.  We note and welcome that the Department of Justice has identified immigration reform as a priority in its current action plan and welcome the opportunity to feed into that process from our experience as a service provider, as I am sure many other civil society organisations, community groups, migrant-led groups and others will as well.  </p><p> As regards the remit of this committee, we wish to highlight the reality that an individual&rsquo;s integration experience is often intrinsically linked to their immigration status and the rights which flow from it.   </p><p> Time does not permit me to go into further detail, but I am happy to discuss these issues and our recommendations for reform in follow-up questions, as well as pointing out the positives that exist and the opportunities that arise through the likes of the migrant integration strategy, as Sr. Breege mentioned.</p><p> I would like to raise the issue of the communication of health, in particular vaccine, information to migrant communities and the deficiencies that have been identified in that area of late.  This issue is not just one of information, but of challenging disinformation within certain sections of migrant communities.  A strategy is needed in this area that directly engages migrants at grassroots levels, with migrant-led organisations, leaders and migrant-relevant media being targeted to address the shortfalls in the communication strategy of the last two years.  Again, time does not permit me to go into further detail on this, but I am happy to discuss it in follow up.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I am happy to discuss the positives and our recommendations in follow-up questions. </p></speech>

I have three questions.  First, regarding the current paper-based immigration system the witnesses have raised as an issue, what do they suggest instead?  What would be a preferable immigration system or process and what would they like to see implemented?  Second, regarding the lack of communication of vaccine information to migrant communities, is there an example or figure demonstrating the impact this is having on vaccine uptake in those communities?  What has been the cause of the increased spread of vaccine disinformation in migrant communities?  Third, regarding the issue of communication of rights and entitlements to migrant populations, can examples be given of the real-world impact this is having?  What particularly important rights and entitlements need to be but are not being communicated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr.  Brian Killoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#C00300"><p>While "paper-based immigration system" may be a bit of a catch-all term, essentially we mean there is a high level of bureaucracy in the system.  Some of it is digitised while some of the application processes are very paper-based and document-heavy.  One answer is digitisation.  That has an impact on the ability of some members of the community to access it but overall it would give people from a migrant background the ability to make applications online, submit documents online and check the status of applications online and to do so in secure formats that will not require, for example, repeated written correspondence with the Department of Justice checking the status of an application or correspondence back and forth with officials in the Department looking for documentation and sometimes requesting documentation that already has been submitted.</p> <p>  Some of it is about the channels into the Department of Justice in terms of how people communicate things, but it is also about communication within the Department regarding a person's status and the documents that have been submitted.  An example will come up where somebody has gone through five years of legal residency in the State, registered his or her presence, submitted his or her documents, met all the terms and conditions through the years and then applies for Irish citizenship at the end of it.  He or she will go through the citizenship process and will have to submit everything again.  Such people have to get documents from one part of the Department and submit them to another part.  That level of communication is bureaucratically difficult on the applicant and it is a massive drain on State resources to go through this level of double and triple bureaucracy in some cases.</p> <p>  Some of that has improved of late.  The Department of Justice, in the case of citizenship, has not required people to submit their passport again.  Small tweaks and changes can make a big difference.  We urge the Department as part of its commitment to immigration reform-----</p></speech>

Our own organisation does a lot of work with grassroots migrant communities and, from what the leaders of those groups say to us, a lot of the issue is that because of the nature of the pandemic over the last two years, migrant communities have to a certain extent gone into a situation of relying upon themselves again because of the reduced levels of interaction, inability to go to work and inability to do normal things.  Within that, the channels the people rely upon for information include social media and media channels, some of which come from their own home countries.  In many of those home countries, there is a high level of vaccine scepticism but also a high level of vaccine disinformation.  That needs to be looked at, analysed, and challenged.  We need leaders from migrant communities to be empowered to engage with their own communities around those issues and get back to the situation where we can address some of the shortfall in that area.</p> <p>  On the real-world impact, Sr. Keenan and I touched upon this in our initial interventions.  There is very little, if any, communication across Government Departments as regards what a person&rsquo;s rights or entitlements are.  The Department of Justice will issue somebody with immigration status but when the person goes to the social protection office, in some instances it is clear but if there is anything in question whatsoever, they will have to go through a very bureaucratic rigmarole with another Government Department to explain again what their immigration status is and what their rights and entitlements should be.  There are numerous barriers.  For example, somebody might be on a type of permission from the Department of Justice which is based on the Minister's discretion but does not fit into a clear category.  If that person applies to get a SUSI grant because they want to go to third level education, SUSI can say it is not clear enough in terms of describing what the person&rsquo;s immigration status is and, therefore, they do not qualify for the SUSI grant.  We see this a lot with victims of trafficking.  It is an example of that lack of communication.  Each Government Department is siloed to a large extent and there needs to be co-ordination across Departments so as not to impede a person's integration.  Sr. Keenan might want to add to that.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work they do, and very difficult work it must be.  I am sure I speak for the Vice Chairman and all of the other members of this committee when I say we will be only too happy to offer any support and assistance that we are able to give.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions of a general nature.  The first concerns the two groups represented here today.  A bugbear of mine across the political spectrum is that we seem to have a lot of groups on every issue.  Are there many other groups in the field of migrant support and help, and do they co-operate with each other?  From what I see, they do, given the interaction between Mr. Killoran and our other two witnesses.  I welcome that and I ask if it is generally the case across the board.  Having too many cooks to spoil the broth is a bugbear I have about most things like this.</p> <p>  How do the witnesses find the attitude of State agencies to migrants in general and to the work of the migrant support organisations in particular?  I am talking about the Civil Service, politicians like us and, in particular at local level, the local councillors.  How do such organisations relate to the State and how do they find the attitude of State bodies?  There might be some outstanding good examples of that co-operation that the witnesses could mention to us, if they are there.</p> <p>  I note from the presentation by Sr. Keenan that the work of her organisation is mostly in counties Wicklow and Dublin.  Is it very much an east coast problem?  Naturally, the metropolitan area and the greater Dublin area would be the first point of entry for immigrants.  Are there support services that her organisation supplies or offers on a nationwide basis?  Given I am a Kerry man, perhaps the south west is an example.</p> <p>  I take on board that language difficulties must be a very serious problem.  There are so many languages.  We all know who the main immigrant groups are from our own communities.  I know there is a very sizeable Polish community in my area and I picked up a few little bits of Polish in my time, not that it would get me very far in Warsaw on holidays.  There must be a lot of minor languages out there and it must be difficult to have interpreters for each and every single one of the languages.  Did the witnesses ever consider bringing out a small handy booklet of vocabulary that could be given to people arriving, no matter what language they speak?  It might be multifunctional, with just the basics, for example, &ldquo;Where is this place?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do I cross the road?&rdquo;, and so on.</p> <p>  The housing area is a big problem for both organisations here today and is probably the biggest problem the whole country is facing at the moment.  With regard to the provision of social housing, do the organisations find resistance from local communities?  I have to say that, anecdotally, I pick up some resistance when houses are being allocated to people with strange sounding names from faraway places, and the locals wonder if they are being squeezed out.  I know a lot of that is very unfair, and I am giving a flippant enough outline of it.  However, I am sure it must be an issue.</p> <p>  As to the migrants themselves, what is their attitude to us in Ireland generally?  Do the witnesses find they have respect for this country?   Do they accept our ways and are they happy enough to assimilate into our lifestyle and the way we do things?  In particular, do they respect our laws?  Again, any crime that is committed by a foreign national always seems to get the headline and, no more than with the Traveller community, that is very unfair.  In general, do the witnesses find they are anxious to blend in with the community here in Ireland?</p> <p>  In that respect, and I know vaccinations have been mentioned, what is their attitude to vaccination generally?  Do migrants tend to see it as something that we in Ireland provide for them and if they are staying as our guests, to a certain extent, they would go along with it, or are they resistant to it?</p> <p>  I have asked a mouthful of questions there and I have some more if the witnesses want to follow up later.</p></speech>

The five minutes are supposed to be for the questions and the answers.  Given we have quite a few apologies, as I said, I will be flexible but we have gone way over time.  We can come back to the issues once we have got through everyone.  I ask our guests to respond as quickly as possible.  I call Sr. Keenan.</p></speech>

We have quite a number of meetings and we are involved in meetings with Government Departments.  While Crosscare is based in Dublin and Wicklow, we receive calls from all around the country and, as we work with Irish people returning with their non-Irish partners, we also work outside of Ireland, if one likes.  I know the Immigrant Council of Ireland has a remit for all of Ireland.  In the south, our compatriots down there are Nasc in Cork, Doras Luimn&iacute; and COPE in Galway.</p><p>They are the national organisations we work with.  I will pass over to Mr. Neenan in order that we all have an opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Neenan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#E00200"><p>The Deputy has raised very important questions, because he has touched on a number of key points.  Co-operation is key because it means there is an open and dynamic conversation about the issues, blocks, gaps and positives arising as well.  We are a core member of the migrant consultative forum in the Department of Social Protection, where a number of agencies, including citizens information, are represented to discuss issues around the area of social protection.</p> <p>  As an organisation, we provide training on the rights and entitlements of migrants for access to housing, homelessness services and social protection.  We have provided training to a large number of agencies and indeed some State actors have attended that training.  We have also provided that training to the regions of the citizens information service, to try to ensure that issues arising nationally are addressed and that we can bring them to the State agencies on a coherent and clear basis.  Significant co-operation and co-ordination goes on to try to achieve efficiency.</p> <p>  With regard to attitudes and awareness in the State agencies, it is very important people act in good faith but also that officials be supported with the right knowledge, tools, infrastructure, information and protocols.  That is why we are very keen for those officials to have clear pathways and protocols of understanding of migrant rights and entitlements and information from the likes of the Department of Justice through protocols.  We are working with both the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice around that issue, because numerous complications arise.</p> <p>  On the one hand, we would see a decision from the Social Welfare Appeals Office saying the Department of Social Protection has no role in deciding on the right to reside of an individual that it makes an application and merely recognises it or not.  On the other hand, we might see another appeals office decision saying that the officer does need to see the contents of a permission letter for a non-EEA person and asks how someone has a right to reside for the purpose of social protection.  Of course, the Deputy may know, there is no such thing as a right to reside for the purposes of a social welfare payment; there is just a right to reside.  These are the kinds of complications that arise where supports are needed.</p> <p>  Communicating those complexities and interacting with people is why interpreter services are critical.  It is very difficult for the local authority and its officials because there is no infrastructure of supported communication.  We have a team of interpreters who have engaged in training.  We thank them, because many are volunteers, for their investment.  However, we also train our own staff in how to work with an interpreter, identify the need and how to do those things properly in order that people are empowered to make informed decisions and are able to engage in the process correctly.</p> <p>  There is a lack of very important information and skills around interpreters and the provision of services in an accessible way.  A simple example is the back to school allowance application has been digital for a number of years, unless one specifically rings the Department and asks for a form.  However, one has to be able to do that and to make the application digitally in the language of the website and have a MyGovID account.  These issues need to be addressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether this was an east coast issue.  It is not.  There are people in direct provision centres, members of the Roma community and many people working in industries throughout the country.  It is a national issue and needs a national response.  We find that knocks on to housing, so it is important that access to homeless and housing supports is supported through a proper infrastructure of knowledge, expertise and resources, of which people can avail.</p> <p>  It is unfortunate to think we have seen some cases in which people have had to flee their home because of racist intimidation in a local authority home.  It is unfortunate that can happen.  It is about community engagement and the State supporting people to engage and know the other and to support, through the migrant integration and the Traveller and Roma inclusion strategies, to support initiatives to bring people together.</p> <p>  When we look at migrant attitudes, people are here by policy and by Ireland recognising by its policy that migrants are welcome because they have a very positive contribution to make.  Various studies, including by the International Organization for Migration, IOM, in 2015, with Nasc, and 2018 reports by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, recognised that a very positive contribution is made and that is reflective of migrant attitudes.  EU and non-EU citizens fulfil essential jobs in the labour market.  They are huge contributors in that sense, as well as culturally.  We just have to look at the quality of the cultural addition migrants have made to Irish society and therefore, they are very respectful of the law because they are deeply engaged in making their lives here.  Society is a bell jar.  There are always people at either end of the bell jar.</p> <p>  When people come, they bring some history with them that living in a different society can amend.  The Deputy asked about vaccinations.  The HSE is making very significant efforts, for example, in the Roma community and through local health workers and information, to help people to make informed decisions about vaccination.  It is a big difficulty with language and literacy and the role of social media and what we-----</p></speech>

I was speaking in the D&aacute;il and the schedule ran late.  I have read the submissions and statements and listened to some of the debate.  I thank the witnesses for the insights.  It is useful and valuable for us to hear directly about the experiences of migrant communities in engaging with State bodies and public services and I commend the witnesses on the work they do.  I have worked with Mr. Killoran on the Immigrant Council of Ireland over many years and it has been a pleasure to work with him on many issues.</p> <p>  How can we, as legislators, best support those individuals and organisations which are drawn from migrant backgrounds and new communities and are keen to get politically involved?  I have worked for many years with AkiDwA, which is a wonderful organisation, established by women who had originally come to Ireland from Africa and has done a great deal to change and move policies forward on a range of issues.  The value and strength of AkiDwA is it is women's voices from communities and nobody is speaking for individuals, which is very important.  I wonder how we can support other organisations such as that in coming forward.</p> <p>  There is a gendered dimension of experiences of those from new communities.  From my work with AkiDwA and Mr. Killoran on the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, I am conscious we see particular issues arising for women, as a result of reproductive health issues and experiences around female genital mutilation, on which we have brought forward legislation.  I am conscious they are particular issues and it can also be more difficult to hear voices from women from disadvantaged backgrounds and communities, including migrant communities.</p><p>My background is as a practising barrister.  In the past, I represented children, unaccompanied minors who had come to Ireland with substantial needs.  How can we intervene to support those who have come here unaccompanied and are, therefore, particularly vulnerable in terms of their accommodation, education and so on?  What can we do about that?</p><p> I appreciate what Mr. Neenan said about the contribution migrant communities make.  My own grandfather was a migrant from what was then Czechoslovakia.  He came to Ireland in 1946 and re-established Waterford Glass after the Second World War.  Many people from different backgrounds make considerable contributions when they come to Ireland bringing knowledge and experience.  We need to celebrate that and ensure it is spoken of as positively as possible at every opportunity.</p></speech>

In terms of political engagement, one of the parts of our integration work down through the years has been around the political enfranchisement of migrant communities.  Some of that is essentially boots on the ground, voter education and voter mobilisation when it comes to informing people about their right to vote.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that we have a good system around accessing a right to vote in Ireland, particularly at local election level.  It is a good system and an outlier in Europe.  Even somebody who is an asylum seeker can vote in a local election.  It is really important that we do that but not many prospective voters know they can vote.  Voter mobilisation is part of it and that is something on which we have focused.<br/><br/>We have also worked a lot with political parties through the years on, for example, migrant councillor internships.  Crosscare did that originally as well and we took up the idea of councillor internships a couple of years ago.  Originally, that included internships with Members of the D&aacute;il.  People who are interested in becoming politically active can shadow a councillor, in the most recent iteration of the scheme, and learn about local politics, whether they are with a political party or an Independent.  Those interns can shadow a local councillor over a number of months and learn all about the system.  In many cases, those interns have ended up joining the relevant party themselves and some of them have run in local elections.  Some have ended up being elected themselves at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Integration is obviously a two-way process.  Part of it is opening political parties and representatives to meeting politically interested migrants half way.  Schemes such as the one we run with migrant councillor internships are a good way of doing that.  That scheme has been replicated in a couple of county councils across the country and run by the councils themselves, which is great.  It has taken wings in and of itself.<br/><br/>We are conscious to work directly with, and be a resource for, political parties with regard to their thinking about the issue.  Some of that is about the party structure, some of it is about asking what a political party is doing to welcome people and what more they can do.  It is about identifying barriers to anyone advancing within the ranks of a political party.  Some of the thinking about those issues can be done with groups such as ourselves and Crosscare.  There are also a great number of migrant-led groups that are increasingly, and rightly, moving to the front and centre of the conversation around migration and integration in Ireland.  We are here to help and support that process.  Direct engagement with migrant-led groups is important.  The Deputy mentioned AkiDwA as a good example.  We are absolutely willing to do anything we can to help make contacts and build bridges and all that kind of stuff.  That is massively important.<br/><br/>On the gender question, we have done work around gender-based violence, victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and domestic violence work impacting upon migrant women.  A gendered approach to our immigration system is a must.  To date, it has been largely a one-size-fits-all approach.  That can be seen, for example, in the placing of victims of human trafficking within the direct provision system in mixed gender accommodation, places that are inappropriate and unsafe for them, as victims of trafficking.  The Government policy is that those women go into direct provision.  That has been criticised not just by ourselves but by international bodies, down through the years.  Much of our work has drawn attention to the fact that we need a gendered approach to support the victims of trafficking and the immigration system in general and the type of social supports that are built around it.  In certain instances, that need is of particular prominence, such as with regard to domestic and gender-based violence.  We need to do a lot of work to reach migrant women.  We must interact directly with them to get their expertise and experience.  We must work with civil society to try to harness that expertise and experience and have it inform policy and work, going forward.<br/><br/>I will briefly touch on the Deputy's last point about unaccompanied minor children.  I mentioned at the start that we do work in that area, as do the likes of the Irish Refugee Council and others.  We have a great level of interaction with Tusla around the immediate legal needs of the person and the care he or she gets through Tusla.  We do a follow-on project around the unmet legal need of unaccompanied minor children.  That can touch on everything other than their immediate legal status.  It can include family reunification, citizenship applications, renewal of status and all the things that flow, especially when someone ages out and reaches the age of 18.  At the moment, that is a civil society-led initiative involving ourselves and the Irish Refugee Council, supported by <i>pro bono</i>partners in law firms.  It is an area in need of considerable development, especially in instances where people have come to the State as minors, do not have their families with them and need to be joined by their families.  We must recognise that the overall integration of such people and their position within a community and in Ireland overall is better served by their having a family structure around them and being integrated as quickly as possible.  I do not denigrate the work of Tusla in that regard and we have a very good relationship with it.  However, there is a lot of unmet legal needs for unaccompanied minor children that we think needs considerable investment.</p></speech>

It is always good to get such good information.  I find my role as a public representative is to make it easy for people to access the services they need, if I can help with that.  That was the case when I was a councillor and it is the case now, as a Deputy.</p> <p>  This is not the first time this committee has heard about the issue around migrants being unable to access interpreters.  We have heard about it in other meetings in the past.  People have contacted my office and it can be difficult to understand what is being asked of me over the phone.  I should say that the level of English of those who are talking to me is a lot better than my attempts at any of their native languages.  They are doing their best.  I always find that if I can sit down and meet that person face to face, it is a lot easier to understand but there was a barrier to doing that during the Covid-19 restrictions, which made it more difficult.  I have questions about interpreters.  What barriers are stopping migrants from accessing a comprehensive service?  Has there been any progress in developing professional qualifications for interpreters, such as those in Britain?  I will ask a second question if I have the chance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Sr. Breege Keenan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We see the need to have very good interpreting as vital for any member of a migrant community who is unable to talk or express themselves through English.  We find that there are a number of interpretive companies but there is absolutely no training.  There is nothing worse than to have an interpreter on the phone and know they are probably standing in a shopping centre or walking down the street when one is sitting with a woman who might be the victim of domestic violence.  One is trying to support her while at the same time realising that the person on the other end of the phone is walking around the street.  It is imperative that we have a training course.</p> <p>  We linked up with somebody in Dublin City University and we have trained our volunteers and sat with them.  We also must ask who supports the interpreter.</p><p>For example, if I have an interpreter for a woman who has been a victim of domestic violence and she is talking about what happened her with the interpreter explaining it, we end the phone call and the interpreter goes home.  With our interpreters, we check in with them afterwards.  We have a debriefing to be sure that they are okay and are not carrying home the trauma, being retraumatised by what they have heard.  This has come up at many Department meetings.  Yesterday I attended a meeting - Mr. Killoran was also there - with the International Protection Office at which we again talked about the quality of interpreters.  It has been talked about for years but we now need action.  Of course, it should be developed with the universities.  For example, NUI Galway has an interpreter course for European languages such as French and Spanish but not for the languages common among migrants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Neenan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#G00200"><p>That is a really important point.  Not only for interpreter services but also for information provision and rights and entitlements, the system should be able to proactively respond without the need for an applicant to intervene.  That is the acid test in a sense.  Should somebody need an escort - for want of a better term - to access a right or entitlement, interpretive services are critical to that.  In fairness, the Department of Social Protection has it in place, but there are issues with accessibility.  Yesterday I spoke to a social welfare inspector who was talking about accessibility, the time that it takes and what they need to go through to organise it.  It needs to be intrinsic to the process and not something that is added on.  That is the first thing and it applies where it does exist.</p> <p>  However, the fundamental issue is that in many cases it does not exist.  It needs to exist and as Sr. Keenan said, the people using that service need to be trained to use it and need to understand the process both for the interpreter and themselves so that the process is empowering, is focused on the outcomes that are needed and spots the vulnerabilities.  They are key points which will empower people to interact with the system in a fair, reasonable and transparent way that they can understand and have confidence in.</p></speech>

Sometimes the matter is easily resolved which just requires somebody to sit down and take the time to have that conversation.  Sometimes it can be resolved with a phone call.  I accept what the witnesses have said about that.</p> <p>  I accept Sr. Keenan's point that interpretation is not just about knowing the language but the skills that go with that are also vital.  Before I got into this line of work, I worked in behavioural therapy dealing with people who had addiction, substance misuse and mental health issues.  We had policies in place so that when I heard some difficult stuff in those conversations with people, I had a place to go and speak about that - supervision to look after myself - which is very important.  During their journey to get here, some of the migrants have had very difficult and traumatic times before they reached Ireland.  It is important to have that support in place.</p> <p>  Can the committee do anything to improve interpreter services for migrants?  For example, should we contact the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the diploma course that was mentioned?</p></speech>

The universities need to be involved.  If it was part of a university programme or a degree in interpreting, it might make more people interested and students who are good at languages might take it up.  It needs to be done now and started for the next academic year.</p></speech>

The lens of the national migrant integration strategy is important to consider in making sure that happens.</p></speech>

Their insight into the immigration system and the experience of migrants is invaluable for us.  The State's approach to immigration is much more complicated and even more draconian than the average person realises.  I hope that the witnesses and this committee can draw attention to those issues which I believe the Ministers and departmental officials can resolve fairly easily.</p> <p>  Further to Mr. Killoran's response to Deputy Bacik, I have a question for both Crosscare and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  A few weeks ago, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland explained how aspects of our immigration system were leaving individuals, including children, vulnerable to domestic violence and coercion.  The way the system is set up facilitates it.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland is scheduled to have an online discussion on the issue on Thursday.  The witnesses from Crosscare mentioned it in their contributions.  I ask the witnesses to outline for the committee some of the concerns they have in this area.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions which can be answered if there is time and, if not, a written response would be great.  Sr. Keenan and Mr. Neenan mentioned that Department of Social Protection services and supports need to be sensitised to migrant vulnerabilities.  I ask them to elaborate on what this would involve and the importance of the changes.  Their statement had a very worrying sentence about individuals and families needing housing and homelessness supports.  It stated that non-EU migrants have the additional layer of immigration residency permission that can limit their ability to access social services.  I ask them to explain the implications of that and what can be done to improve conditions for migrants.</p> <p>  Mr. Killoran highlighted the overly bureaucratic and paper-based nature of many of the immigration processes, the weaknesses of which were emphasised during the pandemic restrictions.  I ask him to elaborate on the bureaucracy involved and reforms the Department of Justice could implement to help to resolve the situation as soon as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Neenan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#G01100"><p>This is very important.  The interpreter service is an intrinsic part of this so that people can communicate.  In terms of the sensitivity, officials must see that treating people the same is not treating people equally.  Officials need to be sensitised to the vulnerability and be open to assessment.  In the migrant integration strategy, the Department committed itself to providing information rights and entitlements, particularly to migrant households presenting.  In having that engagement, it is necessary to explore the issue with the person.  Officials need to be supported to explore the issues and why people are there.</p><p>When they know that, they can act accordingly and link people to services they will need.  There is a structural issue in supporting people in their humanity.  They are officials but they are human beings dealing with other human beings and it is the Department of Social Protection.  The same extends to the housing authority.  It is about training and cultural awareness.  Training in sensitivity to issues such as identifying the possibility of domestic violence and coercive control, and identifying vulnerable people and how they communicate with officials is absolutely critical to the quality of engagement that officialdom have and, in their own way, to be able to help people because that is why the officials are there and stay there.  If that were in a nutshell, that is what I would say.</p><p> There is also the underpinning element.  In terms of sensitivity, it also comes through knowledge and competency around rights of entitlement.  When someone who has just lost his or her job and has particular characteristics walks into an agency, the official should understand the situation that the person is in and be aware of the kind of information that should be given to the person or the kind of pathway the person needs to know about.  That is very important as well.  It happens often, unfortunately, with simple things whereby people get the wrong information, wrong advice and wrong forms.  That is a real problem because the person is heading in the wrong direction and he or she could be in a precarious situation.  It is sensitising officials to hearing the person and the issues, and sensitising them to the pathways they need to know about and need to impart information on.  That is a really important point.</p><p> In the housing side, about which Deputy Cairns asked, it is very worrying.  While there is a circular provided by the Department around local authorities interacting with victims of domestic violence, one local authority pointed out to me that it is just a circular and that one does not have to help them.  That is chilling.  It was not said in an uncaring inhumane way; it was said from the point of view that they work within the structure.  The structure needs to leave space for people to respond appropriately.  That can be a problem.  By way of a simple example of where this can happen in immigration, we have encountered cases of some people who may be undocumented, some of whom are covered by the latest developments, which is welcome, or who have a particular immigration permission and they have received the wrong advice from a homeless section in a local authority.  They have been told that they need to go back to the Reception and Integration Agency.  If they are a student, for example, that agency has no role in their case.  There is confusion about what they should be doing.  We were saying that when someone presents to the homeless section of a local authority, it is covered by section 2 of the Act.  The definition of homelessness is clear in primary legislation.  It should be applied.  Officials should facilitate people to apply it in the vein of humanity with which the legislation reflects.</p><p> These are the kinds of actions we would strongly encourage.  It would have the benefit that people would not fall off a cliff or be exposed to further exploitation, which is often what happens.  A friend might help them fill out the forms or help them interpret.  These friends are often not necessarily good actors.  They are at risk of identity theft.  We have seen, for example, people who have received help with their online application for a personal public services number and their identity has been stolen.  These are the kinds of matters that have consequences and that can be avoided by proper deployment of services in an accessible way.  Hopefully, that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

In the case of women who are a certain number of weeks in a domestic violence shelter, if they do not have an up-to-date Irish residence permit card, they cannot go on the social housing list.  We have an example of a women who was in a domestic shelter and who ended up in homeless accommodation.  She was told she only had three nights to stay.  This is all about information and understanding.  I told her that they would not throw her out with her three children.  She rang me on the first and second nights.  On the third day, she rang and said that she had to be out tomorrow and asked what she would do.  I said that they would not throw her out.  In the background, her little six-year-old were saying "Please, mammy.  Please don't cry.  Please don't cry."  I had to reassure her.  I asked her if I could I speak to her little daughter on the phone.  I spent a half an hour talking to the three of them together - she has two other children - explaining that the local authority will accommodate her in longer-term homeless accommodation.  That is what we are working with because people have not been told exactly what will happen.  We are talking about peoples' lives.  We are talking about a woman who had suffered quite a lot, as it was, and her children witnessed this.  This is what we are trying to follow up.  This is about legislation and the rights and entitlements that, as Mr. Neenan said, some people are not aware of.  It is a matter of humanity.  It is simply saying to the person that he or she will be accommodated for three nights and after that they will get him or her other accommodation to live in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Killoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#H00300"><p>I will follow on from the points Mr. Neenan and Sr. Keenan made about domestic violence circumstances, which we concur with.  There are a couple of other elements I would also like to highlight.  One is that a lot of the issues that emanate in this area come from the fact that our immigration system essentially ties one person's status to another in instances of family reunification.  In the vast majority of cases, the man whose immigration status is that of the "primary migrant" on a work permit or some type of immigration status, his partner joins him as a dependent spouse under stamp 3 conditions.  Their right to remain in the State is contingent on their continuing relationship.  When relationships break down because of domestic violence, it puts the spouse's right to remain in the State in question.  This is not only an issue of a lack of clarity as regards their continued residency in the State, but it is also used as an element of control by abusive partners who say that if their spouse goes to the police or immigration agency, she will be deported and that she is only here because she is in a relationship with the partner.  This is used as an element of coercion.</p> <p>  Organisations like ours have worked throughout the years in support of migrant women primarily, not exclusively, in domestic violence circumstances to convince them that they must get out of the situation they are in for their own safety.  They can then approach the Minister at whose discretion they may be granted a status to remain in the State.  Some 99% of the time that application to the Department of Justice is successful and we have to commend the Department in those circumstances.  In the vast majority of cases, it issues an independent status to someone who is in a domestic violence circumstance.  Generally, that information is not publicly known.  One would have to dig on the Department of Justice's website to find the little information note that refers to the independent status for victims of domestic violence.  It does not refer to a piece of legislation.  It does not refer to a statuary instrument or an official piece of policy.  It is an information note on the website.  There are a significant number of missed opportunities for supporting people.  They may come to an organisation such as ours and get that support and have their hand held to go through that process, but how many do not?</p> <p>  Let us look at the difference between those who come to our services and the number ringing the Women's Aid national helpline who are migrant women, which is a bigger number than those who are accessing our services.  There is a large gap there as Deputy Cairns correctly said and I thank her for mentioning it.  We ran an information session around the "We Are Here Too" campaign which is migrant women-led.  It is a campaign about trying to bridge the gap between marginalised migrant women and the domestic violence services available.  A lot of good work is going on in that area, but there is a great need to clarify it.  We have encountered instances, as Sr. Keenan mentioned, whereby somebody goes into a community welfare officer, who is on stamp 3, has two small kids, whose partner has left having been domestically abusive, and the community welfare officer says that the person is on stamp 3 and is, therefore, not entitled to any payments and does not get anything.  We have had to write letters that I would describe as taking the paint off the wall to get that person some kind of emergency support in the immediate term.  That should not have to happen.  It should not take the intervention of an organisation to come in kicking and screaming to get a payment for somebody.  That is not to say that all community welfare officers are doing this.  They are not.  There is a lot of great work being done in the community as well.  There is an inconsistency that is massively problematic.</p> <p>  I do not know if I have time to answer the second bit about bureaucracy and such issues.</p><p>I will let the Vice Chairman tell me that and not keep talking.</p></speech>

I shall ask a few questions and then we will have another round starting with the issue of bureaucracy.  We have a lot of time after that so we can be a bit more flexible.</p> <p>  One of the opening statements mentioned a diploma in public service interpretation that would be similar to that used in the UK.  How are interpretation services handled in other European countries?  Are diploma and language skill requirements on a legislative footing or how are they done?  I ask as I would like to know what practical things this committee can recommend or do in this regard.</p> <p>  I want to discuss lesser spoken languages.  For example, I needed people to translate languages that are similar to Dari and Farsi.  The translators were native speakers of Dari and Farsi who had come here as migrants.  The situation caused concerns because these communities are very small and people were needed to interpret something sensitive.  Equally, I am conscious that if we require a university degree there are not very many universities that teach Farsi, for example.  Equally, would that put a roadblock in front of migrants who are here from using their language skills as part of their integration and job seeking?</p> <p>  To recap, are language requirements on a legislative footing in other countries?  Please also address my concerns about freezing people out.</p></speech>

I do know that the International Protection Office has on occasion used interpreters from overseas and other European countries before there were interpreters in Ireland.  I cannot answer any further on that.</p> <p>  In terms of languages that are used less frequently, I really am not sure.  We cannot cover all of the languages and I ask Mr. Killoran to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Killoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#J00400"><p>Our experience of this is as a service provider that scrambles around for interpretation as well.  We are not necessarily experts on the international best practice around interpretation but I am aware of instances.  For example, a lot of the domestic violence services in Ireland use telephone-based helpline services in the UK and part of that is because they are better regulated.  To what extent they are better regulated I cannot say offhand.  To get over the issue of somebody, potentially, from the community knowing a family, the circumstances or knowing the individual from attending a mosque or wherever that may be, services are used that are located outside of Ireland.</p> <p>  The competent authorities such as the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, through things like the migrant integration strategy, need to empower officials and perhaps civil society to look at this matter.  Part of looking at the issue is considering international best practice.  I think we are very much behind the curve in Ireland in terms of the thinking on this matter.  Organisations like ourselves must firefight and struggle with this matter as much as everybody else, and are not necessarily able to suggest solutions right now.</p> <p>  Part of planning for and investing in migration in Ireland is looking outside ourselves at countries that have longer immigration histories than Ireland, and have gone through these issues maybe 20 years ago and developed best practice.  It might be as close as the UK when it comes to things like interpretation.  While that will not be perfect, it will definitely be more advanced than what we do here.  The migrant integration strategy is an opportunity to do things like interpretation services properly.  I mean we can get a bit of best practice and tailor the approach in Ireland.</p></speech>

There are a number of different things to the issue and not all of them are massively complicated in terms of what might need to be done.  We are not necessarily talking about legislation.  We are not necessarily talking about massive immigration reform writ large.  A lot of it is bureaucratic and administrative.  Some of that stems from the bureaucracy involved internally within the Department of Justice as regards how we administer the immigration system in Ireland.  One thing that most people will not be familiar with is that a huge proportion of our immigration system is based on ministerial discretion.  We have a broad framework of immigration and legislation that is the bricks and mortar of our approach in Ireland.  However, a large amount of this is done through statutory instruments, policy statements and through somewhat opaque and invisible immigration procedures.  The level of ministerial discretion is extremely high and guides decisions but that can lead to a large amount of inconsistency in application.  One will see two people in very similar circumstances make applications yet both get different answers.  I mean that on paper there would be no difference in their circumstances so there is no rationale for different decisions.</p> <p>  The internal guidelines within the Department of Justice around applications, and the internal sharing of data across the different sections of the Department of Justice, are really important.  Again, we must ensure that somebody is not going through one application process with one part of the Department of Justice and has to do it again with the Garda, a residency permission, a renewal permission and then citizenship further down the road.  A lot of that information can be streamlined to make things a lot of easier</p> <p>  To address the overall issue of ministerial discretion, discretion is necessary within an immigration system.  One needs to have flexibility to manage the strange and unusual situations that may arise or where people do not fit necessarily within criteria.  At the same time, we need much more clear guidelines and procedures to cover 80% of cases both internally and then communicated externally to applicants, service providers and other Departments.  It is a big exercise to do but at the same time the initiative would have huge benefits in terms of increasing the transparency of the decision-making process.  Such an initiative would also assist the decision-making process within the Department.</p> <p>  People do not realise that most applications do not have an appeals process.  There are some appeals processes within the immigration system but a huge amount of applications do not have an appeals process.  For example, if one is refused citizenship there is nowhere to appeal that decision.  One can go to the back of the queue, apply for citizenship again and, hopefully, get a different answer.  A lack of an appeals process is problematic because it would sort an issue in a lot of circumstances.  An appeals process would sort out issues with documentation or glitches along the road.  An appeals process would have a huge impact when one considers the amount of immigration cases that are in the High Court.  Sometimes cases go to the High Court for judicial review because there is simply nowhere else to take them.  There is no appeals process in between.  I think that introducing appeals processes as a regular occurrence within the immigration system would address a lot of issues.</p> <p>  I shall make a final point about the overall approach.  Moving towards legislation and increased transparency in terms of policies and procedures is definitely something that needs to happen in order to move away from discretion as the guiding principle of many of our immigration processes.  A lot of our immigration system was set up in the early 2000s when a high emphasis was placed on rooting out fraud.  A migrant needs to repeatedly explain something to us so that we can be satisfied that in the last 12 months one has not gotten into trouble with the authorities or not done X, Y or Z.</p><p>That governing principle of taking every available opportunity to root out fraud does not translate at all into massive levels of detection of fraud.  There is fraud within the immigration system, like there is within any other system.  However, it is minimal.  That lens that we have of needing to check in with somebody every 12 months and not, for example, issuing a status as three-years long, or five-years long, needs to be challenged.  People need to get longer and more secure immigration statuses and quicker routes to more secure immigration statuses as well.  There is a number of things in that.  These are all practical things.  We are not moving continents here to do this.  These are practical administrative reforms that would have a huge impact on the system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021120700002#K00300"><p>I would like to thank the witnesses for their responses.  Mr. Killoran has pretty much answered my follow-up question in what he said.  I would like to touch on some of the points.  Sr. Keenan spoke about when people are seeking emergency accommodation when experiencing domestic violence.  I have encountered that a lot in my constituency.  The way that people are met at the housing authorities shows that there is not training with how to deal with these difficult situations.  I have heard of people having to prove that they are homeless.  In these kinds of situations, one does not have proof of that when they have left the home.  It highlights how much more difficult it is to leave, when one thinks about all of those barriers that the person is met with and has to face when he or she gets to the housing authority.  There is also the situation of leaving when one&rsquo;s immigration status is dependent on one's partner.</p> <p>  I would like to highlight that in Ireland it is a disaster that, although under the Istanbul Convention we are supposed to have one refuge space for domestic violence per 10,000 people in the country, instead, Ireland provides one space per 10,000 women.  We therefore have 50% less refuge space than the bare minimum.  It is horrible to think of that woman and her family who were told that they had to leave.  It is unbelievable.</p> <p>  Mr. Killoran spoke about how it is at the Minister&rsquo;s discretion in many of these situations whether people who have fled that unsafe situation can get their own immigration status separate to their partner.  I was not aware of that.  Like he said, there is not much awareness about it.  He mentioned that it is somewhere on the Department of Justice website.  The question I was going to ask is if we need to create more awareness, or does it need to not be at the Minister&rsquo;s discretion?  He answered the question there, in that we need to look at the aspect of how much discretion that Department has in relation to making decisions on people&rsquo;s lives and the lack of consistency there.  Although there are probably many things that they have discretion on deciding, but using the domestic violence situation as an example, and people&rsquo;s immigration status being dependent on their partner, if that were to change, is the best change there that you can apply and get that and you are guaranteed it, if that is the situation you are in, that it is not linked to your partner?  Could Mr. Killoran maybe elaborate a bit on the best way we could change this to make it more suitable?</p></speech>

Under family reunification, a person comes in and is joining somebody else.  However, they are dependent on that person.  There has been a campaign by a group called Stamp 3 Ireland about their rights to work as dependent spouses of, for example, holders of work permits.  It does not make sense to have somebody dependent on somebody else for all that time for no reason.</p> <p>  In other countries, for example, Canada, I believe that after 12 months of family reunification, people are issued with their own independent immigration status.  I may not be 100% correct that it is Canada.  However, there are international examples whereby somebody joined as a family member.  While they are taken in on the basis of their relationship, they are also issued with their own independent immigration status after a very short period of time.  This is so that they can contribute, so that they can go out and work and study.  Forgetting domestic violence circumstances, that issue of dependency is a huge issue in and of itself.  This is because we have heard of many instances from professionals within the healthcare system, within IT, within pharmaceuticals and within all these areas in which Ireland is prominent.  If they go somewhere else, their spouse can get to work more quickly.  If they go somewhere else, their rights to family reunification are better and their spouses&rsquo; rights are better.  They will therefore leave, and they are going.  They are going to other jurisdictions where their rights are better enshrined.</p> <p>  First, the issue of dependency is a way to tackle it in general.  Second, the Department will have to retain some element of discretion for unusual circumstances that clearly do not fit criteria.  At the same time, 99% of applications that we support to go in under these kinds of guidelines come back with an independent immigration status for the individual.  A more solid approach to that would essentially say that unless something is really unusual in this circumstance, the Department of Justice has a policy of granting independent status to domestic violence victims.  The Department would have their administrative requirements where they might lead a letter to say that they are accessing a support service.  They might need a letter to say that they are accessing a domestic violence refuge.  This is all the normal information that would need to be produced in these circumstances.  That is understood.  Once that low threshold of criteria is met, a status should be issued.  </p> <p>  Again, the practices of the Department in this regard are good.  It is just a matter of formalising them and communicating them.  Part of the work we are trying to do is to have migrant women to the forefront of the conversation in dealing with and communicating with migrant women in migrant communities.  They are the key to it all.  There is no point in me or in the organisation saying it.  Migrant women themselves should do it, for example AkiDwA, and other groups, as well as the event we will hold on Thursday are crucially important.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  </p></speech>

However, he is speaking about migrants with stamp 3 visas.  On the other hand, we have family reunification members where the sponsor is a refugee.  If a refugee brings in, for example, his wife and three children, under family reunification, his wife will not get a permission letter in her own right.  If the relationship breaks down and she applies for social welfare, in many cases the Department of Social Protection will ask for the permission letter.  She will say that she has stamp 4 visa.  They will say that she has to have a reason for this stamp 4 visa and that they need the letter.  However, the sponsor never gets a letter.  They get a decision from family reunification services to say that they have permission to bring in the names of, for example, three children.  The refugee then applies for the visa, and the visa will be the only proof the wife has.  Then we, like other organisations, advocate for her to get a permission letter from family reunification services in her own right.  As we said earlier about permission letters, this is where it becomes complicated.  The clients do not recognise that.  They think that they have permission because they have their Irish residence permit card.  The stress that causes for many families is unbelievable.</p> <p>  I will revert to Deputy Cairns's earlier point about Ireland not having enough refuges for women.  A number of the women with whom we work here in Dublin at the moment are here in Dublin, but they were on housing authority lists down the country.  Because there is no accommodation for them, they are in refuges and are accessing homeless services here in Dublin.  They then have to reapply to Dublin to get on Dublin housing lists, because they cannot go back to the part of the country that they came from.</p></speech>

I thank Sr. Keenan and Mr. Killoran for those responses.  We were talking about the need to streamline the information between the different Departments.  This would prevent people having to go through these bureaucratic hoops from constantly filling in form after form, as well as the difficulties that arise when there are language barriers and all of that.  I sometimes hear concerns about when people go to one Department, they perhaps being reported to the other if they do not have any kind of a stamp.  There is a need for a firewall in those situations, as well as a need to streamline the information to prevent the consistent filling out of the same form over and over again.  Do the witnesses have any advice on how there could be the right balance, or how there could be a way of doing both?</p></speech>

It has arisen during the Covid-19 pandemic, where there has been much concern among undocumented people accessing the vaccine in regard to where their information would go.  A good body of work was done in communicating the fact that is not an issue.  No information is being shared by the health authorities with immigration officials, for example.</p><p> There is a further issue within the Garda and the Department of Justice whereby if somebody reports an incident of racism, there is a gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement or a stated understanding from the Garda such that the information will not go any further.  The Garda will support the person as an undocumented person to deal with the incident of racism the person is dealing with but the information will not be passed on, although that is not adequate.  It is not true to say statements never permeate verbally across a force of thousands of garda&iacute; throughout the country.  While the Garda has very good intercultural and diversity strategies and is doing a lot of work internally about this, a much clearer description and articulation of firewalls, even within police services, is very important.</p><p> There are good international examples of this.  When we talk about co-ordination across Departments, we always raise the example of Portugal.  Portugal has a high commissioner for migration as a role underneath the Prime Minister's office, and it is his or her role to work across government departments to ensure everyone is on the same page with regard to what they should be doing about migration.  We previously argued for a similar role within the Department of Taoiseach but it has never come about.  The migrant integration strategy attempts to do that by bringing in other Departments, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but that kind of co-ordination role across Departments needs to rest somewhere as a responsibility and needs to have teeth.  It needs to be able to bring in Departments and ensure they are doing what they said they would do, that they have targets and that they are evaluated and reported on independently.</p><p> That kind of sharing of information is very important across Departments while, at the same time, ensuring the firewall is there to protect against, for example, somebody who is undocumented, and there will be those who remain undocumented even after the scheme next year if they have not qualified.  They should not have anything to fear about their status being revealed to immigration.  Very little is served by that happening, apart from the person staying away from a crucial service.  By the very political decision, which was a good one, of introducing the regularisation scheme, as a country we are beginning to recognise the fact that undocumented migration happens.  It is a fact in every country in the world, and the best way to deal with it is by getting people back into the system as quickly as possible.</p><p> We need to get our thinking around that, rooting out fraud and undocumented migration.  Punishment should not be our approach anymore.  We need to enfranchise people as quickly as possible in 99% of cases.  That is much more important than trying to round up people and remove them from the State, which cannot happen in any event.</p></speech>

The practical experiences of people I referred to earlier, in respect of inconsistency in decision-making, even at a senior level, show that in appeal structures there just is not clarity or cohesive thinking.  Through the social welfare Acts and so on, the State seeks to identify eligibility, not to identify those we want to exclude.  The purpose of a social protection system is to provide social protection, not to bar access to it.  While that is the default, the atmosphere and the mood music will change completely because this is much more proactive, positive and welcoming to those who are vulnerable, that is, the very people we are trying to identify and assist.</p> <p>  Senator Keogan asked about the impact.  The impact is that people cannot access rights and entitlements or discretionary services, such as the community welfare service, which has very wide discretion in what it can do for people.  It is a fantastic component of the State infrastructure where there is very wide discretion to assist people on an exceptional and urgent basis, and that has been the saving of many a case through the actions of an individual officer.  Discretion is always important.  A lack of clarity can block people significantly and it is important those protocols and clarities be ironed out and put in place.</p></speech>

It has been a very good discussion.  I have one question arising from what we have been speaking about, relating to the difficulties for those who remain undocumented.  All of us welcomed the Minister for Justice's announcement of the regularisation scheme, an important and positive step forward, but are we still going to see significant gaps?  I have been working with my Labour Party colleagues on a born here, belong here campaign to try to get a better, more generous pathway to citizenship, specifically for children born in Ireland whose parents are not Irish citizens, an issue that will be addressed for many children by the scheme.  In our guests' experience, do they foresee there will be many significant gaps?  Will many people still be excluded?</p></speech>

The Migrant Rights Centre and the other organisations really pushed for it and we welcome it.  I welcome also the fact international protection applicants who have been here for at least two years will be included.  That is very good and I hope they will be given the opportunity to continue with their application for refugee status if they want to do so, which will be important.  Nevertheless, there will still be people who will be outside of it.  We have been working in this area for long enough to know that will be the case, for whatever reason.  There is the cost that is involved and we are not fully sure about the guidelines on it.  If applicants are looking for passports and other such documentation, it will be difficult for some of the people who are undocumented.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly important step for Ireland to take to have a regularisation scheme of this nature.  We do not need to look far around us at political attitudes towards migration to know a person will be quite an outlier if he or she does something of this nature.  I pay homage to the Justice for the Undocumented campaign, which comprises undocumented people who took the risk of leading on that work with the support of the Migrant Rights Centre and all the other organisations in that area.  It is a brilliant scheme and many of the details are very generous.  I refer in particular to aspects such as allowing those who have been in the asylum process for more than two years to make an application and, as Sr. Keenan said, to keep their international protection application running concurrently as well as getting a residency status, getting on with their lives and being able to be integrated in, and to contribute to, the community.</p> <p>  There will be issues and there will be those who do not qualify.  Somebody might reach the end of the six-month period next year and have been in the State for only three years and ten months, not four years.  If he or she applies as an individual and does not apply under this administrative detail, there is a question as to what happens to that person.  There are also those who are stuck in administrative processes, whether relating to appeals or other decisions or because they are in circumstances whereby they are in limbo.  Because of that, they may have a combination of time spent legally in the State and time spent undocumented in the State, which may or may not add up to four years, or three years if they are a family.  They may not qualify either; what will happen to them?</p> <p>  The experience is that undocumented migration, as I said earlier, is an element of every immigration system in the world.</p><p>In the vast majority of cases, it is people who fall out of the system for various reasons, some of which we discussed today, such as relationship breakdown.  The fact that we are doing it in Ireland is brilliant, but it is a once-off.  It was announced by the Minister last week as a once in a lifetime regularisation scheme.  While it is fantastic that we are doing it in Ireland, the fact remains that in 12 months after the scheme, undocumented migration will still be an issue for some in Ireland.  However, hopefully several thousand people will be able to fix their situations through this application.</p><p> We need to build into our long-term thinking on immigration how we deal with instances where somebody has fallen out of the immigration system for whatever reason and how we get them back into it as quickly as possible so that they are not presenting at homeless services or social welfare offices with questions about their status and going around to social services in a loop, with civil society organisations accompanying them, and a long run of 12 months or longer of trying to get them back into an immigration status.  Ultimately, and hopefully, they will end up back in an immigration status anyway.  We need to imbed the kind of principle embodied by the regularisation scheme into our long-term thinking about migration and integration in Ireland.</p></speech>

To briefly reiterate the overarching point that we bring as an organisation, investing in long-term integration and migration planning in Ireland is a must.  It is a reality in Ireland.  It is not a new thing; we are 20 years into a migration experience and we need to be planning ten and 15 years ahead and in investing in appropriate measures.  It makes sense for everybody to do that.

I am an assistant Secretary General in the Department of Education.  My responsibilities include curriculum and assessment policy, which incorporate senior cycle reform.  I am joined by a number of Department colleagues today: Ms Anne Tansey, national director of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS; Ms Orlaith O&rsquo;Connor, assistant chief inspector of schools in the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate; and principal officers in the curriculum and assessment policy area, Mr. Eamonn Moran, Ms Evelyn O&rsquo;Connor and Mr. Neville Kenny.</p> <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, carried out a review of senior cycle between 2016 and 2020, leading to an advisory report that was submitted to the Minister and Department for consideration in late May this year.  The NCCA review involved a very broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide variety of stakeholders on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases during the period of the review.  In particular, teachers, students and parents in a representative cross section of schools nationwide took part in the review of the existing senior cycle.  Individuals and organisations, including students and student representative organisations, were also invited to participate in a public consultation process.  The NCCA also commissioned external expertise to support the process, including the ESRI and the OECD.  The richness of the perspectives from all of the various stakeholders has fed into the advisory report produced by the NCCA.  </p> <p>  In its letter of invitation, the committee highlighted a number of topics in the context of leaving certificate reform which I will comment on briefly.  First, on assessment options, many subjects, particularly those whose specifications have been most recently updated and those which are newly introduced subjects such as physical education and computer science, already have such components.  Some 62% of subjects now incorporate at least one assessment component additional to the traditional terminal examination.  It is, however, accepted that a number of core and popular subjects taken by significant numbers of students do not incorporate any additional assessment component and that for many subjects which do have one there still remains a strong emphasis on the final written examination.  How best to both spread the assessment burden and do so in a way that allows for a demonstration of a fuller range of skills while maintaining standards, integrity, trust and confidence in our leaving certificate needs to be explored as we go forward.  </p> <p>  On digital learning, the committee will be aware that earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Foley announced an extensive consultation process to help inform the development of the new digital strategy for schools.  This is intended as a successor to the previous digital strategy which saw more than &euro;200 million invested in the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment.  The Department, in consultation with the NCCA, now ensures that all new and revised curricular specifications include clear statements that focus on the development of digital learning skills and the use of digital technologies as a resource in achieving specific outcomes across the curriculum.</p><p>In terms of access, equality and well-being supports, significant resources are provided to schools to assist them in supporting students with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage.  Senior cycle development will need to ensure that the offering for students in their final years of schooling is genuinely inclusive and engaging for all.</p><p> While acknowledging that higher and further education policy matters are first and foremost for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, it is vital that the senior cycle experience appropriately prepares students for the next stage in their lives, be that education, training, work or something else.  Developments in curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment will need to be informed by needs in society and how best we support students to realise their potential.  Creating varied opportunities for learning within schools and working with our sister Department to explore greater diversity in pathways beyond school will be a vital part of this.  Recognising the place and importance of the Irish language is also an important area receiving attention.  As committee members will know, the NCCA consultation on new draft specifications for leaving certificate Irish is ongoing.</p><p> Obviously, subsequent to the completion of the bulk of the NCCA's work on the senior cycle, the pandemic hit and the Department and the State Examinations Commission had to respond to the challenges it created for the leaving certificate.  Despite concern about providing marks in respect of their students, teachers and principals carried out this task with enormous professionalism and with a deep commitment to public service.  Equally, the decisions taken by the Government in those years was motivated by serving the best interests of students and the desire to ensure they could progress into the next stage of their lives without delay.  There are lessons from this experience which may well be valuable to us in future but it is important to emphasise that the arrangements in 2020 and again this year were put in place specifically as a response to emergency circumstances that applied at the time.</p><p> There is much in the current system that works well and which can and should have a place in any redeveloped senior cycle as we go forward.  The leaving certificate has continued to evolve during its lifetime.  Examples of this include the introduction of new subjects, updating specifications for existing subjects, the introduction of new assessment components and widening the breadth of curricular languages.  The senior cycle experience is also characterised by more challenging aspects, including stress experienced by students, overdependence on a terminal exam in June and a need to provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate their learning in different ways.  In the context of senior cycle reform, how can we deal with these aspects while also maintaining confidence in State exams?</p><p> In seeking to address the topics highlighted by the committee and others, the complexity involved in seeking to implement reform should be acknowledged.  There is undoubtedly a strong desire for change but how some of the challenges associated with senior cycle can be best addressed is often hotly debated.  Issues such as the nature and modes of assessment, subject choice, transition year, provision for students with special educational needs, access, design of supports and resources for teachers and reporting beyond leaving certificate results are just some of the myriad, interlinked and complex topics that need to be considered.  These, and more, are the challenges that are receiving attention as we advance our consideration of the senior cycle advisory report by the NCCA.  We need to consider carefully how the Government responds to the report, what development work should look like and how best to support its implementation.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Tattan for his opening statement, which will be very helpful at this stage of the leaving certificate review that the committee is undertaking.  Mr. Tattan will understand we have been at this for some weeks.  I want to put to Mr. Tattan some remarks made by a speaker at a previous meeting from the world of business.  That person stated there were literacy and numeracy deficiencies in students at third level and graduate level who are entering the workforce.  This was quite an alarming remark to hear with regard to third level graduates.  Does the Department have a view on this?  Are there areas that can be improved?</p><p>The other part of this conversation is that the committee members are at a disadvantage on the basis that the considerable research the Department has undertaken is not available to us in the context of the review the Department undertook.  I do not think any member of the committee wishes to undermine the integrity of the leaving certificate process or its reputation.  It has served us extremely well.  There are, however, areas in which I believe we can improve and lessen the burden on students.  In his opening statement I think Mr. Tattan referred to certain of the newer subjects being assessed on a continuous basis through the senior cycle, which is obviously beneficial in the context of the terminal exam.  Is there a view within the Department as to what balance or percentage might be appropriate in the context of leaving certificate reform right across all subjects in order that the terminal exam is not such an impactful, burdensome exam for students in the future?</p></speech>

To respond to the first one, I have read the transcript of the recent meeting at which business groups appeared before the committee.  It is concerning to hear that sort of feedback from employers.  As I said in my opening statement, we want to prepare students for the next stage of their lives, whether that is further and higher education, work or whatever else.  We have invested a lot in this area.  A literacy and numeracy strategy was devised a number of years ago in response to an international study in which it was found that literacy scores had seemed to drop somewhat.  Overall, studies such as that carried out by the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, put us very high up, really at world leader level, for literacy, and we continue to invest in that area.  As well as the absolute skills which everybody coming out of school must have, there are also those transversal skills which we have sought to inculcate, particularly at junior cycle level.  We would like to see more of that happen in schools right through to the end of upper secondary education.  I refer to skills such as communication, collaboration, critical thinking and so on, which we know are hugely valued and important in the 21st century.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Farrell's second question about the work done to date, some information is available through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  It has published a number of reports and interim reports and some other studies that have been done, including materials for the OECD and the ESRI.  They are available online.  I accept the core point about the report itself not being available at this stage.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the rebalancing between the terminal exam and other forms of assessment such as continuous assessment.  We do not have any fixed view on that.  From talking to students and others in the system, and I am thinking of the voices of students in particular, I understand that they have sought that idea of trying to spread the assessment load.  We see a lot of merit in that.  We are not putting a figure on it.  If we are to have more continuous assessment, it needs to be meaningful.  It has to be real.  It cannot constitute a very low percentage of the overall assessment.  It has to be something significant in order for us to demonstrate that sort of change.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely that if we are to do this, we should do it properly.  That said, we must also take into account the integrity of the examination process and whether the results that emanate from it and indeed at third level have to be considered in the context of leaving certificate reform as well.  That said, I am sure Mr. Tattan would appreciate the mental health pressures the leaving certificate places on students, even from early stages, in fifth year.  The consequences that that can have, even on a minority of students, is quite profound, and I think it is an area we all recognise and want to do something to improve.</p> <p>  My only other question relates to various remarks made about the Irish language.</p><p>I am very conscious that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is present as one of our few Gaelgeoirs.  I am sure he will have some remarks on that.  As somebody who studied Irish for 13 years in primary and secondary school and was a cinnire t&iacute; in a Gaelcol&aacute;iste in Galway during various summers, I regret that the only time I speak Irish is when I am abroad.  There has to be some significant changes to the manner in which the leaving certificate frames the education and final examination for students who are either being taught through Irish or are particularly immersed in it and its application, particularly at third level outside the core courses like education or teaching.  Has the Department considered areas where improvements can be made in curriculum, assessment and eventual outcomes for students immersed in Irish through their chosen school or the actual Irish examination and any practical improvements that can be made?</p></speech>

I mentioned that some work is under way with the NCCA on a consultation on levels one and two Irish at senior cycle, which is effectively a continuation of development work in place in schools at primary and junior cycle level.  Does Mr. Moran wish to address the stage this work is at?</p></speech>

Regarding the specification for leaving certificate Irish, there is a specification for language one and language two making discrete provision for Irish medium and English medium schools.  This essentially provides an element of continuity for learners in their learning journey regarding the Irish language.  It essentially follows on from the same approach taken with the framework for junior cycle Irish introduced in 2015 where there are two discrete language specifications for levels one and two.  Originally, a single specification went for consultation for junior cycle but following stakeholder feedback, the development of separate specification for level one and level two was put in place.  What is being done for the leaving certificate reflects the approach taken for junior cycle.</p> <p>  The NCCA has undertaken an extensive consultation process regarding the new specifications.  The consultation period was extended on foot of engagement with stakeholders, who expressed their desire to ensure that all views on this would be heard.  The consultation process finished last week.  The idea is that the NCCA will essentially review the input from the consultation process and a consultation report will be presented to the NCCA council in early 2022.  In early 2022, a report on the early enactment of junior cycle Irish will come to council.  The output from that review will also feed into the work that is being done for senior cycle.  </p> <p>  I will conclude by coming back to the Deputy's point that he only gets the chance to speak Irish abroad.  At least, he speaks it somewhere, which is good.  The specifications developed recognise some of the weaknesses in the early specifications in that the desire to provide students with experiences to allow them to enjoy using Irish creatively and critically sought to underpin the new specifications in that we have tried to stress the communication of Irish more in them.</p><p>An emphasis is placed on the aim of developing the student as an effective language user who takes ownership of his or her language learning journey.  Rather than Irish being a language a student learns as a dry subject, and it is acknowledged the view the Deputy expressed, which has been expressed by others, is a stated view, the move towards learning Irish as a language one can communicate with underpins the work being done at junior cycle and senior cycle levels.</p></speech>

I was in the classroom for the subject for four years.  The same was the case with French.  I have a view of languages, which often people have of the Irish language.  Some of it was my own fault and some of it was due to the way it was taught.  It is strange everybody else in my class managed to learn French but I did not.  That may say more about me than others.</p> <p>  I have a brief question for Mr. Moran but I also have other questions.  How many submissions on the public consultation on the Irish language were received?  He might have the figure.  The closing date for receipt of them was last week.  For the information of the committee and the officials, I advise that my committee, Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, made a submission to the public consultation process.  We concluded a report last week or week before.  It might be helpful for this committee&rsquo;s discussions.</p> <p>  I spoke of my schooling 40 years ago when I did the leaving certificate.  I was in awe of Germany and countries like that which had continual assessment as part of their education system at that time.  We seem to have been slow learners.  We have been so slow it took this pandemic to wake people up to the potential of continual assessment and there being less of a need for a terminal examination.  I welcome the fact we are doing that.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the dangers of a continual over-reliance on digital technologies.  Deputy Farrell referred to this and spoke of literacy and numeracy levels.  People are using computers and the computer is doing the work for them.  We all become lazy and in some cases one can forget how to spell words if one is not writing as regularly as one did in the past and is letting the computer do the work.  How does the education system up to the leaving certificate level address that?  Other issues arise at university level.  It is important not to be over-reliant on digital technologies given there is still a digital divide within the country and society as a whole.  Some people do not have access to reliable Internet and broadband connection and some people do not have access to a computer.  If students are studying at home and depending on a computer to do their homework, especially as there seems to be a move for many textbooks or class work to be online, and if they have little access to the Internet or a computer, it must be taken into account there is also a need for physical textbooks, study work and tests.</p> <p>  I have one further question as the Department officials are present and we are discussing reform of the leaving certificate.  Even though it was unimaginable three years ago that all the examinations would be conducted online or by continual assessment, we seem to be facing into another year of that.  When will a decision be taken on next year&rsquo;s leaving certificate in terms of the oral examinations, practicals and mock examinations?</p><p>The mock examinations will be coming up in February or March in a lot of schools.  We now need to be making decisions early to let the students know.  This is the third year and we have come through the other years.  Hopefully a lot of lessons are being learned from the application of exams and continual assessments over the past two years, which may be able to feed into the ongoing assessment of the leaving certificate reform.</p></speech>

I believe that Mr. Moran may have the numbers on the submissions, and if we do not have the figures here we will certainly get them for the Deputy after the session today.</p> <p>  On the point made about continuous assessments, I am inclined to agree with the Deputy about our exposure in this regard.  One can see it with the pandemic that countries such as Germany, and in other places too, had a lot of the assessment pieces already in the bank before Covid-19 hit.  That meant that they were far better placed to pivot when they needed to figure out how they were going to move their group of final school year students into further and higher education and so on.  Because Ireland relies much more on the examinations in June, we had to create the calculated grades process and the accredited grades this year.  Certainly, there is learning out of that.  The Deputy asked about learning from the experiences of the past two years.  That is certainly a learning that we would take in the context of the continuing reliance, particularly in quite a number of subjects, on the final exams.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of the digital divide, which I believe is a fair point.  It is a concern shared by many people about how our children are taught in school and how they are accessing information, whether there is an over reliance on this, and whether there are other ways to interact with information for learning and so on.  It is changing.  It is about trying to get the balance right.  Obviously, the digital skills are very important.  Deputy Farrell spoke about preparing students for beyond school, which is also very important aspect.  It has been an aspect of all of our lives over the past 20 years particularly.  It is about how we best support teachers to integrate those tools so that in the teaching and in the learning and in what happens in the classroom they are used as further means by which to enhance learning rather than simply replacing other things.</p> <p>  With regard to the leaving certificate for next year, our approach has been to have conversations with public health, and we plan to hold further conversations with public health tomorrow.  Our approach to date is that the various assessment pieces would happen largely as normal, so that the leaving certificate would be running as it did in 2021 with the junior certificate running as well.  Schools have managed to stay open and we believe that they will continue to stay open.  That is the key for us.  From January to early March last year that just did not happen and we had to make decisions around that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the oral exams.  We had an arrangement in 2021 where they happened largely over the Easter period and the week after that, run by schools.  Again, a plus from that was there was less impact and therefore less need for substitution.  Teachers were able to continue with their students right through that second term until Easter.  It was less disruptive and there was more protection of the school year.  That was interesting and should be explored, particularly in the context of senior cycle reform. </p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Moran now for figures on the submissions.</p></speech>

There was an online survey to which there are 738 responses received.  The NCCA also conducted 13 focus group meetings, which were attended by 275 participants.</p><p>The NCCA held eight bilateral meetings with relevant bodies, although I do not know which bodies those were.  There were 19 one-to-one interviews conducted and 240 written submissions were received by the closing date of last week.  There is a lot to get through, which reflects the level of interest in this subject.  The report from the committee will also feed into that process.</p></speech>

Obviously, the decision in respect of mock examinations is one for each school to make.  The mock examinations have to mimic the final examinations, so if <i>in situ</i>examinations are expected to take place in June, an early decision in that regard would help schools in the context of <i>in situ </i>mock examinations and the additional resources required in that regard.  I know it is in the lap of the gods in some ways and we are trying to predict the health situation at that stage, but early communication is key.  The biggest concern this year, last year and the previous year was the additional stress on students in connection with the type of examination they would face.  It is about making sure they know as quickly as possible that the Department is considering the likes of oral examinations being dealt with in the same way they were in April 2021 - maybe the meeting today will have done that - or at least are informed that discussions are ongoing.  My daughter is doing the leaving certificate this year, as are several of her friends.  This issue is a worry for them as they are trying to work out a timeframe in terms of the lead-up to the examinations and they need to set it out as early as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#H00500"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  We are seeking to do that.  We have learned the importance of trying to make these decisions as early as we can.  That is something we need to consider.  Easter is quite late in 2022, so in the normal run of things the oral examinations would most likely take place in the couple of weeks before Easter.  If they were to be held at Easter, that would provide a bit more time for students.  We need to be clear that, as highlighted to us by students in the course of the engagement on the 2021 leaving certificate, students want to have time to take a break, which they will need to ensure they are somewhat rested going into the final written examinations, or time to study and revise.  It is about trying to get that balance right.  It might make sense to try to hold the oral examinations at Easter, particularly in light of the teacher supply issue.  That might be less disruptive for students.  However, there would be a need to keep that timeframe reasonably tight.  Some students may have a couple of oral examinations and a music practical examination.  There is a need to ensure those exams do not all happen at around the same time and create a different sort of pressure point.</p></speech>

The students who are undertaking next year's leaving certificate missed a significant amount of in-class learning when they were in fifth year and are going through a teacher substitution crisis at the moment.  I understand from many second level schools that teachers are covering classes that are not theirs and a significant number of teachers are absent due to the pandemic, yet there still seem to be conversations about potentially closing early for Christmas and there is even a question mark over whether schools will open after Christmas in the context of the nature of the new variant.  Although it might not be very popular, would it not be quicker, cleaner and easier for the Department to make an early decision to roll out the leaving certificate for 2022 in the same manner as was done in 2021, with a hybrid model involving written exams and accredited grades?</p><p>All the students who lost out in fifth year and who are losing out now because of the substitution crisis, and who will potentially lose out in the new year, will have additional stress because of the ambiguity.  I do not necessarily expect an answer or opinion on that, but perhaps I could be given an indication as to whether the disruption this year is ongoing.</p><p> Others referred to correlations with their own school experience.  How fundamentally has the leaving certificate changed since I did it in 1994?  Subject changes and changes to certain assessment levels have been alluded to.  Is the leaving certificate radically different from what it was in 1994, when I did it?  I assume it is pretty much the same.</p><p> With regard to subject choice, the remote learning that has come into play in the past couple of years has possibilities.  I realise I am always banging this drum but there are schools that do not have the same subject choice as others.  That is the way we run our system.  We do not have a State system; we have a State-funded system.  In certain schools, a value judgment is made as to whether one subject should be chosen over another.  Alternatively, there may be timetabling issues meaning a student cannot do French and economics or another combination.  A small number of schools do not offer education at higher level in English, Irish and mathematics, which disadvantages the students in attendance.  With the advent of remote learning, is it the intention of the Department to consider the possibility of expanding subject choices through remote learning so the physical walls of a school will no longer have to be a boundary?  We are not living in 1950s Ireland.  If somebody wants to do higher level Irish and a teacher is not available in the school, surely we can facilitate him or her.  If somebody wants to do higher level mathematics and a teacher is not available in the school, surely we can facilitate that.  If somebody has a timetable clash whereby French and another subject cannot both be studied, surely remote learning could be a solution and the Department could drive that.</p><p> The reform of the junior certificate process was quite tortuous and not really taken on board.  There was a lot of misinformation.  I am pretty scalded by it.  I remember conversations about the reform of history.  These were so misinformed that we were almost on the back foot before we started.  I am referring to reasons given for banning history and history no longer being available, for example.  It is my understanding there is a massive drop-off in the number of students who study history after junior certificate level.  The number drops from something like 54,000 to 13,000, by comparison with that for geography, which drops from 54,000 to approximately 25,000.  Am I right about the statistics?  Are we still having a big problem with history?  How do we feel that leaving certificate reform might advance the cause of subjects such as history?  I could talk about the Irish language all day, but I will probably get another opportunity.</p></speech>

On the approach adopted in 2022 and whether it should be the same as in 2021, I would not agree with the Deputy.  I do not believe there is the same level of disruption now as was experienced.  Students doing the leaving certificate examination in 2021 had a period from March until the end of May in fifth year in which there was very little provision because everybody was so caught by the pandemic when it hit first.  The experience from January until March earlier this year was far better, and schools were far more able to move to support their students with remote learning, and they were more agile in this regard.  We have made adjustments, which we announced at the end of June.  The information was issued to schools at the beginning of the school year.  There was some level of adjustment in respect of the examination papers in recognition of the fact there was some disruption, and there was some contingency built in.</p> <p>  On the teacher supply issue, we have allowed full-time teachers to work additional hours to fill gaps where schools might experience them.  As of now, we are certainly not talking about an early closure of schools before Christmas, nor are we talking about a deferred opening of schools after Christmas in the new year.</p><p>We expect schools to run as normal up to Christmas week and to reopen in early January.  That is our expectation and we do not have a particular reason at the moment to view that differently.  We are certainly not getting advice about it that would push us in a different direction.</p><p> The Deputy asked how fundamentally the leaving certificate has changed since the mid-1990s.  My strong sense is it has not radically changed.  We have sought to do some things and I mentioned some of the new subjects where we have made a conscious effort to build in additional assessment components, including subjects such as physical education, PE, that have assessment components in addition to the final exam.  Where we had opportunities coming along with new subjects or where updated specifications were being prepared, the NCCA really tried to ensure they have other forms of assessment in order that different competences in the same subject area can be demonstrated in different ways and we think that is the fairest sort of system.  We would like that to continue and grow.  There are other subjects at the moment, such as the three science subjects, that the NCCA is working on.  Consideration will be given to including an additional assessment component for them.  In subjects such as biology, physics or chemistry, there could be value in having assessment over and above a traditional exam.</p><p> Subject choice is certainly an issue and smaller schools in particular face having to make the best of the resources they have.  What we have done in recent years is to add more subjects into the mix.  It has become more difficult in one sense, given that students may wish to avail of subjects that are simply not on offer in their school.  We owe it to students to try to find innovative ways to do that, and that has begun, in some ways.  There are one or two cases where small schools have used technology as a way to leverage expertise in order that students can link in remotely.  As we know from the experience of the pandemic, it is not completely the same as being physically there, but it is a way to use the expertise effectively and in a way that gives students access to a subject they think is important.</p><p> On the junior cycle, I might hand to Mr. Moran in case he has the statistics the Deputy asked about in regard to history and geography.  The junior cycle reform was a hard experience and was felt as such in the Department too.  Even so, having talked to teachers who have been through it and experienced it, we have found there are many aspects they really like.  For example, they like the subject learning and assessment review, SLAR, meetings where they have an opportunity to meet colleagues and discuss what is happening in their classroom and their students' work.  They feel there are ways for them to improve their practice and learn from one another, which is a key aspect of what we wanted to get out of it.  Through measures such as classroom-based assessment, there have been opportunities for students to demonstrate learning in different ways and to engage differently in the subject material rather than simply sitting an exam.  In the context of that and of other issues such as accredited or calculated grades, there are some interesting points we could draw on in the context of the senior cycle.</p></speech>

That was one of the reasons the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, made a statement that in addition to Irish, English and maths, history would be included among the subjects that had to be taken at junior cycle.  History is now a required subject that students must take in junior cycle, with some exceptions for students with special needs.  I think the intention was that if all students took history at junior cycle, it would increase the number who would take it at leaving certificate level, although it is not the silver bullet that will increase the take-up of the subject at leaving certificate level.</p><p>To come back to a point made by Mr. Tattan on the increased number of subjects that are available, in the past few years new subjects have been introduced at leaving certificate level, including politics and society, which is taken by a number of students who might have previously taken history at leaving certificate level; computer science, physical education, Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese.  There are many new subjects and it is a busy space at leaving certificate level.  I am aware of the effort of the former Minister, Deputy McHugh, to try to increase the uptake by making it a requirement at junior cycle level.</p></speech>

There is a bit of a misconception about what is being proposed.</p> <p>  I wish to return to another issue.  If a student does not have leaving certificate higher level Irish, he or she cannot become a primary school teacher.  If he or she goes to a school that does not offer higher leaving certificate Irish, he or she cannot become a primary school teacher, effectively.  Unfortunately, that means that a number of schools will be disadvantaged.  On the designation, I think the standard of Irish that graduates have when they leave teacher training college is more important than the standard of Irish they have when they enter teacher training college.  There is not necessarily any evidence to suggest that having higher level Irish makes you a half decent Irish teacher at primary level.  Does Mr. Moran think it is in the capacity of the Department to facilitate a student, who, for example, does not have access to higher level Irish in a particular school to be taught remotely, rather than the student having to physically move to a different place or somebody having to physically come to that school to teach them?  I think what remote learning has shown us is that there is potential - notwithstanding digital development and all the rest of it - to shake up the subject choice and the subject level choice for students who, heretofore, may have been disadvantaged because of the nature or dynamic of their school and the pressures schools are under.</p></speech>

There is huge potential there.  On the Deputy's point - even though it is broader than the senior cycle - on the issue of Irish and the entry versus the exit point, it is a point that has been made to us by different groups, particularly those representing under-represented groups in the teaching profession.  For example, Traveller representative groups have consistently made that point that the key thing is that graduates finishing their teacher education need to have the requisite level of Irish.  That is really where the focus ought to be.  It goes to it being set at a bar that will simply prevent some getting in who want to be part of the profession.</p></speech>

I thank all of the witnesses for attending and for their interesting submissions.  I carried out a survey within my own constituency of Kildare South, and 350 responses were received.  The responses were not purely from students.  The vast majority were, but some were from teachers and parents.  Three former students also responded.  The findings were very interesting.  We also had a public meeting on Zoom to discuss some of the issues with guest speakers.  It is important that we listen to young people who are at that point in their lives, and of course, take on board the views of teachers and parents.  Young people do not feel that they are learning the life skills they need to deal with life, whether that involves going on to third level, university or indeed, just living life in a different way and finding some other form of employment.  There is no doubt that the responses to the survey clearly showed a preference for more continued assessment - not necessarily predicted grades, but assessment that is marked externally, and not by students' teachers.</p><p>I agree with that because I believe there is a lot to be said for the anonymity of examinations that are being corrected.  There was also a sense that assessment should be completely based in schools because, unfortunately, there can sometimes be extra support from families when students bring assessments home to complete.  This support is offered with the best will in the world but that is not the way things should be.  The point was also well made that too much continuous assessment can actually increase stress for students.  Introducing too much continuous assessment would be the wrong way to go.  Perhaps such assessments should be limited to three points during the year.  Some could also be done in fifth year.  They were the main things.  There were many very good comments.  I will send them on to the committee separately.  There were also a few comments on the leaving certificate applied.  It was suggested it is good in theory but not in practice.  Obviously, there are issues with it not offering a pathway to third level education.</p><p> With regard to the areas that have been discussed this morning, the Minister, Deputy Harris, was in the constituency of Kildare South last week and I visited a few schools with him.  One of the schools that really struck home with me was Newbridge Youth Training and Development Centre, which is not unlike the Cork Life Centre.  It was excellent.  There were students there who, for whatever reason, felt they did not fit into secondary school life.  They were striving and thriving in this different environment where they could learn more practically.  This is the way forward for so many young people.  Students could even be offered blended learning, that is, to go to a mainstream secondary school for some specific subjects while learning vocational subjects in a centre such as this.  Some of the students were studying to be hairdressers or beauticians.  One group was learning coding.  I was very impressed with the whole atmosphere and how these young people were blossoming.  It was not just because we were there on a visit.  You could tell that by their enthusiasm.</p><p> The question of adjustments being made to the leaving certificate for 2022 has been raised.  I agree they should be made.  While students have not been disrupted as much this year, many have been out because of being close contacts or having contracted Covid.  Teachers have also been out for reasons related to Covid.  There certainly has been disruption to students' learning experience and that needs to be taken on board.</p><p> How can we envisage critical thinking, transferable skills and so on within the curriculum as it stands?  My final point relates to the need for emotional and well-being supports.  The committee has discussed this matter with career guidance teachers.  Some feel it is not appropriate to bring external providers into the school.  I feel it is.  Career guidance is very important and we need experts in the area to support young people in their school settings when they come up against any one of the great number of things that can throw any one of us off balance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#M00200"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions and comments.  I may refer some of them to Ms Tansey and the National Educational Psychological Service, particularly those on the potential for continuous assessment to increase stress, because it is often talked about as something that would decrease stress, and the point the Senator just made on emotional well-being supports.  The point the students made that they do not feel their experience, especially towards the end of their post-primary schooling, prepares them for the next stage of their lives is interesting.</p><p>We share some of that concern.</p><p> There was a conversation about the nature of the assessment process in particular.  At primary level we can see how positive the experience has been and we are starting to see some of the rewards of what has happened in junior cycle reform.  Yet when we get to senior cycle, everything gets determined by what is going to come up in the exam.  To be honest, students figure this out very quickly for themselves.  They know what is valued and will get tested and that is what they will focus on.  They do not really want to focus on other things.  They probably do in their lives but they know this is what they need to get through the process.</p><p> There is a real lesson in other countries and Scotland is a case in point.  There was a recent OECD report noting that where changes were desired in curricula considering critical and other skills in senior cycle, various curriculum reforms can be made.  For example, one could encourage different forms of teaching and support teachers to be able to deliver on that reform of curriculum.  If the assessment system does not also fall into line with that approach, however, it will stall.  Professor Gordon Stobart wrote that report for the OECD and spoke about a curriculum that encourages analysis and reflection, for example, but the exam comes down to elements like naming and describing.  We can see if this is coming up in the leaving certificate, the question is almost why we are doing it?</p><p> We must learn from the experience of other jurisdictions.  Other systems rely more on continuous assessment and some rely very heavily on it, including in Norway, which relies on much school-based assessment.  Students said they want external assessment in such a scenario.  We must look at other systems and see what we can learn from them.  I hope that can reduce stress and allow students to demonstrate a broader repertoire of skills, and that they are learning in many different ways rather than simply in a written exam.</p><p> There was mention of the leaving certificate applied programme, which is really good.  It is interesting in the context of the senior cycle review and it does many things quite differently.  It spreads assessment load and there are many ways in which to get credits.  There is an overall programme award.  The problem, as identified by the committee, is progression after it.  Unfortunately, it does not bring students anywhere after that point and it is something we must address in the context of this reform.  It is something we are looking at very actively.  It is a valuable programme and there are probably elements in it that would be of value to the leaving certificate group more generally.  Equally, the leaving certificate vocational programme has very practical elements, including worlds of work and enterprise and education, etc.  Why are those not more generally available to students to help prepare them in the way being discussed with the committee?</p><p> We have spoken about the 2022 adjustment already.  There has been a level of disruption but we feel the adjustment made is sufficient for recognition and acknowledgement.  Ms Tansey will speak to the stress issue in the context of continuous assessment and emotional well-being supports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Tansey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#N00200"><p>One of the points from the Deputy concerned changes to the leaving certificate.  In NEPS, we are mindful of the level of stress that students experience relating to examinations and the leaving certificate as it is.  We are cognisant of that and try to introduce changes mindful of well-being and that would increase support for well-being.  Elements we consider important in this regard include the idea that any changes should increase a student's ability to stay calm and regulated while feeling he or she can manage.  It is about feeling a sense of efficacy, while being able to manage demands.  Any changes should increase a sense of feeling connected with school and being included with the school environment.  The students should also have a feeling of optimism and hope for the future through whatever changes would be introduced.</p> <p>  In considering that, what is often cited in the context of stress is the nature of the terminal examination for many of the subjects in the leaving certificate.</p><p>The feeling or perception is that the outcome of that exam determines people's life trajectory or certainly the next steps in their progression.  This can provoke anxiety and undermine optimism.  We can assume the removal of the terminal exam or a move towards continuous assessment, as has been rightly pointed out, would reduce stress and levels of anxiety but this probably would need to be managed, as has been said.  We need to be very careful that we do not replace one approach that is stressful with another approach that is equally stressful but maybe the stress is over a longer period of time.  Any changes such as this probably need to be managed very carefully.</p><p> In the same vein, we suggest ensuring that there is a range of pathways to progression available to students, that they are communicated carefully and clearly and that students are aware there are several pathways to progressing their education.  This is important in terms of efficacy, reducing stress and maintaining calm and regulation.  I take the point on this and I agree with it.</p><p> A question was asked about counselling and the provision of emotional counselling in schools.  At previous meetings of the committee, we have spoken about how the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland.  They are provided through HSE primary care psychology services and CAMHS.  The services are provided in the community and not in a school-based setting.  Children and young people can access them through the referral pathways to the HSE services.  We have been working very closely with the Department of Health during Covid to ensure there is clear communication about the pathways to these services.</p><p> The HSE has increased the provision of electronic mental health services.  Text and telephone supports are available through a range of service providers that are funded by the Department of Health, including Jigsaw, SpunOut and Bodywhys.  The Department has increased the capacity of these services to support children and young people.  In the Department of Education we have NEPS.  In this regard, it is important to note an individual service is provided to up to 8,000 individual students every year.  All of the casework support we provide has a component of well-being within it.  We support students.  We also support teachers to understand and respond to the behaviour of students using a trauma-informed lens or an attachment-aware lens.  We are trying to support schools to put in place interventions to support students with identified difficulties, including those with social and emotional challenges.</p><p> We have a range of supports and continuous professional development for schools in this regard.  NEPS is rolling out workshops on the promotion of well-being and resilience.  They will commence at the beginning of 2022.  We hope to have workshops that will draw on the knowledge we have of adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed approaches.  These workshops will be accessible and available to all teachers throughout the country through an online platform.  They will commence early next term.  In addition, guidance counsellors, students support teams, NEPS psychologists and year heads in schools are trained and supported in signposting the services available through the HSE to support the emotional well-being of children and young people.</p></speech>

I will then ask some questions.  Like many Members of both Houses, I feel that it all sounds very good but there is a huge amount of evidence throughout the country that the HSE counselling service is not working.  There are waiting lists of long durations.  At any politician's clinic there are horrifying stories of what some parents and students in primary and secondary schools are going through.</p> <p>  At the previous meeting, the business representative groups stated there is a need for many more graduates with foreign language skills, particularly with Brexit.</p><p>Language fluency will be a significant advantage for the development of our economy.  Will the officials outline what measures have been taken to encourage students to learn a number of foreign languages?  How can we ensure they are given fluency of language and how can we immerse that into the senior cycle?  The vast majority of the people who have come before the committee over recent weeks when we have been discussing leaving certificate reform are not very optimistic on what reforms the Department is going to bring through.  It is hoped we will see the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, bringing through some reforms when she looks at the NCCA report.  Very many people are not optimistic because it seems this has been talked about before.  We had a witness before the committee who had done a report on leaving certificate reform 30 years ago.  That report is still sitting in the Department.  Many officials have gone through the Department in the past 30 years but that report is still sitting on the Department's shelves.  We have had the junior cycle reform and it is hoped we will see the senior cycle reform for the leaving certificate.</p><p> Perhaps the officials will comment on the language question.  I also have a question on the learning and examination of the Irish language.  Has the Department looked at this?  I am aware there was reform in the junior cycle.  To what extent can the learning on this reform in the junior cycle be brought forward by the Department into the senior cycle?  What consideration is given to students who might do a stint in the Gaeltacht?  I am aware that going to the Gaeltacht is not a cheap five or six weeks.  Are there proposals to make this more affordable for all people so they are able to access the Gaeltacht?  Given this consideration, would people be able to get extra points in their leaving certificate for attending the Gaeltacht?</p><p> We are experiencing a technical issue so we will suspend for a minute or two.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Moran to come in again on the languages, including the Irish language.  To respond to the point you made, Chairman, and it is a fair point in that you were quoting from a report from 30 years ago that has not progressed, I do not think we would share that lack of optimism.  We are very optimistic about what can happen here.  We think there are great opportunities in what is coming through from the NCCA work and the very careful shepherding of that by it through various research, evidence and engagement with stakeholders.  We believe there is a real opportunity now for significant reform.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in talked a few minutes ago about radical reform.  We think there is a step change here.  There is certainly an appetite for it.  It has probably been there for a long time, and the pandemic has only amplified it hugely.  We hear that and we believe we can take this forward and people will see significant change when an announcement is made.</p> <p>  I wish to make sure we cover the specific questions you asked about Irish and the foreign languages, Chairman.  I think one of the things you asked about in the context of Irish was learning from the junior cycle.</p><p>One plus out of the extension of the consultation of the level one and level two at senior cycle is that it has allowed the NCCA to commence some work on an early enactment review of the junior cycle language 1, L1, and language 2, L2, specifications.  That was raised by stakeholders as a point of concern.  If Mr. Moran is still there, he might talk a bit more about that and about the foreign languages.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that among the new leaving certificate subject specifications introduced in recent years were four new foreign language specifications: Polish, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Mandarin Chinese.  These arose essentially from the Department's foreign languages strategy, Languages Connect, which was published a few years ago.  It is a strategy to ensure an increased take-up of languages by students and also to seek to improve the teaching and learning of foreign languages.  We have a body under the Department's umbrella called Post-Primary Languages Ireland, which assists schools in rolling out the new language specifications.  One of the issues we have is that for each new language specification that is introduced, fairly small cohorts of students are currently taking them.  They are spread across the country.  Post-Primary Languages Ireland is working to assist those schools and provide additional supports to them to assist take-up of the languages.  Those four new language specifications that I mentioned come out of a common framework for the development of new language specifications.  That is why we were able to roll out Polish, Portuguese and Lithuanian more or less at the same time.  Within the leaving certificate there is a facility for students to take some non-curricular languages.  These are EU languages that are not currently taught in schools.  Our foreign languages strategy is approaching its mid stage.  We will review it.</p> <p>  On Irish language learning, I repeat the point that Mr. Tattan made.  The review of the implementation of junior cycle Irish, the new specification for junior cycle Irish, which was in the form of both a language 1 and a language 2 specification, will be completed in time to feed into the development and finalisation of the specification for leaving certificate Irish.</p></speech>

It is part of the discussion particularly for the experience of students in school whether there are particular gaps in the curriculum as currently framed.  There may be an opportunity for students to express particular skills, talents, strengths that they have.  We are looking at that but we are not in a position to say what particular new subjects might come forward as part of any announcement.</p></speech>

There is a significant issue regarding females participating in STEM subjects.  What measures are in place and what is the Department thinking about to encourage more female participation in STEM subjects?  This is and will continue to be a very important area.  We need to attract more females.  These are just the thoughts of one technological university but I have no doubt that this is a major issue right across the board.  The area has mostly male participation.  Could the witnesses comment on that?  </p></speech>

Could well-being assignments be incorporated into the final results so that it encourages students to engage fully?  Since I became Chairman of this committee, we have dealt with the effects of Covid and bullying in school.  I have listened to all of the witnesses who have come before us.  It is about giving the student the confidence to come forward.  I believe this is something we could work at.  I know Ms Tansey spoke about what is happening regarding counselling in schools.  I have a significant issue with it.  One proposal that was made was having emotion counsellors in school.  I ask that the Minister and the Department consider this.  Deputy &Oacute; Ri&oacute;rd&aacute;in said something a number of weeks ago.  I hesitate to paraphrase what he said because I will definitely get it wrong.  He said fifth and sixth year is probably one of the most difficult times in any student's life, specifically sixth year.  It involves the worry over the leaving certificate and the stress it causes.  Could somebody comment on that?</p></speech>

We gave quite a detailed response with regard to that.  Coming back to STEM, we agree that it is a very important issue and we certainly want to see greater uptake of STEM by females.  However, we also want to see more males taking up STEM as well.  As Mr. Tattan mentioned, we established a gender balance group to advise us regarding how we can improve gender balance in STEM.  This group has representation from industry, higher education, parents and students.  Among others, DCU is also a member of the group.  The starting point of that group was to review what literature was available.</p><p>The idea was to see what interventions have been tried and tested, what works and what does not.  This was all done to help us see and recognise what challenges and barriers there are which prevent females and indeed males from taking up science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the STEM subjects.  A report was published going back, in fact, to last November which provides the outcome on that.  In short, a key finding was that no single intervention will achieve gender equity.  Rather, there is a requirement to support multiple interventions addressing different segments of the ecosystem to effect the change that was required.  As a next step, we set up an expert group to review the report and to check to see what we could do going forward.  That review and report is going to be with the Minister shortly and we would expect the Minister to publish those recommendations.</p><p> As a next step, under our overall policy statement, which goes from 2017 to 2026, we will be developing a new implementation plan under that statement, and the actions coming out of the gender balance group will feed into that, among many other recommendations on other issues in STEM.  Shortly and possibly tomorrow, we will be going out on a public consultation on our next implementation plan.  We would welcome the views of Deputies on that and would hope to have that published somewhere around 2022 or possibly going into the next school term.</p></speech>

It is one that is very challenging, particularly in those final couple of years at school.  Perhaps Ms Tansey may want to speak about this a bit more after me.  I will mention two things the committee should be aware of.  The Department has its well-being policy statement and framework for practice, and it has provided supports to schools and sought to make well-being very much core to what schools do.  They have done it so well but this is to provide them with further tools and guidance to help them in that area.</p> <p>  This is a very important point in the context of senior cycle because in all of the nuts and bolts matters of assessment, curriculum, different skills and so on, the point of well-being cannot be lost in all of that discussion because it is core to it.  Students will need that sort of resilience to get through what is going to be, realistically even in a reformed senior cycle, some level of stress associated with this experience.  It is, by its nature, high stakes but is not all or nothing and we are always very conscious of saying that.  There are many avenues and routes towards getting to do what you want to do in life but it is a very important one for students.  We can lower some of the stress levels in some of the reform measures we might choose to take but we might not ever be able to eliminate it fully.</p> <p>  Perhaps Ms Tansey may have some other things she may wish to say on that point.</p></speech>

We have a range of supports, and I have mentioned some of them today, whereby we support schools to support the well-being of students, including our leaving certificate students.</p> <p>  One of the things we have been doing over recent years is engaging closely with the HSE and with the services it provides, and it is being very responsive to us.  At particular times, for example, during the Covid-19 period, which we anticipated would be stressful for leaving certificate students, we were able to connect with our colleagues in health and they were able to provide enhanced supports at their end in anticipation of an increased ask or demand from the sector.  At other times over this period when, for example, the results were coming out or when changes were being announced on the leaving certificate, which happened over recent years, we would have got in touch with our colleagues in health and would have told them we anticipated there would be an increased demand.</p><p>They were able to put increased resources into the services they are providing at their end to support access to e-mental health services, online counselling, telephone and text support.  That is one element of what we are doing on an ongoing basis.</p><p> Another action we have taken recently, as part of a joint item of work with our colleagues in the Department of Health, is the circulation of leaflets to all schools in Ireland, including post-primary schools, on mental health and well-being information.  Those leaflets have been delivered in hard copy as well as electronically.  It is a signposting tool and a guide for schools, students and their parents to  know how to access services.  I have the leaflet to hand and the services listed range from MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware and SpunOut.  Every school has received hard copies of quite a number of those leaflets in recent weeks as well as in electronic format.  We have also published revised guidelines for our student support teams and they have been circulated to schools in recent weeks.  They are all about strengthening how school support teams can support the well-being and welfare of all students within the school setting both from a universal approach taking a whole-school approach as well as taking account of the targeted needs of some students.  That would include engaging and signposting the supports the Department of Health, the HSE, and its service providers, are providing.</p></speech>

I am not saying it comes down to the Department of Education.  There is a great deal of joined-up thinking.  I believe there are way too many organisations involved and the message gets lost.  That is my opinion, not the opinion of the committee.  Mental health is a big issue.  It came through clearly in the other hearings we had with respect to the appointment of emotional counsellors in schools that students with issues or problems could be identified at an early stage and would not have to go through the system.  Savings would be achieved in the system within the HSE.  If we had the roll-out of emotional counsellors in schools, specifically primary schools, many children with issues and problems could be identified at an early stage.  That is just my opinion.  I would appreciate if Ms Tansey would pass on ten copies of that leaflet for members of the committee.</p></speech>

It is wonderful that the leaflet has been emailed to all students and parents.</p> <p>  I am a member of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and it is great to know MyMind is listed on that leaflet.  It provides access to counselling and it is very reasonable.  Covid-19 has had an impact on access to that service, although I believe it is free currently.  Turn2Me is also listed on the leaflet.  The 24-7 text line for that service, which is 50808, for any students going through any difficult times at present.  It is probably more so the case that our third-level students are facing examination pressures at present. </p> <p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Tattan.  He said the report is coming back from the NCCA and it will provide an analysis of the period 2016-2020.  In his opening statement he mentioned that 62% of the subjects currently have some type of continuous assessment.  However, he acknowledged that core subjects do not have that.  Could those core subjects be considered as part of the reform?  I am sure the Department will examine many elements.  He highlighted that we must maintain the integrity of the examinations, which is crucial, but many of the stakeholders and witnesses that have come before us have spoken about the leaving certificate, as it stands, being a stand-alone assessment.  It has a very good reputation but perhaps for businesses today, to meet future challenges and to provide the skills that will be needed as we move forward, there could be changes we could consider and its reform would benefit students, parents and future employers and our society.</p><p>We are developing our leaders of the future through our educational system.  How could we look at expanding the continuous assessment of those remaining key subjects at leaving certificate level?  Could that happen on an ongoing basis or does it need to wait for the report to come out and then to set out potential reform in a longer timeline? </p><p> On the digital learning plans, I was pleased to see the announcement from the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, this week.  There was nearly &euro;3 million allocated to primary and secondary schools this week to reduce the digital divide.  That is a big concern, particularly in areas of disadvantage and DEIS schools, where there is a digital divide.  We heard from the expert group on future skills last week that digital skills are one of the key crucial skill sets.  In fact, digital skills was their number one point about how we ensure that our students are ready to face the future and the challenges that are ahead of them in environment, climate action, dealing with the likes of the pandemic and understanding and being able to use critical thinking about research and evidence base.  We need students who are coming out of leaving certificate to be able to tackle the huge amounts of data that we now see on all platforms and in social media.  They should be able to distinguish all that type of data with a clear thinking mind.</p><p> I want to compliment the circular that was sent out from the Department along with that announcement.  It spoke about exciting options, such as politics and coding for primary schools.  It spoke about using simulation and game-based learning to assist students in secondary school.  I must admit that I nearly felt like wanting to go back to school.  I thought it was good and positive.  It was excellent to see that being supported. </p><p> On targeted double funding to DEIS and to areas of disadvantage, I represent Roscommon-Galway, where there are areas of disadvantage.  We need to support those students.  Would Mr. Tattan or Ms Tansey wish to respond to these points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#V00200"><p>I thank the Senator for those points.  On the report from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, I mentioned the 62% at the beginning of the meeting.  The Senator is right that many of the big subjects, such as English or maths for example, have two papers but they are the same assessment medium.  They have two written papers and no other form of assessment.  A number of other business subjects also provide an example of that.  There are new areas where many or most students are taking subjects, in which there is only the determiner of the exam.  The trajectory over the last number of years, with either new subjects or updating of the existing subjects, is to try and build in additional assessment components.  We will see that as a feature going forward as part of the senior assessment modelling.  It is ongoing.  Even the leaving certificate science programme at the moment, which is currently in the development phase with the NCCA, does not have an additional assessment component.  We are trying to build a meaningful additional assessment component into it.  There is the element that a percentage level of assessment must be reasonable, so that it is worth the effort of having a different component.  Also, it should be different in the sense that it tests different competencies in the same subject area.  It should not be just a written exam in disguise, if you like.  It should be different so that the broader range of skills, such as those the Senator talked about, such as critical reasoning, collaboration, communication and so on, can be demonstrated.  A terminal exam does not provide the same opportunity to do that.</p> <p>  The Senator talked about the timing of this, and how we should not wait a long time to see some of this arrive.  That is part of our thinking too.  Some components will require further development work, further engagement with stakeholders and so on.  We can perhaps move on more quickly with other aspects.  We should be moving as quickly as we can.  They will all ultimately join up.  We should be careful not to confuse the system or overload students in doing that.  It has to all work for those students going through the system.  There is a way that things can happen sooner, rather than waiting for everything to arrive in place in, for example, five years or ten years from now.</p><p>On the digital piece, obviously, there was the recent announcement in that regard.  There is also the digital strategy for schools, which has gone through consultation and that we would hope will be finalised in 2022.  It remains, therefore, a really important area for us and as the Senator mentioned, it is number one for some groups there.</p><p> One of the interesting things about the announcement yesterday, and the Senator talked about some of the examples of things that schools could do, is that it was designed to try to give schools the opportunity to innovate for themselves rather than it being dictated centrally from the Department.  Schools can actually have different ways of approaching this depending on what their needs are and how they want to move.  It remains a really important area for us, however, and it is just part of those trainings for essential skills, which is an absolute must-have for students coming out of school.</p></speech>

It is also a Microsoft school and a green flag school.  I commend the teaching staff and principals that we have in our schools across the country but for a school in a small town in east Galway competing on the world stage to win an award that was awarded at COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, it was incredible to see.  It just shows that with technology, there is a levelling.  There is the point of view of having access to devices but when one also has technology, one can compete in any forum.</p><p>I will perhaps ask a quick question around how we can support teachers.  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, spoke a little bit about accreditation for teachers and I know from SFI that there would have been training programmes at times with centres of excellence in which teachers could participate.  It was about learning new research skills or about the research environment at the time or what was happening in a particular subject area.  It drives passion, engagement and enthusiasm.  How do we do that across other subjects, particularly around digital skills?  I must admit that I probably am not totally <i>au fait </i>with everything that is happening at the moment.  Is there a way we can do that when teachers and principals at the moment are so overwhelmed after the last year or 18 months?  I know that they have such a heavy load and can sometimes be at breaking point.  Does the Department have any ideas about how we do this in a way that will enable and support teachers and yet not be an additional load on top?</p><p>Finally, I will comment on the student voice on the examinations this year.  Mr. Tatton mentioned very briefly that there is probably not any decision yet on the examinations coming up this year.  The student voice in that decision-making is important, however.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, said that was a key part in the last couple of years and I believe that she is very focused on that.  Mr. Tattan might comment on how that consultation process might look in the next number of months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#W00500"><p>On the issue of the teachers, perhaps Ms O'Connor may want to come in at the end in terms of anything else she wants to say about SFI or STEM.  I would say generally, and this is a learning we took out of some of the junior cycle experience, that we need to find ways to really support teachers well in the context of senior cycle review.  Much of that comes down to time and ensuring that they have the time they need to engage when there is development work going on and where there is change happening.  Members of the committee mentioned the pressure that is faced in schools all the time.  There just has not been the time at all.  There probably was not before and there certainly has not been over the last 18 months for teachers out there.  We must find ways to ensure that we can support the curriculum of reform we want.  Teachers need to be properly enabled and some of that, which we talked about a couple of minutes ago, is about giving schools a sort of autonomy about innovation when it comes to digital.  It is about being able to listen to schools.  Schools in some ways have a lot of shared experiences and challenges but they are also unique.  The Senator spoke about the school in Ballinasloe as being just one example.  Lots of different schools have different strengths and they also have challenges they face.  Finding ways, therefore, to support the group of teachers and that speak to them is important.  We need to find ways to be able to be adaptive to do that and, as I said, give them the time as well.</p><p> On the student voice, the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, is represented on the examinations advisory group.  Outside of the more formal structures that we use to engage on exam issues, we also have direct engagement with the secondary students union.  We had one such engagement recently in regard to 2022.  In the context of 2021, we found that voice hugely enriching in terms of the thinking that we needed to give to our response with regard to the disruption that happened at the beginning of the year in January and February.  That engagement will continue.  We expect that we will be meeting the group again very soon, particularly to discuss the oral examinations and how they will operate for the current leaving certificate students.  Ms O'Connor might want to add something on the SFI piece.</p></speech>

There is additional explicit curriculum provision as well.</p> <p>  On the Senator's comments with regard to the particular school and climate action, well done to that school.  I am delighted to hear that.  One of my areas of responsibility is education in sustainable development.  We have had one strategy and we are in the process of developing another, which we will be lining up with the sustainable development goals.  As part of that, we are ensuring that sustainable development is integrated into specifications.  I would be delighted to send the Senator a one-page outline of how currently the sustainable development goals are integrated into the curriculum.  We followed up with the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, yesterday to remind it to continue, as it develops new specifications, to move more and more in this direction.  The NCCA confirmed it is doing that and that it is very conscious that it needs to move more in that area as well.</p> <p>  On STEM, I mentioned that we have an Education Policy Statement 2017-2026.  One of the key pillars of that policy is to enhance early years practitioner and teacher capacity and to support STEM education practise.  We have developed a continuous professional development, CPD, framework which supports the cross-sector design and delivery of STEM CPD such that teachers can avail of that.  That will help them to deliver in the classroom.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to know all of that.  I will send on details of the school.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge Sport Ireland for its work with primary schools, particularly the marathon for kids programme which has been rolled out in a number of schools in my area.  I understand the athlete, David Gillick, was there.  It is about building healthy and active routines for children and about their mental health and well-being.  Sport is good for the head and good for the heart.  I thank our teachers, principals and the Department of Education for working with Sport Ireland on that particular programme.  It is a wonderful way to help children to create good habits and routines, which I still do not have.  It is important that we encourage children to do that at a young age and to keep it up.  It is really is wonderful.  I again thank the groups involved.  </p></speech>

In fairness, she was very good and she complimented the Department.  She said she did a report 30 years ago.  I know there is an appetite for leaving certificate reform.  We have learned a great deal about it in the last two years because of the Covid pandemic, which gave the Department, the Minister and everybody else the shot in the arm they needed to introduce some real reform of the leaving certificate.  I have been through five general elections but that was nothing compared with what I went through with the leaving certificate.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern has appeared before the committee previously.  The witnesses are here today to discuss leaving certificate reform with the committee.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Sharpe and Ms Sheridan O'Callaghan to make a joint opening statement, followed by Mr. Ahern.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  We have approximately an hour.  Unfortunately, many members of the committee could not travel to Leinster House today because of the status red warning affecting some counties.</p><p>They apologised for not being able to attend.  The committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before we begin, I remind witnesses that if they are giving evidence remotely from a location outside the parliamentary precinct, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They have already been advised of this issue.  I invite Mr. Sharpe and Ms Sheridan O'Callaghan to make their opening statement, followed by Mr. Hugh Ahern.</p></speech>

Next year, I will go on to do my master's in UCC.  I have been volunteering with Jigsaw in Cork for three years.  When I did my leaving certificate, it was a complete nightmare.  If I did not have the mental health supports that I got at the Cork Life Centre I do not think I would have been able to do it.  I got lucky, but I know the same supports are not there for every student in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am representing those students here today, as well as their opinions on reform and their grievances with the current leaving certificate system.  I have been in both mainstream and alternative education and so I can speak to my experience of the effects of the leaving certificate within both.</p></speech>

Methods of assessing almost everything across the world have evolved in the last century, but it seems that the leaving certificate has not done this in any significant way.  The grades might be given different names but the methods of learning, assessment and stressors were the same for my older peers, siblings, parents and even grandparents.  Education is about learning, not memorising.  It is clear from the feedback gathered that the leaving certificate needs to change.</p></speech>

The education system has been by far the most stressful thing in my life.  Getting an education was not something I looked forward to doing.  Instead, it felt like a challenge.  Not a challenge that makes one work harder, but an unachievable goal that I was working myself to the bone for.  Even when I started in mainstream secondary school I was hoping for change.  I constantly talked about changing the system that decided our futures.  Although my mam did not care for it much, she saw it as me moaning.  She would say: "We all went through it".  I hate when people say that.  Going through something is not good.  Why is it that just because you went through it, so do we.  Imagine if you tried to change something inherently bad and you were told that you cannot change it although it was bad for other people too.  Instead of telling us to get over it, why not make a change and reform the leaving certificate.  Set us up with the skills to face the world not break us down to the point that we get used to it.  I know the world is hard, and it can be challenging, but instead of beating us down, five days a week, why not help us to learn to help ourselves, and give us what we need without making our lives hell.</p></speech>

There is no place to discover what you are actually interested in.  Your school often dictates your options for subjects and what areas you get to explore.  You have to learn specific things and they do not cater for people's creativity and individuality.  Most leaving certificate skills are not transferable to college or real life.  I left school not knowing what referencing was, not knowing how taxes work and what career paths are out there.  I did two PLC courses before I went into psychology.  I had to.  I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I am not saying everyone is going to know what they want to do in their life or career but surely expanding the range of subjects and experiences available in the leaving certificate would help the young people of Ireland with these stressful decisions.</p></speech>

A new initiative brought in for a subject every few years does not equate to change.  Adding to a fundamentally flawed system does not change it.  What we need is complete reform.</p><p>We have heard from submissions that have been made that the leaving certificate may take ten, 20 or 30 years to enact.  This is not good enough.  In its current format it is not fit for purpose and is arguably causing more harm than good.  It is time for a complete overhaul.  It is time to rethink the system.  I thank the committee for its time and attention.  We look forward to discussing our experiences and opinions with members and are happy to answer any question they may have.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom labhairt leis an gcoiste seo ar athch&oacute;iri&uacute; na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta.  My name is Hugh Ahern and I am a student of the Patrician Academy, Mallow.  I am in third year.  The leaving certificate examination was established under the Intermediate Education (Amendment) Act passed in 1924.  Since its establishment, there has never been a major reform of the examination.  This is why I urge the committee to consider a three-year reform plan, which should start in early 2022 and be completed for the sitting of the leaving certificate in 2025.</p> <p>  I will now go through the recommendations I made to the committee in my submission.  There should be continuous assessment during fifth year.  The fifth year Christmas examination and summer examination could be used for continuous assessment.  The fifth year exams could count for 30% of the overall leaving certificate grade.  Then, in sixth year, the students would sit one examination, as is the case at present.  The reason I believe in continuous assessment is that the current leaving certificate examination, with only one final exam on one specific day, does not suit all students.  For example, someone could have died in the family or a student may not be feeling well on the day.</p> <p>  The bonus points for higher level maths should be removed.  This is not a fair option as it can add an extra 25 points to someone's results.  Let us say students did not choose higher level maths and got the maximum 600 points.  In this scenario, even if they received the maximum points possible they could still get 25 points fewer than students who did higher-level maths.  Also, students put so much time and effort into higher-level maths that they can forget about the other subjects.</p> <p>  Project work would be beneficial for students who may struggle with exams.  The way this might work is that one project would be completed in fifth year and another in sixth year.  The two projects could count for 20% or more of the overall final grade for the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  Applied sciences, including woodwork, engineering and metalwork, should be promoted in girls' schools.  These subjects should be offered in all schools regardless of the gender profile of the school.  Unfortunately, a lot of girls' schools do not offer these subjects.  Home economics should also be offered in all schools regardless of the gender profile of the school.  Running a household correctly and knowing how to cook is an incredibly important life skill.  Unfortunately, a lot of boys' schools do not offer this.</p> <p>  There should be a new subject of social, personal and health education and life skills.  For students who do not select home economics and for schools that cannot offer it as a subject, a life skills course should be offered to help students deal with life's situations.  I also believe that social, personal and health education should become part of the senior cycle curriculum as many schools do not have this.</p> <p>  There should be high-speed broadband Wi-Fi in schools.  Every school in the country should be fitted with high-speed Wi-Fi as schools progress into the digital age.</p><p> All students should have access to digital devices for schoolwork.  Covid-19 has shown us that there is a need for all students to have access to a digital device.  Currently, only 81% of DEIS students have access to a digital deceive for schoolwork while 88% of non-DEIS students have access to a device.</p><p> There should be English support for students whose first language is not English.  All schools should be required to offer support to students who have language difficulties because English may not be their first language and many students struggle with learning the language.</p><p> Regarding equal funding for schools, the same level of funding should be given to voluntary secondary schools as is offered to DEIS schools because all students should be given the same access to education.</p><p> There should be a new level for students who have completed national framework of qualifications, NFQ, level 1 or level 2.  Unfortunately, there is a gap in the junior and senior cycle systems currently whereby the students completing NFQ level 1 or level 2 in the junior cycle have no equivalent system at senior cycle.  That is why I am recommending that a new level be introduced for the students who have completed level 1 or level 2.  They should be offered another next level so they can move on to senior cycle.</p><p> We should encourage more apprenticeships.  To do an apprenticeship, a student must be at least 16 years of age and is expected to have a minimum of grade D in five subjects in the junior certificate or equivalent examination.  Nowadays many employers require the leaving certificate to have been completed.  The pathway to apprenticeships should be encouraged more by schools.  Many schools encourage their students to go to college but not all students wish to go to college.</p><p> More oral and listening work should be included in the Irish language curriculum. The amount of literature studied should be reduced.  This is because many students will use only the oral and listening aspects of Irish rather than read literature in Irish.</p><p> I would welcome any questions or concerns the committee may have.  Go raibh mile maith agaibh.</p></speech>

Ms Sheridan O'Callaghan spoke about the stresses of the leaving certificate and how she has come through them.  We have spoken about emotional counsellors in schools to help students.  We spoke about this earlier with departmental officials.  How would Ms Sheridan O'Callaghan flesh out the real stress of the leaving certificate?  What was the biggest issue for her?</p></speech>

In the Cork Life Centre, I did have access to counselling and guidance counsellors, but in mainstream school there were no counsellors or mental health supporters to help us through the leaving certificate and the period afterwards.  These are essential to get us through it.</p></speech>

I visited Cork Life Centre two weeks ago and therefore know exactly about the fantastic work being done there.  What are the main stresses for Mr. Sharpe as he is preparing for his examinations?  I said to Department officials this morning that I have fought five general elections.  A general election is very stressful but I found the leaving certificate equally stressful, if not more.</p><p>I know that was back in the mid-1990s, which was many years ago.  What stresses are the witnesses experiencing?  What help should be available for every student in mainstream secondary school, not just the Cork Life Centre, as they prepare for the leaving certificate?</p></speech>

Everything in maths is just covered under maths.  English literature and English language are covered under one subject.  That is mainly what is stressing me out because there is so much to learn and remember.  It is categorised to the point that we cannot study individual subjects.  I am also stressed because the leaving certificate is so important and is put on a pedestal.  It basically decides your life.  Everyone says there are other ways to go through it but really the leaving certificate is the main focus for everyone under the age of 18.</p> <p>  With regard to supports, counselling needs to be more generalised and supported in mainstream schools.  A big concern I have is that guidance counsellors are not counsellors and counsellors are not guidance counsellors.  They should be treated as per their role.  It seems many guidance counsellors nowadays are dropping the guidance and giving advice and listening.  While I can see what they are trying to do and how they are trying to help, that is not their job.  Guidance counsellors are there to support us in our educational health and provide a stepping stone to what we might do in the future.  Counsellors are not in mainstream schools enough for leaving certificate students to have the ability to speak about what is stressing them or going on in their heads.  It seems that when the leaving certificate is over, students are expected to forget about mental health because counselling services are not provided after the leaving certificate.  Schools expect us to just drop everything and be okay.</p></speech>

If we learning things that were useful to us in life, it would be more beneficial.  It is very stressful to have to learn everything on the curriculum, especially when we know we will not use it.  At my first ever statistics class in college, my lecturer told us to forget everything we had learned about maths in the leaving certificate because it was useless and would not help in statistics at all.  If we learned things that actually benefited us in life, it would be much less stressful.</p></speech>

Some people will agree with Mr. Ahern and more will not but I am a big believer in continuous assessment.  I would like it to have been in place when I did my leaving certificate many years ago.  Mr. Ahern was right when he spoke about home economics being available in all schools and not just schools where females attend and also about how woodwork and metalwork should be available to females as well.  In bygone days, they were only available in boys schools.  I totally agree with him on that.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Ahern to comment on continuous assessment.  What do his peers think?  I presume he spoke to his fellow students and peers before today's meeting about their thoughts and feelings on the leaving certificate.  He is now in the years where he will prepare for the leaving certificate.  It is with trepidation or nervousness that he approaches it because, as Mr. Sharpe said, it is seen as the be-all and end-all, which is not the case.  There are other ways and means of achieving what one wants in life and there are a huge number of opportunities in the educational field.</p><p>Maybe Mr. Ahern will flesh out the continuous assessment piece.  Does he think many males would take up home economics if it were available in all schools and, <i>vice versa</i>, if metalwork and woodwork were available in girls' schools, would there be an uptake in those subjects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#DD00200"><p>On the Chairman's continuous assessment question, during the week, I was speaking to a member of staff in my school and she made a very valid point.  In colleges, it is broken down: there are exams but then there are assessments.  It should be offered in the leaving certificate programme.  The leaving certificate should be a preparation for moving on to college.  In work, people are always being assessed through their work.  They could take it out of the junior certificate such as with the curriculum-based assessments.  They seem to be going very well even though a lot of them were postponed for this year's junior certificate.  I think it should be offered.  There was a huge take-up in the accredited grades process, so there probably would be a take up in continuous assessment.  It would have to be prepared rigorously by the Department.  Guidelines would have to be set out to make it a fair and equal system for everyone.  With continuous assessment, teachers who normally teach the class would know what grade the student would get.  If they were to be correcting work, my main worry would be that the teacher may move them up a small bit.  I am sure it would not happen; teachers take their jobs very seriously.  But if it were to happen, would it not be better to do it like the leaving certificate whereby the papers are sent somewhere in the country during the academic year to be corrected?</p> <p>  On the applied sciences in girls' schools, when the students from the girls' school in Mallow come to my school, the teachers who teach applied sciences offer the teaching of applied sciences during the evening.  We do not offer metalwork or engineering; we only offer woodwork and technical graphics.  I know there is a huge uptake in those with the girls.</p> <p>  Home economics should be offered in boys' schools.  I think there would be a huge uptake.  One of the most successful chefs in the world, Gordon Ramsay, is male.  It should not just be considered as a subject for females.  It should be offered.  I hope I have answered the Chairman's questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern made the point about continual assessment during fifth year in the form of Christmas and summer exams.  I am one of those people who believes continual assessment should be used a lot more.  As I said to the officials easier, 40 years ago when I did my leaving certificate, we were talking about how the Germans were well ahead of us and how slow we had been to react.  Of course, it took a pandemic to get us where we are at present and we still talking about end of year exams being the key.</p><p>What is Mr. Ahern's view of continual assessment in the form of further coursework happening in fifth year or sixth year?  Maybe that has been answered already.  One of the other points to emerge in recent times is the access to traineeships and apprenticeships, which is important.  I know from my daughter who is doing her leaving certificate that there seems to be a huge concentration on the CAO, that is the option, rather than the other options that are available and that are quite important for us as a society.  If we are trying to deliver a viable plan into the future, it cannot be all graduates.  There is a need for greater focus on traineeships and apprenticeships.  What are the views of our guests in that regard?  </p></speech>

Continuous assessment is incredibly important.  It takes a good deal of the stress off the students.  If the students know that they are going to have continuous assessment in fifth year and maybe one in sixth year, he or she knows that if he or she screws up on the final exam, he or she still has that continuous assessment, which will give some bit of hope to him or her.  Continuous assessment is possible and important as it also encourages students to stop cramming study because there are certain students who work throughout the year and then other students who just cram everything into the final couple of months before the exam, and continuous assessment would make those students do a small bit more.  Continuous assessments keeps students in the mind frame.  They will be able to know when everything is ready.  It also develops life skills such as research, project work and so on.  I mentioned that in my third recommendation.  Continuous assessment could be counted towards that as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question relates to apprenticeships.  They are sort of forgotten.  I would not say they were forgotten but everyone wants to go to college.  It is the first question anyone would ask.  If you meet students who have just completed the leaving certificate, the first question they are asked is what are they going to do, and they are expecting something about college.  More emphasis needs to be put on the apprenticeships and the CAO should take a somewhat more involved role in apprenticeships.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, have put a huge emphasis on apprenticeships but more emphasis should be put on them, and perhaps they could be promoted in transition year.  It seems like an area that is sort of forgotten or pushed away.  There is a need for apprenticeships.  There was an article on one of the national broadcasters about a shortage of skills and how we need to start bringing people in to apprenticeships.</p><p>It can be more labour but many benefits come out of apprenticeships.</p></speech>

I was part of the first year of students who did the new junior cycle.  From the top of my head, we had two continuous assessments in business that we did throughout the year.  Continuous assessments are a tool that is completely underutilised in the system.  As Mr. Hugh Ahern said, they are a gateway to learn how to gain life skills in researching and developing an idea, and putting it into a format, in addition to learning how to show the world what you have.</p> <p>  Senator O'Loughlin said earlier that too much continuous assessment is bad, but it is important to find a balance because it is such a great tool to remove a lot of stress from the end of the year and spread it out during the year.  It is not laid back to the point where students are not studying and not doing their work, but it is not stressful to the point where they cannot do the exam. </p></speech>

We should also have more options, such as philosophy and psychology classes, and classes that would benefit a student for college and life, where people can find out what do and do not like, so they have a better idea when going into college.</p></speech>

She has come through the leaving certificate.  Would she have preferred continuous assessment over two years compared to the written exam that she did?  Does she believe she might have done better under continuous assessment or would it have put her under more stress in fifth and sixth years?  What are her thoughts on that?</p></speech>

I personally would have preferred it, especially if there were two continuous assessments, one in fifth year and one in sixth year, and an end-of-year exam for students who might prefer exams to continuous assessments.  They can then all be weighed up to 30% or 40% of the overall mark or something like that.  It then gives people a chance to pass the subject on continuous assessments instead of the exam alone.</p> <p>  I did not do very well in my leaving certificate because of the stress and pressures.  I continued on to do two post-leaving certificate courses before I started studying psychology.  I had to do that because I had no idea what I wanted to do.  Everything I learned on the leaving certificate curriculum was just not beneficial for me at all, for example, the oral exams and all that.  I do not know about anyone else but I walked out of my first oral exam and refused to do it because it was so stressful trying to talk to a stranger.  I am now doing Spanish as a minor subject in college.  The lecturer is the one who does the oral exam and is someone I am comfortable with.  An external examiner listens back to the recording.  I find that way better.</p></speech>

Talking to a stranger is an artificial situation.  If the oral exam was held with five or six people, together with an examiner, and with a conversation that is bouncing back and forth, it might be easier to make people more comfortable and more aware.  On a further point, when a student goes to college, nowadays there is often group work involved.</p><p>However, there is no reflection of group work in the leaving certificate.  The closest thing would be some of the project work or practical work that students do on their own.  However, they do not have time to bounce ideas off their teachers and classmates.</p><p> On the point Mr. Ahern made about the CAO and apprenticeships, it would be interesting if they could play a greater role.  Are there any other options that could be used to try to expand students' awareness and also the public's appreciation of apprenticeships?  Mr. Ahern was correct that the first question people ask students is what college they intend going to.  Society and the economy will not survive without the skills of electricians, carpenters and so on.  These skills are not as appreciated as they were in the past.  Even simple courses than can be done as apprenticeships, for example, courses for technicians, are needed now more than ever to keep the wheels of the economy turning.  Despite this, most people seem to want to go to college or university.  That might not be the best option for them but it is what they are geared towards.  Perhaps our guests can figure out or already have some ideas about what else we can do as regards other options.</p></speech>

It could also be included in first year.  Apprenticeships could also be encouraged in primary school because they need to be encouraged much more.  Colleges hold open days to attract students.  They will do anything to attract students to the college.  To encourage apprenticeships, schools could have guest speakers from certain trades, such as someone from an electrical background, a plumber and people from similar trades.</p> <p>  The public service recruitment service has launched a section to encourage students to consider a path in the public service.  Perhaps one of the Departments could do something similar and set up a website that students could access for information on apprenticeships.  Currently, this is done by word of mouth and you have to know people.  Apprenticeships are not promoted much; colleges are promoted more.</p> <p>  The Department and the CAO could develop a specific option whereby students who want to do an apprenticeship would only have to sit certain subjects instead of having to sit all subjects.  Someone who wants to do carpentry probably does not need Irish as much as woodwork or maybe business.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills and the Department of Education could look into creating a specific examination to encourage people to do an apprenticeship.  These ideas are off the top of my head so I do not know how great they are.</p></speech>

They could go off and do a trade, an apprenticeship and a bit of college work.  Students who wanted to take a more academic path, such as STEM, or anything to do with college or university would continue with the leaving certificate and then university.  That would get many people doing trades and get up participation rates in trades.  It would lead to many women taking up trades too because it would be so easy to access, whereas at the moment that path is very hard to access.</p> <p>  As Mr. Ahern has said, students need their leaving certificate and certain grades to get an apprenticeship.  Some people just are not able for that and do not want to do that.  They will not focus on that.  It is just a bit silly restricting some people's lives just because they do not want do maths or English.  They might want to fix cars or whatever.  It should be at least an option.</p></speech>

We are having trouble with the connection to Senator Dolan, who is next on the list.  Does the Deputy have any further questions?</p></speech>

I did my leaving certificate 40 years ago and at that stage there were technical colleges and what he describes is specifically what they were aimed at.  They ensured that trades would involve the required skills.  It was where people with an interest in woodwork and metalwork or trades went and where people used their hands.  They were then converted into community colleges and over time they concentrated on further education.  Now they seem to be also viewed as a tool to ensure people can get to colleges.  Even the technical colleges at third level have changed to universities and standards have gone up in terms of access to universities.  Apprenticeships seem to be getting squeezed and left as an afterthought.</p> <p>  Some of these centres in my area have at times struggled to fill courses.  The result is despite there being a demand for further housing, we will not be able to meet that demand even if the Government puts all the money in and the sites are there.  We do not have the skilled people to involve themselves in the building trade.  It is the same in many of the other trades in which we need apprenticeships.</p> <p>  When apprentices qualify fully as electricians or whatever, they are well-paid and have good jobs.  They must put in the hours.  It is hard manual work in many cases but I always encourage people to look at it as an option.  There are also people who get into trouble at school because it is too academic.  They cannot focus on that kind of academic approach.</p><p>Often the space is open for them then to continue their education, and I agree.  Perhaps it is the case that the system may encourage some schools to go to one or the other.  Not every school can offer the fullest of leaving certificate courses.  I see that Senator-----</p></speech>

It was mentioned that people would do what they want to do and that they would not be messing.  I will talk about that point a bit more.  If there was a way people could be in the classes that they wanted to be in, then the rate of bullying, messing in classes and people not listening would go down significantly.  If people want to be in classes, and make a choice to be there, then they are going to be there.  Those students are going to want to learn and they are going to learn, and then go off and be successful because they are doing what they want to do.  That could also solve many bullying problems.</p></speech>

Apprenticeships are going to be included in the CAO from this academic year.  I have spoken before about how there is a great deal of peer pressure on many students regarding what college they are going to and how many points they got.  That is the focus of the talk between peers, friends, family and everybody when students are doing their leaving certificate examinations.  Asking people what college they are going to and what they are hoping to do there is part of starting a conversation in this regard, but it puts huge pressure on students.  I refer to situations where one person might want to do law and then another might want to be a plumber or a carpenter, which are not seen as being sexy jobs compared to what might result from some of the other academic college courses.  Now that apprenticeships are part of the CAO process, will that make it easier for students to participate in apprenticeships?  I ask the three witnesses for their views on this point.  I call Mr. Ahern first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021120700002#JJ00500"><p>It would encourage people to take on apprenticeships.  As the Chair said, an apprenticeship may not be the most attractive job compared to going to college or doing courses like law, but it is a good thing.  People who qualify from apprenticeships put in a lot of hours, but those jobs tend to pay well.  In addition, if apprenticeships are being recognised by the CAO, then I think people would want to take them up.  The national media, though, are sort of responsible as well.  I am not sure if I should say more.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Ahern to continue and to say what he is saying, because I agree with him.</p></speech>

That is because every year, around July, when the exams are finished and the results are out, the front page of every newspaper, tabloids and the main national papers, will have photos of the graduates who got the top-of-the-range points in the leaving certificate examinations.  We do not, however, see the people going off to do apprenticeships.  More encouragement must be given to people who do that.  They should be recognised in the same way as their peers who may have got 625 points and may be going off to one of the top colleges in the country.  The people going off to do apprenticeships should be included in the newspapers as well.  It is a great achievement for the people who get the top points, but it is also an achievement for people who get into apprenticeships.  They may have completed the junior and leaving certificate examinations, but they may not have wanted to.  Therefore, I think the achievements of all students should be recognised by the media, no matter in what area.</p><p>That is one of the partial causes, but there are many more.  I will pass it on.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, depending on what trade they go into, they can make much more than the person who gets 300, 400 or 500 points.  Apprenticeships can lead to fantastic careers.  Some people who went into apprenticeships were extremely successful at starting their own businesses and are very wealthy now.</p></speech>

Many people who want to go into a trade need their leaving certificate to do it and many of them drop out before then.  Giving people the option to go into a trade after the junior certificate would be extremely beneficial and it would lower the dropout rate, people not getting jobs and things like that.</p> <p>  Continuous assessment would be beneficial because in college we have the option of picking a title within a topic.  That way someone knows for sure they are doing something they like.  They are writing about something they enjoy.  It gives people the option to show their academic skills in a way that they want to.  It would be important to bring that into secondary schools.</p></speech>

That causes stress for many people.  As the Chairman said, in conversation it is all about what college someone is going to or what course they are doing.  It just feels like a very big competition and we need to change how we look at it.  Doing a course is regarded differently from doing an apprenticeship.  There should not be a stigma around that.  I know people who do apprenticeships who are much more successful, but more importantly much happier than people who go to college and do a course they do not like just because of the social pressure to go to college and say they have a course.  We need to look at that completely and work out why there is such a stigma around getting apprenticeships.</p></speech>

Mr. Ahern addressed the committee previously.  It is great to see them.  I am delighted they are talking about apprenticeships.  One of the key messages we are trying to convey relates to the opportunities for students at leaving certificate level.  There are so many ways for them to get to the career they want.  Sometimes it comes down to what other people say.  I recently read that people decide to take up apprenticeships on the basis of something somebody they know said to them.  In other words, it is not coming from schools or career guidance.  It might be coming from an acquaintance, a family friend or someone in the family who might promote the course.  We need to work to promote the programme.</p> <p>  As the witnesses and the Chairman said, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has introduced the CAO reform that allows applications for apprenticeships along with all our further and higher education courses.  Ms Sheridan O'Callaghan mentioned that there are different PLCs and that students might have a choice of doing a PLC to try something out.  This may sound a bit cheeky, but I am not sure any of us still know what we will be doing.  People will only have two or three jobs or careers in their lifetime.  Last week, the expert group on future skills needs said that it wanted to develop a leaving certificate and a secondary school experience that would leave people with an appetite for learning.</p><p>That was a great thing to say because in all ways, be it in a practical learning way or in an academic way, people might come back in their 30s and 40s and consider doing more courses and we might build a culture of lifelong learning.  The leaving certificate could potentially be improved so that we leave students with a better feeling about education and about doing further and higher education.<br/><br/>There are 60 apprenticeships and another 18 are being developed on <i>apprenticeships.ie</i>.  We are trying to encourage employers to come on board.  Part of what I try to do is talk to businesses and tell them about this programme if they are worried about staff shortages or recruitment and retention.  It could be in so many areas such as hairdressing, biopharma, accounting, real estate or auctioneering.  How could we encourage employers to think about taking on a young student or a student of any age into an apprenticeship programme?  What would be a good way for employers to look kindly on taking on somebody?<br/><br/>Career guidance counsellors were mentioned.  Mr. Sharpe mentioned that career guidance teachers are not counsellors and that counsellors are not career guidance teachers.  Does some work need to be done on that?  Mental health supports and well-being were also mentioned.  We spoke earlier about supports like <i>mymind.org</i>and <i>turn2me.ie</i>and the helpline number is 50808.  Do the witnesses know of any friends or anyone who might have accessed online supports when it comes to health and well-being that are out there to support students?</p></speech>

PLCs are beneficial but if I had some sort of psychology learning in school I would go straight into it in my degree instead of spending two years doing PLCs.  Classes like that are beneficial.</p> <p>  On counselling and guidance counsellors, in mainstream school I never found any counselling, if it was even there.  Guidance counselling, on the other hand, was difficult too.  In the Cork Life Centre I was able to access both guidance counselling and counselling during the leaving certificate year and after the leaving certificate.  I found that was beneficial to me but I know that not all students have that experience</p></speech>

I want to touch on the difference between career guidance counsellors and counsellors.  Counsellors are not really looked at as a necessary part of the education system.  They are looked at as a side aspect that can help students in their personal lives.  Mental health affects every single student in the leaving certificate and junior certificate system in one way or another.  Students should be taught in schools how to preserve their mental health.  Counselling should be more important in schools and it should be provided.  The HSE does not touch on it much and counsellors are not provided.  There needs to be a huge reformation of the counselling in the leaving certificate system.</p></speech>

Most of the time the online services are one-off and they do not provide continuous support.  It is only there if you are in an immediate crisis but not if it is a serious crisis either because it cannot deal with that.  In-person counselling is really needed, especially in mainstream schools.</p></speech>

The officials of the Department of Education mentioned a leaflet.  I spoke to a couple of people to ask about that leaflet and I have a feeling it never reached certain schools.  It is the first time I have heard of the leaflet.</p> <p>  In regard to counselling services, I was involved with the youth advisory panel of Turn2me, which put quite a lot into a youth service.  I believe the Department and the health service should look at a school service for students.  The Department officials stated in the report that it is a HSE matter but I would see it as more of a Department of Education matter.  Student welfare has been a topic of concern in recent years and new policies have been brought out on student welfare.  I believe the Department should have greater concern in regard to student counselling.  If the committee can get a copy of the leaflet for me, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I was going to say "well done".  There is an incentive of &euro;2,000 for employers to take on an apprentice and another &euro;1,000 if they keep them on after six months, so that is there.  Well done.  We will work with the Cathaoirleach to ensure that leaflet is circulated.  It could be the case that it is sent to people within the school and it just needs to be circulated to students.  I thank Mr. Ahern and all of the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, due to the impact of Covid restrictions on the one hand and Storm Barra in the second instance, we are somewhat restricted in our attendance and our engagement.  I apologise for that.  However, it is important that we proceed, in any event, notwithstanding the technological challenges.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senators Joe O'Reilly and Craughwell.  I am delighted, notwithstanding the challenges to which I referred, we are meeting with representatives of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Sorcha Tunney, Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights; Ms Rosa Mar&iacute;a Mateus Parra, who is joining us from Colombia and represents the Colombian human rights organisation the Jos&eacute; Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective, CAJAR - members will be familiar with engagements on this issue earlier this year; Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Neill, Christian Aid Ireland; and Mr. Garry Walsh, Tr&oacute;caire.</p> <p>  Most of the guests will be familiar with the format of our committee engagement, but I apologise that it is not possible to have our meeting in-person in the committee room.  Along with the officials, I am somewhat alone.  However, hopefully the restrictions will lift in the new year and we can put the global pandemic behind us.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the opening statements of our guests followed by a discussion, and questions and answers with members of the committee.  I remind members to be concise with their questions to allow all members an opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we will have a second opportunity for members to come back in if they wish.</p> <p>  I advise witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction is complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  However, I do not anticipate that these issues will arise in the context of our engagement.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  I will call on Ms Tunney to introduce her colleagues and to make her opening statement.  With regard to the statement of Ms Mateus Parra from Colombia, I understand it will be delivered in Spanish.  An English version of the statement along with a presentation have been circulated to members.  During the course of Ms Mateus Parra's presentation, members might wish to have a copy of the English statement to hand.</p> <p>  Ms Tunney is very welcome, and I give her the floor.</p></speech>

We will introduce each other as we go along so that it is easy for people to follow.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present on this important issue.  First, I want to say a few words about the coalition and then I will briefly outline why it is calling for legally binding business and human rights legislation.</p> <p>  The Coalition for Business and Human Rights is a new coalition.  Our members consist of union representatives, development organisations, human rights defenders, and legal, women&rsquo;s rights and environmental organisations.  Some of our members include Oxfam Ireland, Front Line Defenders, the National Women&rsquo;s Council and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Joining us today is Tr&oacute;caire and Christian Aid Ireland.  Our members also include leading academic experts in the areas of human rights, law and business.  The coalition is focused on progressing corporate accountability and Irish leadership in promoting business and human rights, both at home and abroad.  We advocate to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s support for the development of a UN binding treaty on business and human rights, with a gender and human rights defender perspective, and mandatory, gender responsive human rights and environmental due diligence legislation in Ireland and the EU.</p> <p>  Why do we need a binding UN treaty and mandatory due diligence legislation in Ireland?  Companies have an enormous impact on people&rsquo;s lives and the communities in which they operate.  Sometimes the impact is positive - jobs are created, new technology improves lives and investment in the community translates into real benefits for those who live there - but sometimes the impact is negative.  We have witnessed countless instances when corporations exploited weak and poorly enforced domestic regulation with devastating effects on people, communities, and their environment. The activities of corporations have contributed to climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse, the erosion of workers&rsquo; and trade union rights, forced and child labour, growing poverty, reprisals, and even the killing of environmental and human rights defenders.</p> <p>  There are few effective mechanisms to prevent corporate human rights abuses or to hold companies to account, and there is no global regulation in this area, despite the transnational nature of much business.  The development of legally binding regulation at UN level to regulate transnational corporations and other business enterprises is in process but has not been supported by the European Union.  To date, the response at international level has been to develop principles that allow companies to voluntarily implement these guidelines.  However, there is growing global consensus that the voluntary approach has not worked.  The lack of legally binding and enforceable standards for corporations with respect to human rights and the environment have allowed some corporations to continue to disregard appalling human rights abuses and environmental harm.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.301" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>For example, last year was the most dangerous year on record for human rights defenders as 227 were killed while campaigning on land and environmental issues.  Women are being failed massively.  They are over-represented in precarious work with poor working conditions.  They are vulnerable to exploitation and sexual abuse.  Furthermore, indigenous women defenders are vulnerable to evictions and dispossession to make way for large-scale development projects.  Developing a UN binding treaty or mandatory due diligence law is not anti-business.  Many of the leading global brands and investors have called for corporate accountability legislation.  Such legislation will create a level playing field where all companies are obliged to invest and improve their human rights performance in a systematic manner rather than leaving that to chance.</p><p>We will continue, as a coalition, to work, like Oxfam Ireland, with progressive businesses in Ireland and Europe to support effective legislation.  Strong laws are really needed that require all companies to identify, prevent and address their human rights and environmental risks across the entire business operation.  The coalition has produced two reports to support the development of such laws.  The first report calls for a transformative treaty that clearly details how Ireland can make progress towards a UN binding treaty.  The second report is our new one that is entitled Make It Your Business.  It details how Ireland can ensure businesses respect human rights and the environment through the development of domestic legislation.</p><p>There are high levels of pubic support for corporate accountability.  Recently Ipsos polled a group of people on behalf of the coalition.  Ipsos discovered that 81% of Irish people want Irish companies that act unethically in low-income countries to be subjected to legally binding regulation in Ireland.  Ireland is a global leader in protecting human rights.  Now it is crucial that Ireland plays a role to prevent the abuse of human rights and prevents environmental abuse.</p><p>I thank the members for listening.  I am delighted to introduce the human rights lawyer, Ms Rosa Mar&iacute;a Mateus Parra, who will share her experience in Colombia.  As the Chairman said, Ms Mateus Parra will speak in Spanish.  Members have a copy of the translation in a Word document.  We are lucky to have her here today and I would like to give her a warm welcome.</p></speech>

Other men from other worlds want hunger and death to come in, a hunger that kills silently, that can kill the silent.&rdquo;  I will tell the committee about a people who is not silent, despite those who would wish to silence them.  My gratitude to those who can listen to us with their conscience because we will discuss death, a people's risk of extermination, and who is responsible and can be made accountable.<br/><br/>Over more than 20 years of work, our organisation has managed to corroborate several things <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>the complaints of indigenous, Afro-descendant and small-scale farming communities of La Guajira in Colombia.<br/><br/>First, the coal exported from our country is coal brimming with death and destruction.  The extracted coal that reaches Ireland has meant the constant violation of human and environmental rights, as has been stated in the Colombian court sentences about the ineffective and disingenuous compliance of companies.<br/><br/>Second, the affected communities have identified and face abuses of power and enormous asymmetry in relations between states, the company and communities.  Third, the communities are in a struggle to defend life, water, and territory from the violations of their right to a healthy environment and ecological balance, to be against pollution and the mine's high water consumption in a semi-arid region, diseases, ignorance of the climate crisis, and the need to act urgently in the face of violations of labour rights.<br/><br/>The information presented to these offices exist within the context of a dispute over the truth between one of the parties, and the communities which only have only their voices, their feelings and their lived reality, and some judicial sentences that have not been fulfilled and fall short of accountability for senior decision-makers.  Plus, there is the company, which counts on communicative power, corporate capture, wealth and countries that, finding it difficult to review their conscience and dream of a different world, believe that we can continue to live as we have until now.<br/><br/>We once said the following to the shareholders of these companies.  We said that it may be that the world is condemned to suffer the invisible dictatorship of finances and profit, and that no one in the auditorium really cares that the money they receive cost the life of a Wayuu child, that it did not matter because it was not their children who would not be able to sleep at night due to a coughing fit, and that it was of no importance because it was not they who, as mothers and fathers, would have to weep for their children dying of hunger and thirst.  In La Guajira more than 5,000 children have died in the last decade.<br/><br/>It may be that the world is condemned to live under the spell of the words of those who lie, cheat and take advantage of people's vulnerability.  Perhaps people have settled for varnished stories about the social responsibility they claim to apply and chained themselves to their lies.  However, there is only one reality for them, for members and for the whole world - the climate crisis.  One day the companies will no longer be able to pass off their encouraging statistics because the world will simply no longer tolerate their lies.  The climate crisis is something that we will all experience.  No one will be able to flee from it and profits will not keep us warm or feed us.<br/><br/>It is urgent that those who have an opportunity to help stop so much death should do so.  It is urgent that those who hold office and represent consumer states help to prevent this from continuing, and from becoming accomplices to the destruction and suffering perpetrated by others.  It is necessary to monitor the companies denounced by communities, even companies that have declared themselves responsible.  It is necessary to exact justice so that these companies do not remain in impunity.<br/><br/>The need for alternatives and a transition is a reality.  The response to a change in the traditional energy matrix is a reality.  All that is necessary is to listen to those who have answers rather than those who have lied, those who see in others the faces of fools whom they can subject to a model that day by day becomes an ever greater failure for humanity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#B00400"><p>On behalf of Christian Aid and the coalition, I sincerely thank Ms Mateus Parra for her passionate speech about what has happened in Cerrej&oacute;n and how communities have been impacted.  We stand in full solidarity and support with them.  In many ways that is one of the main reasons for our presence today.</p> <p>  Last year, Christian Aid Ireland published detailed research on the situation at the mine and, crucially, details on the Irish links with the mine.  First, for two decades, the State-owned Electricity Supply Board  imported millions of tonnes of coal from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine despite years of extremely serious human rights abuses and environmental harms being associated with the mine.  Since 2001, the mine has provided the bulk of the coal burned at Moneypoint power plant in County Clare.</p> <p>  Ms Mateus Parra and our other Colombian partners rightly ask that we question the energy we consume.  We must ask ourselves where does it come from and how does it get here.  We cannot ignore that this coal, which is burned to light our homes and help fuel the country, has been drawn along a supply chain that is littered with really serious human rights concerns.  These concerns range from displacement and intimidation to ecological destruction, the pollution of air, soil and water, and the associated health and respiratory problems.  This simply is not consistent with the ESB's obligations under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p><p>Of course, these principles, which were agreed multilaterally, apply to State-owned companies, such as ESB, but also to the many multinationals based here.  Ireland has a particular responsibility in this regard.<br/><br/>Our foreign direct investment, FDI, model and low-tax environment have made the country a magnet and hub for some of the biggest, most powerful companies in the world.  This can bring employment and tax revenue but it also brings a requirement to ensure those companies are adequately regulated and operating responsibly.<br/><br/>The case of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine illustrates this well.  While the coal is mined more 7,500 km away on the other side of the world, its sale and delivery is managed through a small subsidiary based in Dublin.  The Coal Marketing Company, CMC, was established in 2003 by the mining giants which then owned Cerrej&oacute;n - BHP, Anglo American, and Glencore.  In the years since, it has recorded billions of dollars in revenue and not only does much of the coal flow from Colombia to Europe, some of the profit does too.  In Cerrej&oacute;n, we see the role powerful corporate actors can play in fuelling human rights abuses as well as, ultimately, the failure of states to adequately hold them accountable.<br/><br/>As my colleague, Mr. Walsh, will set out in detail, Ireland and other EU states have so far taken a largely voluntary approach, which seeks to encourage corporate respect for human rights, rather than make it mandatory.  That is precisely where our coalition's proposal and report come in.<br/><br/>Christian Aid and many of the international aid and development organisations in the coalition have been active on this issue, because we see the impact businesses can have on human rights all over the world, in the different countries in which we work.  It is crucial to say it is not just about Colombia, or one country or context.  It is about a global power dynamic in which a relatively small number of companies yield huge influence, generate significant profit, but can often evade accountability when they are engaged in human right abuses.  The complexity of modern corporate structures and elaborate supply chains have made it even more difficult for impacted communities such as those La Guajira to seek justice, often across borders and several jurisdictions.<br/><br/>There are many more examples of this dynamic in industries ranging from mining to textiles, in the EU and in Ireland, contained in the report.  It also includes the case of a Palestinian man, Awni Shaaeb, whose farmland in the occupied West Bank was seized by Israeli settlers and a settlement established on it.  The members will be aware this is illegal under international law.  It is a presumptive war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, but over the years the settlement has nonetheless expanded and Mr. Shaaeb can no longer access much of his land to farm.<br/><br/>However, any of us can this afternoon log onto <i>airbnb.ie</i>and book a holiday rental in the illegal settlement built on his family&rsquo;s land.  Those bookings are made through Airbnb Ireland, based in Dublin&rsquo;s docklands.  What makes this more egregious still is that the rental is made under conditions of inherent discrimination.  Israeli citizens and, indeed, international tourists can pay to stay there, but Palestinians are effectively prohibited.  Here we have a company based in Ireland, profiting from these rentals, despite the unambiguous illegality of the settlement project and the myriad human rights abuses associated with it.<br/><br/>Airbnb, to its credit, publicly recognised this in 2018 and announced it would de-list these properties over human rights concerns.  Sadly, in the wake of intense pressure and potential legal action, the decision was at least temporarily reversed.<br/><br/>The crucial point is that these cases and the others included in the research, are illustrative of a much wider trend.  The uncomfortable truth is that many large European companies, including some based in Ireland, have been linked to serious human rights and environmental harms throughout their supply chains and global operations.  It is very important EU member states take action to tackle this.  My colleague, Mr. Walsh, will speak in more detail about our proposal for new, binding corporate accountability legislation to help address this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garry Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#C00200"><p>Our coalition is of the view that the key to addressing the issue of corporate harm to the environment and human rights is to move beyond voluntary commitments and towards legally binding regulation.  This would be the most effective way to systematically address these issues, such as in the cases that we have heard about in Colombia, Palestine and other areas.  Ten years ago, the UN agreed a set of key guiding principles on business and human rights.</p> <p>  The guiding principles provide a framework for how states and businesses should meet their obligations and responsibilities to respect and protect human rights and to provide for remedy when abuses still occur.  They suggest a "smart mix" of measures, including both voluntary and mandatory approaches.  These include introducing systematic due diligence checks, whereby companies must identify, prevent, mitigate and, ultimately, account for how they address human rights issues throughout their supply chains and operations.</p> <p>  However, despite these guidelines from the UN, due diligence over the past decade has largely been encouraged, through voluntary guidance, rather than made mandatory through binding legislation.  Fundamentally, asking corporations to effectively police themselves has failed to systematically prevent these abuses from happening.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach has also largely relied predominantly on voluntary measures, rather than progressing binding legislation.  Our national plan on business and human rights has focused on voluntary guidelines and there is little evidence that this model of encouragement to Irish companies has had a significant impact.  Recent research from Trinity College Dublin has shown that of the top 60 companies in Ireland, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s ten largest State-owned enterprises, 34% scored zero on embedding respect for human rights in their operations.</p> <p>  Furthermore, at UN level, Ireland and the EU have failed to support the development of a legally binding treaty on business and human rights.  Negotiations for a treaty to regulate the activities of transnational corporations have been ongoing for the seven years.  We are extremely disappointed with the EU&rsquo;s lack of meaningful engagement to progress this treaty, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s lack of pro-active support in favour of a UN treaty.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this issue of corporate accountability, business and human rights, which relies predominantly on a voluntary measures, is out of step with developments throughout Europe in recent years.  There is a clear shift now towards firmer binding legal requirements.  France, Germany and Norway have all introduced legislation for mandatory human rights due diligence across supply chains.  The European Commission is developing an EU-wide legislative proposal which was due this year.  It has been delayed, but we hope it will be announced early next year.  Just in the past few days, the Dutch foreign minister has indicated the Netherlands will introduce mandatory human rights due diligence.</p> <p>  We would like to see Ireland using its influence at the EU to push for a strong and robust EU due diligence directive and for the EU to secure a mandate to negotiate a UN treaty.  In October 2022, during the negotiations in Geneva, we want to see the EU push for a strong treaty and want Ireland to push in order that the EU turns up at the eighth session with a mandate to negotiate.</p> <p>  These international frameworks are important, but the priority should be to introduce national level legislation.  The EU directive would ultimately mandate Ireland to introduce such legislation and this should be the priority.  Ireland should develop strong legislation and the groundwork should begin now.  We encourage this committee to strongly support the initiation of Irish legislation and our coalition has set out our proposals for how such legislation could look in our recent Make it Your Business report.  We have set out key elements of how such legislation would look, underpinned by the work of Dr. Rachel Widdis from Trinity College, who is one of the leading experts in Ireland in this area.</p> <p>  Such legislation would make it mandatory for companies to undertake human rights and environmental due diligence.</p><p>This would be a legal duty.  It would cover all Irish businesses and all human rights and international environmental standards.  It would also introduce legal liability for companies throughout their global supply chains.  If we see an Irish company cause or contribute to damage, they could be liable, so affected communities would be able to take cases against Irish companies for damages, compensation or remedy through the Irish courts.  We would also advocate that it should include meaningful and safe engagement with affected communities at all stages in the process and it should address reprisals against communities which choose to speak out to defend human rights.</p><p> Given the work of initiating and developing such legislation would cut across the responsibilities of a number of Government Departments, we respectfully request that the Chair of the committee write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also to the Minister for Justice and the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to recommend that they progress strong corporate accountability legislation in Ireland and work together across Departments to progress legislation along the lines of the proposals we are setting out in our report.</p><p> To conclude, as we recover from the pandemic, ultimately, we need to change our approach.  We need to insist on legally binding regulation.  We need to see an end to land grabs, rivers been poisoned, forests being cut down, garment workers producing our clothes in situations akin to modern slavery and toxic oil spills ruining the environment.  We need to end corporate abuses of human rights and the environment.  Frankly, we need to do our best to end the involvement of Irish companies in the situations we have heard about from Ms Mateus Parra in her powerful testimony today.  We have to protect the land defenders, environmental defenders and indigenous defenders because they are already protecting all of us.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is a remote meeting but that does not take from the evidence they have laid before the committee this afternoon.  It is very damning evidence, with some very serious asks, not just of this committee but also of the EU and the Irish Government.  It would be safe to say we are seeing communities throughout the world being exploited for profit.  That is touched on very comprehensively in the latest report from the coalition, Make It Your Business, which contains damning evidence of the human rights violations and abuses going on across the world, with everything from Texaco to the ESB to human rights abuses in Uganda and Kenya by Tullow Oil and Total Energies all laid out very graphically.  We see huge volumes of land being seized, forests being cut down and rivers being poisoned, all in the name of business.  We also see communities facing very violent forced evictions, land grabs, brutal physical assaults and murder.</p> <p>  I welcome our guest, Rosa Mar&iacute;a Mateus Parra from Columbia.  Unfortunately, Colombia is one of the worst countries in the world for murders associated with assaults on human rights defenders.  There is an account of 227 human rights defenders being murdered in Colombia last year, making it the worst country in the world for assaults and murders of human rights defenders.  Next week, this committee will continue its work on the whole area of human rights violations and we will have Mr. Eamon Gilmore before the committee.  I know our witnesses will be familiar with some of the work by Mr. Gilmore, who is currently the EU special representative for human rights and previously was the special envoy on the peace process in Colombia.  We will have an opportunity to question Mr. Gilmore on many of those issues associated not just with human rights in general but particularly in Colombia.</p> <p>  It is shameful there are no legally binding business and human rights regulations to stop the exploitation and abuse.  As has been alluded to and quite graphically portrayed by all of our witnesses, voluntary measures have failed to prevent the abuses and are simply not strong enough to stop them, hold the businesses to account and ensure due diligence is being carried out.  It is safe to say many corporations have more economic clout than many of small countries across the world where they are happy to operate and continue to exploit.  We cannot expect them to regulate themselves without a strong global legal framework in place to which they have to adhere.</p> <p>  I agree that we need mandatory, gender responsive human rights and environmental due diligence legislation both in Ireland and the EU.  It is very disappointing, to say the least, that despite repeated rounds of negotiations, the EU and Ireland have not signed up to a binding UN charter.  I ask our witnesses why they think there is such a reluctance at that level to sign up to something that is binding.  Has Ireland made its official position known with regard to a UN charter and has it made any statements in that regard?</p> <p>  This committee has done work in terms of trying to address some of the concerns that Mr. O&rsquo;Neill in particular touched on around the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia.  The committee embarked on writing to the Colombian ambassador and the ESB earlier in the year and we got some correspondence back from the ESB in February.  It said there is a complaint by the Global Legal Action Network from the national contact point for Ireland.  It goes on to say that, in the period between 2015 and 2018, ESB purchases made up only 2% of the volumes but it seems to suggest that it has stopped receiving coal from Cerrej&oacute;n.  Perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Neill will be able to answer on whether that is the case or whether the ESB is still bringing in coal.  It is very concerning given the level of human rights abuses, violations and murder, not just in Colombia but particularly at that mine.</p> <p>  The issue of Airbnb is also very concerning.  Ireland is the first EU country to formally declare that Israel has illegally de facto annexed Palestinian land yet we still have the Airbnb headquarters here in Dublin, although it is using land that has been illegally confiscated on its platforms and it plans to rent or lease it out to people.  This is very concerning and it again highlights the need for this legislation.</p> <p>  A UK Government watchdog recently found that JCB failed to carry out due diligence and human rights checks with regard to the use of JCB equipment to illegally demolish Palestinian homes.  I might get a comment in that regard as to what system is in place in the UK.</p><p>Is it part of a voluntary system?  What type of repercussions do we think might come from a finding such as that of the UK Government watchdog?  We know that JCB equipment is utilised to a large extent for the illegal demolition of Palestinian homes.</p><p> This legislation is badly needed.  We need legislation in the State and we also need it at EU level.  I want to take Mr. Walsh up on his request that the committee take the lead on this issue.  It is incumbent on us to invite before the committee not just the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also the T&aacute;naiste, who has a responsibility for trade, to brief us on the Irish position on the UN treaty, our involvement in the legislation going through the EU and the prospect of putting in place legislation that is critically needed in the State to ensure that due diligence in respect of human rights and business is put in place.  It is the right thing to do.  According to opinion polls, 81% of Irish people want Irish businesses and companies to behave ethically and to be held to account when they do not do so .  I have asked several questions and I hope the witnesses will be able to answer them.  If there is an opportunity later, I would like to come back in.</p></speech>

I will fully support the call for us to write to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice.  The committee can probably go further and get its teeth into this matter and take a lead on it.  Mr. Walsh outlined that work on the legislation has already started.  Perhaps it might be an idea for us to engage in an informal pre-legislative process and get into the work.  This is a suggestion I am making more to the committee than the witnesses.  Perhaps we should start getting our teeth into an informal pre-legislative process and begin to organise the questions that will arise and bring them to other committees.</p> <p>  Recently at EU level, we have had the Singapore trade agreement.  In this regard, human rights abuses were raised.  How does legislation targeting corporations impact on EU trade agreements such as that with Singapore where significant issues regarding human rights violations exist?  What can be done at this level?</p></speech>

I notice from the report presented to us that France and Germany have introduced laws on mandatory human rights due diligence.  I am interested to know what the witnesses think of these laws.  How do they impact, if at all?  I notice some improvements could be made.  Has any other country introduced the type of legislation proposed?  If so, how does it work?  Mr. Walsh said 34% of Irish companies scored zero on embedding respect for human rights in their operations.  On the other side of the coin, are there examples of good practice whereby companies have taken on the voluntary approach and managed to do the right thing?  Are there Irish or global companies the witnesses could tell us about?  I know from my work in the past on diversity that some companies do a lot of very important work in this area.  Are there any large corporations that are trailblazers we could use as examples and point to?  Sometimes we need this type of pioneering spirit that others can follow.  I have read the reports and what is happening in many areas is appalling.  We need to do what we can to address this.  Much of it seems to be based on greed and profit.  It is something we cannot stand over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#E00700"><p>It is hair-raising to have another Sorcha present; it has made me jump slightly on several occasions.  I thank all of our guests for their very detailed explanations and opinions on what is happening in the world.  I get very perplexed and somewhat confused because we often hear the repeated refrain of how we are now a global economy and that we need to think about work, business and customers in a global manner and almost remove the parish pump element from our businesses.  What we do not see, and what we certainly do not hear about, is the global nature of responsibility and the global nature of regulations that need to be put in place.  Mr. Walsh spoke about ten years of voluntary guidelines.  I find it difficult to comprehend why anybody would have thought some companies would voluntarily sign up to these guidelines and would voluntarily take on the additional cost and the change in their outlook that would respect human rights and remove the environmental harm they have been doing.  Let us be honest.  It is not something that some corporations are open to or with which their business model is automatically compatible.</p> <p>  Ireland's long-standing reputation on overseas aid and its progression as a people who want to see a greater level of human rights has been delivered over generations.  It strikes me that there is a hue of hypocrisy when we pat ourselves on the back regarding the amount of work we engage in while not holding companies that are Irish, or that may be semi-State bodies or that may be some of the biggest companies in the world operating here, to a standard which means that they can no longer act with token impunity in another place.  In the run-up to this meeting I was looking at the social media presence of some global and Irish companies and the lovely fluffy glassy brochures they put out there.  What they do not mention, and what they are very slow to acknowledge, is the impunity with which they operate in some lower income countries or developing countries.  We need to take Ireland's reputation as a protector of human rights and overseas development aid into another area whereby we see the same regard for demanding a higher level and holding corporations to it than how they operate in some countries at present.  This comes back to corporate accountability legislation.</p> <p>  The national action plan on business and human rights was published in 2017.  The Government received a recently conducted review of this.  Have the witnesses had engagement with Departments on this?  With regard to the proposed treaty, what is the most resistance the witnesses meet to it as a concept?</p> <p>  I do not mean to be facetious when I ask my next question.  What are the immediate steps the witnesses believe need to be taken with regard to how indigenous women are being failed?</p><p>I am going to call it out for what it is, because their needs and their rights are almost being sacrificed and are definitely secondary to corporate profits.  Again, what does the coalition see as the immediate steps that need to be taken now?  What would the long and medium-term benefits be of those steps being taken?</p></speech>

Before giving Ms Tunney the floor, in the context of my own support for a more robust framework, allegations were made earlier with particular reference to named companies.  One of those was the ESB, as Deputy Brady pointed out.  This committee has correspondence from the ESB.  My understanding, by way of follow up, is that the ESB no longer buys coal from any mine in Cerrej&oacute;n.  That might be acknowledged, if it is the case.  If not, we have something of a conflict, because we have correspondence, having raised this issue ourselves as a committee with the ESB earlier in the year.  We have correspondence to the effect that the ESB no longer engages in such a practice.</p> <p>  Second, I follow up with reference again to Deputy Stanton and others on the matter of the legislation.  It seems to me that the lead Department would be the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am wondering if Ms Tunney&rsquo;s coalition has had any contact with the relevant committee.  Has the coalition made a presentation to that committee or has it sought to make a presentation?  We would certainly be happy to write to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar.  On the legislation and the responsibility for moving matters on here, if we take a legislative route which has been mentioned, I do not think it would be the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It seems to me to be the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That committee would then have the consequent responsibility for pre-legislative scrutiny hearings.  Ms Tunney might have a view on that.  If the coalition has not engaged directly with the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I would suggest that it does so.  We could be helpful in that matter by informing both that committee and the Department by way of letter to the T&aacute;naiste of our engagement with the coalition, not only this afternoon but also of previous engagements that the coalition has had with this committee.  It is my hope that Ms Tunney would regard that as being helpful.</p></speech>

Then I will I try to collate all the other questions.  We are aware that the Department with responsibility is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We are planning to write to it to engage in a similar manner as this committee.  This week we launched a report.  We are having our initial meetings.  We have met with the Department as a coalition following writing to the T&aacute;naiste.  We are therefore engaging with the Department, but we also wish to engage with the committee.  I thank the Chair for his offer and, if possible, we would be delighted if he were to follow up on that.  Forgive me if I have missed a few questions.  I will try as best as possible to group them.  I will call first on Mr. O&rsquo;Neill from Christian Aid Ireland.  He will try to deal with Deputy Brady&rsquo;s questions around the UN treaty, the ESB and Colombia.  He will talk through where it is at now.  Maybe we could bring in Ms Mateus Parra on this as well.  Mr. O&rsquo;Neill has a good idea of the questions he wanted to cover so I will let him take over here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#F00400"><p>I wanted to thank the Deputies again for their strong attendance.  It is heartening, especially given the environmental difficulties of being here.  We appreciate it.  I will try to be quick as many good questions have been raised.</p> <p>  First, in reference to what Deputy Brady asked, and also as noted by the Chair, we have engaged with the ESB.  In fairness to it, it has had a constructive engagement with us in Christian Aid and with the coalition.  We ensured that it had a right of reply in the research report that we shared with the committee.  This was important.  We do not feel that the processes the ESB put in place for checks are sufficient.  We do very much accept and recognise, however, its engagement with us.  Ultimately, we think that it is not about engaging with one specific company, but about making sure that the laws change so that all companies operating here have to abide by the same standards.  That is the best way that we can tackle this. </p> <p>  On the issue of importations, the company has not imported in recent years.  Crucially, no firm commitment has been given to end ties with the mine.  It seems to depend on demand and on market factors.  We would like to see, along with a recognition of what has happened, an apology, as well as a permanent end to involvement in the mine on human rights grounds.  Crucially as well, the company has been involved for over two decades, or 20 years.  The environmental scars that are there, of which Ms Mateus Parra spoke, do not go away overnight.</p> <p>  Now we can see energy companies in Ireland and around the EU finally starting to move away from coal and harmful fossil fuels.  That is important.  We need to do this, but we have to make sure that the principle of a just transition applying domestically, of which many of the Deputies here have spoken, applies not just in Ireland but internationally.  This is because the communities affected are now left with the very real prospect that the companies that have mined the coal and that have made enormous profit from it will just wash their hands and will leave the affected communities in La Guajira picking up the pieces.  If Ms Mateus Parra would like to come in on this after it would be appreciated.</p> <p>  A key call is for the progressive closure plan that can fix the damage done, that supports local communities with compensation and with environmental restoration.  That can all take time.  Importantly, the ESB needs to set out a firm, detailed human rights policy.  We need to set out a mandatory law for it and for other companies to make sure that this does not happen again.  For example, if in Moneypoint we see a move from burning coal to wind energy, that is fantastic and important.  However, where are the materials to produce the wind turbines coming from?  How are they being sourced?  What is happening at the far end of the supply chain that we simply do not see?  These are the crucial points we would make.</p> <p>  The question Deputy Brady raised of JCB and the settlements and demolitions in occupied Palestine is an important point.  Our coalition noted it in recent weeks.  It is promising to see the case at the OECD national contact point, NCP, in the UK.  It shows again, as Mr. Walsh said, the growing recognition across Europe for the need to be firmer on these issues.  The NCP process is under the OECD.  There is a contact point in the UK and in other OECD countries, including Ireland.  It is a slow-moving, non-binding mechanism.  We in Christian Aid Ireland, along with Ms Mateus Parra&rsquo;s organisation, CAJAR, other Colombian organisations and the Global Legal Action Network, GLAN, have submitted equivalent complaints through the Irish NCP around what is happening in Cerrej&oacute;n.  We made the first submission in January 2021.  We still do not have even a first initial assessment.  These processes are therefore slow-moving.  They can take years.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  All roads point back to the same place, which is a proper, mandatory legal system of human rights and environmental due diligence, as well as a suite of liability and measures to make sure that companies comply with this.  </p> <p>  The last point is on the national action plan.  It is promising.  Internationally, these principles were worked out between 200 countries, at UN and OECD level.  They were agreed ten years ago.  States then took action, including Ireland to our credit, to put those onto a domestic footing.  The national plan was produced and now we are at the next point in this process, where we have to look back on what has worked and, crucially, what has not worked.  Our clear message as a coalition is that the voluntary system is a step forward, but it is wholly insufficient, and it needs to be made mandatory.  That is the message that we have given to the Department who have consulted with us.  It is the message we give to the committee today.  I want to check if Ms Mateus Parra would like to come in on any of those points related to Colombia and Cerrej&oacute;n.  If not, I will pass back to Ms Tunney.</p></speech>

I come from a country that works hard to silence us in the work we carry out so the opportunity to speak to the committee is important to us.  I shared information with Christian Aid that I hope gets to the committee.  We have provided broader and more detailed information to the committee in the format of short documentaries that I hope members will have time to see.</p> <p>  We are facing huge abuses of power and what I want to speak to and make clear is that there is an asymmetry and imbalance in the way we are able to address this issue.  That continues to be the case, even in settings such as the OECD.  There exist tools and mechanisms that we have tried to make use of but these instruments are not designed to benefit communities and people.  Instead they end up maintaining and upholding this imbalance and asymmetry of power that exists between people and companies themselves.</p> <p>  There was a comment about free trade agreements and my recommendation would be to evaluate in detail the clauses that exist in those agreements on human rights and the protection of the environment.  We cannot allow these companies to continue running roughshod over people and their rights to territory.  It is incredible to the communities that companies exist in their territory that proclaim themselves to be socially responsible, that the companies continue to violate their rights and that people continue to buy from them.</p> <p>  Speaking to the alternatives before us, I would like to call attention to the extreme importance of us listening to the communities that are having dialogues about this issue of a just transition and what it could look like.  We must also examine what it would look like to close down these companies and this mine in particular.  Members could ensure there is effective participation by these communities in such dialogues.  I would like to thank Deputy Clarke for remembering the role of women and for understanding that women suffer differential impacts in human rights violations.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh might be able to give us a practical manifestation of what would happen if, for example, a human rights abuse occurred in the Amazon and the remedy was in a court in Dublin.  How would he see that working out practically, with particular reference to the conduct of the hearing but also, and perhaps more importantly, in the enforcement of a judgment either way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.325" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Garry Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#G00900"><p>I will start on trade agreements and Ms Mateus Parra has addressed Deputy Gannon&rsquo;s comments on that.  She made the important point that we need to be cognisant of the business and human rights impacts of trade agreements but also as new markets are opened for Irish companies this highlights the need for human rights due diligence as these companies enter those markets.  It is frustrating that we cannot all be in the committee room today but the pandemic has also given us the opportunity to be able to use video technology to hear directly from human rights defenders such as Ms Mateus Parra.  That is one positive if unintended outcome of this pandemic, which is excellent.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Brady&rsquo;s question on the UN treaty and why Ireland and the EU are reluctant to support it.  It is a good question.  It should be noted that the countries and areas that are least supportive of the UN treaty are the countries and regions where there are the most transnational corporations.  Maybe that is not a huge surprise and there is a strong corporate lobby.  That being said, the fact that the EU is failing to secure a negotiations mandate on the treaty is inconsistent with the fact that the EU is also progressing legislation around due diligence.  As such, the EU should support a UN binding treaty.</p> <p>  What we have heard from the EU and Ireland is that the latest draft of the treaty is not ready for negotiation.  The latest is the third draft of the treaty and our civil society networks have done a legal analysis on that.  We believe it is imperfect and there are issues with it but it is a stable draft and it is ready for negotiation.  While the EU is not at the table, other states such as China, Russia and the US are actively intervening to undermine the process and this is why we need a strong voice in favour of the treaty and to defend the treaty.</p><p>We would like to see the EU at the table defending the need for a robust binding UN treaty.  That would be the most impactful way to address these issues given the transnational nature of the issue we are speaking about.</p><p> Deputy Stanton asked a question, which was elaborated further on by the Chair, around the examples from other countries, particularly those in the EU.  France, Germany and Norway, although Norway is not in the EU, have introduced legislation in recent years.  We believe these are ground-breaking initiatives because it is first time anywhere in the world that states have legislated for mandatory human rights due diligence across supply chains and moved beyond the voluntary approach.  As such we are seeing the beginnings of a paradigm shift, which is very welcome.</p><p> We think the laws do not go far enough, although it is probably too soon to assess whether they are impactful enough.  In 2017, a duty of vigilance law was introduced in France.  There is a threshold of more than 5,000 employees under the law.  The law only covers 0.03% of French firms, which we believe is inadequate.  If we applied it in Ireland, then one could probably count the number on two hands.  The German law has the smaller threshold of covering companies that have more than 1,000 employees.  That is progress but, again, if we applied that law in the Irish context, we believe that would be inadequate.  Our position is that companies of all sizes and in all sectors have a responsibility, which is outlined in the UN guiding principles.  The most robust law, based on human rights principles, should cover all businesses.  That being said, we believe due diligence requirements should be proportional.  A small company would not have as much requirement as a large company or a company that is not in a high-risk sector.  We believe the law should be practical and workable but cover all businesses.</p><p> The Dutch have outlined that they will introduce legislation and an announcement will be made in the coming days.  We believe the legislation the Dutch are considering is stronger than the French and German examples.  The Dutch are talking about legislation that would cover companies of 250 employees or more and apply a two of three principles.  That means there would be a threshold of employee number but also a certain threshold regarding the balance sheet or turnover, which we think is something that Ireland could look at given that there are companies in Ireland that may have a turnover of billions of euro yet have fewer than ten employees.  As Mr. O'Neill mentioned, there is the Coal Marketing Company, which is registered in Ireland and connected with the serious issues in the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia, but it has only 27 employees and a turnover of $2 billion.</p><p> We need to make a law that is workable and practicable but we also need to make sure it is effective for communities like those of Ms Mateus Parra and prevents human rights violations.  Ireland should take a close look at what the Dutch are doing.  As we begin these discussions, it is excellent that the committee is supportive of playing a role in initiating these discussions where it is within the mandate of the committee.  As I said in my opening statement, writing to the three relevant Departments would be an excellent way to progress this matter.  It would be great to consider the different legislation in different contexts as well as consider the principles we outlined in our report, which we think is the most robust way to introduce such legislation.</p><p> I want to address the Chair's question on how this would work in practice through the Irish courts.  I will give a few hypothetical examples of how the different duties would work for Irish companies.  First and foremost, the legislation that we propose would introduce a legal duty to undertake human rights and environmental due diligence.  That involves considering supply chains and with whom one does business throughout the entire global value chain.  Indeed, one can see that at the very end of the value chain there are the communities where abuse is happening.  Some of the laws do not go through the full chain and we do not think that is effective.  We would like if Irish companies were obliged to continually assess their business relationships, which is subsidiaries and suppliers, to see if there are any human rights issues and if a company did not undertake this process, then it would be liable to pay an administrative fine as is done for not paying a television licence.  If a business did not undertake the process of due diligence, then it would have to pay a fine regardless of whether harms have occurred.</p><p> We would like to see civil liability introduced.  Let us say an Irish company imports 80% of its cocoa from a subsidiary in the Ivory Coast and, therefore, it has leverage or a controlling influence over the subsidiary.  Let us say it does not undertake human rights due diligence, does not assess the conditions in the workplace and, say, force labour or child labour is involved in production and supply.  Let us say the company did not undertake its due diligence and did not address or mitigate this risk.  In that instance, under the proposed law, the affected company could take a case through the Irish courts against that company.</p><p> The third level that we would propose would be the introduction of criminal liability for the most egregious abuses such an oil spill.  Let us say an Irish oil company is involved in a toxic oil spill and there is severe ecological damage.  Let us say there is evidence that its company directors are directly implicated and there was negligence or a failure to prevent this severe abuse from happening.  In that instance, we would propose that there will be a criminal liability and charges could be taken against the State for that individual.  I hope my three examples illustrate how a law might work in practice.</p></speech>

I will also respond to what Deputy Clarke said about indigenous women and gender in terms of mandatory due diligence.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton asked for examples of good practice.  We would probably point to companies like Adidas and Unilever that have taken on mandatory due diligence.  These companies have lead the way.  Our report highlights bad practice because we can see that there is a need for regulation.  I wish to note that we are not talking about all companies.  However, at the same time, many companies have called for mandatory due diligence legislation because many companies are experiencing an uneven playing field now.  One has companies that engage in best practice, engage with human rights defenders, ensure that, along their whole supply chain, that they are not impacting on human rights and then there are those that do not.  The companies that play fair lose out in the long run and there is no level playing field.  Recently, 105 investors called for the introduction of mandatory due diligence globally and there is a very big and growing corporate voice to bring in companies, which is great.  We have seen that because there is no level playing field, we need mandatory due diligence for some corporations to make sure they come in under the same kind of regulation.  I hope that I have answered the question.</p> <p>  On gender and mandatory due diligence, I agree with Ms Mateus Parra that the best thing about the first step is engaging communities and listening to what they have to say, and putting the rights holders in the centre of legislation.  Women are negatively impacted by the absence of such regulation and we can see that when we talk about slave labour and poor working conditions.</p><p>We can see companies actively increasing gender discrimination and gender pay gaps by the practices they allow along their supply chain.  We would like companies, when engaging with any proposed work, to do proper gender analysis and if there is an absence of data to collect data to establish if the work practice they are engaging with will end up making matters worse for the lives of women and workers.  The first step is to listen to and engage with women and with communities if one's business is in that area.  That seems a natural first step to many of us.  Businesses should also examine the way in which the companies with which they engage would impact on women and working conditions, whether it be women working at home and there being no protection of their labour rights.  That is what the new law would provide for.  That is what we would like to see.  The last thing we want to do is to continue to push women back as we move forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#J00300"><p>I will brief to allow for more questions to be raised.  I will briefly respond to some questions raised by the Chairman and Deputy Stanton.<br/><br/>I very much take on board the point on the functional operation of a system like this.  What we have tried to do in our research, working with Dr. Rachel Widdis in Trinity law school who is an expert in this area especially around access to justice, is to examine the way these different systems work in other European jurisdictions and draw a line between them to set out the core principles we believe need to underpin an effective law.  We have tried to be propositional on that but we also very much recognise there will be the unique characteristics of the Irish system.  Much preparatory work needs to happen in Ireland.  Similarly, we know an EU directive will be coming forward.  Our core message in our engagement with different Departments, Ministers and this committee is not to wait for that directive but to act now.  We know there will probably be a lead-in time of a number of years for member states to transpose that directive domestically but I hope there will also be a need to engage with our coalition, with impacted communities and possibly consult business groups such as IBEC, and all of that will take time.  We would like people to work across two or three Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice in terms of access to Irish courts, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to begin a discussion on the way that would work in an Irish context.  That would involve beginning drafting; an assessment of the current gaps in the Irish system and what would need to change across those three Ministries to make an effective system; and the publication of the heads of legislation that could be brought before this committee and others and debated in Parliament to make sure there is democratic engagement.  We have set this out in the report.  There are key questions about how this works in terms of the scope, what businesses are covered, potential liability and reform of access to courts systems to make sure justice is effective.  Those are all issues that need to be thoroughly ventilated in detail in spaces such as this committee.  If we act now, there is no risk of us going too fast.  That work will take time.  We would very much offer the expertise of our membership from trade unions, academics and development organisations to assist in the work but there is a risk in waiting for an EU directive, waiting again to start the  preparatory work at some imagined point in the future and perhaps coming back to this committee before then and members hearing more stories of impacted communities such as those Ms Parra has set out.<b></b><br/><br/>It is difficult to seek justice through other courts  We mentioned the OECD case we have taken with Ms Mateus Parra's organisation, CAJAR, other Colombian partners and the Global Legal Action Network, GLAN.  It has been difficult and slow.  It is a semi-judicial mechanism.  There was a great example of that in the Netherlands in recent years related to Royal Dutch Shell.  It is the biggest European oil company with a market capitalisation of more than US $150 billion.  It was operating in Nigeria.  More than 30 million people were living in the area and since the 1950s an estimated 11 million barrels of oil were spilled leading to widespread pollution, health problems and areas becoming uninhabitable.  Four brave people who were impacted took a court case against Shell in the Dutch courts and, incredibly, they won but it took them 13 years to get a judgment and in those 13 years two of the defendants died before they could see some justice delivered.  There is a principle there.  There are some limited and imperfect examples of how it has worked.  We want countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, France and the other countries that have led on human rights to make those systems more efficient and ensure they work quickly, and to make sure communities do not have to wait for more than a decade for justice when their human rights have been abused.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to hear that 105 investors have called for due diligence, as Ms Tunney said.  I have come across that previously in the areas of diversity and climate change where investors and large corporations have learned that the bottom line can be impacted in a positive way by them doing the right thing.  Diversity, for instance, can often lead to increased innovation, creativity, productivity and a happier workforce.  I note the current debate on slavery and people&rsquo;s awakening to what happened in the past.  Companies such as Adidas, Unilever and others are leading the field.  It is important good practice as well as bad practice would be highlighted.  If companies realise their bottom line will be impacted in a positive way by doing the right thing, then that is the other side of the coin.  I am not saying we should not highlight the negative; of course we should.  I thank the witnesses for being here today.  This is an extremely important issue.  I note what they said to the Chairman and the members with respect to other committees.  I also note Mr. O'Neill's point that this measure will not be rushed, rather it will be a slow-burner but an important one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#J00700"><p>I will come back to Ms Tunney but, first, there was a reference by Mr. O'Neill or Ms Tunney to a community support figure.  A survey showed 81% support from the Irish people towards a more robust framework, which in any circumstances is overwhelming.  If that indicates the support of the Irish people, was a similar survey conducted of Irish business?  Where does the support lie in terms of Irish business, having regard to the fact that Ireland is a small open economy with major emphasis in our economic engagement on export and dealing with overseas concerns?  I might have missed that detail in the presentations but if a figure for such business support was included, the witnesses might remind us of it.  I recall being involved with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in convening a national forum in 2014.  That was seven years ago.  I acknowledge progress since then has been slow.  We had the national action plan on business and human rights in 2017.  Again, that was some years ago.  While I note much of the running in this area has been undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides the secretariat for the implementation of the national plan, it appears, as was said earlier, the line Department or the one with overall responsibility is the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  </p> <p>  We will undertake to write to the T&aacute;naiste, as adverted to by Deputy Brady.  We will help and assist in any way possible but we will not act alone in that regard.  It is a matter of how best we can convene a number of stakeholders.  The Department of Justice was mentioned; obviously, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and the Department of Foreign Affairs seems to have embraced its role and function to some effect.  One of the outcomes of today's engagement is with respect to how best we can progress matters having regard to the fact that I do not hear any dissenting voices among the members of the committee.  I suspect there is none.  We all want a more robust framework.</p><p>I was struck by what Mr. O'Neill said in advising us not to wait for the European Union but to proceed in any event.  I take that point and it is one we will certainly put to the other Departments as well.</p><p> I call Ms Tunney again.  If there are no other comments from members of the committee, I will move to concluding remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sorcha Tunney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021120700002#K00200"><p>To be honest, I do not think there has been a similar poll.  We conducted polling with the Irish public.  Our European partners conducted a similar poll with the European public and had a higher level of support, at 90%, for such legislation.  Recently, there was a lot of engagement with businesses across Europe and 26 leading companies called for the European Union to move mandatory due diligence legislation.  The companies included Unilever, Adidas and Mars Incorporated among others, so there has been work done by companies.  The Chairman's question opens up whether such a consultation with businesses in Ireland and with us is required.  As we move forward towards potentially heads of Bill or whatever in the future and in such a consultation with business and how it views this, I would be surprised if there was a negative response but one would probably get some ideas regarding how businesses might fear it and how we can engage with them and bring them along.</p> <p>  I wish to thank the committee on behalf of the coalition for having us at the meeting today.  It has been an honour to present to the committee and to share Ms Mateus Parra's testimony and the work they do.  We appreciate being asked to attend the meeting.</p></speech>

We were critical of the national plan which has now expired in that it did not promote or advance binding legislation on human rights due diligence.  If there is to be a revised plan, whether it is put forward by the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we would like to see it emphasise support for a UN treaty and to support the initiation of the legislation on mandatory human rights due diligence we have been speaking about today.  As Mr. O'Neill mentioned, we cannot go too slowly on the process of initiating legislation.  That would be the priority for us.  As I mentioned, Ireland is out of step so we should begin that.  Indeed, beginning it before the EU directive could influence the EU to have a higher standard.  The Dutch foreign minister has announced that the Netherlands will not be waiting around for the EU directive but will introduce a stronger and more robust proposal, which could have an impact in raising the standard for the more harmonised approach.  We believe there is a very good argument for Ireland to follow suit.  If Ireland was to introduce national legislation along the lines of the proposals we have set out, that could have a far-reaching impact in terms of setting the agenda and raising the bar at EU level.</p> <p>  I wished to mention that but also to say that we appreciate that there have been no dissenting voices and that this committee has been largely supportive of the proposals and recommendations we have made.  We are very encouraged that the committee will write to the T&aacute;naiste on this matter.</p></speech>

It is a very important principle for our coalition that everything we do is directly influenced by what is happening in communities and the partners with whom we work.  We are very appreciative of that.</p> <p>  We also recognise the constructive criticism or the more challenging questions.  We will make ourselves available to the committee members to follow up after the meeting with more material on those.  We have a wealth of research that we can share.  The coalition has recognised that Ireland, rightly, has been seen as a leader in human rights in many different areas and the impacted communities in the different countries we work in around the world look to Ireland for leadership on human rights issues.  The corporate impact is one of the areas where we have made less progress.  When we look around the European Union and see countries such as France and the Netherlands taking those steps now, doing the research and getting the processes in place, that is what is helping the EU directive emerge.  That is what will push the ambition of the EU directive higher.  The offer of this committee to write to the relevant Departments and to work with sister committees under different Departments to try to ensure Ireland is in that pack of leaders is very well received and I thank the committee for that.</p></speech>

To bring matters to a conclusion, this was a very interesting engagement and I thank our guests for their expertise and for sharing with us the experience of their work over a number of years.  In particular, I thank Ms Mateus Parra for joining us from Colombia and for sharing with us the first-hand experience there.  I also again thank Ms Tunney, Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Walsh.  This is important information for the committee in terms of our engagement.  As regards next steps, we will start by writing, as Deputy Brady suggested earlier, to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment informing him of our engagement with you and of the importance of having a more robust framework.  We will inform him that the committee has formed and agreed a strong view that a more robust legislative framework is appropriate and necessary and that perhaps we should not wait for the European Union to give leadership here but embark on a process ourselves.  We will write to him in the first instance and then act on whatever response we receive.  We will also contact our colleagues in the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and inform them of our engagement with the coalition and suggest that they may wish to take up matters, as we have done.  As Mr. Walsh suggested, we will write to the Minister for Justice and to the Department of Foreign Affairs, with which we have regular engagement in any event.</p> <p>  I will be happy to share the responses we receive with Ms Tunney and perhaps in the course of spring in the new year we might be in a position to chart a more direct course or avenue towards how best we might address matters further.  In the meantime, if there are reports or further information Ms Tunney believes would be helpful to the committee in terms of our engagement, we would be happy to hear from her in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for being with us.  My apologies again for not having an in-person meeting, but notwithstanding that I believe we had a fine engagement.  I thank our technical people for the manner in which they managed to facilitate this important meeting, which proceeded without a technological hitch.  Most importantly, our guests' presentation has been very well received by the committee and I know from the contributions of members that the committee will be keen to advance matters in accordance with the information provided to us.</p></speech>

Apologies have also been received from Senator Martin Conway.  We are joined by Deputy David Stanton.</p> <p> I will deal with one item of committee housekeeping.  Can I take it the draft minutes of our private meeting of 24 November 2021 and public meeting of 1 December 2021 are agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  Before I introduce the witnesses, apologies have been received from the HSE advising that many of its senior people who are due to address us this morning are involved in the response to the storm that is hitting the country at the moment.</p> <p>  Some members expressed concern prior to the commencement of public session of the meeting that the time limit of an hour or an hour and a half for the meeting is not sufficient.  Deputy Hourigan has a proposal in that regard and Senator Black will second it.  Does Deputy Hourigan wish to speak on it?</p></speech>

It will be very difficult to reschedule a meeting when we have already had a partial meeting.  I have real concerns about the level of information we have already received.  I am also awaiting replies to a number of outstanding parliamentary questions from the Department of Health and the HSE.  We should reschedule the meeting on an agreed date.  I suspect Senator Black has a comment to make on possible date for a rescheduled meeting.  As Chairperson of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, she might have a comment to add.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is accompanied by a number of officials who will assist the committee as necessary with any of their questions.</p> <p>  Before we proceed, I must read note a privilege.  Members are reminded of the constitutional requirements that they should be physically present within the confines of the place in which the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For members attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meetings.  This means they will have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person does who is physically present.  </p> <p>  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue your remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  </p> <p>  I welcome Minister of State to the meeting.  We have had a number of meetings in the past on issues relating to his remit around biodiversity and heritage and we had the Heritage Council in last week.  We are delighted to welcome him here today.  I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#E00300"><p>I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to provide an update of the work across the heritage and electoral reform divisions of our Department.  As members can see, I am joined today by colleagues from across the heritage and electoral reform divisions.  It has been an extremely busy 18 months since I took office.  Much has been achieved to date and, notwithstanding my presentation today, there is much more to do.</p> <p>  The immense and urgent challenge of addressing biodiversity loss is now being felt across all levels of society and the need to conserve and restore our historic built heritage and national monuments has never been more prominent.  Similarly, we are seeing unprecedented and timely attention on the issue of electoral reform as we seek to build resilience in our democratic systems to meet the unique challenges of the 21st century.  </p> <p>  I would like to start by acknowledging the great work that this committee has been doing to support the work across this Department, ably chaired by my party colleague, Deputy Matthews.  I expect to see much more of members over the coming year as we progress our legislative and policy agenda, including the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill, the Electoral Reform Bill 2020, Heritage Ireland 2030 and the fourth national biodiversity action plan.  </p> <p>  My work in this role and that of my colleagues across the Department is to protect, conserve, restore and manage Ireland&rsquo;s heritage.  This includes its biodiversity, such as habitats, species, and natural heritage, its built heritage, historic buildings and structures, and the precious national monuments and archaeological features.  This is for the benefit of present and future generations and, particularly with regard to nature, for its own sake, independent of the value people place upon it. </p> <p>  Under this programme, the 2022 allocation of a very significant &euro;133.5 million will allow my Department to progress an expanded programme of biodiversity investment and the restoration and conservation of protected peatlands, including raised bog compensation schemes in line with national biodiversity and climate action objectives.  It will continue to support the protection of our archaeological and built heritage.  It will allow us to invest in and support Ireland's national parks and reserves.  We will be able to continue to monitor habitats and species as required under the birds and habitats directives and to advance with the delivery of conservation projects under the EU's programme for environment and climate action, LIFE, and other funding instruments, including the conservation and restoration of protected natural heritage areas, NHAs, and an expanded farm plan programme.  It will allow us to accelerate the conservation measures programme to enhance protections and supports for nature at more than 600 Natura 2000 sites across Ireland.  In addition, we will maintain and invest in waterways for 15,000 registered boat users through Waterways Ireland and support the investment in cross-Border initiatives under the Shared Ireland, Shared island initiative and New Decade, New Approach, NDNA, agreement, such as the Ulster Canal and the Narrow Water Bridge. </p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, there is a commitment to review the remit, status and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to ensure that it plays an effective role in delivering its overall mandate of enforcement role and protection of wildlife.  The primary determinant of an effective response to that commitment is resourcing.  I secured additional monies in the 2020 July stimulus, significantly increased NPWS funding by almost 50% in budget 2021.  This week, I announced that NPWS funding will increase yet again, to more than &euro;47 million in 2022, a total increase of 64% since I became Minister of State, bringing it back to a level not seen since before the financial crisis. </p> <p>  The NPWS review is under way and consists of a comprehensive three-phase process: Review, Reflect, Renew: A Strategic Action Plan for the Future of the NPWS.  It has been designed to define exactly what is needed as well as developing an action plan to renew the NPWS and ensure it is equipped to respond to Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity emergency now and in the decades to come.  The orientation, or review, part of this process commenced in February 2021 under the direction of Professor Jane Stout from Trinity College Dublin as chair and Dr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, deputy chair, formerly of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The independent reviewers heard from more than 3,000 people and groups providing an external perspective on some specific aspects of the NPWS in conducting an analysis of comparable organisations across Europe to inform a suite of recommendations.  </p> <p>  The next phase, reflect, is taking account of outcomes of the outcomes of the Stout-&Oacute; Cinneide work and then synthesise the resourcing gains of the past 18 months with a detailed expert analysis of governance, organisational structures, communications, data systems and future resourcing, and outline the NPWS's specific requirements across these areas.  The final phase, renew, will detail the objectives and prioritise actions that will equip the NPWS to deliver on the ambitious goals, objectives and targets emerging from our programme for Government, the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the EU biodiversity strategy towards 2030, Heritage Ireland 2030 and the new national biodiversity action plan and to be the respected voice for nature that so many have called for.  </p> <p>  Our national parks and nature reserves have never been busier, nor have they been such a refuge as in the challenging days of the pandemic.  I commend all of our heritage staff, who were deemed essential workers from the outset, and who played a cathartic role in providing those beacons of tranquillity, beauty, safety and amenity, never missing a day for the past two years.  I also want to acknowledge that while we are all safe inside today, many NPWS and National Monument Service colleagues are out in the elements of Storm Barra, providing vital health and safety cover at our heritage sites throughout the country. </p> <p>  Some &euro;6.5 million in capital funding was provided in 2021 for the maintenance, development, management and operations of our 87,000 ha network of national parks, nature reserves and other conservational and recreational nature heritage sites.  During 2021, this funding has facilitated more than 300 individual projects, ranging from infrastructural repairs, improvements to extending visitor facilities and the upgrading of trails, to habitat restoration and invasive species removal.  </p> <p>  A particular highlight for me this year was the continuation of the white-tailed eagle reintroduction programme.  During the summer, 21 Norwegian-born eagle chicks were imported into Ireland from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research and subsequently released into the wild.  Returning this lost keystone species to Irish skies will be a huge step in improving Irish conservation efforts by restoring a top predator to the ecosystem and will benefit Irish biodiversity more broadly.  The success of this programme is thanks to the ongoing co-operation of many stakeholders who are working together to restore a lost element of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage.  My family and I had the privilege of attending the release of the white-tailed eagles at Lough Derg a number of months ago and it was a very special occasion.  Again, I pay tribute to our own NPWS staff who manage and oversee the project and also the assistance of other interested parties, such as the Irish Farmers' Association, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research and, in particular, local landowners and farmers, without whose enthusiastic support in monitoring nest sites and care of birds, the project could not succeed. </p> <p>  Biodiversity underpins all life on earth.  Yesterday, I was delighted to announce &euro;2.1 million in funding for biodiversity initiatives by local authorities, including &euro;1.5 million for the local biodiversity action fund and &euro;600,000 for the next phase of the biodiversity officers programme for local authorities.</p><p>This represents a 300% increase in the fund since 2019 and recognises that local authorities are vital in addressing our biodiversity loss and protecting, enhancing and restoring habitats and species through the implementation of the national biodiversity action plan.  I want to ensure biodiversity officers are in a position to lead on the delivery of strategic actions for biodiversity at the local level, supported by strong connections with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and the necessary networks and resources to enable them to do such great work.</p><p> I am happy to say that, on 4 November, I received Government approval for the establishment of a new national biodiversity data centre as a company limited by guarantee, subject to oversight by the Heritage Council, with a purpose to collect, record and maintain data on Ireland's biodiversity and make them available to the public.  The creation of this new company will support the consolidation of relationships across government and provide sufficient flexibility to develop new programmes responding to the unique challenges climate change poses for agriculture and other sectors.</p><p> On the subject of our built heritage and as most of the committee knows, my Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings, historic structures and archaeological monuments through three capital grant schemes that are, in the main, administered by local authorities.  These are the built heritage investment scheme, BHIS, the historic structures fund, HSF, and the community monuments fund, CMF, which was recently announced.  This year, total funding of &euro;6 million was awarded to 562 projects under the BHIS and HSF.  In addition, the CMF awarded &euro;4.2 million to 139 projects carried out over the course of the year.  These schemes touch every county in the country, providing local employment and much-needed economic stimulus.  The 2022 schemes were launched this month and are now open to applications, with a combined funding pot of &euro;13 million, which is an increase on last year's.</p><p> In conjunction with the Heritage Council, my Department delivers the historic towns initiative, which is providing &euro;1.5 million to a number of towns in 2021, including Ballyshannon in Donegal, Listowel in Kerry, Sligo town, Roscommon town, Ballina in Mayo, Birr in Offaly, Tramore in Waterford and Callan in my own county of Kilkenny.  I am delighted to say this successful initiative will run again in 2022 and will be open to applications in the coming weeks.  This year, it will also seek to address the issue of vacancy and residential reuse of heritage properties in line with the Government's commitments under Housing for All.</p><p> We continue to make strides in new legislation and policy.  As members may be aware, the Cabinet just last week approved the referral of the new draft monuments Bill to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I look forward to working with members on that over the coming months.</p><p> Later this week, I will launch our new vernacular architectural strategy, A Living Tradition.  This contains clear, well-considered and fully deliverable actions as well as engaging and informative background information on Ireland's vernacular built heritage.  I will be more than happy to provide copies to members of the committee early next week.  We would all agree it makes sense to rehabilitate buildings that are actually standing and bring disused ones back into use where this can be done in a way that respects the buildings and the communities that created them.</p><p> The purpose of our new national policy on architecture is to support and promote architectural quality and sustainability.  It will contain policy actions to encourage best quality in researching, understanding, designing, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environment assets as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces.  A draft policy has been prepared and is now going to copy editor for further refinement ahead of publication.</p></speech>

I note the amount of travel the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have been doing in visiting the various parks and heritage and cultural sites.  That is much appreciated by everyone who is involved or has an interest in these matters.</p> <p>  I will move on to members and follow the usual meeting order by first calling on Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, both of us must leave the meeting but we hope to rejoin it.  The Minister of State has our apologies.  It is not a reflection of our interest in his work and that of his Department, which is highly commendable.  We congratulate him and everyone in the Department.</p> <p>  I will focus on a small but important issue, that of the national monument on Moore Street.  It was a great honour to serve on the Minister of State's advisory committee, which reported in May.  Thankfully, the Government included the matter in the granting of &euro;120 million in urban regeneration for the north inner city, but there is considerable disappointment and frustration on Moore Street and elsewhere in the north inner city at the lack of progress.  The advisory group endorsed the concept proposal from the Irish Heritage Trust.  When will we see work commencing on the national monument on Moore Street?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for the commitment he has shown to community historical projects.  We have seen the benefit of that in my constituency through the funding he awarded to St. Canice's monastery and graveyard.  That nearly &euro;30,000 has already been put to good use by Dublin City Council.  We will see the benefit of that investment in the years to come.  As a result of that work, though, we have discovered the vast extent of what needs to be done on the site.  Will the Minister of State be making similar rounds of funding available so that we can build on the investment he has already made and go much further in restoring the abbey site?  It is an important local historical site.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#F00700"><p>To address Senator Fitzpatrick's question, we have made considerable progress in respect of Moore Street.  As she knows, the advisory group, which was chaired by Dr. Tom Collins, whom I thank for his fantastic work, commenced in 2017.  Its final report was submitted to the Minister and me on 5 May of this year.  We are making significant progress.  Our officials have been liaising with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on progressing the next element of the works on the national monument and the creation of a new visitor centre.  We want to expedite this work as much as practicable, notwithstanding other complexities with the site.  The national monument is our number one priority.  I will be working with the Minister on trying to advance the work in 2022.  I hope this has answered the Senator's question.  I can ask Mr. Michael MacDonagh from the national monuments service to appear before the committee if required.  I will give a commitment, though.  The Minister and I have discussed this matter in recent weeks.  We want to try to make significant progress in early 2022.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy McAuliffe's question on St. Canice's monastery, we were delighted to be able to support that project.  I urge the area's community to continue looking at our funding streams, in particular the CMF, in 2022.  There is a significant capital programme in stream 1 that I urge the community to consider.  We will work with the community.  The monastery project is important and we would be delighted to try to help the work in any way we can.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I appreciate his assurances and accept his commitment and that of the Minister, but I must reiterate the considerable disappointment and frustration at the lack of any visible progress or action on the national monument.  A hundred years had passed by 2016 and we are now going into 2022.  I urge the Minister of State to visit the site again &ndash; he has been there previously &ndash; as soon as possible.  We need to see some action on the national monument.  The Irish Heritage Trust's concept is excellent, everyone is behind it and the funding has been provided, but there is bewilderment at the lack of activity on the site.</p></speech>

The Senator is aware of the progress that has been made to date and the funding that was allocated this year.</p><p>We want to progress that.

I thank the Minister of State for the updates he has provided.  There are three areas on which I would like more information.  It is very welcome the State architectural policy will now be published.  As the Minister of State and I know, it has been long delayed.  When we met last year and spoke about this, there was an indication there would be further rounds of engagement with interested parties prior to publication.  Has that happened?  More important, what is the hope in terms of ensuring, particularly in the context of public investment, that State agencies and Departments will be made leaders in ensuring full adherence to this policy?  We all wish to see the principles of sustainability and high quality architectural practice, especially when this is at taxpayers' expense.</p> <p>  It is great that the general scheme of the monuments Bill was published last week.  When is it hoped to bring it to committee?  When is it hoped to move to the full drafting of the Bill?  This is very overdue legislation.  It is several decades since we have had similar legislation.  I have not yet had time to read the general scheme of the Bill but the Minister of State is aware I have a keen interest in 20th century architecture.  Will the Bill cover not just what people generally consider to be architectural monuments, that is, those from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but also the growing number of at-risk mid-century modernist buildings we need to ensure are protected?</p> <p>  As regards the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Minister of State did not provide a timeline in his update.  He will have significant support from members of this committee in terms of where it is to be hoped he will take this, particularly from those of us who are advocating for a strong, independent and stand-alone National Parks and Wildlife Service not unlike the Environmental Protection Agency and certain other bodies.  Is there a sense of when the renewal phase and those other nice reworded phrases might be timelined?  We are all keen to see that progress.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State, in responding to the question on the monuments Bill,  to outline what is contained in the Bill.  I have not read the general scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#G00400"><p>I will, of course.  I thank the Chairman and the Deputy.  I am keenly aware of the significant interest of Deputy &Oacute; Broin in this area, especially in modern architecture.   I thank him for his questions.  As regards the national policy on architecture, he is aware the policy is to support and promote architectural quality and sustainability and it will contain policy actions to encourage best quality in researching, understanding, designing, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environmental assets, as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces.  The draft policy has been prepared and is now going to a copy editor, as I said in my opening statement, for further refinement ahead of publication in January.  Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ryan of the built heritage unit of the Department is present and I will ask her to contribute when I finish addressing the Deputy's three questions.</p> <p>  As was stated, the process for the national monuments legislation started in 2009.  This is a consolidation of well over 100 years of national monuments legislation, so it is very much welcome.  It was approved by Cabinet, having been brought to it by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, approximately two weeks ago.  We hope to get the Bill before the committee as soon as possible in the new year.  I have spoken to the Chairman in that regard.  Mr. Michael MacDonagh of the national monuments service, who is present, might give a more in-depth outline in terms of the Deputy's question on protection of modern architectural heritage.</p> <p>  As regards the National Parks and Wildlife Service review, the piece prepared by Professor Jane Stout and Dr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide was completed several weeks ago.  That first review phase is still in draft and being completed.  We hope the next phase will be completed by the end of January, at which point we will be able to bring an update to Cabinet and then move to the final phase.  All going well and notwithstanding the significant challenges, I hope we will soon be ready to do so.  We decided to expand this out to consider the resources that have come in since the Government was formed in 2020 and to use that to work with the Stout-&Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide report in terms of the really expansive work that was done across all stakeholders to try to get to a point where we had a very consolidated and strong plan for a future vision for the NPWS.  As the Deputy is aware, it is critically important to deliver on nature and biodiversity for the next decade.  All going well, that work should be completed by mid-2022.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Ryan to come in specifically on the architectural policy and Mr. MacDonagh to come in with a more detailed response on the national monuments legislation.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his question on the policy on architecture.  I am conscious we intended to publish this policy a little bit earlier.  We got caught in the space of the last 10% taking almost 90% of the time.  We got caught in an endless circle of consultation, especially because there were so many other policies coming out at the same time and we want to tie in with Housing for All and the town centre first initiative.  We now have a draft ready.  The Deputy asked about the final consultation.  For the final consultation, we consulted finally with all Departments.  We did not do a broad consultation because we felt we might never get it over the line.  I am glad to say we do have a policy now ready to go the copy editor.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned implementation of the policy.  That is a very good point.  We need a strong delivery board to make sure this policy is implemented.  We will have a delivery board, probably to be chaired jointly by senior officials in our Department and the principal architect or State architect in the Office of Public Works, so that it will be implemented at a very high level to ensure the actions are implemented early in the new year once the policy is published.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for other members of the committee, but the Minister of State will certainly have willing support from my party in amplifying that to the best of its ability.</p> <p>  As regards the monuments policy, we need to get the detail of the legislation right, but we also need to get the Bill through in as timely a manner as possible.  I reassure our guests that the Bill is likely to enjoy a strong level of cross-party support.  We need it.  What we saw with the O'Rahilly house, for example, or some of the earlier iterations and legal challenges relating to Moore Street show the need for the most up-to-date set of legal protections for historic monuments and archaeological heritage.  I reassure our guests that my party will be a supportive voice at this committee on both of those pieces of policy and legislation.</p></speech>

One of the especially interesting things the Minister of State mentioned was how well used our parks, forests and public spaces have been over these past 20 months.  Parks and forests offered sanctuary and in many cases, sanity, during lockdowns.  I acknowledge all the workers who kept them open and pristine for all to enjoy.  My local parks, Griffeen Valley and Lucan Demesne, were a hive of activity these past 20 months.  Woods such as Slade Valley and Slievethoul had footfall like they have never seen before.</p> <p>  Covid gave many people a new appreciation of nature and natural amenities on their doorstep.  That gives us a unique opportunity to harness that appreciation into support for the action on climate change agenda.  I know all of us here agree on that and the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Green Party and colleagues of mine, such as Deputies Bruton and Farrell and Senators Currie and McGahon, have done tremendous work on it.</p> <p>  As a result of pandemic-related restrictions, several zoos, including Dublin Zoo, have reported they now may face closure due to lost income and ongoing expenses in maintaining their animals.  I heard the director of Dublin Zoo on "The Ray D'Arcy Show" last week saying they have literally been kept above water by the generosity of the public who came out in their droves last year to donate to Dublin Zoo to support it to stay open and continue doing the essential conservation work it does.  In fact, it is Dublin Zoo's ambition to move from being a zoo that does some conservation work to being a primary conservation centre that also happens to be a zoo.</p> <p>  That work is very important and we know great zoos such as Dublin Zoo have massive support and affection from the general public but, unfortunately, public generosity can only get them so far.  They need Government support at this difficult time.  I acknowledge all the advocacy for Dublin Zoo by my colleague, Senator Currie, who recently arranged for An T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, to visit the zoo and meet with staff and management to understand the challenges.  Will the Minister of State share with us what his Department can do to support Dublin Zoo and ensure this great facility and amenity remains open?</p> <p>  My second question is on behalf of farmers and relates to the EU diversity strategy, which proposes an increase in the percentage of protected areas throughout the EU.  Does the Minister of State's Department intend to compensate farmers and landowners for these additional designations?</p> <p>  The Minister of State got cut off before we had the chance to discuss electoral reform in detail.  He has done amazing work when it comes to modernising the electoral register and the register to vote process and, of course, the moves towards the establishment of the electoral commission.  However, one omission from that legislation, about which we talked to death at this committee, was the fact the online political advertisements will only be regulated during the electoral period, which may only be a couple of weeks.  Will the Minister of State give us an update as to whether he fed our feedback back to his Government or colleagues?  Can he fight to have this included in the online social media regulation Bill?  Is it something on which he can work with other Ministers to try to rectify?</p></speech>

We have a significant role to play in Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park.  Our National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, for starters, has responsibility for the implementation of the regulations arising out of the zoo directive and licenses these establishments, including aquaria.  When Covid hit last year, we reached out directly to zoos and aquaria throughout the country, not just Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park.  We were the first to put in a fund of &euro;1.6 million to Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park and a further additional funding of &euro;300,000 to our smaller zoos and aquaria throughout the country which, along with the public appeal from Dublin Zoo, has helped to stabilise the situation from the huge losses they incurred during the lockdown in 2020.</p> <p>  Like the T&aacute;naiste, I have visited Dublin Zoo and I commend Christoph Schwitzer and his team for the amazing work they have done throughout the pandemic and Sean McKeown and the team down in Fota Wildlife Park.  In terms of the conservation value they have, Fota Wildlife Park is a key player and partner with the NPWS in our corncrake conservation programme and in the conservation of the natterjack toad.  We have taken natterjack toads that were bred in Fota Wildlife Park and released them in the Maharees on the Ring of Kerry with communities and schoolchildren down there, which was a fantastic event.  They play a critical role in conserving internationally endangered species.</p> <p>  We see that value and continue to support both Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park in their conservation efforts and look towards those conversations around the bigger elements we can do to support international conservation efforts.  We have had good conversations with both on that.  With regard to the EU biodiversity strategy, elements around the targets for 30% land, 30% marine and 10% strict protection are still in negotiation, such as the spread and the burden share of those, but we are looking at State and semi-State lands around how we achieve our targets and those conversations are being had at present.</p> <p>  Certainly, many of the programmes we are putting in place around biodiversity in general and farmlands, around life programmes, such as the farm plan scheme which I know some members are interested in, reward farmers for protecting biodiversity on their land.  I hope we will see some very good measures coming from Pillar 2 of the next CAP strategic plan, in particular, in which we have had a hand and that will help and support farmers in their conservation efforts, because we know they want to do the right thing and are critical partners in conservation.</p> <p>  With regard to online political advertising, I cannot say enough to thank the committee for its consideration.  It went way beyond what was expected of it with pre-legislative scrutiny for the electoral reform Bill.  It was fantastic.  Our Department has been working closely with the European Commission over the past 12 months looking at the development around proposals in the electoral reform Bill and having regard to the development of the Commission's own proposal on online political advertising.  We are aware the Commission has recently published its own proposal for regulation on the transparency and targeting of political advertising, which was announced on 25 November last, as part of protecting election integrity and promoting democratic participation.  Our officials are now examining the European Commission's online advertising proposal with a view to ensuring the two policies are closely aligned.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, our proposal on online political advertising during electoral events is unique in its own sense and progressive, but it is specifically for a piece of work around electoral events.  We are giving consideration to the recommendations that came forward from the committee and will be feeding back on that in due course.</p></speech>

Two of my questions relate to the recent discussion we had here in the committee with the Heritage Council, with respect to the national policy on architecture, which the Deputy mentioned already.  The others relate to the Minister of State's announcement yesterday and the NPWS farm plan scheme.  Yesterday, the Minister of State's Department announced an increase in funding to &euro;1.5 million for the local biodiversity action fund for 2022, which I understand is a 300% increase on 2019, which is extremely welcome and will assist local authorities in the implementation and funding for actions in the biodiversity action plan.</p> <p>  However, we know that, ultimately, local authorities need more staff and capacity to be able to execute these projects properly.  While in many local authorities, heritage officers are currently stepping in for biodiversity officers, from my experience of working with heritage officers, they are already working beyond capacity in terms of managing heritage.  This added workload is not sustainable.  Therefore, will the Minister of State give an indication of when all local authorities will be equipped with biodiversity officers, including my local authority of South Dublin County Council, which is still without one?</p><p>How many local authorities have received funding under the local authority biodiversity scheme operated by the NPWS?</p><p> In the context of reducing energy emissions in our built environment, which is a key aim of the national policy on architecture, NPA, when can we expect the NPA to be published?  I know that was talked about earlier but it would be interesting to know if the Department has a deadline for that and I would like to know if that draft is available to us.  Will the final NPA document contain a definitive proposal for a national built environment research body, as stated in the Places for People document, which emerged following a public consultation on the NPA?  If so, has the Department considered what form this is likely to take?  Will the NPWS farm plan scheme be expanded in 2022?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked a question similar to Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s question on the architecture policy that is due to be published shortly.  We can seek to get a draft to members ahead of that publication.</p> <p>  There were a number of other questions on the energy policy and the national architecture policy that I will deal with.  I refer to the national policy on architecture and the Places for People document.  As Ms Ryan said, a delivery board will be established to implement the actions of the policy, including that research element the Deputy is talking about.  While the policy will apply the broad parameters, further work will need to be done to map existing resources, identify gaps and scope out more detailed research requirements regarding this.  We would welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on that and I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Broin&rsquo;s comments on this committee&rsquo;s commitment to supporting this work on our architectural policy, which is critically important.  Far too often we see buildings that are 30 or 40 years old being knocked in Dublin and across the country.  These building are perfectly reusable and have an architectural value in their own right.  It is critically important that this policy informs local authorities about the reuse and repurposing of these buildings and about the embodied energy that is locked into them.  A lot of work has been done on this by the International Council on Monuments and Sites Ireland as well.  We welcome the commitment given by members to support that.</p> <p>  I refer to biodiversity officers in local authorities and yesterday we announced the expanded roll-out of same.  Currently, only five local authorities have biodiversity officers.  I take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point about heritage officers being stretched.  They have asked us for assistant heritage officers and that is something local authorities need to prioritise.  We also need conservation officers, architects, archivists, archaeologists and a full suite of staffing within our heritage division to do this important and necessary interdisciplinary work across all sections of local government.  We announced &euro;600,000 in funding yesterday and we are still in the process of designing that scheme.  We want to make sure it is actionable and that it is tied in with the national biodiversity action plan, the strategic biodiversity action plan therein and the protection of our Natura 2000 networks.  We want that to have a key role for heritage officers, not just a supporting role .  Heritage officers need those additional resources but what we are saying about the biodiversity officers is that we want this to be a good scheme that is supported.</p> <p>  There was a question on the farm plan scheme and it is the case that we will expand it next year.  The scheme operates nationally and targets various habitats and species, working with farmers to go above and beyond their statutory requirements.  We already expanded the scheme in 2020 and by the end of 2021 we should have over 200 plans in place, pending participant approval.  It has been hugely popular, with others currently in design by agri-ecologists contracted to the NPWS.  We hope to bring this to over 250 plans and it is expected that a new call for applications will be made in 2022.  This will support the delivery of our conservation measures nationally and the staffing of the NPWS agri-ecology unit will be increased in 2021 to service the increased demand for farm plan schemes.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  If there is anything I have missed perhaps Ms Ryan or Ms Nally from the NPWS might come back on specific elements of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions that I have missed.</p></speech>

I also want to pay tribute to the Minister of State as he is active and interested in the area he is covering.  The report he provided shows the width and breadth of what he has been doing.</p> <p>  I would like to focus on something I have previously asked the Minister of State about and it concerns a local matter that is also of national interest.  It is specifically about the preservation of built heritage.  I will do that by focusing on the Iveagh Market in Dublin.  It was built in 1902, it is situated on Francis Street in Dublin 8 and it has fallen into severe dereliction.  As the Minister of State may know, there was a deal between a city council and a publican to develop that market after the market closed in the 1990s and since then it has essentially been allowed to fall into dereliction.  Some conservation experts have said that the market is close to collapse.  It is estimated that it will cost up to &euro;23 million just to bring it up to a basic standard, not even to restore it.  I was interested in the report the Minister of State gave on the built heritage investment scheme historic fund and the community monuments fund.  They are funded to the tune of &euro;6 million for 562 projects, and &euro;4.2 million, which is for 139 projects.  That is far away from the amount it will take to bring something like the Iveagh Market back into use and protection.  Are there any plans on behalf of the Government to invest more money in large-scale built heritage projects?  Otherwise they will constantly be allowed to fall out of State hands and developers will run them down so they can build something else on them.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned heritage legislation towards the end of his report.  Are any plans included in that for punitive measures on people who deliberately run historic or protected structures into the ground in order to be able to knock them and develop the site?  That is one of the key issues.  Everybody knows that there is a clause which allows them to get around buildings that are on the record of protected structures or heritage buildings.  If one allows them to fall into dilapidation then one can knock them down and build there.  Are there any plans to include measures to tackle that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#J00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her positive comments, which are most welcome.  The question on the Iveagh Market is timely because last week we reached out to the Iveagh Trust to see how we can progress the matter.  Like the Senator, I share the concerns of the wider community in Dublin and in the locality about the historic Iveagh Market.  It is a beautiful structure with a huge social structure attached to it.  The Senator is aware that it was repossessed by Mr. Edward Guinness last December, following much inaction on its redevelopment.  That matter rests between the Iveagh Trust, Dublin City Council and a third party.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and I are committed to reaching out to the Iveagh Trust to see where we can help.  Our grant programmes are useful in issues like this but they require the establishment of clear lines of ownership, stewardship, etc., and they are not sufficient for a project of this scale, as the Senator has said.  It is a huge project that will take a significant capital investment.</p> <p>  We are seeking to have a conversation with all parties to see how we can move this along with the Iveagh Trust and Dublin City Council.  My role on protected structures is mainly advisory but we want to try to secure this before it deteriorates any further.  We want to pull it back from the brink.</p><p>It would be fantastic to see it restored to its former glory.</p><p> On positive measures, I cannot specifically answer the question in respect of the national monuments legislation.  I am not sure whether Mr. MacDonagh can.  There are already mechanisms on protected structures in development plans.  Members may have seen that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, recently submitted the updated national inventory of architectural heritage data for Dublin city.  There were over 1,400 recommendations for the local authority to consider the protection of structures.  That falls down to the role of the elected members of Dublin City Council.  Therefore, we urge elected members to be proactive and to try to include as many structures as possible in the record of protected structures for the city development plan.  This goes back to the point on having in place conservation officers to work with premises owners to ensure buildings do not fall into disrepair.  The arrangement should not be used as a mechanism to allow buildings to deteriorate to a point where they have to be demolished.  That should not be happening.  I wholeheartedly agree in respect of the question but I cannot give any detail on whether our legislation will deal with the matter.  Strengthening within the development plan should be the primary focus.</p></speech>

Will he be considering the Electoral Act 1992, specifically section 111, which under certain circumstances requires people in the polling station to take an oath or make an affirmation under a presiding officer.  If they do not want to make a religious oath, they have to declare that it is against their religious beliefs.  In this day and age, it is not fair to require someone going to vote to make such a declaration to a public official.  Their religion should really be their own business and they should not really have to declare it publicly or at a polling station.  Are such matters being considered in respect of electoral reform?</p> <p>  Second, on biodiversity, I do a lot of walking, including hillwalking in national parks.  Over recent years, especially the years of the pandemic, I have noticed that there have been many more people going outdoors to enjoy areas such as national parks.  However, there is a downside in terms of erosion and damage to habitats.  There is a lack of investment in walking infrastructure in Ireland by comparison with other countries and jurisdictions.  That is taking its toll.  When I was on the Howth special area amenity order management committee, I noted that good investment in paths was a really good way of giving walkers what they wanted while, more important, protecting habitats and keeping people on the paths.  I am aware there is &euro;6.5 million in capital funding for national parks and nature reserves.  Has there been an assessment of the damage done in recent years, particularly owing to the increase in the number of walkers?  Is this on the Minister of State's radar?  Could this area be prioritised for additional resources?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#K00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The question on posters is my pet question.  I love it because I successfully ran my 2020 general election campaign without a single poster.  I am of the view that posters should be banned or restricted.  I would love to see candidates and political parties putting their resources into providing good information to the electorate, both online and in print.  It would create a level playing field.  Obviously, it is more challenging for new candidates.  I was 16 years on a council and was well known around Kilkenny and Carlow.  I hope that the commission, once established, will be considering issues such as this.  It is time-sensitive in the sense that the next scheduled electoral event will comprise the 2024 local and European elections.  At that point, perhaps, the commission could issue a set of recommendations to the Oireachtas and local authorities on posters, ideally restricting them to designated sites on the periphery of large towns.  In an era of climate emergency, posters are an unnecessary campaign tool.</p> <p>  Mr. Barry Ryan, from our franchise section, might respond specifically on the second question, on the oath made to presiding officers.</p></speech>

The electoral reform legislation being brought forward and the proposals in it are very specific.  The Minister of State mentioned the establishment of the electoral commission, the modernisation of the electoral registration processes and the regulation of online political advertising.  What the Deputy described is not envisaged.  There are many other issues in electoral law that could be considered.  The elements in the legislation are very specific.  As the Minister of State indicated in his response on posters, one of the key elements concerning the establishment of the commission is that it will have a research and advisory function.  The two issues raised by the Deputy were posters and the oath.  There are many other issues across electoral law.  It is envisaged that the commission will be well placed to make recommendations to the Government on the various issues.</p></speech>

There have been huge challenges.  I will ask Mr. Trevor Donnelly from the NPWS to comment on this.  During the first summer of the Covid pandemic, there was significant damage.  There was certainly an intrusion on wildlife and damage to trails and walkways.  A lot of the money we secured under the July stimulus went towards trying to repair trails and install new ones.  In our peatlands and bogs, designated walking trails provide a fantastic amenity, but they need regular and significant maintenance.  It is critical that we have continued to invest through the capital programme both this year and last year.  That includes having general operative staff on the ground in our national parks and nature reserves to help carry out the work.  I will ask Mr. Donnelly to comment specifically because he has more detail.</p></speech>

This year to date, we have had the guts of 4 million visitors across our network.  This is more or less the same as the number we had in pre-Covid times.  Foreign usage has been replaced with increased domestic usage, which obviously has an impact on sites.  A specific issue for us is not so much the numbers but the fact that the sites are being used at a different time than they were.  We are finding that we are having peak systems during our traditional downtime, when we would do the type of repair work in question.  If a track is used a lot in the winter, it has a greater impact than in the summer months.  As is the case every year, the upgrading of our sites takes place constantly.  Even this year, we upgraded 12 km of surfaces in Coole, and we upgraded a similar amount in Derrycrag and elsewhere.  We have spent the guts of &euro;500,000 upgrading roads and trails in Killarney National Park.  This is something that goes on but, as with everything, any capital budget we have is useful in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#K01000"><p>I thank Mr. Donnelly.  I agree with the Minister of State's view on election posters.  I did not put up many, but you certainly feel at a disadvantage driving around the county seeing thousands of your opponents' posters and only one or two of your own.  I have no doubt that, after the storm on the day of the count in 2020, many posters were left lying around or hidden in bushes, and cable ties were left up on poles.  If we were to restrict the numbers, it would make sense and even the playing field anyway.</p><p>I apologise to the Minister of State and the committee as I was attending another meeting in the House.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the meeting.  I welcome the statement, which I read, about the vernacular architectural strategy.  It is a good one and I look forward to the document being published next week.</p><p> There is a major national debate about rural housing and there are many conflicts in this regard.  The Minister of State is familiar with the Flemish decree, which is a constant subject of Commencement matters in the Seanad.  We are told the Department is looking at this.  Old barns, lodges, cottages or rural farmhouses on sites may be 90% okay, although they may have a damaged roof that caused people to move out, and we need a definite policy encouraging their use.  They are houses of interest, perhaps, although they may not always have historic value.  There is a heritage significance in terms of how they were constructed.  It is another arm of action to be used to enhancing rural communities and also providing homes for people.  It is an important point.</p><p> I really want to focus on the heritage area and I welcome the idea of developing heritage officers.  I also welcome the idea of pursuing every local authority to have a conservation officer.  We need to be clearer about the role of the conservation officer.  In the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, for example, with which I am familiar, the conservation officers are aligned to the architects' department.  In some local authorities, the conservation officer is aligned to a planning department, although I accept that not all local authorities have a separate architect and planning section.  There are certain pressures in any organisation and an agenda for redevelopment and new development.  I am very familiar with planners who have resisted the inclusion of buildings on the record of protected structures and they argue the sites need to be cleared because of pressure.  We must remember that this designation of protected structures is exclusively a reserved function; ultimately members take advice but they make a final decision.  That must always be the way.</p><p> Will the Minister of State comment on the national inventory of architectural heritage, NIAH?  What is happening in Dublin is very positive.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown has been waiting for one for years.  It has a large number of protected structures and it is clearly not a priority for the NIAH.  Will the Minister of State at a subsequent date let us know where we are with all that?</p><p> There is an issue with protected structures in itself and I have had ongoing engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, on this.  Again, there is a view in some local authorities that we can only designate protected structures during a development review process.  There is another view that this can be done through a variation.  There are different examples.  I know Galway County Council has lots of six or ten throughout the span of a development plan.  There are mixed messages.  I have found that planners can be wrong and chief executives of local authorities can spew misinformation.  I have checked this with the Department.  There are three mechanisms or strands in which to designate protected structures.  I ask that an updated circular be sent to elected members.  I know they already engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, a colleague of the Minister of State who is attending the committee today.  He has done much work on this.</p><p> There are two or three other items.  I looked at the programme for Government the other day and under the built heritage section on page 90, there is mention of publishing and implementing a new all-Ireland Government heritage policy.  We had a very positive engagement with the chief executive and chair of the Heritage Council two weeks ago.  It was a really positive experience.  I picked up from the engagement that people are keen to see the national heritage plan, so will the Minister of State speak to us about that?</p><p> On the whole, this is a very positive area.  The Minister of State is very easy to deal with and engage with.  I thank him and his staff for that.  I am glad to see the Minister of State here.  If there is something I would like to see more of in this committee, and I say it in the Minister of State's presence, it is a renewed focus on heritage.  We spend much time on housing, planning and local government.  Perhaps we should spend more time on the end of the tag line, which is heritage.  I am delighted the Minister of State is here nonetheless.</p><p> I have a final point on electoral reform.  I raised this before and I still hold the view that it is not in our interest to have 31 different systems of local authority looking after electoral registers.  We must get with it and modernise the system.  We are a small enough country to have a centralised system, with one local authority managing it on behalf of other local authorities.  Different local authorities can do different things.  Some local authorities do not do door-to-door canvassing to get people on the register and check them.  We have been forced into using technology more in the past 12 months because of Covid-19 but we need a slicker and a much more professional and centralised register.  It can be subbed out but we do not need to duplicate resources and staff around 31 local authorities.  I do not normally subscribe to the idea of taking things away from local authorities but in this case we would benefit from having a slick, professional and consistent approach across the country.</p></speech>

We are really grateful on the heritage side to have this attention and focus on our work.  We know this is an incredibly busy committee that has worked through a huge amount of housing legislation since the Government was formed.  We deeply appreciate the fact that it is affording equal time, energy and effort into heritage.  It is equally important to other aspects and we appreciate that.</p> <p>  I will launch the vernacular architectural strategy this week in my county of Kilkenny.  One of the buildings on the front is in Mooncoin in County Kilkenny and I look forward to launching it.  It is a well-considered policy strategy and I will be happy to distribute a copy to the members of the committee next week along with a National Monuments Service calendar.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about the Flemish decree and rural housing.  I will not get into a full debate on that but there are significant challenges around the country where populations are in decline and perhaps consideration could be given to clustered housing and constructed wetlands in dealing with such approaches.  There is no doubt we should not be demolishing our vernacular heritage.  It can be repurposed and reused for housing and that should be happening.  Ireland has beautiful farmhouses and cottages that might be reused for modern living and that should be given absolute consideration.  Our traditional barns and outbuildings also provide fantastic refuges for bats and barn owls and we want to see this recognised as well.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned that conservation officers are sometimes aligned to planning departments.  He also mentioned the reserved function of elected members for the record of protected structures.  We take on board the Senator's point on how local authorities update their record.  In my time on a local authority, it was intermittent and may have happened once or twice per year and during a development plan cycle.  There probably should be consistency in considering how local authorities update their record of protected structures.  As I said, NIAH has submitted the records for Dublin city and there are over 1,400 there for consideration.  It is a major job for elected members.  Perhaps Ms Ryan might comment further on that.  We have given additional resources to the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage to continue that work and expand it around updating the inventory.  It is very important work.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to Heritage Ireland 2030, a copy of which I have here.  There is still some work to be done on it but I hope we will be in a position to launch it early in the new year after it has gone to Cabinet.  It is a much-anticipated launch.  I welcome the fantastic session that the committee had with both the chair and chief executive of the Heritage Council.  I spoke with them afterwards and it was very valuable to them as well.  We recognise and thank the committee for the session.</p> <p>  Mr. Ryan will speak to the electoral reform piece.  Our intention through the electoral reform Bill is to streamline the register.  That will require a specific role for local authorities.</p></speech>

There are a number of elements to this, of which I will mention three important ones.  The first is the move towards continuous registration and away from that annualised process.  This will involve implementing a sort of rolling register.  The second is the provision of an online registration system, giving people the option to register online.  That is important.  The third element I will mention is the move to individual registration as opposed to the existing household registration system.</p> <p>  The electoral commission will have an important oversight role with regard to the register.  While local authorities will still be responsible for preparing their own registers, they will have to report on their operations annually.  The electoral commission will have an oversight role in that regard.  As part of its research and oversight role, the commission can issue guidelines and make recommendations to local authorities.  That should assist in standardising processes.</p></speech>

As I understand it, that survey is under way.  It is due to be completed and its recommendations finalised in 2022.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#M00500"><p>Yes.  I will return to the issue of Moore Street.  It is my understanding that there are three planning applications and that requests for further information are pending.  The deadline for the latter is next week.  There is a view among many people who are more involved in this project than I am that much of the success or failure of what is currently on the table will depend on what happens with Hammerson, that is, whether it will continue to have the ability to invest financially or whether it flips the site at some point in the future.  It will also depend on what happens with metro north.  I know that the Minister of State will not be in a position to comment on either of those matters but I would be interested to know whether the heritage section of his Department made any formal submissions to the planning authority in the most recent round of the planning process.  If it did, will the Minister of State give us some information in that regard?</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State give us a timeline as to how he hopes the Electoral Reform Bill 2020 will progress?  I have a small point regarding posters.  I am very strongly in favour of tight regulation of posters in respect of designated sites and also designated materials to assist in meeting the sustainability challenge.  The level of expenditure on posters is extravagant in the extreme.  However, I urge people to always been mindful that, in an era of declining electoral turnout, anything we do that reduces the level of buzz around an election could have unintended consequences.  While I share the Minister of State's intentions, I would not go as far as a full ban until such time as we have some good research from the electoral commission, once it is established, on the potential impact on turnout.  In the expert advice and some of the expert commentary from political scientists, none of whom has any invested interest in posters, concern is expressed regarding a potential negative impact on turnout.  If posters were to be controlled, first-time candidates may be disadvantaged because those of us who get an awful lot of airtime and who are well established have the advantage of incumbency.  Let us make sure our approach is evidence-based.  I believe we can meet the environmental and sustainability objectives the Minister of State has outlined, which I share 100%, but we need to ensure that we do not lose turnout.  I am just sharing that as an opinion rather than as a disagreement.</p> <p>  On the National Parks and Wildlife Service, in the timeline he gave us, the Minister of State took us up to the point at which he hopes to give an update to Cabinet.  He did not indicate when he hoped the Government would have actual recommendations regarding the future structure and form on the other side of that.  Does he hope Cabinet will agree that early in the new year or is there another stage after Cabinet?  It is a little bit like the case of the EPA.  It did not arrive in its current form, it evolved over a period of time.  If Government is able to outline a trajectory with a very clear endpoint at which we will have a service with the strongest possible powers and the greatest level of independence - obviously resources are a matter for budgets - we would all welcome that.</p></speech>

With regard to Moore Street, I reiterate that we are committed to working on the national monument aspect.  Over &euro;12 million was awarded under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.  We want to get working on that early next year.  I will ask Ms Ryan to come in specifically on any comments the Department may have made.  I do not want to speak about live planning applications, as the Deputy will appreciate.</p> <p>  With regard to the Electoral Reform Bill-----</p></speech>

I would not ask the Minister of State to comment on the live planning applications from the point of view of the planning authority but I believe he could comment on whether he or his officials have made a submission as part of the process.  I believe it is reasonable to ask him to update the committee on that, if he can.</p></speech>

We have commented.  I believe there are three applications but I do not think we have commented on all of them.  We have submitted comments regarding our preference for buildings to be reused, where at all possible.  There might have been a small concern regarding areas where buildings could potentially be reused.  I do not have the comments in front of me now.  I am sorry; I am trying to refresh my memory.

We commented on three blocks.  As the Deputy will know, the Hammerson development is divided into various blocks.  We commented on three.  The remaining blocks have yet to come through our development applications unit.  We and the Office of Public Works have also made comments regarding the finishing of the arch in line with recommendations of the Moore Street advisory group.</p></speech>

On the issue of posters, I absolutely take on board Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point.  These are issues I hope the commission will consider in carrying out its research and advisory function.  I agree on the issue of declining electoral turnouts.  Yesterday, the other four Oireachtas Members from Carlow-Kilkenny and I attended a fantastic event in Loreto Secondary School, Kilkenny, on the concept of a new social contract in the wake of Covid-19.  The assembly was full.  It was a really useful debate by the school's politics class.  We are seeing a great level of engagement, particularly at secondary school level.  We now need to ensure that engagement continues throughout civic life.  That includes the participation of minorities in our political processes and widespread and informed debate, discussion, discourse and publicity around the importance of our democratic structures.  That would be a far more effective measure.  Posters are certainly part of the paraphernalia of election campaigns but what we really need is much deeper and more meaningful engagement with the electorate on why it is important to vote and take part in referenda.</p><p>I hope the commission will play a key role informing us how to do that.  I am only expressing a personal view on posters.  I managed to get away without using them.  That is not to say they are not an effective tool for new candidates as part of the effort of trying to get elected.  I take that on board.</p><p> On the recommendations of the NPWS review, it is a matter for Government to consider.  All the way through this process, we want to ensure we engage with our team at the NPWS.  We are in the process of doing that.  On timelines, I would hope it would be early in the new year for the next phase of it.  We hope to be able to present a set of recommendations in report form to Government perhaps mid-year next year.  We will come back to this committee on those recommendations.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State and I apologise that I was not present for all the committee meeting as I had a commitment in the Seanad.  I would like to comment on a couple of areas of the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief.  The built heritage grant schemes that are in place, such as thatching grants schemes, are very valuable.  I do not need to tell the Minister of State that.  We get exceptional value for money in the rolling out of those schemes.  Any additional moneys in that space would be very much welcomed, as would any additional funding for our trails, walking trails in particular.  They have been a significant outlet for many throughout the pandemic as well as for those who use them regularly.</p> <p>  I wonder about the electoral reform Bill.  Does the Minister of State have a date for this?  Maybe he has already answered this.  Is there a date for that legislation?  We have done substantial work as a committee in our pre-legislative scrutiny report on that.  When will that before both Houses?  In that context, my colleague, Deputy Higgins, in her contribution, raised the regulation of political advertising outside of election periods.  I echo her comments.  The Bill, as it currently stands in the general scheme, is quite narrow in just focusing on that.  This is particularly the case for the online space and we need to look beyond that.</p> <p>  I raised a local issue with the Minister of State, on which he has committed to coming back to me, namely, the possibility of roofing of Greyfriars through donations and at no cost to the State.  This is where the Minister of State officially opened the Irish Museum of Time on a beautiful summer&rsquo;s day.  While we did not get rained on that day, it would be fantastic to have a roof on the building to proof it for the future and against all weathers.</p> <p>  Waterford is a substantial coastal county.  There is a growing number of issues with the population of seals on our coastline, which is impacting the livelihood of fishermen.  Does the Minister of State have a plan in place to look at and address that matter?</p></speech>

That would be our ambition; we would love to do that.  They are very popular.  They also provide much local employment.  We have been trying to compile the number of hours in local skills and traditional skills the two built heritage schemes I mentioned and the community monuments fund provide.  We have been trying to get data together on that, as well as on local materials.  It would be very important.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about the trails.  Mr. Donnelly from our National Parks and Wildlife Service has highlighted some of the work we have done to date in our national parks and nature reserves.  There are other sources of funding through local authorities and through rural regeneration and rural development moneys that can be availed of to help with trails that are not under our stewardship.  That is very important.  Greenways are very successful.</p> <p>  On the electoral reform Bill, Mr. Ryan has outlined that we have made significant progress with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The progress on the Bill and on its drafting is going well.  We hope to have that early next year.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We see this as quite innovative in our electoral reform Bill.  Certainly, we will be working with the European Commission around other proposals concerning the online space.  This has come out loud and clear in the pre-legislative scrutiny report this committee has sent to us.  We are giving consideration to it.  Our initiative around online political advertising during electoral events is very progressive.  We are taking into account and trying to distil the recommendations that came forward from the committee on that.</p> <p>  Again, I will not comment specifically on the local issue the Senator brought to me.  Certainly it was a wonderful event in Waterford, launching the Irish Museum of Time.  Great credit is due to Waterford City and County Council, which has done an incredible job on the museum experience across the city and the public realm.  The Irish Museum of Time is another timely, should I say, addition to that set of experiences for visitors.  It have really contributed to the vibrancy of the city centre in Waterford.  We will give consideration to the proposal the Senator brought forward to us.</p> <p>  On the coastline and the population of seals, we have had representations in that regard concerning harbour seals and grey seals.  I might ask Mr. Donnelly from the National Parks and Wildlife Service or Ms Nally to come in on that point.</p></speech>

Both species of seals - harbour or common seal and grey seal - are protected under the EU habitats directive.  Ireland is obliged to maintain their numbers.  We are monitoring their populations and we are reporting to the European Commission on their conservation status.  A monitoring programme is in place.</p> <p>  While seals are protected, the Department can issue licences to cull them.  Affected persons can apply for such licences.  The officials in the NPWS are in discussions with the Marine Institute and Irish universities on approaches to managing seal-fishery interactions, including inshore fishing practices and trends, seal behaviour and numbers, and interactions between seals and fishing gear.  We will continue to investigate these issues and potential solutions in partnership with the fishing industry.</p></speech>

I compliment the Minister of State, his staff and officials on some of the excellent work that has been done over the past 18 months to two years.  It has been hard to keep up with many of the announcements that have made about funding, projects and schemes that are being carried out across the country.  Both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have visited many of these sites and that is very encouraging.</p> <p>  Comments were made earlier about giving time to heritage and this committee fully recognises that the heritage section is a significant part of the Department and an important aspect of our society because our cultural and architectural heritage and our buildings can be damaged quickly and take many years to restore.  That is why we must be pre-emptive and protect that heritage as much as we can.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions about the wildlife crime unit, which has caught the imagination of many people.  While there are laws to protect biodiversity and our natural environments, the establishment of a wildlife crime unit may be significant and can work well to reinforce what is already there.  Will the Minister of State outline for us the wildlife crime unit, its role and how it will work?</p></speech>

There are many national monuments around the country, comprising stones, cairns and old structures.  There does not seem to be a lot of information on those sites.  There is some crossover with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in that regard.  Does the Minister of State see any advances that could be make in that area?  I am not talking about putting up large signage and a big essay but just something to indicate to people what it is they are looking at, what era it is from and perhaps an indication of where they could find out more information about it.  That is important not only with regard to the archaeological monuments out there but also heritage buildings in our town centres.  Kilkenny, the Minister of State's town, is a fine example of some of that because it contains walking trails and routes.  Small bits of information are available to entice people into finding out more about the architectural heritage of an area, the importance of a building and what may have happened in it, who built it or the style of its design.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#O00400"><p>I thank the Chair.  On the wildlife crime unit, it is the case that the NPWS, in association with the Garda, has been doing fantastic work, and continues to do so, on wildlife crime.  Earlier this year, we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Garda around the investigation of wildlife crime and, more recently, we have formally established a wildlife crime unit within the NPWS.  That is intended to enhance the work that is being done on the ground by our district conservation officers across the country.  They are on the front line.  The Chairman may have seen that, in recent months, a significant number of cases have been brought to successful prosecution.  Doing that requires significant investigation, including the preservation of crime scenes and the preparation of books of evidence.  We are also encouraged by the decisions judges have made in those cases.  Significant fines have been handed down for destruction of habitats and hedgerows.  In a recent case in County Laois, a landowner received a suspended sentence for being in possession of two birds of prey.  There have been moves in that regard and I might ask Ms Nally to elaborate further.</p> <p>  The establishment of the wildlife crime unit is intended to ensure we have a consolidated and standardised approach to wildlife crime.  There have been approximately 19 successful prosecutions this year and another 41 are pending.  Members of the public are now seeing that the penalties are quite significant, including penalties on farm payments, etc.  There is quite an amount of work being done in this space.</p> <p>  We also see a very important public awareness role for the unit as it is enhanced in the coming years.  I will ask Ms Nally to come in that.  I do not know if I have missed anything on that question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#O00600"><p>Wildlife enforcement is a big issue that involves all our field staff.  The Minister announced in April his decision to accelerate the recruitment of rangers nationally and that is coming into frame already.  We currently have 83 rangers nationally and that number will rise to 120 next year.  That is a great resource for us to carry out front-line investigation work in all our areas.</p></speech>

The Chairman also asked about information on the sites of national monuments.  I was in County Cavan last week with Deputy Niamh Smyth and it was incredible to see the work that local communities have done on their interpretation of the local heritage and monuments, particularly graveyards and church sites.  Funding is available under the community monuments fund, stream 3 of which is concerned with interpretation.  We encourage communities to be a part of that.  There was useful and simple graphic signage and useful interpretation panels at some of the sites in Cavan.  They were not overly scripted but very useful for visitors.</p> <p>  The Chairman also made points about the heritage buildings and walking trails in my county of Kilkenny.  Much of that was developed over many years with support from the local development company, the Kilkenny LEADER partnership, particularly around the Lingaun Valley and places like that.  There are heritage trails and walking trails.  There is a trails officer in place in Kilkenny.  I would see the interpretation of these sites as being mostly local initiatives.  I am not sure if Mr. MacDonagh would agree or how he would respond to that specific issue but there are good examples all over the country.</p></speech>

Raheen-a-Cluig is the church on the side of Bray Head.  There is nothing in place to indicate what it is to people as they walk by.  There is a sign that just states, I think, it is managed by the OPW.  I cannot remember if that is what is written on the sign but it probably is.  There is a very good local medieval group in Bray doing research in that area.  Is standardisation required for signage so that we avoid random types of signage appearing on monuments around the country?  Perhaps we need something that would fit with the monuments.  Mr. MacDonagh might like to come in on that point.</p></speech>

The particular site the Chairman mentioned in Bray made a funding request and received that funding in 2020.  We can continue to work with the community there on signage.</p> <p>  There is recognition that there should be diversity in signage.  Our key aim is to work with communities and local authorities to ensure that the information provided, as the Minister of State said, is appropriate and authentic.  We will continue to do that.</p></speech>

Some of these land use changes may also cause unsustainable rates of nest loss due to increased levels of associated predation.  In addition, there is a very low survival rate of juvenile births through their first winter, which is not balanced by the number of young being produced each summer.</p> <p>  In order to identify the actions required to address these threats and prepare a threat response plan, the Department has had to undertake comprehensive reviews of available evidence and scientific information and to gather, compile and analyse information on the precise nature, extent and distribution of the threats.  It has also supported new research, for example, on the ecology of the wintering hen harrier, and engaged with stakeholders across the relevant sectors to inform the plan.  Data and findings from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's hen harrier European innovation partnership have also been very useful in this regard.</p> <p>  While this process is taking a number of years, and certainly longer than we had hoped, it is moving forward.  Recently, the Department brought a draft of the threat response plan to the consultative committee to seek its views with the intention of then proceeding to public consultation, which we hope will happen in the coming months.  The consultative committee raised a number of matters that we are working to address, including the finalisation of site-specific conservation objectives for the six breeding hen harrier special protection areas.  Once the discussions with the consultative committee and the interdepartmental steering group conclude, the plan will then move to public consultation, which we hope will be shortly, as well as a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment of the plan, if required.</p></speech>

We have just concluded our pre-legislative scrutiny report on the local government (directly elected mayor with executive functions in Limerick city and county) Bill 2021.  To be fair, the pre-legislative scrutiny report included a wide range of suggestions.  However, it was very clear that the changes that were needed, even to the scheme proposed to us, would not be suitable for the Dublin region, which has four different local authorities.  What is needed urgently in Dublin is a citizens' assembly to progress the issue.  The T&aacute;naiste has made a commitment to me that it is first in the queue.  We need to find a way for that to progress, even with Covid restrictions.  While many of us have said that the outcome of that process needs to be a directly elected mayor for Dublin, there is also a need to look for stronger executive decision-making in Dublin that is accountable.  That comes down to the councillors.  We have some fantastic and talented councillors across the city.  There are more than 160 of them.  To remove them from the process and replace them with a directly elected mayor would not be a good reflection of local democracy.  I ask the Minister of State to expand a little on where we are doing in Dublin and how we can ensure that the people and, importantly, the councillors who have so much experience, have a say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-07a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021120700002#P00700"><p>This issue, particularly in relation to the directly elected mayor, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  As such, I am not in a position to comment.</p> <p>  On the question of a citizens' assembly, we want to get the citizens' assembly on biodiversity loss over the line first.  We have found, through Covid, that it is possible for online resources to be used in public engagement.  We have seen that through city and county development plans and various plans and policies.  We can be innovative in ensuring that any process, whether it is a citizens' assembly or another mechanism that is used for this really important decision-making, is deployed.  A blended approach of in-person meetings and online engagement could be used.  We do not know how long more we are going to be living through this pandemic.  During the summer, we engaged extensively on  the issue of marine protected areas and met communities.  That engagement also had an online element to it.  It is really important that whatever mechanism is used, whether it is a citizens' assembly, plebiscite or something else, the engagement with local communities and elected members is immersive.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a valid point that elected members across the Dublin region are fantastic and contribute greatly to local democracy and policies and plans in their own areas.  Elected members are of huge value whatever the outcome that is delivered by the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.  That is critically important.  I am sure the Minister of State will lead on this issue, as he has done with regard to the directly elected mayor for Limerick.  He acted fast and very comprehensively on the issue.  As someone who served for 16 years on a local authority, I value the role of the elected members in local democracy and decision-making.  I take the Deputy's point on board fully.</p></speech>

The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report is with the Minister of State.  One of the issues we did not really have time to develop, due the time pressures of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, was a belief by many members of the committee that social media is fundamentally changing our electoral system, how people within the system are operating and, equally, how voters engage with the political system.  We have indicated that we will deal with the issue in our committee.  Have discussions taken place between the Department and others on the idea of a new media regulator and the impact that social media is having on democracy?  For example, the Bill proposes that we ban radio advertisements, yet it facilitates advertising through multinational companies that often do nothing to dissuade people from using fake news.  That is a glaring error in the Bill.  We need far more discussion on the whole area of how social media is impacting on our democracy.  Has the Minister of State reflected on the pre-legislative scrutiny report?  Is it intended that the Bill will proceed or will other legislation be required?</p></speech>

The comprehensive report provided by the committee is being given due consideration as we frame the legislation and complete its drafting.  Social media strays into a number of territories, in particular, the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  What we are doing here in terms of the regulation of online political advertising during electoral events is innovative in a European context.  A number of other measures are being taken across other spheres at a European level and across other Departments.  As I said, we are giving due consideration to the work of this committee.  I know it is an issue on which the committee spent a long time deliberating.  I ask Mr. Ryan to comment further on the specific issue raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Their origins lie in an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which looked at Ireland's electoral processes and disinformation, and the recommendations the group made in its second report, in particular, the recommendation that we regulate for transparency around online political advertising at electoral events.  That is what is contained in the proposals the Minister of State is bringing forward.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is correct that there are other elements to this.  There is the online safety and media regulation Bill, for example, which is also being progressed.  We have engaged with colleagues on that.  We have also engaged extensively with the European Commission in the 12 months since it published the European democracy action plan this time last year.  In the plan, the Commission made a commitment to bring forward proposals in the area of regulating online political advertising.</p><p>It has done that and published proposals for regulation on 25 November.  The piece on which we are focusing as we conclude drafting the Bill is making sure the proposals in the Bill align with the proposals coming from Europe.  </p></speech>

I am aware the Minister of State needs to make contact with staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding storms. There is so much we did not manage to touch on today - even around the work of Waterways Ireland, the national biodiversity plan for 2022 onwards and the management plans for our national parks and Natura sites.  We need to do more to protect trees in urban settings.  There is so little protection for urban trees.  I know it comes under planning and local government but we can do more there.

We appreciate the questions and how informed the committee is about our portfolio in heritage and electoral reform.  I reiterate that we are very appreciative - knowing how busy this committee is - of it affording time to our work.  We will continue to work with the committee over the next number of months and years.  If there are any areas we have not touched on, we can certainly come back to the committee over time.  Again, I thank my officials for the incredible work they do across our heritage division and the franchise section.  They are incredibly dedicated to what they do.  From built heritage to the National Parks and Wildlife Service to national monuments to the franchise section, they are just amazing people and we are deeply grateful to them for the work they do.  I am very proud of the work of the Department and am very privileged as Minister of State to witness it at first hand through our work and travels around the country over recent months, be it visiting the corncrake project in Fota Wildlife Park, the restored castle in Fethard in County Wexford, the release of natterjack toads with young children in the wild dunes in Magharees, the restored pub fronts in Kilkenny or the ancient woodlands of Killarney National Park.  All of these connect deeply with our work for nature, built and archaeological heritage and communities that treasure them.  We certainly discovered that over the past 18 months or so.  I hope that over the next number of months, members will join us on some of our projects if we are in their respective counties.  We will certainly send out invites to all when we visit projects and highlight the positive impact of our work on the ground.
