No apologies have been received.  Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.  When people are speaking, obviously they can take off their masks.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with the University of Limerick, UL, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The university has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention: non-compliant procurement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, formerly known as the Dunnes Stores site; the overriding of controls; and the president&rsquo;s remuneration.  UL has also been advised the committee might wish to examine the fact the Department had withheld capital funding until certain governance issues have been resolved.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the university: Professor Kerstin Mey, president; Ms Mary Harney, chancellor; and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial performance officer.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: Mr. Keith Moynes, assistant secretary with responsibility for the higher education policy division; and Ms Emma Leonard, principal officer with responsibility for the climate action and capital planning unit.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051200002#A00500"><p>The group total income of the University of Limerick for the accounting year 2019-2020 was &euro;288 million.  Some &euro;90 million of this is recurrent State grant and pension funding.  Academic fees amounted to &euro;113 million, with 28% of this received directly from the Higher Education Authority.  Research income recognised in the year was &euro;33 million, including more than &euro;23 million from State sources.  In the year, other income fell by &euro;6 million, largely due to the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions.  Total expenditure of the group in 2019-2020 was &euro;285 million, representing an increase of &euro;4 million.  Pay and pension costs account for &euro;196 million of this.  The group surplus for the year 2019-2020 was &euro;3.9 million, and this compared with a deficit of &euro;2.1 million in the previous year.</p> <p>  I am satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the transactions for the year and of the financial position of the university at end of September 2020.  Consequently, my audit opinion on the financial statements was unqualified.  As is the case for other universities, the audit report includes an emphasis on matters relating to the deferred pension funding asset.  The purpose of this is to draw attention to the assumptions that underpin that part of the pension asset for which there is no explicit funding guarantee.</p> <p>  My audit report also draws attention to four matters that are disclosed in the university&rsquo;s annual statement of governance that accompanies the financial statements.  The first matter is the significant expenditure incurred by the university on procurement that was not in compliance with the relevant procurement procedures.  The second matter relates to the purchase of a property in Limerick in April 2019 for the development of a city centre campus.  Arising from concerns raised by an employee, the university engaged a firm of consultants to conduct a review of the purchase.  The review included an examination of the university&rsquo;s due diligence procedures around the purchase as well as the accuracy of the information provided to the governing authority when its approval was sought for the purchase.  Members will be aware from updates provided by the university that finalisation and dissemination of the report has been held up as a result of High Court proceedings.</p> <p>  The third matter I draw attention to arises from an investigation into a series of allegations made in 2017 and 2020 about the actions of a member of the university&rsquo;s senior management.  The investigator found the senior manager had breached the university&rsquo;s recruitment and procurement policies and procedures and, in relation to one of the allegations, the senior manager&rsquo;s actions were both inappropriate and unprofessional.  The senior manager had left the university before the investigation report was completed in November 2020.  The statement of governance sets out the progress in implementing the recommendations in the investigation report.</p> <p>  The final matter I draw attention to in my audit report relates to the arrangements entered into by the university relating to the resignation of the former president, effective from the end of August 2020.  The contract of employment with the former president did not contain clauses dealing with early termination or a notice period, which are standard clauses in employment contracts.  Following negotiations, the university paid an amount equivalent to four months&rsquo; salary, some &euro;65,000, and just over &euro;30,000 in respect of legal costs incurred by the former president.  It also incurred legal costs of more than &euro;15,000 on its own behalf.</p> <p>  Having reviewed the documentation relating to these payments, in my view, the agreement with the former president has the typical characteristics of a severance agreement.  Therefore, before agreeing to the terms for ending the employment, the university should have consulted the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about what was proposed and secured the prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those steps were not taken in this case.  The statement of governance presents the university&rsquo;s view that the arrangement with the former president around his departure was not a severance agreement and, therefore, did not require prior approval of the Departments.</p></speech>

As detailed in the letter of invitation, she will have five minutes for her opening statement.  I note the statement is very long, so I would ask her to summarise it in four or five minutes.  It has been made available to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Kerstin Mey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051200002#B00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting, which concerns the financial statements of the University of Limerick for 2019-20.  Those in attendance with me are Ms Mary Harney, chancellor of the University of Limerick, and Mr. Gary Butler, chief financial and performance officer.</p> <p>  If the Chairman will allow, I would like to briefly share some thoughts on the institution, of which I am extremely proud to be president.  A modern university must meet a variety of societal needs.  It must be: a centre of high quality education and research; a place for the discovery of new knowledge and better understanding about the world and ourselves; and, perhaps most importantly, a vital force in realising the full cultural, social and economic potential of the communities it serves.  Since its establishment, the University of Limerick has been a dynamic catalyst for change for the people of Limerick, the broader mid-west and nationally.  The capacity of our university to build and sustain deep and mutually beneficial relationships with industry continues to be a major driver of the region&rsquo;s economic prosperity and social transformation.  In addition, our strong academic and growing international research profile has attracted talented people across a broad range of disciplines, nationalities and cultures to come here to study, live and work.</p> <p>  Beginning this month, the University of Limerick will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its establishment in 1972.  In addition to celebrating our unique heritage, this will be an opportunity for us to articulate and promote our excellence in research and education and highlight the extraordinary achievements of our students, alumni and staff.  This important anniversary also coincides with, and has very much informed, our current strategic plan, UL@50, which we have recently refreshed, and also the development of our sustainability framework, which will provide us with a roadmap for development over the next decade.  Students are at the heart of everything we do and the campus settings in which they receive their education is to the forefront of our drive for sustainability.  Our objective during the lifetime of the strategic plan and beyond is to ensure that the university continues to evolve and prosper and contributes to a thriving world so that we can continue to provide future generations with an exceptional, inclusive and recreational environment in which they can excel.</p> <p>  I would like to share with the committee the performance of University of Limerick relative to its peers during the past number of years.  We are honoured to be the recipient of multiple awards for our world class campus, marketing and communications success, excellence in the provision of academic and professional services, gender equality in higher education, our research and for our incredible Erasmus programme.  In addition, we have: grown our student numbers to well over 17,500; our graduate employment is up 15% on the national average; we have become the first Irish university to engage with apprenticeships from level 7 up to doctorate qualification; and we have surpassed 10% of employment market share in Limerick.</p> <p>  Regarding our financial position, as requested, I have provided the committee with a comprehensive briefing paper outlining the university&rsquo;s financial position at the end of the 2019-20 year.  I have also provided some more detail on many of the matters which members raised at our previous attendance before committee.  My intention in so doing is to assure the committee of my personal commitment, as president, to ensuring our university&rsquo;s sterling reputation for excellence in education and research shall be matched by a commitment to the highest standards in corporate governance, transparency and accountability, and an open and inclusive, supportive and empowered organisational culture.</p> <p>  The 2019-20 year was unique and was characterised by the extraordinary uncertainty that accompanied the arrival of a global pandemic.  We also had to contend with the evolution of Brexit.  The governing authority, executive committee and staff of the university, in partnership with the student unions, worked tirelessly to ensure the continuation of academic activities and impactful research while also safeguarding our financially sustainability.  In the relevant period, the university returned a surplus of &euro;3.9 million.  The executive committee and the governing authority are agreed that this surplus must be reinvested in areas that will directly and demonstrably further enhance the student and staff experience, including implementing the broad learnings from Covid-19.  At this month's governing authority meeting we agreed to consult widely, especially with the student body on our intentions in that regard.  The consolidated university statement of comprehensive income and net profit for the year to 30 September 2020 are shown on page 38 of the financial statements.  During the period in question, Covid-19 impacted virtually all areas of the university&rsquo;s activities.  From 12 March 2020, the campus was effectively closed to staff and students.  While we continue to adhere to public health guidance and to assess ongoing and any permanent financial impact of the pandemic, it appears the worst is now behind us.  Happily, the university is emerging from the pandemic in very good financial health.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements for 2019-20.  The university welcomes this.  In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on information other than in the financial statements, attention is drawn to procurement non-compliance as disclosed in the annual governance statement; the purchase of a site for the city campus, the override of controls and the president&rsquo;s remuneration.  With respect to procurement, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to a sustained reduction in the percentage of such expenditure deemed non-compliant.  In the relevant period, non-compliance was 0.6%.  That is two thirds lower than the prevailing rate in the sector, which is 1.8%.  I am pleased to advise the committee that the university is one of the leading institutions regarding procurement compliance.  There is still room for improvement, and I have outlined a number of further and better controls we have put in place.  These will identify any future inadvertent or deliberate breach of public procurement protocols.</p> <p>  The university is wholeheartedly committed to its civil and civic mission, and this is very much reflected in our strategic plan and the refreshed plan.  We intend to contribute fully to the rejuvenation of Limerick city and we are working closely with our partners, including Limerick City and County Council, in that regard.  We have opened up part of our existing city centre campus where our digital fabrication lab offers opportunities for exploration and learning to University of Limerick students as well as the community.  The renovated space includes a Limerick City and County Council Community Engagement Hub and a further flexible space for teaching and events, which is heavily utilised.  When circumstances permit, we hope to make the significant capital investment that will be required in order to develop a truly vibrant city campus, accessible to everyone and an exemplar of sustainability.</p> <p>  I am well aware the committee has been particularly concerned to understand the circumstances which gave rise to the university&rsquo;s acquisition of the former Dunnes Stores site for &euro;8.343 million.  KPMG was commissioned to conduct a review, which has been completed but which is the subject of a legal challenge.  We are working with our legal advisers to try to unblock impediments to its publication.  I appreciate this is still a very live issue.  However, I hope the committee would permit me to draw a distinction between the process by which the property was acquired, arising from which the governing authority commissioned the KPMG review, and the enormous civic potential of this strategic site in the centre of Limerick city on the banks of the Shannon, which gives me cause for great optimism about the future of our city centre campus.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to hear the willingness of Professor Mey and the chancellor to publish the report.  It is certainly some comfort to the committee.  They can appreciate our insistence that we see it.  When it is published, I imagine that we will be inviting them back to discuss it in more detail.  I hope it is not a barrier to our discussion this morning.</p> <p>  There is a lot to discuss and I have a limited amount of time.  I welcome our witnesses.  The big thing I would like to discuss at the outset is the city centre campus.  Primarily I would like to afford time to the witnesses to take us through from April 2019 until today.  I heard them speak about the investment in the site and their excitement for the university about this site.  This cannot overlook the enormous cost of the site and the increased cost of the site from &euro;3 million originally when it was valued by Limerick City and County Council to what was paid for it at more than &euro;8 million.  Will the witnesses take us through the reason for the increase in costs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Harney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051200002#C03300"><p>I thank Deputy Devlin.  It is a very obvious question as to how we went from &euro;3 million to &euro;8 million.  This did not happen.  The &euro;3 million referred to, both in the public domain and here, was a valuation done on behalf of Limerick City and County Council for the purposes of declaring the site derelict and putting it on the vacant site register.  It was the council's intention to compulsorily purchase the site.  Dunnes took on the council and got a judicial review.  The council did not succeed in having the site declared derelict and put on the vacant site register.  I want to read from the so-called valuation.  It was carried out by a highly reputable national company.  It states that the figure it provided was on a high-level desktop basis and represented its estimate of value of the unencumbered freehold interest in the property.  It also states that in order to undertake a full evaluation, it would need to obtain confirmation of floor areas and undertake inspection.  It further states that it would also need to know the planning potential of the site.  The valuation document indicates that in view of the location of the property, it was likely at a minimum to be able to sustain six floors and perhaps more.  It states that based on this approach, it could look at a valuation appraisal to assist in determining what the site value or acceptable purchase price would be.  There was no &euro;3 million valuation as a market value.  It was a valuation done to declare the site derelict to put it on the vacant site register and for the council to compulsorily purchase it.  The affidavit presented in the judicial hearing in which Dunnes got a stay showed that on 30 September 2015 and subsequently the council indicated it wanted to compulsorily purchase the site.  I understand it might have wanted to put a cultural centre there.</p> <p>  In 2013 or 2014, UL decided it should have a city centre campus as an experience for students and to play its part in the strategic development of the city.  It looked at a number of sites and identified the Dunnes site as the preferred site.  It is an iconic riverside site.  It has been described as the preferred site in Limerick.  Unfortunately, it was not available.  Discussions took place with Dunnes over the time but it was not for selling.  There was not a willing seller.  There was a willing buyer.  In April 2019, Dunnes indicated that it wanted to engage with the university to see if it was still interested.  The university engaged in negotiations.  Dunnes looked for &euro;10 million.  I understand from the documentation given to the governing authority that the university put &euro;6.5 million on the table and that those involved in the negotiations settled on &euro;8 million.</p> <p>  When we made the decision to purchase this site on 5 April it was a unanimous decision.  I have read there were dissenters.  There were no dissenters.  There was great enthusiasm and excitement because of the location of the site.  We were told that valuation papers were tabled in the negotiations.  We made our decision based on the information before us.  It subsequently transpired, as a result of a freedom of information request, that there were no written valuation reports.  We were horrified as governors that we were told something based on a document that did not exist.  This is why we sought an independent inquiry.  This is why it is so important for me and the governing body to know whether we were misled or given the full facts when we made our decision.  We are entitled to expect if a proposal is coming from the president and deputy president of the university that all of the information in the memorandum and proposal is accurate.  This is what we are awaiting in the KPMG report.</p></speech>

The governing authority decided we should have an investigation.  The governance committee of the governing authority said it should be one of the big four.  I was not involved in that and nor was the governing authority.  The president can deal with that.  Essentially, what the investigation was to do was establish whether or not the correct information and the full information was put before the governing authority.  This is the purpose of the report.  That is why I said it to the Chair that nobody wants it more than me and the governing body.  I assure the committee that it comes up at every meeting as to why we cannot see the report and publish it and move on from the controversy.  It was a really good story.  When we got the site not only were we all excited in the university but it was very well received in Limerick that the university was going to come into the city and create a campus at that location.  Unfortunately, since the freedom of information request and the knowledge that there was not a written valuation, the matter has been dogged by controversy, including here this morning.  I regret this very much, as do my colleagues.</p></speech>

In doing that, we did a review of the assets that the university had on its balance sheet in order to assess whether the carrying value was correct and was not overstated in the financial statements.  In undertaking that exercise, we had independent advice on a reinstatement value for insurance purposes on the site as it stands and then a new-build cost if we were to build the equivalent today.  Both of those figures came in at around &euro;20 million.  That gave us confidence that the amount that we were carrying in the financial statements was not overstated.  This is a fairly common approach in terms of reassessing values each year to ensure that the financial statements give a true and fair view.  That information was shared with our external auditors, PwC, in order that they could review it and approve the sign-off of the accounts.</p></speech>

There is a process in place to look at the governance processes and to get assurance about them.  That has been a constructive process between the HEA and the university.

I also noted something strange in the accounts.  The internal audit was outsourced up until 2019.  Was that an historical decision?  Was that always the case or was that something that was done over the past decade?  Was it the same company or organisation that was conducting the internal audit for the university?  Who was that?</p></speech>

Its a very good question.  The current audit and risk committee recommended that we should bring in-house our internal audit function.  Traditionally, it was outsourced to one of the accounting companies.  That internal audit function is performing extremely well and we are enhancing the resources available to it.  The audit and risk committee is really happy with the performance of the internal auditor.  It was a very good and very wise decision.</p></speech>

It is most peculiar to have an outside organisation doing an internal audit and it is certainly the right step that the university has taken in that regard.</p> <p>  Speaking of steps being taken, I note that total legal expenditure is &euro;926,000, which is actually lower than the figure for 2019.  I presume this year's figure might be higher, given what we discussed earlier.  There is a brand refresh and implementation fund of &euro;87,000, which is higher than the 2019 figure, which was &euro;85,000.  The university in its opening statement highlighted the impact this whole saga has had on the reputation of the university.  Is that fund for repairing some of the damage?</p></speech>

She told me she had taken legal advice, which was to circulate it to those who are perhaps are directly affected by the findings.  That is what she did.  It was in that process that the legal challenge was threatened.  She followed the advice from her external lawyers right along and kept me informed of that.  She informed the governing authority as well.  I believe it was Professor Mey's intention to publish it in February-----</p></speech>

However, we can only surmise all of this because we have not seen it.</p><p>If the chairperson of the board of governors has not seen it, what is the function of the board of governors of the university?  I am actually puzzled at this stage.  I read all the documentation the witnesses sent us.  We have been trying to follow this.  The more I look at the documentation, the more I am unable to figure out what exactly the role of the governing board of the university is.  I have served on a number of different bodies but I have never come across a situation like this.</p></speech>

The role of the governing authority is defined in the legislation and the role of the chancellor is defined in the 1997 Act.  I have clearly no role in relation to operational or management issues.  We have an oversight role.  We approve the budget and the strategic plan.</p></speech>

I am sure the chancellor wants to see the report.  She has outlined her position, and I am sure she is like the rest of us in this regard.  Is it the case that the chancellor is not trusted with the report?  Is that the situation we have here?  Why would the chancellor of the university not have seen this report, which has implications and covers a very contentious issue that has been dealt with here and has been in the public domain?  Is the chancellor not trusted?  Yes or no?</p></speech>

On the delegates' opening statement and the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General on procurement, the university should be striving to be the bottom of the best as opposed to the top of the worst.  I really do not get it when they are backslapping over the fact that there are universities that are worse than theirs.  I ask that they remedy that in the future and strive to be the worst of the best.</p> <p>  The chancellor is sitting beside Professor Mey.  I do not mind who answers my next question.

The governing authority, when it learned there was no written evaluation, asked for an inquiry.  It asked the executive to organise that inquiry in conjunction with the audit and risk committee, which would be our procedure within the university.  The audit and risk committee approved the terms of reference that were drafted in conjunction with the executive.  I do not believe there is any issue with the terms of reference.

I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement, where he stated his view that the agreement between the university and the former president regarding his resignation had the "typical characteristics" of a severance package.  UL stated, based on its legal advice, it was satisfied that the recognition of payment did not constitute a severance package.  It also referenced Circular 09/2018 and concluded that prior approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was unnecessary.  I am trying to establish that the circular stated, in the case of a university, the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science required prior approval through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I will provide the context in respect of the former president's resignation.  He was paid more than &euro;180,000 from 1 October 2019 to 31 August 2020.  No contract or notice period was established in his terms of employment and he was paid &euro;65,000 in September 2020 for his remaining four months, when an interim president was also appointed.  His legal costs, which were in the region of &euro;30,000, were covered by UL, in addition to UL's costs.  Legal costs cost in the region of &euro;45,000.  My first question is for the Department's representative.  Will he please explain whether the Department considered the former president's remuneration as a severance package? </p></speech>

On 5 May 2020, the president informed me he was going to resign because he said the virus impacted on his ability to serve the university.  I sought a date from when that would take effect because we were in the middle of a pandemic.  I pay tribute to the staff and students for the manner in which they adapted to the huge challenges of changing the way they worked and learned.  We were getting ready to open up, which was the intention in September, and I wanted to make sure we had a president during that very difficult and challenging period.</p> <p>  The then-president said he wanted to be paid for a year through his legal advisers.  Bizarrely, his contract had no notice period.  I took legal advice.  The current Minister, Deputy Harris, in a similar situation when the director general of the HSE was resigning, said in the D&aacute;il on 17 May 2018 that payment in lieu of notice is normal.  The Department was involved in a Supreme Court case way back in 1940, the Murphy case, and there is also Independent Newspapers and the Carey case in August 2003.  There is significant case law that suggests people are entitled to a payment in lieu of notice.</p> <p>  I obviously did not want to pay a year.  As we wanted to minimise that, negotiations took place between our external lawyers for the university and the former president's lawyers.  As part of that, and on advice, legal fees were paid, which were &euro;25,000 plus VAT.  All of that was approved by the governing authority, although not the amount of the legal fees because we were not quite certain of it at that point.  The governing authority approved the payment.  The president got four months in lieu of notice and two months' holidays.  He worked remotely until the end of August.

I want to return to the issue of the site purchase for the city campus, and particularly the events of 5 April, when there was a governing authority meeting.</p> <p>  I will preface my comments by saying that I differ slightly from some of the previous members in that I would be concerned, as a member of the Committee on Public Accounts, if, despite legal advice not to publish the KPMG report, the university went ahead and did so and, as a result, the State or the university incurred significant costs.  I would like to say that.  However, I echo the absolute concern raised by all the members here, as well as, I can imagine, by the members of the governing authority, who do not feel that they can see sight of that KPMG report.  I will return to that in a moment.</p> <p>  In essence, the KPMG report is a University of Limerick document.  It was commissioned by the University of Limerick.  It has no statutory basis.  It is essentially a report that from the university and that was commissioned to KPMG for the university.  Would that be correct?</p></speech>

Okay.  It is not unusual, I suppose, for people who are party to the findings of a report to seek the recourse of the courts to prevent their publication.  This happens pretty much with every Government report that files a hard finding.  All of that being said, I understand the university&rsquo;s position, but I hope the witnesses will appreciate our frustration as well.</p> <p>  I will come back to the issue of 5 April.  I think Ms Harney said earlier in her comments that the governing authority was told that an independent valuation was available.  Is that Ms Harney&rsquo;s evidence?  Perhaps she might speak to that point.</p></speech>

DCU is a fantastic university in my area.  They carry out a lot of good work.  This is an empty site.  I imagine that there was huge enthusiasm for it.

Or does she believe that the written documentation before them was sufficient?</p></speech>

It was our preferred site for many reasons.  It is an iconic site.  It is a riverside site.  It is the premier site in Limerick.  A property person said to me recently that if it had gone on the open market, there would have been a cat-and-dog fight for it.  We were therefore excited that we now had it.  At that point, after we got it, Limerick City and County Council dropped its attempts to have it declared derelict and put on the vacant site register.  There was great enthusiasm, both within the university and externally.  I do not think that the enthusiasm over getting the site took away from our responsibility to use our critical faculties and to look at the proposal before us-----</p></speech>

However, Ms Harney can understand our concern that just three days earlier, a funding application had been submitted to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which included options.  This site had not been included in that.  First, I cannot get my head around why, if this was the preferred site, it was not included in that application.  Second, just three days had passed.  Can Ms Harney talk about how a document can be submitted to the HEA, but three days later an entirely different proposal can come before the governing authority?</p></speech>

From memory, in December 2018, the governing authority approved the procurement of what is called the "opera site".  It was not an ideal site, but it was the only other site that was available.  We approved that and then we made an application to the higher education strategic infrastructure fund.  That application was only submitted a couple of days.  When the president phoned me to put the matter of the Dunnes Stores site on the agenda for 5 April, among the reasons he used was the fact that we needed to change the site for the purposes of the HEA application, as well as the fact that he did not want Dunnes Stores to change their mind.  That is why it went to that meeting for a decision.  The reason we wanted to go to the city centre, besides the fact that we wanted to play our part in revitalising the city, is that the university, for those who do not know, is 4 km east of Limerick city.  We wanted to bring the university into the heart of the city.  That has been an objective for quite a number of years.</p></speech>

I can understand the reasons for Limerick, as well as for the university.  I will come back to the idea I was pursuing.  The president submitted a document to the HEA.  He was aware that a different, parallel option was available and that it was being actively explored by the university-----</p></speech>

I imagine there is huge enthusiasm in the room for it and it is approved.  I accept all of that.  However, there is a difference between that and the results of the FOI where the governing authority was told that a valuation took place and FOI and I imagine the university's own investigation show that no valuation took place.</p></speech>

We were told that valuations were tabled at the negotiations so clearly when you are told that, you assume written valuations are tabled.

In my view, the document is within the University of Limerick and I do not see any reason why the governing authority could not see that report in advance of it being published unless it had received legal advice that circulating it to 27 people on a governing authority would be tantamount to publication.  I believe the governing authority or at least a sub-committee of the governing authority should have access to that KPMG report given that it is an internal document.</p></speech>

It seems to me that if there is a withdrawal or holding back of funding, it stymies the ability of the university to fulfill its mission and obligations to its own staff but also its wider mission to the mid-west and Munster region.  I say this as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  I am very much aware of the work of EPI-STEM, Lero and other such entities and the translational effect of the research provided by the University of Limerick.  I worry that if the HEA is withholding funding, it will have a downstream effect on the university's ability to allow staff to progress from below the bar to above the bar positions or to allow the university to ensure that people progress and that there is a career path for employees within the university.  Is it the case that the holding back of this funding is affecting staff's ability to progress?</p></speech>

This is only my second time back.  The last time was for the banking inquiry.</p><p> We learned about the &euro;2 million mentioned by Mr. Moynes from a media outlet last Thursday, which I believe was very unfortunate.  We were completely blindsided.  We first learned we were approved for the grant and we also heard in the same call that the grant was being paused.  That is not the way to do business.  This blindsided us and it damages our relationships.  I know the president has had a call from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to apologise over the leak.  He does not know how it happened.  I hope we can engage with the Minister have these moneys paid over to the university as quickly as possible.  The Deputy is correct because this does impact on our ability to make things happen.</p></speech>

The governing authority confirmed all those reforms and I, together with the president, had another meeting with them, including the CEO, on, I believe, 12 November.  I believe the HEA, and I am not speaking for it nor do I have any such right, is satisfied serious reforms in governance have taken place at the University of Limerick.  I hope the Minister, when he visits the university on the 23rd of this month and engages with the president and her colleagues, will be in a position to release that funding.</p></speech>

This is all money that has been spent on external services.  Will the president tell me why the university spending &euro;595,000 on project management services and what are these services?  That is my first question for her.</p> <p>  Also, in respect of the brand refresh and implementation, &euro;87,000 would pay the fees for one lecturer above the bar, if I can put it that way.  My focus here is on staff and students, on what they are receiving and on what I would call their rights and entitlements.  It seems to me the amount of money, which is approximately &euro;3.1 million and is a significant amount, is all money that has been in spent on external services that could reasonably have been expected to be ploughed into investing in staff, educational output, and research output.</p></speech>

The university is a dynamic institution and develops rapidly and radically in the realisation of its vision to offer excellent education and research.  A number of projects have been carried out in that space to support the university to realise its ambition going forward.  I already talked about the brand refresh, that i was essential for us to have our appearance in the marketplace in line with the character of the institution, which is actually something that supports us in recruiting, attracting talent and affirming our position in a global and very competitive marketplace.  On the details of the expenditure, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Butler, to talk the committee through some of the details.</p></speech>

In 2019, the university spent &euro;1.04 million on legal expenditure alone.  It is a hell of a lot of money on legal fees.</p></speech>

The president referred earlier to the expenditure on the legal fees and we said we would provide more detail on that.  It creates a situation whereby there are a number of cases for which legal advice was needed.  We also often seek legal advice throughout the university on different developments we are undertaking.</p> <p>  On the expenditure mentioned by the Deputy, I would also like to comment on project management and consultancy.  These are large figures but are an investment in our student record system.  This system was introduced in 1999 and it is fair to say there was not regular investment in that, so a project has been undertaken to update and refresh that system to ensure it is fit for purpose.  It is the bedrock of the university in how it manages its student records, and that investment will continue because the university takes very seriously the ability to have systems that work and are fit for purpose.  That is the area around which the consultancy and project management moneys were spent.  Further investment will be seen in these areas in future years.</p></speech>

It has been described as an iconic site but it is certainly not an iconic building.  Otherwise, Limerick City and County Council would not have been pursuing it with regard to the derelict sites register.  It may well be an iconic site but it is certainly not an iconic building.  There are many iconic buildings in Limerick but the last time I passed this building, which was not that long ago, it looked to be in poor shape.  I would like to ask the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science about its role in this matter but, with regard to the report, will Professor Mey tell me who her employer is?

I have a number of concerns, especially when it comes to due diligence and due process within the university.  That has been highlighted to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>The significant level of procurement non-compliance and issues around property transactions that the university has been involved with have been particularly concerning.  There were also HR matters in relation to the former president, his resignation and around severance agreements that were not submitted for sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is something that is of particular concern to me.  </p><p> How did the purchase of the &euro;8 million site in Limerick city from Dunnes Stores for the UL campus come about?  I put that to the head of the governing authority of the college who has overall responsibility regarding these matters as set out in legislation.</p></speech>

If the Deputy has not heard it, it is worth hearing because it will help our engagement.  The &euro;3 million valuation - I read from that report - that was done for the purpose was desktop.  No inspection took place of the property and it was to be used for internal purposes only.  That was emphasised by the reputable company that carried it out.  It was done for the purposes of having the site declared derelict and having it put on the vacant site register because the council wanted to CPO it.  Dunnes took a judicial review and it got a stay on that happening.  UL always wanted to move into the city because we are four miles east of the city centre.  That was identified as the preferred site but there was not a willing seller.  However, in April 2019 Dunnes approached the university and asked if we were still interested and the university said yes.  Negotiations took place between the university and Dunnes Stores.  My understanding from what the governing authority was told is that we made an opening offer of &euro;6.5 million.  Dunnes was looking for &euro;10 million and through the negotiations we settled on &euro;8 million.  That proposal was put to the governing authority and it unanimously supported that proposal.  In the context of that proposal the governing authority was told that valuation statements were advanced in those negotiations.  It subsequently transpired that there was no written valuation when a FOI request was submitted.  The governing authority was obviously concerned that there was no written valuation and that is why the KPMG inquiry was established.</p></speech>

It is a derelict site, a vacant site.  I am sure the Deputy knows that if someone is going to CPO property they put in an opening offer.  It sometimes goes two, three or four times higher than that.  I do not want to read it again but it is in the record here.  The people who carried out that valuation said it was desktop that they had not seen the property and they would need to have access to it and inspect it to know its potential from a planning point of view and then they would give a valuation in the context of a purchase or acquisition.  The point I make is that &euro;3 million cannot be compared with &euro;8 million.  It would not be fair or right to do so.</p></speech>

That is interesting.  I appreciate the response to the question.</p> <p>  On non-compliance around the resignation of the former president and the severance agreement, why was it not submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for sanctioning, if it is okay to ask that question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Harney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051200002#N00800"><p>Earlier I dealt with that as well.  The former president informed me on 5 May that he wanted to resign because he was not able to carry out his duties because he was vulnerable to Covid.  I sought to get a date from the president.  He engaged through his lawyers and said he wanted a 12 month payment in lieu of notice.  Unfortunately his contract of employment had no notice period.  We took legal advice.  There is a lot of case law which I mentioned earlier.  Carey<i>v.</i>Independent Newspapers, Murphy <i>v.</i>Department of Education and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, in the context of the resignation of the director general of the HSE all upheld that in this kind of situation payment in lieu of notice is paid.  The negations took place between our lawyers and the lawyers for the former president.  They settled on a four-month payment in lieu of notice.  He got two months where he worked virtually.  Part of it was his holidays.  It was four months.  If it had been a severance payment he would have been entitled to over &euro;12,000 tax free.  We taxed it all.  If it had been a severance payment of course I would have consulted the Department.  That would never be an issue for somebody like me.  I would naturally follow the advice and do what was appropriate.  The Department spoke earlier.  We differ on this.  They say doctors differ and patients die.  Lawyers differ too.  The Department's view from its legal perspective and the view we had were very different and I followed the legal advice that was available to me</p></speech>

There has been significant concern around the cost of the new student centre.  It is around &euro;20 million.  There was an increase which was understandable in the context of construction related inflation that has taken place.  However, in September 2020 the contractor for the construction of the student centre, unfortunately, was deemed to be in breach of the contractual obligations for the project.  Can the committee be provided with an update?  What is the latest status of the project?</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, the project had to go out to a new tender to employ a construction firm.  The tender process was concluded but the prices for construction are further exploding.  Therefore the contract with the current construction firm, as far as I am aware, has not yet been concluded amid fear of a further spiralling of the costs could create issues for the construction firm.</p></speech>

The disclosure in this case came to my predecessor but proceedings were paused at the request of the person who initially made the complaint.  It then came to me to be activated.  As is the procedure, I appointed a group from the governing authority to look at the allegation.  This group appointed Ms McKenna, a barrister, to carry out the investigation.  Her report then came to hand.  She made findings and each of these has either been implemented or is in the process of being implemented.</p></speech>

The initial plan was developed in 2019.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Brexit and a changing external operational environment have made it necessary to recalibrate the plan.  We have undertaken an extensive internally-resourced exercise to recalibrate our strategic plan, which involves very ambitious targets with regard to the transformation of our education provision as a research-led university and 360&deg; of internationalisation.</p></speech>

We offer six apprenticeships so far and a seventh will commence in September.  These apprenticeships start at level 7 and reach up to level 10, doctoral level, in the case of principal engineers.  We are providing the talents for the future.  We have developed a range of innovative flexible programmes, including professional diploma and microcredential programmes, to support the reskilling and upskilling agenda of the Government and the national skills strategies.  Significant processes of transformation have already taken place in the university.  We have significantly enhanced our research performance with regard to quality, international standing and the money that has been competitively awarded under the Horizon 2020 projects.  We were the best performing university engaged in both rounds of the July stimulus package.  Our graduate employability is 50% higher than the national average.</p></speech>

I am being generous with that &euro;400 an hour.  At 40 hours a week, that is 58 weeks of legal advice.  That sounds extremely high.  Are there a number of major legal proceedings ongoing?

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial, and it went back into the High Court for a further four days and then back into the Supreme Court again.  The third-level college picked up the entire cost of it.</p></speech>

It is one of the things I am very keen to see happen before this governing authority ceases to exist next November.  It would be unconscionable from my point of view and that of my colleagues on the governing body if we did not have the report before then.  We are going to use every legal vehicle open to us to make that report available to the governing body and, I hope, to the committee and others.  It would be an awful pity if the body that asked for the report, which was commissioned by the university, could not get sight of the report before its term of office ends.</p></speech>

I was acting for a totally independent party, but that is how long the case took, and at huge cost to a particular third-level institution.  That is going back about 20 years ago and I was acting in a legal capacity.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates to the speculation about the valuation of the site.  Does the college have an idea of the current valuation of the site?</p></speech>

Earlier, I outlined a process that we went through called the 2020-2021 financial statements where we did a review of the carrying value of all the assets on the balance sheet.  That review included preparing a reinstatement insurance cost for the current facility and a new build cost.  Both of those came out at close to &euro;20 million in terms of what is currently there.</p></speech>

I served on a State board - the board of the Port of Cork - for ten years.  When we were purchasing new property we always got two other valuations and that would be the process available.  With a 29-member board, how come nobody raised that question in regard to this purchase?</p></speech>

Prior to this governing authority making changes, the president, with the approval of one of the subcommittees of the governing body, could spend up to &euro;20 million.  We have reduced that to &euro;2 million.  We have done a lot on governance issues to make sure that our oversight role is taken seriously.  In the future, it is clear that there will be learning from what happened.  The president has read the report and is in a position to make sure that learning is implemented as quickly as possible even before the report is published.</p></speech>

When it was brought to my attention by the president, because it was not part of our strategic plan and we had not done a business case, I did not allow that to go to the governing authority and asked for the money to be withdrawn, which it was.  A subcommittee of the governing body was set up to look at whether we should have a facility in Dublin.  I assure Deputy Burke that we use our critical faculties to make sure that anything we are doing is in compliance with our strategic vision.  Any learning from the KPMG report will be put into effect as quickly as possible, including what Deputy Burke suggests.</p></speech>

I would like to explore the role and <i>modus operandi</i>of the governing body.  In response to the previous questions, Ms Harney said &quot;we trusted what was put before us&quot;.  This committee could probably use that as a good title for most of the issues we deal with, where boards are simply not capable of or not willing to face up to the executive.  This is not specifically confined to UL; unfortunately, it is widespread.</p><p>I will ask a few questions to try to get a sense of how the board operated.  Ms Harney mentioned that the university's opening offer for the Dunnes Stores site was &euro;6 million.  Was the board aware of that offer being made at the time?</p></speech>

The proposal was in writing, including pictures of the facility etc., and was put before the board.  To the best of my knowledge, the deputy president presented the report and the president made comments.  Two members of the governing body asked questions.  One asked if full due diligence was done and was assured it was.  Another asked when the facility would be made available and was told the end of May or June.  From my memory, those were the two questions asked.</p></speech>

She stated that nobody expressed concerns in respect of the valuation of the site.  I am puzzled about this.  A verbal assurance was given but no documentation was presented, yet no one asked was there a second valuation or evidence of a second or third valuation.  I have sat on boards that handle far smaller amounts of money than this - I chaired one of them - and I can assure Ms Harney that for deals that involve a tiny fraction of this amount, one would seek not one or two but three valuations.  One would not rely on a person's word.  Much of this seemed to rely on the good faith of former senior staff.</p> <p>  Ms Harney mentioned and Professor Mey confirmed that a deposit was paid on a house in Dublin that did not fit in with the strategic plan.  Certain individuals sailed off to Dublin and put a deposit - I do not know how much it was - on a house the purpose of which was questionable.  Obviously, it was decided that the house was not needed and that decision was probably correct.  Fair play for stopping it.  The same individuals, however, sailed in to the university and stated that there was a site that was worth nearly three times what Limerick City Council valued it at but no one questioned that or asked for a written copy of even one valuation.  That is beyond belief.</p></speech>

I ask him please to give me an opportunity to respond.  We are here to answer questions.  I am happy to answer any question whatsoever.  This site was something we wanted for a long time.  There is no comparison between procuring this facility and procuring a Dublin property that was not part of our strategic agenda.  This site was sought after not only by us, but also by Limerick City Council and many other interests.  The University of Limerick entered into negotiations with Dunnes Stores with property advisers and a person to advise us on value.</p><p>It is not realistic for a governing body to say, just as it would not be realistic for the Cabinet to say, that every proposal that comes before it could cure something and to ask to see all the documentation.  That is not realistic.</p></speech>

There were a number of additional procurements where there were extensions of contracts because there was a reliance on the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to complete processes.

We will be starting a cultural audit to identify where there is room for improvement that will involve all among members of the campus community.  Since I have taken on the role as interim president and now as president I have worked hard to establish consultation processes, dialogue and a new communications platform so that we have regular exchanges.  The executive goes on roadshows in order to develop a much more dialogical relationship in the universities and all of that contributes to establishing a culture of empowerment and trust that is underpinned by transparency and full accountability.</p></speech>

I want to clarify my contribution earlier.  The document that was circulated earlier was presented by the president and prepared by the deputy president.  Is that paper available to the committee?  If we were to request it, could it be made available to us?  It seems to have been heavily relied on by the executive body in making that decision.  We have had a lot of discussions on the severance package for the president.  I was not aware that the report was prepared by the deputy president.  Is the deputy president still working with the university and are there any conflict of interest issues following their departure from the university if they are no longer working with it?</p></speech>

Then there was a fresh round and the McKenna report followed that.  I am reading from the briefing document, which states that the investigator found evidence that a member of senior management had breached the university's policy and procedures, that in the case of one allegation the investigation found that the actions of the member of senior management were inappropriate and non-professional, and that this manager left the university.  Was any payment made to that person on leaving the university?  Are there other protected disclosures in this same range of issues that are unresolved at this stage?  Deputy Munster asked a question earlier about how recruitment happened.  Does this relate to that issue?

Can we get a note on exactly how the members of that board will be appointed, the bodies that will be represented and how it will be constructed?</p> <p>  My final question is to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It relates to the former president's package.  Earlier, the representatives from the university indicated legal precedents dating back to the 1940s and other instances.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a view on whether the exit package as described has characteristics of a severance package or would it have been appropriate for departmental approval to have been given?  This relates to the contract of the former president and the difficulties it led to.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a view on whether the package agreed was appropriate in the context of best practice?</p></speech>

In my view, sanction from the Department should have been sought in that regard.  It is clearly a legal issue.  The only way to finally thrash it out would be through a legal case.  There is not one in this situation.  The problem clearly stemmed from the comprehensiveness or lack of comprehensiveness of the original contract of employment.  We have looked at other universities and seen the kinds of scenarios like termination and notice period included in the contract of employment.  It is clearly good practice, and I expect to see the University of Limerick doing that in future.  There is a learning there.</p> <p>  As to the value of the settlement or agreement, that is something on which I have not previously commented.  In every situation, the circumstances determine what is a reasonable amount.  I am not seeking to try to second-guess that; I am concerned with the process and ensuring things are done properly, and that those who are required to consider the matter are actually given the opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

The minutes of our meeting of 5 May were circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  No financial statements and accounts were presented to the Oireachtas Library between 2 and 6 May 2022.  We will return to this item next week.</p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 1217 B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 28 April 2022, enclosing the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in response to our report on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s 2019 financial statements.  Our first recommendation was that the report outlining the timeline and estimated costs for the completion of the national paediatric hospital be published as a matter of urgency.  We have requested sight of it on a number of occasions.  The response to the recommendation, which is not accepted, restates the board and the Department&rsquo;s position that the analysis is commercially sensitive and &ldquo;must remain confidential at this time, so as to ensure that the NPHDB&rsquo;s ability to enforce the contract is not prejudiced, and ultimately the project is not adversely affected.&rdquo;  In our latest correspondence with the Department on this topic, we asked for clarification as to whether the report could be provided to the committee on a confidential basis, and we await that clarification.</p> <p>  Our second recommendation, which was accepted, included a number of changes that will improve transparency in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board&rsquo;s accounts in respect of expenditure on this project, and that is welcome.</p> <p>  Our third recommendation was that future capital projects of this scale prioritise value for money, which was also accepted, and that a comprehensive review is carried out following completion of the project to ensure lessons are learned for future capital projects.  This is a requirement under the public spending code and will be done.</p> <p>  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy have flagged this item for discussion.  I ask Deputy Carthy to try to be brief.</p></speech>

Again, the issue of commercial sensitivity in respect of the hospital is being cited as reason for not providing this committee with a report that was previously promised to us before its publication.  For the life of me I do not understand how if there is a contract in place, the publication of a report into that contract could result in commercial difficulties.  We have been in regular contact with the Department of Health in respect of this, but I propose that we write back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it if it has an estimate of the final costing of the children's hospital and, if so, if it will share it with the committee.</p></speech>

We do not know what the timeline of this is, but it could be another couple of years before it is completed and we see the conclusion of this.  In the meantime, a similar project which was earmarked as costing &euro;300 million in 2017 is now being talked about as a project of the same scale costing &euro;1 billion, that is, the new national maternity hospital, which is equally mired in controversy about its site.  It is very difficult to see how lessons are learned if the project is completed before the other one starts.  How do we get even an interim understanding or some lessons?  The two-phase process is not similar, but how do we get some lessons we do not have to wait another five years for?  That is what it looks like.  We will have the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in before the committee.  It would be useful to know what the most recent set of accounts is and whether another set of accounts is due soon.</p></speech>

The 2020 accounts are the latest set on which an audit has been completed.  I will get an update for the committee for next week as to where the 2021 accounts are and when we expect to have them.

It provides information requested by the committee regarding National Broadband Ireland's 2022 updated interim remedial plan.  The plan confirms a target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of contract year three, which is 31 January 2023.  The Secretary General states that "under the contract, National Broadband Ireland is entitled to claim relief against its contractual obligations in circumstances where delays are due to circumstances beyond its control (such as the global pandemic)".  The national broadband plan is approximately 12 months behind schedule, eight and a half of which are accepted by the Department, as Members will note in the correspondence, as beyond NBI's control.  It appears that sanctions will apply in respect of the other three and a half months.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I raised this over lunch break, when we had the opportunity to raise it with the Taoiseach.  It was not to get in before I said it at this meeting, but I pointed out to him and the officials from his Department the fact that at least three and a half months are not accepted as within NBI's control.  It is important a penalty is levied for that.  The Taoiseach committed to speaking to the Minister about it.  One of the reasons given in the correspondence relates to blocked ducts.  It can be expected when starting to push cables through existing duct that there will be problems and glitches.  Covid has been overplayed as a reason, as I have mentioned before.  In the first quarter of last year, 2021, NBI was on the ground working, as far as I could see.  If it was not, it should have been.  While progress would have slowed, there was a certain amount of work NBI could do.  It is important that we keep on with that and that, along with raising the matter with the Taoiseach, the committee writes back to the Department asking it to clarify if a penalty is now being levied for those three and a half months.  On page 3 of the correspondence it states, "While these are addressed by the ... [updated interim remedial plan], sanctions are accruing against non-delivery of those Milestones."  That is what it says about non-delivery.  We should question that.  Deputy Carthy, do you want to come in briefly on this?</p></speech>

We were informed, if I recall correctly, that the target of 60,000 premises to be passed by March was still in place at the time of our hearing.  My understanding is that the most up-to-date figures we have received are that 41,000 premises or thereabouts were passed.  I think that those figures relate to last month and that only a little over 9,000 premises had actually been connected.  There is a problem here and, for the life of me, I do not understand why the Department is not live to that and reflecting the urgency of remedial actions in order to get this project back on track.  We have talked about the huge costs involved in this project and the number of communities that are desperately awaiting broadband.  The Government pursued this particular mechanism to deliver it and, clearly, NBI is not doing it in line with its own targets and milestones.  We need to keep on top of this issue, particularly in respect of the penalties, as you have mentioned, Chairman, and whether or not they are being applied or whether or not they can be applied.  The fact that penalties have not applied to date is concerning from my point of view.</p></speech>

The numbers are black-and-white.  I know that allowances were made for Covid for time that was not available, but that cannot continue to be used as an excuse.  In fact, if Covid has showed us anything, it is that it is even more essential that reliable broadband be provided.</p></speech>

It is important we are absolutely clear.  It is the first time I have seen any document from the Department state that sanctions are accruing against non-delivery of these milestones.  The importance of this is that it is a first, so it is important that that is seen through.</p><p>We will ask for clarification of that and of the nature of the penalty, that is, whether it is a financial penalty or otherwise.</p><p> The final item of correspondence is No. 1223B, from Mr. Mattie McCabe, board secretary of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, dated 29 April 2022 providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting on 24 March 2022 with the SEAI.  The correspondence provides responses to eight questions across a range of areas, including retrofitting and electric vehicles, EVs. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that also agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy indicated that she wants to discuss this further.  </p></speech>

We are in a very different environment now as against last year and this retrofitting scheme really has to succeed.  It is important that we ask the Department how it is taking into account the changed environment in relation to inflation in both labour and materials and to get an update on same.  It is useful to get this response but we are going to have to keep on top of that because we have legal obligations to meet our targets and if inflation is going to be an impediment, it would be an issue.</p> <p>  I wish to raise another issue.  We had a discussion last week with the Department of Finance and I asked a question in relation to the target of 100,000 EVs by 2030.  It is a nice round figure and I am always very wary of round figures.  Apparently the Department of Transport provided that figure but there does not appear to have been a robust exchange between the Departments of Finance and Transport on the ability to achieve that target but we will end up paying fines if we do not achieve it.  That is the point I was making last week, that it will come back on the Department's budget.  I suggest that we look at the McKinsey report on the second-hand EV market because the vast majority of people will not be able to buy new EVs at their current prices.</p></speech>

It is referred to in the final paragraph.  We need to follow up on how to reduce the price of EVs.  I personally think that the strategy should focus more on public transport and getting really good transport systems in place but the Government's strategy is to get 100,000 EVs on the road by 2030, a target with which we are supposed to comply but I do not see evidence of a sufficiently robust exchange between the various Departments on this.</p></speech>

The following engagements are confirmed for May: the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May and the Department of Health and the HSE on 26 May.  Two meetings have also been confirmed in June, namely, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 2 June and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 June.  We also agreed to schedule an engagement to examine local government oversight and accountability in June.  If we were to hold one engagement in relation to local government on 23 June, that would leave three meeting slots before the summer recess.  I ask members to review the work programme in advance of next week&rsquo;s meeting so that we can prioritise engagements for those remaining meeting slots.  We had a discussion earlier about how to handle the local government issue and agreed that we would bring in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Again, I ask members to review the suggestions that were submitted for the work programme and to let the clerk know if there is any issue they would like to prioritise for the vacant slots before the summer recess and we can agree them next week.  </p> <p>  As there are no matters that members wish to raise in relation to the work programme, I will take it as agreed.  As I said, if there are any specific items of interest, please revert to the clerk.  Is there any other business that members wish to raise? As everyone is happy, we will adjourn the meeting now.</p></speech>

Face masks should continue to be worn when people are moving around the campus and during the meeting except when speaking.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.</p> <p>  I propose that we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings held on 24 and 28 April 2022, which have already been approved at a virtual meeting.  We must do this for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Our next business will be the committee's engagement with Mr. James Walsh, a petitioner.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witness is reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that he should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of Mr. Walsh's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, he will be directed to discontinue his remarks.  It is imperative that he complies with any such direction.  Before we hear from our witness, I propose we publish his statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Mr. Walsh.  I invite him to make an opening statement for approximately ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have approximately ten minutes.  That will allow for members to come back in a second time, if they want to.  I invite Mr. Walsh to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022051200002#A00500"><p>A herbicide, also known as a weedkiller, is defined by law as a pesticide.  All herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, as well as moss killers and slug killers, both amateur and professional, are defined by law as pesticides and also referred to as plant protection products, PPPs.  There is legislation in place for pesticide use to protect the health and safety of members of the public and to protect the environment and animals.  The main Irish legislation concerning the control, marketing and supply of pesticides is SI 155 of 2012.  The main European legislation on pesticides are regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009 and directive 2009/128/EC.  The pesticide control division, PCD, and the pesticide registration division at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for enforcing these regulations.</p> <p>  Article 12 of SI 155 of 2012 states that no person shall apply a pesticide in areas used by the general public.  Alternative measures must be prioritised.  Only registered users can consider using a pesticide with documented evidence to state why any other measures would not work and there must be a risk management system in place, including warning signs.</p> <p>  Article 22 of SI 155 of 2012 states that any person who contravenes Article 12 commits a criminal offence and is liable to a class A fine and a court conviction.  A copy of the fixed payment notice was included in the supporting documents I sent to the committee.  Warnings are given before a fine is imposed.  The current fine is &euro;250.  The fixed payment notice includes SI 155 of 2021 and asks which Article was contravened.</p> <p>  A letter was sent to all local authorities, including councils and other public bodies, to ensure they comply with SI 155 of 2012.  I have a copy of that letter with me.  I have highlighted the area of the letter where Article 12 of SI 155 of 2012 is referred to.  It states pesticides should not be used in areas used by the general public.  It uses the examples of public parks, hospitals, public schools and public playgrounds.  It states that alternatives must be prioritised.  There must be documented evidence to state why an alternative would not work.  A proper risk management system must be in place by way of warning signs.  That is repeated in the letter that was sent to all councils in the country.</p> <p>  Many public bodies have made significant improvements by way of reducing or eliminating pesticides in public areas.  However, a significant part of public areas are sprayed by private users who are not a part of a public body.  Examples include contractors hired by schools or hotels, and other areas used by the general public.  Many farmers and residents spray public roadsides for up to a mile either side of a village, on both sides of the road or only one side, where children walk to school or people are walking.  Some people who do not have a car are forced to walk or cycle past such areas.  Young children have to step in off the side of the road and are forced to stand in pesticides.  There are often no warning sides when an area has been sprayed.  It takes seven days for a verge or grass to change colour after it is sprayed with pesticides.  One cannot tell within the first few days when the spraying was done.  It could have been sprayed five minutes or two days earlier.  The area could still be wet with glyphosate.</p> <p>  Shopping centres, private car parks, caravan parks, hotels, golf courses, GAA clubs and other sports grounds, swimming pools, health centres and restaurants, industrial estates and business parks, rented accommodation and estate agencies are further examples of public areas that may have been sprayed with pesticides.</p> <p>  I asked the manager of the pesticide control division at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine why this law is not enforced.  He told me the Department is understaffed.  He agreed with me about Article 12 of SI 155 of 2012.  It is illegal to spray public areas with pesticides.  A media spokesperson has confirmed this and said that to date, no public body has been brought to court.  It is not clear whether or not a private person has been brought to court.  Nobody is aware that this regulation, this law, exists outside of the many councils who have been made aware.  It has been in existence since last year.  The letter to which I referred earlier was sent out to councils in 2021 but outside of councils, nobody knows this law exists.</p> <p>  There are problems with some town councils that are persisting with the use of weedkiller but others have made improvements.  Cork City Council, for example, announced in February of this year that it will cut out its use of chemical weedkillers by 100% with immediate effect.  Cork County Council roads department has stopped spraying along primary and secondary roads.  Some municipal districts, however, still insist on using weedkillers in housing estates and playgrounds.  Close to where I live, for example, the roads department has done an excellent job using alternative measures along roads but the department looking after the council estates, which is a different department in the local council, is still spraying pesticides as far as people's front doors and even along the side of the swings in the playground.  I have video evidence of that.  Many other housing estates in the same town no longer use pesticides, as is the case in many other towns.  This raises questions about the willingness of some councillors in some municipalities to comply with current legal requirements and their understanding of the law.</p><p>I also received an email from Midleton town council and it stated it wants to use pesticides for another couple of years in public areas, and that it might eliminate it in future years.  It is clearly visible there where pesticides are still sprayed on footpaths in strips of 1 m wide along the dual carriageway between Midleton and Little Island and along the water's edge, which is also in violation of section 11 of SI 155 of 2012.  It is the same in Dungarvan on the footpaths and close to the water.</p><p> A motion was put forward this year to Cork County Council by an east Cork councillor to implement the same policy as Cork City Council and cut out pesticides in public areas by 100 %.  It was supported by all councillors but Cork County Council still did not agree to implement it.  It stated that Cork city is more urban than Cork county.  In my view, a housing estate in a town in Cork county, outside of the city, is the same as a housing estate in the city, and a primary or national road should not be any different to maintain than a dual carriageway.  According to section 12 of SI 155 of 2012, if some councils are persisting in this practice they are not currently operating within the statutory requirements of the legislation available.</p><p> In cases brought before judges by top lawyers in many courts across the United States, they have proven glyphosate-based weed killers to have directly caused cancer in humans.  It is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, at the World Health Organization as a group 2A carcinogen.  The main glyphosate-based pesticide supplier is being sued for more than $1 trillion dollars by more than 125,000 people in the US and is paying out $10 billion in 100,000 settlements.  It was announced that glyphosate will be removed from the domestic market in 2023 in the United States.  The sale of glyphosate is already banned in many countries, including Fiji, Saudi Arabia and five other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Bermuda.  Germany, Mexico, France and many other countries are banning glyphosate from 2024.  Pesticide use in public areas is already completely banned in many countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Portugal, Italy, Malta, Austria, and Luxembourg, most of Argentina, most of Canada and most of the United States.</p><p> A small percentage of public areas sprayed is invasive species, which includes Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed and a few others.  An organic vegetable-oil based alternative called Foamstream is successfully used in many areas in the United Kingdom to eradicate invasive species.  It is applied every six weeks when the plants are small to medium in size during growing season.</p><p> Private users who spray pesticides are already doing so illegally under section 12 of SI 155 of 2012.  In most cases they are not registered, they do not prioritise alternatives, they have no documented evidence to say why alternatives do not work, and they have no risk management system in place by way of leaving warning signs.  Public bodies that still spray pesticides in public areas are also doing so illegally, again because they do not prioritise alternatives, they have no documented evidence to say why alternatives do not work, and they have no risk management system in place.</p><p> Solutions would include warning signs to be placed in shops selling pesticides to say it is a criminal offence to spray along public roads and other areas used by the public such as caravan parks, schools, playgrounds, sports fields and so on; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to respond to any contravention, as with any other crime; hiring and training pesticide control wardens might also be an option, similar to a dog warden or traffic warden; all city and county councils should adopt the same policy as Cork City Council to eliminate pesticides in public areas by 100%; and a non-chemical alternative is available to treat invasive species successfully.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Understandably, there are challenges there for our environment in what it is facing.  A petition like this is especially timely and I believe it is worth examining.  It must also be noted that the petitioner is raising a matter of public health and particularly when it comes to the safety of public spaces such as playgrounds that would, in large part, be used by children, young adults and young people.  The petition also raises the need to consider the alternatives and why they are not being used.</p> <p>  I will open up the discussion with three quick questions and then I will let in the other members.  Will Mr. Walsh summarise some of the points he made in his opening statement and tell us what his concerns are about the current use of pesticides?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Walsh could break it down into private use and the use by the public bodies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.761" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022051200002#B00300"><p>Yes.  I will start with the issue of private use.  For example, where I was living previously in a village in north Cork, there were four roads coming into the village, one or two big farmers were living on the edge of the village.  All four roads were sprayed with pesticide on the road verges, sometimes on stretches up to half a mile long.  Children were forced to stand in this pesticide when they were walking.  As I have said, there were no warning signs to say the area had just been sprayed.  Their shoes would already have been contaminated.  Where I live now, the playground is sprayed.  Children are most likely to have come into contact with pesticides already, on their skin and definitely on their clothes, and bringing it into their houses where there may also be pets.  One of my neighbours has told me he will not bring the dog out after any spraying.  Another person I met had brought a similar petition to his local council in Carrick-on-Shannon.  He collected 1,300 signatures.  He said people had stopped going to the park over it.  Mothers would not bring their children to the park anymore.  Children are at high risk of getting contaminated with pesticides on their clothes and skin and breathing it in.  This is especially if the area has just been sprayed.  No warning signs are ever left.</p> <p>  Alternatives are not being used and it is not being documented.  If it is private use, in most cases they are not even registered.  Section 12 of SI 155 of 2012 clearly states a person shall not apply a pesticide in areas used by the public.  It clearly outlines that only in certain cases, if the registered person cannot use any alternatives, might its use be considered, with clear evidence logged as to why an alternative did not work.  That evidence must be logged, including how much was used, and a proper risk management system must also be in place.  None of that is ever done.  Private users are not registered.  They do not know the law exists.  There needs to be a public awareness campaign to tell people this law exists.  It all starts with the shops where people buy the pesticides.  If a person can see a sign to tell him or her it is illegal to spray the pesticides along a public road, in a caravan park, in a school or in a church, then the person is not going to do it.  At the moment it is possible just to buy the pesticides.  People do not understand anything about the law and the person in the shop is not telling the buyer anything about the law.  The buyer does not know he or she is doing anything wrong and believes he or she is helping out by doing a little job for the church or the school by just spraying it.  The person does not know anything about the law or anything about the pesticides being used.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Walsh make the distinction between pesticides for public use and those for professional use?  With regard to the call being made by Mr. Walsh, are the further restrictions applicable to both uses or just to one?</p></speech>

The law says a pesticide does not differentiate between an amateur pesticide or a professional pesticide.  In most cases I mean the professional pesticides, the same as used by the council, but which people can easily buy in a hardware shop.  They are using it all over the place.  In the village I lived in previously, you could not go anywhere that was not sprayed.  It was everywhere.  It was in the playground, in the GAA pitch, on all the roads coming in, on all the streets, including the main streets and outside the chipper, the nursing home and the hospitals.  It was just everywhere.</p></speech>

The restrictions are already there.  The law is already there.  By law they cannot do it but they do not know the law.  I am calling for signs in the shops, where it all begins when the person goes in to buy, so that there is a clear sign to say it is illegal to spray along public roads or other areas used by the public and that fines will be incurred.</p><p>Another option, given that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is understaffed and cannot enforce this, is for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be made aware of the legislation so its members are able to respond.  If I see someone spraying at a caravan park, public playground or along the road coming into a village, I should be able to ring the garda&iacute;, who could come down within 20 minutes, have a chat with the person and let him or her know that such spraying is illegal.  I have also included as an option, while the ban is relatively new and people are still unaware of it, the hiring of pesticide control wardens, similar to dog wardens or traffic wardens who could leave a warning with people or tell them about the law.  The main focus, however, is the shops, which is where it all begins.  They should display warning signs making it clear that it is a criminal offence to spray pesticides in public areas.  That would be good.</p></speech>

The letter is two pages long.  It was sent out to every Department.  It refers to national legislation S.I. 155/2012 which provides for restricted use of plant protection products, PPPs, in specific areas including areas used by the general public, special protected areas and special areas of conservation.  It says clearly that pesticides should not be used in these areas but whether the local authorities have read it is another question.  The letter was sent to them all but some might not have read it.  Some of them might not understand it because there is a lot of other information in it.  They might not have read it properly.</p></speech>

I was not aware that there was legislation and rules in place governing this.  The key issue here is to raise awareness of how dangerous these chemicals are and Mr. Walsh outlined that very well.  His commonsense approach, which we do not hear too often in this House, sits well.  There is no way glyphosates should be used in housing estates or anywhere that there is footfall, including playgrounds and so on.  Mr. Walsh is right about that.</p> <p>  I agree that warnings should be displayed wherever these chemicals are being sold.  Again, this is about providing information because I genuinely do not believe most people would be aware that they are breaking the law.  I spray my plants at home but I use a mixture of white wine vinegar, salt and washing up liquid.  That is an alternative and by God, it works.  I am very interested to hear Mr. Walsh's view on how we can raise awareness of the dangers of using these substances and also of the fact that there is a law in place which means that people who use them in public places are actually breaking the law. </p> <p>  This is a massive health and safety concern.  In terms of an alternative for the biological and cultural control of weeds, what would Mr. Walsh recommend?  Specifically on Japanese knotweed, herbicides are injected into the stem and the roots but is there an alternative approach?  Would it be useful for this committee to write to all of the local authorities to raise awareness?  Should we embark on an awareness-raising campaign using Mr. Walsh's ideas and recommendations?  </p> <p>  My main questions are how we work on raising awareness, what the alternatives are for playgrounds, how we enforce the rules and whether there is an alternative for Japanese knotweed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022051200002#C00600"><p>Many public bodies have already significantly reduced their use of PPPs.  In Cork city, their use has been cut out completely, 100%, and now one will see grass and weeds growing out of kerbs.  One sees that a lot in Dublin as well because the local authorities in Dublin have also reduced the use of PPPs by about 90% in the last couple of years.  Some have hired Foamstream machines.  As far as I know, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was the first to hire Foamstream machines and Fingal County Council also uses them.  That technology goes to the Deputy's other question.  Foamstream can be used on invasive species but the plants must be treated when they are small to medium in size and every six weeks during the growing season.  If a Japanese knotweed plant is too big, the hot water stream will not work but if it is treated when it is small to medium in size it will respond as well to Foamstream as any other grass or weed.  Foamstream uses organic vegetable oils and has been used successfully by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils.  They were the first to buy Foamstream machines in Ireland.  They are used in New York, Miami, Barcelona and many other places.</p> <p>  Apart from Foamstream technology, a lot of councils have stopped spraying in housing estates and are using mechanical options like strimmers and manual options like hoes and so on.  They probably need more manpower because they are not using sprays but they are doing it successfully in a lot of places in Ireland.  It is working.  The councils that are persisting in the use of sprays are doing so because they do not understand the law or out of pure habit.  They just keep renewing the contract with the sprayer and are not taking any interest in it.  One can clearly see that other methods are working well, including manual and mechanical options and in Dublin, the Foamstream technology.  There are plenty of alternatives.  I lived in Holland previously and used to see vans pulling up outside my home.  Six guys would jump out with shovels and hoes and clear an estate and then move on to the next estate.  I do not know if PPPs were ever used in public areas in Holland but certainly since 2014 most weedkillers have been banned, except for agricultural use.  Many countries are able to do it and a lot of towns in Ireland are already doing without PPPs.  </p> <p>  There is no excuse for those councils that are persisting with their use, especially near trees.  Cork City Council was one of the worst in the country last year but there were so many complaints that it went from being one of the worst to being one of the best in the country.  One would often see rings around trees after an area was sprayed.  However, with strimmers it is important not to get too close to the trees so what they do now is leave a small amount of grass growing around the base of the trees.  Things like that are very easy and effective.  Thanks to the pollinator plan, one sees dandelions growing along primary and secondary roads nowadays.  Councils have stopped spraying them and it is probably saving them money.  They are not spending money on chemicals or on the guys who were doing the spraying.  They are leaving things to grow a bit more.  In a lot of ways, they are doing it already in a lot of places.  </p> <p>  I hope I have answered all the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

There is only one cut per year.  I agree with Mr. Walsh that it is important to raise awareness.  It is also important to change the habits of the councils.  It can be done.

I apologise about that.  We are all on the video link.  He is on top of his game.  I thank him for the petition.  I recall that South Dublin County Council, based in Tallaght, passed a motion to ban glyphosate from being used in public spaces.</p> <p>  How much of this is about doing nothing or doing less?  Not using anything to replace pesticides or herbicides costs nothing.  It would save money.  Is there really a need to spray all of these areas?</p></speech>

The area near where I live, between Midleton and Youghal, is beautiful.  Spraying along those roads stopped and one can now see wildflowers growing along the sides of the roads.  There has been a change due to the pollinator plan, from having everything being straight-cut to instead having wild flowers.  That change has already happened.  Some councils, out of habit, keep hiring contractors to use sprays.  It happens anywhere that they find it hard to use strimmers, such as at road sign poles, trees, gravel areas or any hard surface area.  They find it difficult to do anything but spray.  If they took their time with hoes and shovels and were more careful, they could leave a bit to grow alongside the trees and road signs, even with the Foamstream that is used in Dublin.  There are many ways to do it.  Many other countries get by without herbicide and there is no need for us to use it.  It is a matter of habit at this stage.</p></speech>

It is not really a case of doing nothing.  One would do quite a lot of good by not using herbicides or pesticides, since it would allow for growth and be good for biodiversity.  Mr. Walsh mentioned the pollinator plan, which I was going to raise too.  There are many examples of how we label products, including alcohol, tobacco and so on, so that could be looked at.  The green schools movement and tidy towns are forums which could bring awareness to the issue.</p></speech>

I thank him for his attendance, his contribution and his original petition.  He has highlighted various elements.  He has a great knowledge of and interest in this.  As Deputy Buckley said, the legislation is already here.  It needs to be implemented and enforced where necessary.  I was particularly pleased to hear Mr. Walsh mention my county council, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, which took this step a number of years ago.  There was hesitation about it.  Mr. Walsh mentioned the weeds and so on that he saw on his route through Dublin to Leinster House.  There is a knock-on effect.  Some pesticides and herbicides do what they say on the tin, but there are unseen impacts on the environment.  That is why D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown took what was, to my knowledge, a unanimous decision, and other local authorities acted too.  Mr. Walsh mentioned his own county.</p> <p>  I was reading the guidelines and one matter stuck out.  The officers of the pesticide control division in the Department will inspect local authorities for compliance with the sustainable usage of pesticides directive, SUD.  Does Mr. Walsh have much information from the Department about how many inspections of local authorities have been conducted?</p> <p>  Colleagues have mentioned restrictions in sensitive areas.  Mr. Walsh mentioned playgrounds.  Where these are used can be seen, because there is a scorched earth look to grass, to verges or to wherever it is used.  Public representatives get many calls when weeds are not under control.  Mr. Walsh mentioned hot foam and other methods.  All of those should be used.  They are better for the environment.  Some Irish companies produce the chemical-free agents that local authorities could use.  One in my area, VivaGreen, has many non-chemical, non-invasive products which work.  Is Mr. Walsh aware of other, preferably Irish, companies that are doing that too?  Mr. Walsh might answer those, then I will come back in if possible.</p></speech>

They came up with a solution together.  I was told that by a Green Party councillor from Cork.  Inspectors visit councils and inform and help them.  From what I heard from the Green Party councillor, that is where the plan came from.  Matters in Cork were bad last year.  The council apologised publicly for some of the spraying.  It admitted that it was done outside of guidelines.  I know that inspectors go to councils.</p> <p>  The second question was about whether I know of any other Irish companies.  I only know one company that provides Foamstream, which is from England.  I have not come across any Irish companies that provide alternatives for councils.</p></speech>

They do not want the place to look untidy.  To use Mr. Walsh's analogy, people are not looking for golf course quality, but ultimately, they do not want the place to fall into wrack and ruin.  A balance is to be struck.  Where local authorities could use products that are not harmful to the environment, humans or animals, we need to make sure that they do so.  Alternative methods such as hot foam are fine, but we also need to encourage local authorities to explore other options.  I am not necessarily hearing that from Mr. Walsh.</p><p>Maybe to follow from today, the committee could write to the Department and find out first how many inspections have been happening.  I heard what was said about Cork but I am suspicious that it is because of Mr. Walsh's activity that Cork was inspected last year.  We need to find out how many inspections are done annually and also what kind of promotion and experiments are being done with non-chemically based products.  We should find this out from the Department and then maybe we could engage with Mr. Walsh and others in a little while again.</p><p> I thank the witness again for his attendance and answering the queries.  Well done.</p></speech>

I am from a horticultural background and I studied it in college.  I will not say I know a lot but I know something about this business.  I have had an issue with many of the weedkillers, such as those like Roundup that have a glyphosate base, over the past ten or 12 years.  I like to see their use reduced wherever possible.</p> <p>  As Deputy Devlin has said, there must be balance, but I can get really annoyed when I see a stretch of road that has been sprayed for a quarter or half a kilometre.  The spray might have got rid of weeds but it will also have done damage to insects and other plant life.  When we study this, we always have a mind for it and would always be thinking about things like that.  I missed the start of Mr. Walsh's contribution but I presume he is mainly talking about local authorities, or is he more concerned about individuals?</p></speech>

A significant portion of public areas are sprayed by non-public bodies, or essentially private users.  It is, collectively, a big problem.  We could walk down the road from a local village and many residents will have sprayed their part of the road.  We could end up on a GAA pitch that has been sprayed and in a shopping centre or hotel the car park might be sprayed.  It happens in many different places, including businesses like car dealerships.  We can see it particularly in caravan parks with holiday homes.  Wherever people are maintaining grass it can be used but according to law it should not be used there.  It is just that people do not know about it.  Its use by private parties is a big part of the issue but there is also the question of its use by councils.  They are both significant and almost equal in importance.</p></speech>

I suppose local authorities face the challenge of making these safe for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.  Again, I do not like to see such corners sprayed but I presume such an area could be trimmed to ensure safety, which is a prime concern.  It is about safety when it comes to road use.</p></speech>

It still persists in some areas almost out of habit.  Alternatives are being used.  For example, in the county where I live there was some use not so much in the city but the countryside.  In November, spray was used along the roads and in circles around road signs.  There was spray used around housing estates.  It seemed to be everywhere.  I thought that we were lucky that many councils were stopping its use and they might not do it any more.  The roads department seems to have stopped spraying and is using alternatives.  The other local authority department is still using it in estates in front of people's houses and the playground, however.  They are probably not aware of the letter or have not been talking to anybody about it.  They are able to control such growth without these sprays and that has been done successfully for the past year in many places.  It can be done.</p></speech>

Apart from the damage done to plants, there is also the question of the effect it may have on human life and people.  Personally, I believe it will be found in time that they have an effect.  I know there is some research indicating that is true.</p> <p>  Correct me if I am wrong but did Mr. Walsh mention Carrick-on-Shannon?  There was an issue with spraying there.  I ask this because part of Carrick-on-Shannon comes under Roscommon County Council and part comes under Leitrim County Council.  I know in Roscommon they have cut out much of this spraying in recent years and it is very into biodiversity now.  Are there any details about where the spraying in question happened in Carrick-on-Shannon or is that a fair question to ask?</p></speech>

They normally run on diesel but there are also smaller electric versions.  There is a guy near Castlemaine or Castleisland in Kerry.  I do not know the name but I know Furlong Equipment Services has a Facebook page with information.  It has a website at <i>www.herbicidefree.ie</i>and it has information about invasive species as well.  I was invited to see the company and did so as part of my research.  He let me try it and the machine uses vegetable oil and hot water to loosen moss and things like that.  It is completely safe.  He was able to rub the ingredients on his tongue and hair.

It is a good suggestion.  Is there anything else Mr. Walsh thinks we should be doing to get rid of this practice where possible?  We should definitely introduce more environmentally friendly systems.  I live in Strokestown.  Deputy Devlin might tell us O'Connell Street is the widest street in Europe but we have that.  We have a problem with keeping weeds controlled on footpaths etc.</p><p>If anything destroys the look of a town, it is overgrowth of weeds, particularly on streets and footpaths.

There should probably be a task force designated just for that, perhaps in every city and town.  Guys used to go around in vans with shovels, hoes and strimmers and used to go along the kerbs, like they do in Holland.  They jump out of their vans and clear the weeds along the kerbs.  They might do ten estates in a day or something.  Other than that, maybe the foam would work.  I do not know how well it works in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but lots of countries are able to do that and to keep places clear of weeds.  You do not see weeds growing there.  They do that without herbicides.  Holland is therefore probably a good country to look at to see how this is done.  I am not sure about Foamstream.  In some areas there are still a lot of weeds growing, even though Foamstream is used.  The cost of it is probably another reason.  The councils probably do not have that many machines for it running at any one time.  It is like anything else.  I have talked to different golf courses as well.  Some golf courses do not use any pesticides and some do.  The ones that do not use pesticides said it is all down to daily labour.  People maintain the courses every day by mechanical, manual ways and there is no need for pesticides then.  If, however, nobody maintains the courses, weeds will grow.  This can be done by alternative means, but somebody has to do it mechanically and manually or else the weeds will just grow.  It might require extra workers.  I do not know.</p> <p>  Second, and very importantly, I spoke earlier about a way to eradicate the practice of private users spraying public areas.  It is a matter of making them aware in the shops from which they are buying the herbicides with signs stating that that is illegal.</p></speech>

What could we as a committee do?  Deputy Devlin said we will write to the Department but, specifically, outside of that, is there anything Mr. Walsh would recommend?  Perhaps the committee could go to the Department or write a letter to the local authorities stating that X, Y and Z works in Strokestown or wherever else-----</p></speech>

If it works in A, it should work in B.  It cannot be said that it does not work if it already works in A.  With private users, the most important thing is, as a couple of people mentioned, public awareness.  If a person goes into a shop with the intention of spraying his own garden, that is grand.  There are no restrictions on that.  If, however, he intends to spray a public road verge where people walk every day, a caravan park out of which he hires caravans or a restaurant beer garden that hundreds of people visit on weekends, sitting outside and lying on the grass, he should be able to see the warning signs in the shop stating that that is illegal, according to SI 155/2012.  Once people know, the practice will be cut out straight away.  It is similar to the smoking ban.  People know smoking in pubs is illegal because the public awareness is there.  That is important.</p></speech>

I assure him, however, that if weeds start to grow on the footpaths in a housing estate, we as public representatives will be hit with demands to get the council up and to get rid of them, no matter how.  I know from experience - and I am sure the other members will tell Mr. Walsh the same - that the first thing local authorities will tell us is that they do not have the manpower.  I think the best option to go for, therefore, is the foam spray or something like it.  I can mention this to Tipperary County Council's Joe McGrath but he will tell me straight up to go away, that the council does not have the manpower to do the work.  We will give the councils the options.  Mr. Walsh has told us how this works in Holland, but I think the best hope we have of changing the councils' attitude is to go for a different machine or something.  I would love to see more manpower, and I am sure every supervisor in Roscommon, Cork and everywhere else would love extra men, but at the minute there is very little chance of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.825" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022051200002#F01000"><p>I am reminding myself of the response from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Brendan Gleeson.  It touches on what we talked about earlier.  He speaks about pesticide use in public areas and the current situation.  I note that he states that if a product authorised for professional use is intended to be used, it can be applied only by a Department-registered professional user.  Going back to the non-chemical products, Mr. Walsh might be able to assist in that regard because of his experience.  Senator Murphy is correct that Mr. Walsh obviously has a real gr&aacute; for and an interest in the topic.  It would be good to identify a number of non-chemical products that could be recommended to the Department.  Ultimately, if the Department takes the lead on this, the local authorities will follow.  The Department goes on to state in its response that there is best practice in responsible pesticide use in public areas.  That is a guidance document the Department produces.  That is one point.</p> <p>  The second point is that the reply goes on to state that there is currently a robust EU legal framework for placing on the market the use of pesticides and that the EU is responding to the concerns of member states in a more harmonised approach to deliver fully on the ambitions of sustainable use of pesticides.  In tandem with what the Department is doing, the committee, on foot of Mr. Walsh's petition, should correspond with the Department, not only about the inspections but also about whether it is trialling non-chemical products and whether it recommends them on its list for professional contractors.  That might also assist because it is in line with Mr. Walsh's recommendations to the committee.  One point is about the warning signs, and that is fine.  Maybe an information campaign could be good, particularly around April and May every year, as the growing season comes on.  Mr. Walsh said all city and county councils should adopt the same policy.  I agree with him on that.  He is right that if it works in one area, it should work in them all.  The problem, however, going back to the Chairman's point, is manpower.  We can have all the machines we want but we need people to drive them regularly.  Mr. Walsh's experience in Holland is fine if they have the crews to go out regularly, but we find there are long stretches of road that do not get the attention they need and people give out about them.  As I said earlier, there is a balance to be struck here.  We have to be cognisant of biodiversity as well.  We cannot kill everything that is growing that we do not like the look of.  That is not good either.</p> <p>  To Mr. Walsh's third point about the non-chemical alternatives, that is where he can assist, as well as the committee corresponding with the Department, to try to recommend more non-chemical-based products.  Let us see whether the Department is trialling them - we do not know - and how many inspections are being undertaken.  Then, when we get the response, we might engage again with Mr. Walsh.</p></speech>

The Department responsible for enforcing the legislation may or may not inspect or judge the risk assessment documents afterwards.  I would like Mr. Walsh's opinion on that.</p><p> I have been on a scheme with about 20 others.  We spent half a day using the spray equipment, with each of us using it for five minutes.  After just half a day's training, we got a document stating we were able to spray, taking into account wind and the whole lot.  I could spray here and it could destroy the whole room.  Does the matter of who gets a licence to spray, especially in public areas, need to be tightened up as well?  As Mr. Walsh said, if it is in a person's own place, it is not going to do any harm.</p></speech>

I do not know if that booklet was designed before or after 2012 but it does not mention Articles 11, 12 or 22 of the statutory instrument.  It gives the user no knowledge of any existing law.  That is a problem.  The letter I received from Cork County Council stated the council wants to continue using herbicide in public areas and may eliminate it in future years.  It stated the council was fully compliant with the SUD, which is not the case.  I have the directive here and it mentions Article 12.  The letter referred to the council operating under the guidance of Straight A&rsquo;s for AMENITY.  This is just a little guidance booklet for those who are on the ground spraying.  It informs users to be careful there is nobody walking around and not to go too close to water.  It does not mention Articles 11, 12 or 22 of the statutory instrument.  The booklet does not match up enough with the legislation.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Walsh propose an alternative way of monitoring how the risk assessments are done in the lead-up to pesticides being sprayed in any particular area?</p></speech>

They probably look at it sometimes.  From another media article, a woman wrote an article about me in a small online news outlet.  It was quite popular.  A lot of people looked at it.  She said she contacted a lot of councils to find out more about it and, as I said, they do not have documented evidence to say how much they sprayed and why they sprayed.  They do not have that information.  They do not fill it out.  They just do it out of pure habit.  They hire some guy and they do not even know what the guy has done.  Councils hire a contractor and he can do what he likes.  They do not even know themselves what it looks like, probably.  I was talking to a guy from the roads department where I live.  He was sound, actually.  He was one of the people who was engaging with the emails and was interested.  He did not even know what a road looked like when it is sprayed.  He was asking me what roads were sprayed.  I told him all the roads had been sprayed and asked him had he not see it since he had hired the contractor.  He said he did not know what it looks like and he had just hired the guy.</p></speech>

My father eats organic.  That is how it started, actually.  My father was always telling me organic is much better.  I researched the difference between pesticides and organic and there are a lot of laws in place in the EU, even when it comes to food, that we should be moving towards organic.  Even the hospitals should be testing for pesticides, by European law, and I do not think it is being done.</p></speech>

I rang the EPA at one stage and was told to ring the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's pesticide control division.  I do not know whether it was the EPA that sent me on the number.  I was dealing with the EPA briefly on the phone and I think it was the agency that told me to get on to the Department.  There was one instance where, similarly to what the Chairman was saying, a guy who did a one-day spraying course sprayed all around the water treatment centre where I was living.  That is illegal according to Article 11 of the same statutory instrument.  It depends on how many people live in the village but spraying is not allowed within anything from 50 m and 200 m of a water treatment plant.  He sprayed right around it, including all the buildings, where the water goes into the river and everywhere.  I complained to Irish Water and the council got back to me the next day.  I do not know if I am allowed to mention any cases but it rang me up the next day.  It inspected 14 water treatments centres in north Cork afterwards and the guy who did it got a warning.  Even though he did a one-day spraying course, what he was doing was completely illegal.  He had no knowledge of the legislation.</p></speech>

The Chairman covered some of the issues I intended to raise.  Sometimes local authorities are placed in a no-win situation, mainly in the context of rural roads.  It is a health and safety issue on an acute bend.  Mr. Walsh will know how it is.  In summertime, wild parsnip and other plants grow out onto the road, which means walkers and cyclists have to move out from the roadside.  The initial reaction to that sometimes, particularly if people complain, is to spray it off.  Maybe if councils have to take that sort of action, they should cut back the vegetation rather than spray it.</p></speech>

It is true people do not like to see some vegetation cut back but I am thinking of where it is a health and safety issue.</p> <p>  As part of the green and environmental debate taking place all over the world and the discussion on saving the planet, it is extraordinary what is going on with technology.  There are all these new products coming on the market.  We will see more and more products that are safer, environmentally friendly and will not have the effect products like Roundup do.  I studied this for years and I honestly believe the more some of these weeds are sprayed, the worse they come back the following year.  Spraying might kill them for a while but they seem to expand.  Maybe Mr. Walsh will give us his thoughts on that.  There is so much new thinking and so many new developments going on that we will probably see far safer products coming to the market in the short term.</p></speech>

We see a lot more organic food and stuff in the supermarkets, so it is kind of going that way.  The legislation provides that alternatives have to be prioritised, documented evidence is needed and spraying should not be done in public areas.  In the European legislation, Directive 2009/128/EC, states that spraying is particularly dangerous.  In the introduction of the directive on which the SUD is based, it states it is particularly dangerous to spray in areas used by the general public.  It outlines that it is specifically dangerous for children, elderly people and vulnerable people with underlying illnesses.  Article 3 of the main European legislation states that.  All the legislation says not to use it.</p></speech>

I want to say a huge thank you to our witness today.  He has obviously put an awful lot of thought and legal research into this.  It is also great he is able to share his own lived experience from Holland with us.  In terms of Mr. Walsh's three recommendations, his first was with regard to the legislation that is in place already and that it should be better communicated, with perhaps warnings on the pesticides as they are purchased or at the point of sale.  I totally agree with Mr. Walsh on that.  That is a practical suggestion that could definitely make a big impact and increase awareness as to what the rules are currently and what is safe and unsafe and legal and illegal.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh's second recommendation was in terms of all local authorities following the path of Cork City Council.  Each local authority has its own jurisdiction when it comes to these things.  However, if we were to look at that blanket synergy, if you like, we would probably need a directive or ministerial order.  I would certainly be interested to hear more.  I do not know if we have further plans as a committee.  I know it is in some of the documentation referenced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but I would still be interested, nonetheless, to hear from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this as well to see whether it thought that would make sense.</p> <p>  In terms of the non-chemical alternatives, Mr. Walsh referenced the UK-based experience of a vegetable oil-based alternative, which is used approximately every six weeks during growing season.  Forgive my ignorance but does Mr. Walsh know the current situation in terms of how often farmers have to spray pesticides?  It is just to give me that background knowledge.</p> <p>  Have any reports or analyses been done in the UK in order that we could maybe learn from its experience, see what is working and not working, what needs tweaking, or whether there is something we could just lift and shift and work away with here?  Much research has been done on this.  I know at an EU level the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies are and will be Ireland's guiding principles on this.  An awful lot of work is being undertaken at an EU level.  The plan is to have 50% less pesticides in use in eight years' time and to reduce that overall risk of chemical pesticides by 50% in eight years.  My understanding is the European Commission is finalising a proposal around the sustainable use regulation to replace the sustainable use directive and that will come into force here.  Is that something on which Mr. Walsh has any insights?  I know he is not necessarily an expert in this field, if he will forgive the pun.  I compliment the amount of research he has done, however, so he may well have research on this as well.</p></speech>

Where farmers are currently using pesticides, how often is it sprayed?  I am trying to ascertain whether there will be labour intensification or more work involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.847" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022051200002#H00400"><p>The question around it being used every six weeks is only about the invasive species.  Foamstream is used for normal grass maintenance, similar to pesticides, two or three times per year.  It is only the invasive species that have to be treated every six weeks because they need to be treated when they are small to medium-sized.  They need to be treated more regularly to make sure they do not grow too big.  Invasive species make up a very small percentage of the reason people spray in public areas.  It has normally just been injected in most places with pesticides.  It is not, therefore, the biggest problem.  They should by law also be using alternatives to that but it is down at the bottom of the severity of problems.  Definitely with the invasive species, however, Foamstream would be used every six weeks because plants are small to medium-sized.  I do not know how many times they need to apply pesticides on invasive species currently.  I think maybe if they inject it once, that will go down to the root.  I am not sure; I really do not know.  I have been told by people who are very knowledgeable about Foamstream that it tends to work better.  Like another man said, plants grow back wilder again with pesticides but with the Foamstream, the oils go down into the root.  They actually nourish the insects in the ground as well because it is organic.  It is less likely for the invasive species to come back up.  That is what I was told.</p></speech>

I was told it was the same by some people.  I rang up the woman who hires out the trucks in Dublin.  I am not sure if it was the same company but she said that Foamstream came out on top of all things but that it was more expensive.  According to her, it was more expensive than pesticides but it did not take into account other costs associated with pesticides.  It was purely the cost of the foam itself and stuff like that.  It did not take into account the cost of labour versus the cost of insurance with pesticides and also much of the time, people show up with pesticides in bad weather and they might have to cancel a day or whatever.  Foamstream can be used in different types of weather.  I think it cleans chewing gum off the streets as well.  It has different functions.  I am not too sure.  She reckoned it was slightly more expensive.  The guy who is distributing it reckons it is the same, so I do not know.</p></speech>

This letter to the Department is getting longer by the minute, but in fairness some of the things Mr. Walsh touched on today were not responded to or highlighted within the Department's response.  Obviously, they were not highlighted in Mr. Walsh's original petition.  This is coming out in our discussion, which is helpful.  It would be good to know when the booklet was actually produced, however.  It does not reference section 12 of SI 155 of 2012, which Mr. Walsh mentioned.  It would be useful if we could establish that.  Mr. Walsh is right in saying that if the booklet were updated, if it has not been already, then that could do some of the work we are actually talking about and people would be informed about what they should and should not do.  Ultimately, the vast majority of people want to comply.  Mr. Walsh mentioned the product.  I have had experience of this in the past while.  The vast majority of people are looking for non-invasive chemicals to use.  They do not want to do any harm.  That is where we need to make sure the Department is trialling those.  If we can get those responses from the Department in that correspondence, that will help and it might inform our discussion.</p></speech>

From what I have been seeing on Facebook pages and hearing, I think there is a problem in England as well in some places.  I think it is the same.  In many ways, Ireland is doing the same in trying to comply with the sustainable use of pesticides directive, SUD.  Many countries are ahead such as those I mentioned earlier.  Some countries such as Holland have even banned pesticide sales outside of agricultural use.  A person cannot even buy it for the garden.  It is just for agricultural use.  In those countries, it is not sprayed by councils and things like that.</p></speech>

I have heard time and again from people, and experienced it myself, that residents associations spray housing estates.  I complained to the residents association of a place where I was living and told it that it could not spray, but it sprayed the playground and the rest of the housing estate.  It got some random guy to spray pesticide.  When I drove past one day, he even sprayed it over my tyres.  He had no clue.  I told the association that was illegal.  I made a video.  I am not sure whether it was followed up on because the pesticides control division of the Department did not say whether it had done so, but I do not believe the residents association sprayed it anymore after that.  I have heard from other people that other residents associations were also spraying pesticides.  Bringing Tidy Towns on board would be good.</p></speech>

Petition 14/22, on raising the upper age limit in the Defence Forces, is from Mr. Stephen Martin.  The petitioner considers that current upper age limits for joining the Defence Forces are restrictive and, as a result, there is a risk the Defence Forces are missing out on suitable candidates who are keen to join but cannot because of their ages.  The committee secretariat wrote to the Department of Defence about this petition and the Department responded, providing information on the current age limits for general service, technicians, cadets and certain specialist positions.  The Department advised there are no plans to change the upper age limit.  The recommendation is the correspondence from the Department be forwarded to the petitioner for comment and that we consider adding this to our work programme for the coming year, should time allow.

There are possibilities.  I have encountered people who are fully qualified engineers, mechanics and the like but who, because of their age, have not been allowed to join the Defence Forces.  This matter should be looked into and I would like to revisit it.  In cases where people have expertise that would be an asset to some part or other of the Defence Forces, it should be allowed.</p></speech>

This petition is about houses that are affected by defective blocks and aggregate such as mica and pyrite.  The petitioner has concerns about the proposed Government redress compensation scheme and questions about planned legislation, namely, the defective concrete blocks redemption Bill.  The committee secretariat wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, about this petition.  The Minister has responded with details of interim enhancements to the defective concrete blocks grant scheme and has advised that he aims to introduce primary legislation in the Oireachtas as soon as possible to give effect to the enhanced scheme.  The recommendation is the correspondence from the Minister be forwarded to the petitioner for comment and the secretariat respond to her questions about proposed legislation inasmuch as it can.

This petition was submitted on 28 January and relates to a housing estate in Kildare where houses were bought by the county council several years ago and have been blocked up since.  The committee secretariat contacted Kildare County Council about the petition three times but did not receive a response.  During this time, the petitioner contacted the secretariat seeking updates.  The recommendation is, first, that direct contact be made with the interim chief executive of Kildare County Council, Ms Sonya Kavanagh, to determine whether she received the correspondence from the secretariat; second, that once that is established, the clerk should write directly to Ms Kavanagh seeking a response within 14 days the committee; and third, that we respond to the petitioner advising him of the first and second parts of this recommendation.</p> <p>  As we discussed during private session yesterday, the secretariat has tried hard and been fully on top of this matter in recent months.  Three months without a reply from any Department or local authority should not be tolerated.  That is why a period of 14 days is being recommended.  The amount of work our secretariat has put into trying to get answers needs to be recognised.</p><p>Do any other Members have a view on this, or is that agreed?</p></speech>

It is an absolute disgrace.  Our case workers have enough work to do.  To be waiting nearly three months for a reply is not good enough.  The committee, by which I mean the secretariat, the researchers and everybody else, has a responsibility to assist those people who depend on us.  To be waiting three months for a reply is ludicrous.</p></speech>

I am on another committee that wrote to each of the political parties that receive State funding to invite them before the committee and we did not get a response from at least one political party that receives funding from the State and that is represented in this building.  It can be extremely frustrating for members of committees when there is not co-operation, particularly when we talk to public authorities, which is ultimately what a local authority is.  I therefore fully support the recommendation and share the frustrations of the secretariat.  I am sure it is a really difficult job when it is constantly chasing after people and getting nowhere.  I think you are right, Chairman, to make contact with the interim chief executive and right about the 14 days.  Well done.</p></speech>

Deputy Tully is being substituted this morning by Deputy Buckley.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to Ms Helen Doherty, national co-ordinator of Social Farming Ireland; Mr. Brian Smyth, national project manager; and Mr. James McManus, who will be supported by Mr. Niall Cahill.  I also welcome Mr. Willem Le Roux, co-ordinator; and Mr. Stephen Coates, Mr. Deante Troy and Mr. Anthony Redmond, who are young adults from the Central Remedial Clinic.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are within the precincts of Leinster House.  I ask members who are joining us remotely to confirm that they are within the grounds of Leinster House prior to contributing to the meeting.  For anyone watching online, some witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented nature of these circumstances, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical difficulties arise.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending and giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be provided on the extent to which such evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect the decision of the Chair. </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on Ms Helen Doherty from Social Farming Ireland to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is a simple but powerful concept that gives people who have challenges in their lives the opportunity to engage in ordinary everyday activities on ordinary working Irish family farms in their local community.  The support is based on the relationship that develops between the people and the farmers, the families on the farm and the wider communities.  People avail of the natural environment, connecting with the seasons, nature, plants and animals, which are all hugely beneficial for people with challenges.</p> <p>  There are four main areas of benefit for people in social farming, relating to mental health, skills development, social connections and physical health.  On mental health, there is evidence of benefits for people as it gives them purpose and meaning in life, gives them valued social roles, connects them with nature, animals, plants and the landscape and gives them a sense of achievement.  Often it is about getting the opportunity to care for somebody or for things such as plants and animals, instead of just being the receiver of care.  It builds people's self-esteem, confidence and personal capacity.  There are always skills to be learned on a farm, from farming skills to life skills.  Building wider social connections is important for people.  People build new relationships and a wider relationship with the community that exists around any farm, creating a wider personal network.  There are also physical health benefits for people involved in social farming.  In a very natural way, people end up doing a lot more physical activity, even if it is just walking. </p> <p>  The farmers we work with receive extensive training.  Farms can be risky environments so we take our farmers through an extensive training process of about 25 or 30 hours.  When they have completed that training, we follow up with HSE-approved safeguarding training.  We do extensive health and safety training, we vet our farmers and we prepare them for practice.  They comply with our standards of practice and reach that minimum standard before we work with them.  Our team across the country continues to support the placements as they become active.</p> <p>  This has all been made possible through support and funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Successive Ministers have been very supportive, from the early days with Deputy Coveney, subsequently with Deputy Creed and now with Deputy McConalogue, who was on a farm in Donegal very recently.  Our farmers are paid for the time they devote.  One of the first things I say to any farmer is that there is no point doing social farming if they do not have time to devote to people.  They are giving up that day to spend time with people and there are also additional costs involved in setting a farm up for social farming in a lot of instances, although not always. </p> <p>  Social farming taps into the existing assets in rural Ireland, that is, the farm, the farmer and the community around them.  It taps into something that is very valuable.  We are responding to the demand for social farming right now.  People are exercising their choice to receive care and support in different ways and one of the choices people are opting for right now is social farming.  We are experiencing quite significant demand for social farming right across the country.  These are local solutions to local problems and people do not have to leave their area.  Some people travel some distances to go to farms but generally it is within a 20 km radius.  People are becoming more visible as a result of their activity and getting involved in the farm.  They will be involved, for example, in going to the local co-op or the mart and in the different activities that go on in the normal run of things on a farm.  We are breaking down barriers at community level.  That responds to Government policy because we are achieving better outcomes for our citizens and providing good value for money.  Social farming is a stepping stone to the workplace.  People come to social farming seeking outcomes in their lives and we help them achieve those outcomes.  Social farming brings together the natural environment in an enjoyable and ordinary way and delivers significant benefits for lots of people.</p><p>Who are Social Farming Ireland?  Social Farming came from a pilot programme that was run by Leitrim Development Company, which was the rural development partner, University College Dublin, UCD, and Queen's University Belfast.  Originally, it was a cross-Border programme.  Subsequently, we then got funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we now offer social farming opportunities to people right across the country.</p><p> We have approximately 150 farms on our books at the moment on which people have received training and are ready for practice.  We have trained in excess of 600 people across the country.  We have delivered 13,500 placement days to 1,400 participants.  We expect to deliver roughly 5,000 placement days this year because we are back in full swing again and back to exceeding our 2019 levels.  We expect that figure of 1,400 participants to exceed 2,000 participants this year.  We have worked with more than 300 health and social care organisations right across the country.</p><p> If members would like to hear more about social farming, we have an upcoming conference in Killashee Hotel on 1 June.  That is something that will hopefully be of interest to people.  I will hand over to Mr. Smyth now for some more remarks.</p></speech>

We have quite an extensive support for people in recovery from mental ill health.  We have refugees, people coming out of the justice system and out of prisons, people with addictions, brain injuries etc.  People with disabilities have accounted for almost 60% of the participants since we started placements on farms, however, so it is very significant and that is reflected in the European context.</p> <p>  There is no question, therefore, about the need and desire for people to partake in this choice of support across the community.  It is a social community support rather than following the medical model.  For that reason, it is quite innovative in that it links sectors that do not really naturally link such as agriculture and health and social care in that context.  The innovation has been following policy delivery.</p> <p>  In that regard, we have linked with University College Dublin and other institutions, and with projects in the European context, to keep track of researching and reporting the evidence from what happens in Ireland.  We deliver on and promote the vision and aims of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, particularly those in Article 19 on living independently and inclusion in the community, Articles 24 to 27 on education, health, habilitation and rehabilitation and work and employment and Article 30 on participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport.</p> <p>  As I said, we are not providing employment on farms because there is a distinction between this and employment placements or job placements.  It is a pre-employment support that progresses people toward their choices in life.  Some want to move towards employment, whatever the nature of that may be.  Others have different goals when they start out, and, after a number of placements, may move towards employment.  It is, therefore, a progressive planned placement that helps people achieve goals.  The goals can be very simple in many cases in terms of better physical activity, social interaction, establishing routines of using public transport and getting into a work routine of getting up in the morning and getting lunch.  That is how we are delivering for people on the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  We are also delivering for people on key national policies with regard to the Government policy on disability, including the New Directions initiative, getting people into the community and innovating in support.  Members will hear an example shortly from Mr. McManus in respect of the Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities report.  We have also built additional supports in our local development company.  This year, we applied to the social welfare scheme announced by Pobal and we have in place an individual placement support, IPS, worker based on the model of IPS that operates in the mental health service.  We have a person working there to work with people who are actively seeking paid employment.  We will hear from Mr. McManus later and he will give us an example of that.</p> <p>  Obviously, we have the national disability strategies and particularly the Towards Personalised Budgets for People with a Disability in Ireland report, which was launched in 2018.  We have one particular example of a person on a farm in County Wexford who has personal budget support, and he and his family will give their experience at our conference.  We are delivering, therefore, and want to deliver on national policy.</p> <p>  The activities associated with social farming and the model of implementation are very personalised.  People choose the goals they want and the plan around each placement works on achieving those goals.  The placements are generally time-limited even though we have people now who have been on them for 12 months or two years.  The view is always to plan to achieve certain goals and to go forward as opposed to just placing people for the sake of it.  It is, therefore, progressive.</p> <p>  We want people to feel like they are valued, independent, active citizens through their placements.  We want to take away the labels because farming is farming.  It is ordinary; it is part of every community and people can access it.  Our view is to make this accessible for people.  Because it is an innovation in the health and social care side, it is that bit more difficult to mainstream the accessibility of it to find the funding to cover the cost of placements.  We are very grateful to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the funding in that regard.</p> <p>  There are gaps in the service provision to allow people to innovate and make the choices they really need.  Choice is so important.  Covid-19 contributed to gaps in service provision, which I am personally aware of because I have a daughter with Down's syndrome who is just about to leave the secondary school system.  I am very well aware of the issues with the hit-and-miss nature of service provision and accessibility to service.  I was a director of Down Syndrome Ireland for many years.</p> <p>  What we are trying to do is to provide something innovative that is very valuable.  We have research and our document on research on the disability side shows the benefits, outcomes and value.  It shows how valuable it is for delivering a better life and connecting people in the community with the natural environment and things that really interest them in order that they live a much more fulfilled and better life.  There is a discovery process in this.  Before the placement, there is a review of the placements and people move on.  We are looking to move people towards those ultimate goals they have, with employment being an important part.  We are always speaking to the political system and statutory systems to look at increasing the accessibility and sustainability of social farming.</p> <p>  There is a very significant depth of knowledge now in Ireland from our activities with a wide range of services.  It is a collaborative project.  We work across many different Departments.  We have young people coming out of the leaving certificate applied, LCA, programmes, pre-exit from schools, looking at options they may take in the future.  We have Ukrainian refugees actually taking part in placements on farms at the minute so it is very responsive to people's needs, no matter what they are.</p> <p>  What we have is a very fragmented funding model for social farming placements.  We have very significant funding for this year, thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, from her disability integration funding, which we received for seven counties.  We had to apply numerous times - I think for 14 or 15 counties - and we received grants for seven.  We would like to see a national multiannual fund that is some way embedded or mainstreamed in order that we can be certain of support for placements, which are very valuable.  That is where I may leave it, as Mr. McManus will now speak.</p> <p>   In that regard, as a disability campaigner as well, I am very interested in seeing the reality of personalised and individualised funding.  It has been very slow.  We know that was legislated for in 2014 in Northern Ireland when we were working on a cross-Border basis.  We see the benefits of that in terms of providing accessibility to social farming for people with disabilities.  It is still in the very early stages.  It was a key part of New Directions.  It has not turned into a reality, although it has for some.  There is a pilot process with approximately 120 or 130 people in the country.  We would speak to the committee, as legislators and as people who can move policy into practice, to make sure that becomes a reality for people.  It will give people real feeling that the UNCRPD is actually a reality for them in making choices.  Mr. McManus will now give us his input.</p></speech>

I work as a co-ordinator at the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, on the employment plus programme.  With me are Anthony Redmond, Deante Troy and Stephen Coates.  I will hand over to them shortly.  They have some interesting points they want to make.<br/><br/>For me, and on behalf of our small staff team, I just want to say that it is a real privilege to work with all our course participants.  Helping someone on their employment journey is one of the most rewarding jobs you could have.  Our programme is funded by Pobal.  We are grateful for its support and assistance.  The need for an employment programme for people with disabilities became evident after many adults completed the ability programmes and achieved their major wards at Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, levels 3 to 5, inclusive.  The next step is getting into employment, so our programme aims to increase the labour market participation of people with disabilities, increase employment skills and employability, increase good practices and supportive work places and increase paid work and placements for people with a disability.  Through our interventions so far we have one course participant who entered into employment with a private sector company, two adults who secured community employment, CE, scheme places and one adult who is applying for the same.  Six adults are actively involved in work experience at present and one adult identified self-employment as his preferred route.  We have 20 adults on our programme altogether and everyone can now access the services of a guidance officer as we have partnered with Ballymun Job Centre.<br/><br/>Although the programme focused mainly on employment supports, we found it necessary to introduce other supports relating to mindfulness, well-being, healthy living and stress management.  We have had some good results, which gives much hope and optimism.  However, we have had some difficulties as well, which highlight some of the barriers people with disabilities face when looking for employment.<br/><br/>One thing I have noticed is that for many of our current course participants, it is their first time meeting up with a guidance counsellor.  If you consider the average age profile of our participants, which is between 25 and 30, you might think that this is well overdue.  Guidance counsellors can play a vital role in advising young people so that they can make informed choices about their future in relation to employment, education and training.  Imagine the progress we could make if this process started early for people with disabilities and where they can develop career management skills early and possess the ability to have an honest and authentic understanding of themselves when leaving school.  Unfortunately, access to guidance counselling is not equal for all.  In 2019, Indecon published a review on career guidance.  It stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Special school staff generally, as part of their ongoing work, undertake guidance activities, including planning for the child&rsquo;s future, assessing further education options, training, employment or other placement options subject to the individual&rsquo;s abilities.  There are no guidance counsellors allocated to these schools and in Indecon&rsquo;s opinion there is merit in policy providing enhanced provision for career guidance training for teachers in special needs schools, and also in enhancing the access of such schools to wider career guidance supports. </blockquote> <p>One final word from me on partnerships.  During the height of the pandemic, the CRC was fortunate to work with an employer to create a work experience partnership.  This relationship has developed over time and is still growing.  It took a long time to establish this partnership.  It required staff and our adults to work differently, take on new risks and have new expectations.  Partnerships like this could pave the way towards employment in the future.  It will be useful to promote and encourage such collaborations with both public and private sector partners.<br/><br/>I will now hand over to Deante, who will share his thoughts on the recruitment process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Deante Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051200002#C01800"><p>First up, the jobseeking process can be very tricky.  CVs, interviews and dealing with nerves are things most of us find hard to manage.  You need a lot of organising skills, IT skills and networking skills.  These must be followed up with coping skills and being patient.  There is also getting to interviews, which can in person or online, being against other candidates and also included is Garda vetting, background checking and medicals.  This all combines into a huge undertaking for a person with a disability.</p> <p>  The UNCRPD can play a strong role here to make sure disabled people have equal access and their rights to work are helped.  Having campaigns to change the way employers think with disability awareness and accessibility training will help.  We should celebrate diversity and include everyone.  I enjoy being on the CRC employment course because staff are helping me to be more confident, to sell myself, know what to say in interviews and what not to say - the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts.</p> <p>  I now hand over to Anthony who will speak about how families can help or not help when it comes to finding employment.</p></speech>

I am one of the students on the employment plus programme.</p><p>I will speak about what is good about family helping with trying to get work and the problems family can cause.  It is good to have a family that helps out and deals with situations.  Families show the benefits of a work environment and life-changing situations.  From childhood onwards family members teach the skills needed in life, the benefits and other steps people with disabilities can take.  Sometimes there are little issues such as family illnesses or health problems that stop people from trying to get work because they are worried about their parents.  I like to return the help I got from my parents by helping them out as much as I can.  Doing this while working causes a lot of pressure.  I am working through it the best I can.</p></speech>

I will speak about the rigidity that can be found in the workplace and in schools.  When I was in second level education I was not allowed to do the leaving certificate applied or even to do transition year.  I was told I was not doing them.  When it came to the workplace in one place I did work experience I was asked to go in as a baker but when I arrived nothing was set up.  What ended up happening was that I paid out of my own pocket for ingredients and supplies.  That was quite difficult on disability payments.  Another place I worked on a community employment, CE, scheme had very rigid standards.  A CE scheme is supposed to be approximately 19 hours a week.  I was working 40 hours a week there.  There was no discussion or deliberation.  I was told these were my times and to do them.  When it came to doing the work sometimes with extra hands we were finished early.  This left me, a person with ADHD, sitting around.  That is quite unhealthy for us.  We need to be moving.  In my case if I am left sitting still I go completely mental.</p> <p>  Now that I have been introduced to the CRC I have found a new career path.  Mr. Le Roux mentioned one student who wants to be self-employed.  That is me.  After the experiences I had in various workplaces I decided I want to have my own place where I can run a little bakery and avoid the mistakes I have suffered in the past.  I want to have a bakery where everyone is welcome, whether they are disabled, blind, have Down's syndrome or are in a wheelchair.  People could come in and do some work and learn the fun of baking.  That is what I enjoy.  It is therapeutic for me.  Thanks to working with the CRC I have begun to work on a logo and copyrighting and trademarking names.  I am learning the business side of what I need to do.  Thanks to Mr. Le Roux I have found a self-employment course in TU Dublin for which I have applied.</p></speech>

Their contributions on employment have been very interesting.  I am interested to hear about how these schemes can empower disabled people to have choices and control over their own lives and the work they want to do after their experiences on the farms or taking part in the schemes.  How have disabled people been able to secure paid jobs as a result of participating in these schemes?  What percentage of people who participate in the schemes go on to paid employment compared with those who do not?  What impact does it have on their chances of long-term employment and advancing their careers.</p> <p>  I will be extremely honest, and my comments are not personal.  How people are treated in employment is something very close to my heart.  To the best of my knowledge, and I know people who work in social farming, it is not a paid role.  I am interested to hear more from the witnesses about how we could make it a paid role.  How can we get support so that disabled people working on farms would be able to be supported financially?  Ireland has the lowest rate of employment for disabled people in the EU.  How can schemes such as those of the witnesses bring about systematic change for people with all types of impairment and disability?  My questions are very general.  I am really here to find out more about unpaid labour on farms.</p></speech>

There is a long history in Ireland, and we speak about that history, of people being taken advantage of.  In the past, people in mental hospitals worked for free on the farms.  People were sent out to work on farms.  There were more recent episodes in sheltered workshops where people did not have redundancy rights or get the minimum wage.  There is a very clear distinction between support and employment.  We are very clear in social farming that it is a support placement.  We have turned some placements into paid employment.  The relationship changes immediately on that happening because people get all of the rights associated with employment, including the right to be paid the minimum wage and redundancy rights.  We have a clear line.</p> <p>  There are people who have started work on some farms but other farms look for people for unpaid work.  This is why we have a very clear process of informing farmers and participants what is involved.  These farmers provide support to people who are very distant in many cases.  The progression from social farming places to employment is at a low level at present.  Mr. McManus is one instance.  He started engaging with us in 2017 and started work at the beginning of this year.  We made several attempts to seek paid employment during that time.  Mr. McManus moved to employment during his placement.  People need an awful lot of support to move along this journey to employment.  Since the end of 2021 we have employed someone under the Pobal programme, which Mr. Le Roux spoke about.  He is solely focused on bringing people into employment and is working with a cohort of people we have on the books in Leitrim and who are in social farming placements.  We also have two individual placement support workers on the mental health side in our company.</p><p>People require a level of support and time.  Investing in people is the best way of doing that consistently, not short-----</p></speech>

It is remarkable what the farm can do, but there is something badly wrong with our system when the farmers get paid instead of the people who are doing the jobs.  This is not an attack on Social Farming Ireland, and I thank its representatives for appearing before us, but people need to be aware of this.</p></speech>

I do not want to go into the issue of value for money or the outcomes for people in institutional care settings that have been in this country for a long time.  We have to innovate with people to give them choices in the supports that are valuable to them.  Regarding the difference between the value of what is done with and alongside people versus the cost of that, Mr. McManus could not access a disability service provider at the time he was referred to Social Farming Ireland.  He interacted with two farms.  He has said that that support helped him &ndash; we know that &ndash; to move into independence.  He learned to cook on one of those farms.  The farms are focused on producing food and the participants on the farm in question learned to cook their own food.</p> <p>  The farmer is not getting paid for having labour on the farm.  Rather, this is a support placement, which is very different.  These supports are provided in a natural environment on an ordinary-----</p></speech>

It has been an interesting discussion and I take on board the points that Senator Flynn made, but I want to place a value on the work that has been happening.  I know Val and Una Cross in Drumshree, Rathangan, who are wonderful ambassadors for the concept of social farming.  It was the first time I had heard of it.  As hosts, they have gained a great deal.  They have run open days and brought members of the community to their farm.  Similar to Mr. McManus, those who have participated have gained a great deal through empowerment, learning skills and being part of the community.</p> <p>  While Senator Flynn was asking questions, I was trying to think of my own experience.  I did social farming once in my early 20s.  It was in Israel on a kibbutz.  We were paid 1 shekel per week, or the equivalent of 50 pence, but what I learned and what I experienced over the few months I was there &ndash; obviously, it was a different situation &ndash; was phenomenal.  It empowered me in many different ways.</p> <p>  I was delighted when the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, made so much more money available for social farming within the seven counties.  That was important.  The model is important and could be applied across other sectors as a stepping stone to employment in a similar way to the Oireachtas Work Learning, OWL, system that we have in the Oireachtas, through which participants from KARE and WALK have the opportunity to be in a workplace.  They are not paid in a similar way to others, but more than 50% of them have gone on to full-time employment, three of them in Leinster House.</p> <p>  It was great to hear Mr. McManus&rsquo;s testimony and about how the skills he learned through social farming helped him to achieve his dream of living independently and doing so much for himself.  That is very important.  Perhaps he might tell us more about what he feels he gained from being on the social farm.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses from the Central Remedial Clinic, including Mr. Le Roux.  One of the issues that he mentioned was career guidance.  I could not agree more.  It is shocking that there is no career guidance in special schools.  It is wrong that we are effectively denying young people the opportunity to discuss what they would like to do when they leave school.  Mr. Le Roux also mentioned partnerships.  We must consider how to engender and support partnerships for the young people we serve.  He might comment on this.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a general question about the key changes that the witnesses feel are needed to increase participation in employment by people with disabilities.  What policy changes do we need to put in place?</p></speech>

Mr. Le Roux referred to it as well.  We collaborate with the families, advocates, service providers, the HSE, the Brothers of Charity, the National Learning Network, NLN, and farmers, but at the centre of it all are the participants themselves.  They are directing what happens within their placements and go where they want to.  We do not just place people on farms and leave them indefinitely.  There is a goal, and we measure whether it has been achieved and move people along.  There is value in all of the supports, elements and collaborators.  No service or system is all bad.  That is part of the innovation in delivering policy and change.  It would be great if someone wanted to rewrite the programmes and systems, but it is not possible to do, so people have to collaborate to bring about change.</p><p>That is the key.  Innovating is what we live to do in that field, as well as to use the assets there.  These farmers provide real value.  The distinction here is that it is not employment, though some are taking people on to employment.  Farming is under pressure and many farms we have are small scale and would not employ people anyway.  However, they can provide valuable support that is absent for many people in, particularly, rural communities, or those people have to get on a bus and travel for an hour to a service and come back in the evening.  They can access farms close by in the community and be included and seen as valuable members of the community.  There is real value in that.  As has been said, the people we have providing that support are in the community and have experience of the difficulties in various sectors.  Many families have people working in the services or have experience in the mental health or disability service from their family circumstances and can provide inclusion in that regard.  </p><p> The cost and value can be measured in any service, whether disability, mental health or other, and we believe in the cost-value of this service.  Part of the reason we are having this conversation on 1 June is to look at a cost-benefit analysis of the support provided on farms.  </p></speech>

We need the truth to be put on the table and the witnesses did that.  Listening to the speakers, the first thing that struck me and that has been mentioned a number of times concerns mental health and disabilities.  Supports seem to be practically non-existent for people, especially in the disabilities service, who need extra supports.  It was also mentioned that funding is legislated more in the Six Counties.  I remember in the previous D&aacute;il working with Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on disabilities.  Again, it is about information.  We learned there was a specialist centre in Middletown, County Armagh that covered the Thirty-two Counties and was funded by both Ireland's and England's education sectors.  Witnesses are talking about funding, and looking at it on an all-Ireland basis might be more beneficial.</p> <p>  I want to go back to some of the lads' testimonies.  It excites me when people are being given chances.  It is something I am passionate about.  A number of years ago a lady in my town started a summer school for people with autism or any kind of disability.  I think it started 27 years ago with about 30 people.  She has over 140 people per year for the summer camp and maybe 300 volunteers who come on board to assist these people.  The witnesses are right in saying we learn from one another.  It changed my children's lives because they stopped taking things for granted.</p> <p>  My biggest worry here is the gap relating the opportunity to get upskilled to gain employment.  On the downside of that, many people will be restricted when it comes to hours, so the ability to make a living wage becomes a problem.  If you go into part-time work, does that affect your social welfare payments or is there something we can do to offset that for people and make it more attractive?  Unfortunately, the way things work is that if you go into a CE scheme or something, the lads here will not get paid.  If they go into part-time work and get paid, do they lose some of their social welfare payments?  That does not encourage anybody.</p> <p>  I love what Mr. Coates said about being self-employed.  He grabbed the bull by the horns and said he would not take it anymore and would do it for himself.  That should be an inspiration to anybody.  If you are not happy with the way life is going, the only person who can change that is you.</p> <p>  The issue about employment and the property trap is significant, but the word "disability" is at the crux for me.  Witnesses mentioned the UNCRPD on rights and a rights-based approach.  It must be nine years ago that we did a streetscape in our town with the town council and brought in all the service users in the town, including people with disability.  That section of the streetscape won a European mobility award because everybody was listened to.  It is a two-way track here.  We have to listen to the witnesses and also to take on board how we can assist them.  If Mr. Le Roux, Mr. Smyth and Ms Doherty each had one wish that in three months' time, through legislation, something would change rapidly and be of huge benefit to everybody in the meeting, what would that be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.953" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willem Le Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051200002#F00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for that.  If there is one wish from me, it is for greater flexibility when it comes to people with disabilities.  When we started our programme four or five months ago, everybody came in on the first day saying they would only consider part-time positions, a full-time job was not for them at that point and they wanted to hold on to some of the allowances they received from the State.  There should be encouragement to dream a little bit more, to be more daring and not to be limited right from the set-off.  Flexibility and understanding are needed.</p> <p>  The partnerships we could have with employers are important.  Much more could be done in terms of the recruitment process where some existing practices could be adapted, including practical things like the interview process, how people advertise jobs or the job description, to be more understanding of what people with disabilities encounter in their lives when it comes to literacy issues.  Using plain language in advertisements is another example.  We could do practical things.  On our programme, we try to make people as adaptable as possible but there are limits to that.  There can be adaptability from the other side, that is, from employers and maybe even Government providers.  </p> <p>  Disability awareness training should be mandatory for most employers.  There should be somebody in a company or business with knowledge of working with people with disabilities.  I would love to see that being promoted.</p> <p>  I think social farming is an innovative service.  During the height of Covid we had to be very creative in our service delivery and do things differently.  Social farming has been going for a long time but it is innovative and creative.  That is what we need to connect with so I am a big supporter of that. </p> <p>  Partnerships would be a key change I would like to see.</p></speech>

For example, if you earn more than &euro;400 in one week, you lose your disability payments for two years.  That is a scary thing for someone with disabilities.</p> <p>  On what Mr. Le Roux said about partnerships, my hope is, once I get my business started, to come back to the CRC and offer partnerships.  I will be someone who is giving back to the course.</p><p>I do not know if that is good or bad, but it is just something I hope to do.</p></speech>

It is daunting to have something like that hanging over anybody&rsquo;s head.  the possibility of losing one&rsquo;s payments for two years because of trying to better oneself and contribute to society is very worrying.  We must look at this situation and look at it fast.</p></speech>

This is the situation for me.  It is then necessary to fight for your money and benefits.  I would like to see that changing.  When people have been getting money to live independently and to start their lives, it takes a long process to get back to where they were after the money is cut.  This is one point I am thinking of.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Cairns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.959" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051200002#G00600"><p>I thank everybody for coming in and for sharing their insights with us.  As Senator Flynn mentioned, Ireland is the country in the EU with the lowest employment rate for people with disabilities.  This is a disgrace and it is essential we address this situation by removing barriers and ensuring people, especially young people, can develop their skills and confidence to gain meaningful employment and independent living.  To help us make recommendations, we must understand the issues involved and this session has been helpful in that regard.</p> <p>  As a farmer and someone who grew up on a farm and then worked for a long time in disability support services, I am especially delighted to hear from the representatives of Social Farming Ireland today.  Agriculture can be an incredibly rewarding and empowering career, if people are supported in getting involved.</p> <p>  I have a few questions, and I will start with the witnesses from the Central Remedial Clinic.  Mr. Troy spoke about the challenges encountered in finding work and in the recruitment process.  Will he discuss the idea of having a campaign to change the way employers think about people with disabilities? Mr. Coates talked about his experience on a community employment, CE, scheme and how it was not beneficial.  It is such a pity to hear that.  Community employment schemes can be very positive for people.  Without going into specifics, I would love to hear what suggestions Mr. Coates might have regarding improvements that could be made to the scheme.  I ask Mr. Le Roux to share his insights into community employment schemes with us as well, if there is time.  Several measures and changes were referred to that could help to increase the rate of participation in employment among people with disabilities.  Are there any other changes and concrete measures this committee should know about?</p> <p>  The representatives from Social Farming Ireland have explained how the organisation helps people to be active, independent, valuable and visible.  Could they give us more of a sense of the importance of this experience as an empowering process for the participants and as a learning opportunity for the wider community?  I thank Mr. McManus for sharing his experience of working on a farm.  Will he tell us in more detail how that worked and how the work helped him to feel more confident and to learn new skills?  Also highlighted by the representatives of Social Farming Ireland was the importance of personalised budgets as a tool to allow people to make their own choices, supported by their own budgets.  Could that aspect be elaborated on some more in respect of the importance of such personalised budgets and how they facilitate a more equitable and accessible approach in social farming?  The point being made by Senator Flynn was this same point about financial independence.  We are all working towards the same goal.  It is good as well, and this was another of the points made by Senator Flynn, for all of us to challenge ourselves.  It is particularly important for us as members of this committee to challenge a potentially ableist view or culture.  This committee focuses on the rights of people with disabilities and the ratification of the UNCRPD, but as far as we are aware, none of the members of the committee has a disability him or herself.  Therefore, it is important we challenge ourselves in the context of these views.</p> <p>  The point being made in this regard is something Mr. Coates and Mr. Redmond touched on, as well as Deputy Buckley.  I refer to there being a rights-based approach and people having the right to employment and to financial independence.  It is not up to organisations like Social Farming Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland or any other group to act in this regard.  It is the State that must ensure people can exercise the rights they should have under the UNCRPD, and that they would have if we ratified the optional protocol.  Those rights will include the right to employment, to live independently and to financial independence.  It has been highlighted, in an inadvertent way, that this is something we need to push for more.  People should have the ability to realise those rights, but they do not now.  Mr. Coates and Mr. Redmond touched on this aspect as well.  When people try to seek more employment or more financial independence, then their payments are cut.  This is what must really be addressed to ensure people&rsquo;s rights to financial independence and employment are vindicated.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Coates to comment briefly on Deputy Cairns's contribution.</p></speech>

She spoke from the heart and I love that.  Regarding the community employment schemes, the problematic one for me was flexibility.  When I was working on that scheme, one staff member was doing everything and it took that person the full eight hours.  I can fully understand that part.  When it became the two of us working on the scheme, however, it was a much lighter workload.  Everything was done within six hours, including the final clean-up.  That left us basically twiddling our thumbs for two hours, which was tortuous for someone like me who has ADHD.</p> <p>  Another aspect I wish to mention concerns applying for jobs.  I have applied for jobs online in the past.  I know this is going to sound stupid, but the computer systems in some places will check CVs sent in online.  If any problem words are detected, such as "disability", for example, a rejection letter is automatically sent out to that applicant.  One rejection letter I got stated the company concerned did not have the supports to facilitate someone like me.  In my CV as well, however, I had also mentioned that I do not require any additional supports.  I do not need someone standing and looking over my shoulder.  That was a big red flag in respect of annoyance for me.</p></speech>

I went into one interview and the staff member looked at me and then asked what age I was.  I felt uncomfortable.  I think people in these positions should be doing the training we do for our course.  Managers should have their teams doing training courses to enable them to learn from us.  If we go for a job and we have anything wrong, then the staff in the company would be able to know that a person with a disability was coming in and there could be a means of support in place.  If we were to feel nervous or that something was wrong, then we would have someone to lean on.  I did one job for a day, and I felt so uncomfortable that I said I would not be back.  I got so nervous and I felt the appropriate supports were not in place.  I went back to my college and said that job was not for me.  Therefore, there should be people in companies with a background to allow them to provide support for people to lean on.</p></speech>

In some regards, it is true that people get more from the experience, but the problem is we lose the benefits.  This is not all about the money.  Also important are the additional benefits and entitlements in this regard.  I refer to a person with a disability going into full-time employment and losing his or her entitlements.  That is why I do not want full-time employment.  The problem lies in trying to find part-time work these days.  It is harder to do now more than ever.</p><p>In addition, if someone's family has illnesses and so on, that person has to look after them independently in addition to himself or herself.  The life change is more emotional for people when they are trying to find a job.  If they find a job, they do not know if the hours will be the best or the work environment will be suited to their needs and so on.</p></speech>

I would love to debate this all day.  Two words that come up probably every day in my job, in conversation or when I speak to my staff are "person centred".  Everything we do is person centred and in response to what a person actually needs.  When it comes to legislation, we are talking about personal budgets.  That enables people to make choices about the support they receive.  This is not just about social farming.  I totally support what Mr. Le Roux said about flexibility being key.  We have become too systemic and too rigid about our responses to people.  All of those things can be solved by people having access to their own budget and being able to make choices, with people who know them best and who support and advocate for people, supporting them to make good choices in their lives.  That comes with access to a budget.  We use that word every week and almost every day.</p> <p>  It is also about allowing and supporting businesses and communities to create opportunities for people and to value the people who are in their own communities.  Finding valued social roles is also very important in social farming because we see it a lot.  People grow and develop into various roles, not just employment, but often valued roles in their community.  Again, it is about that response to what the person wants.  If the person wants paid employment, he or she should be supported to pursue and achieve that, but those supports can be difficult to find.</p> <p>  Those working in the system need to be educated.  We get involved in talks with third level colleges in Ireland.  We go in, inform people about social farming and explain how we can deliver on policy and what they want to achieve in their careers for the people they are supporting.  Those are just some of the things we do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.969" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051200002#H00300"><p>To address Deputy Buckley's question, flexibility in the systems is one issue.  Personalised budgets certainly give people choice in advance of employment, but it also about flexibility in the systems, such as community employment, CE.  In the past, people could get their disability payment and CE payment together.  That ended with the crash.  Those kinds of things were there but have changed over time.</p> <p>  It is about focusing and investing in people and allowing flexibility.  All our lives change.  We need to front-load more investment for people with disabilities when they are in the education system and when they transition after school into training, further education and employment.  If we have a happy, fulfilled citizen for the vast majority of his or her life, and that individual may need more supports later in life, as we all will, that person becomes independent and an active, contributing citizen.  People with disabilities have rights.  The rights-based approach Deputy Cairns mentioned is absolutely the way to go, but a person cannot have a right unless there is flexibility in the budgets to make those choices to give an individual those rights.  That is what the system has been finding it difficult to do.</p> <p>  When innovation comes along, we have found we are up against it.  A lot of money, some &euro;80 million, is going into disability service provision but the cost and value of what that delivers is key.  We know when people get choice, they make good choices for themselves.  These are not always perfect choices but they make choices that are good for them.  We still do not have access to that in the way we should.  That flexibility relates to the systemic arrangements for social welfare payments, electronic data systems, and rehabilitative training, RT, placements.  People have no choice but to take the RT placement they are given, especially in rural areas where there is limited or maybe no provision.  When somebody gets a choice, that person is very innovative.  We believe in flexibility, both in the current systems and in innovation, and allowing people to come in to look at the real value of rights-based approaches, if there is proofing on the delivery for an individual and investing in people.</p> <p>  We have documented the empowering process that happens in social farming.  We have a number of these reports on our website that relate to the mental health service, people with disabilities and young people.  We can see and are reporting and researching how individuals change in the way they view life, the choices they will make and how the system can support them with innovation.  There is a significant empowering process when people are seen as citizens as opposed to different.  That is certainly happening on farms.</p></speech>

It is great to have them here.  They might be familiar with my surname because my brother, Matthew McGreehan, is a very proud social farmer.  Our family has been very committed to social farming for many years now.  I am a major advocate for it.  I heard Senator Flynn speak about dressing it up as unpaid labour, but social farming is so much more than the work done on a farm.  It is about inclusion into a family and community.  It is also a complementary therapy.  So much learning and education goes on in social farming, from learning to bake bread, growing your own food and interacting with people you might not know.  My brother spent yesterday at the agricultural show in Balmoral in the North with his social farmers.  He brought them up there for the day to show it to them.  To be included in that is, in itself, a learning experience and a therapy.  I am a major advocate for it.  As Ms Doherty said, it is about that personalised budget.  It is about people being able to say this is the social prescribing they want to do, that they do not want to be in a day centre today but out on the farm, that they do not want to sit but want to be an advocate for themselves, and that they want to be able to social prescribe and be on a farm today.  Maybe they want to be on a guided walk on another day or do art.  Social farming is about that concept of social prescribing and complementary therapy.  It is not about unpaid labour.  It is about so much more.</p> <p>  Following on from that, is there a further step we can take so it can be more like a CE or F&Aacute;S scheme?  Based on the experience of the witnesses, can we add that on so that people with disabilities are empowered and raised up?  We know that people come on.  I have seen them grow, not just people with disabilities but those suffering from drug addiction and mental health difficulties, when they work on the farm.  They grow, change, develop and become the people they are and want to be.  After personalised budgets and that right to choose, what is the next step we can take to advance towards that employment on a bigger farm?  Many of the social farmers are on smaller, family farms, which are pretty much on the edge of their seats when it comes to making ends meet.  How do we move it on to the next stage?</p></speech>

I farm on a social basis at the weekend to take myself back to reality.  I have two kids who would be on the farm morning, noon and night if they could, no matter what they are doing.  There is a significant benefit to be had from it and I have seen many people benefit.  Every member raised the disability allowance and the inflexibility of the scheme.  Everybody is trying to advance the system.  I have spoken with people from different services in the past couple of weeks and with the Department of Social Protection.  A rural social scheme was developed 20 years ago for people on low-income farms that did not receive farm assist so that they could get jobs with local development companies and with communities.  That did significant good for the women on the farms.  If a farmer had a low income, a member of the family could participate in the rural social scheme.  It transformed lives.  I could name people who had been working in the home who got out to work.  It transformed their lives.  The flexibility in that scheme allowed that to happen.</p><p> We need to develop a disability social scheme or some new mechanism.  We have had rigid systems for the past number of years.  We understand that systems will be rigid, but, in the end, many farmers and communities are wondering what has happened with the social farming model.  Mr. McManus's point about the benefit is powerful.  It has enormous potential.  We have to consider budgets and accessibility.  Flexibility was raised repeatedly by both us and the witnesses.  How do we ensure flexibility in the system?  One person involved in social farming and community development asked about looking at the rural social scheme.  That related to farming, but why can we not examine that scheme and tailor it for people with disabilities who can continue to work and derive both a therapeutic value and a sense of commitment to society from their work?</p><p> Deputy Murnane O'Connor has joined us.  We are under serious time constraints.</p></speech>

We know from more than ten years involved in the practice that it works.  As one of the 46 Irish Local Development Network companies, we implement the rural social scheme in County Leitrim.  We have 130 participants.  They are farm family members who access what is effectively a labour market intervention.  There are certainly opportunities to look at how people with disabilities could access a similar programme.  Some of the farmers who provide support could overlay that scheme.  We want to avoid segregation and differentiating people with disabilities.  They need to be part of everyday life and seen as just citizens who have particular needs.  They need to partake in the mainstream, rather than setting up separate schemes.</p> <p>  It is worth looking at how the farming asset can be unlocked to support people with disabilities.  We have shown what is achievable in the social farming that is happening across Ireland, funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a number of projects.  The Chairman referred to connecting people.  There is no doubt about a disconnection across all sectors of society between the natural environment and its rhythms, which can ground people.  There is a disconnection from food.  People increasingly do not realise where their food comes from.  Engaging in farm activity brings that back to basics.  When there is a breakdown in people's lives due to unemployment, disability, addiction, prison or whatever it may be, they can reconnect with people, the environment, the natural rhythms and the rhythms of getting up, getting out and engaging other people.  That is the value that any natural setting like farming can provide.</p> <p>  We would like conversations with the Department of Social Protection.  I recently contributed to a European network of employment services on social farming and what it means for employment services.  Community employment certainly has a place.  Many people on disability payments do not access community employment because they would lose their payment and they are not eligible for community employment.  Do we want to create a scheme just for people with disabilities and segregate them yet again?  I do not think so, if we want to take a rights-based approach.  Some people who have disabilities participate in the rural social scheme, but the main scheme they access is farm assist with a payment based on farm income.  There are eligibility issues.</p> <p>  We innovated with social farming and we are adding to and complementing that with the individual placement support programme, funded by Pobal.  These approaches can be modified.  We are doing in a rural setting what Mr. Le Roux is doing in an urban setting.  That provides experience with social farming.  It happens around the country.  We have an individual placement and support, IPS, worker working with 25 people this year.  It is just a one-year programme.  That kind of programme could be run out and linked properly to projects such as our own and others to support people like those here today to move to self-employment.  That is where flexibility comes in.  We designed the IPS programme with Mr. Mark Willis, who is in the post at the minute, based on our experience of supporting people with disabilities in County Leitrim and with social farming.  Our plan is to have 12 people with disabilities employed in Leitrim who were not employed this time last year.  That kind of collaboration and innovation will be key.  The same can happen with the rural social scheme, the T&uacute;s programme and others that we implement as local development companies around the country.</p></speech>

When one thinks of autism, one always thinks of people we see in the news who are termed as "high-functioning autistics".  I cannot think of the appropriate term.  They are more mute than vocal.</p><p>It would be handy if one could get employers to meet the person so that they can see that this person is not like the character from a very famous film involving a person with autism, and actually more like a real person with whom they could actually work.</p></speech>

Let us get them to start thinking about their careers at a very early age.  I was involved in a pilot project where we worked with 14-year-olds.  One can see results very quickly when one gets people thinking about careers at an early stage rather than leaving that consideration until the age of 20 or 25.  I think we can do better there.</p> <p>  Our programme is funded until the end of the year and it would be lovely to see continuation of some of the work we have done there.</p></speech>

Many of the placements that we do onto farms never work on the farm.  Others get involved in the activities and that includes work activities, but such activities are part of the process of supporting them as opposed to working and being productive in that regard.  It is about the support that this provides.  For instance, we have a number of people who are transitioning out from a disability service in the north west under the decongregation plan.  Part of the process was that these people would go to the farm before leaving the institutional setting, during the process of moving into their own homes, and after.  Most people had spent a generation in that congregated setting.  They were on the farm for a period of time.  Some of the people have issues with sight difficulties and most are in wheelchairs.  They had a really good experience, including the smells they had not encountered for many years.  The smells on a farm are very important; it is a sensory experience.  They were involved in a variety of activities but they were not working on the farm.  There was no question of them being taken advantage of.  I want to clarify that this is not a work scheme.  People are not working on farms.  They are there and engage in the activities on a working farm, including going to the Balmoral show and attending vintage events.  There is a multitude of things that happen.  I just wanted to clarify that.</p></speech>

If joining on Teams, I ask members to mute their microphones when not speaking and use the raise-hand function to indicate.  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, all members, visitors and witnesses are encouraged to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus and when they are in close proximity to one another, and to adhere to public health advice.  I welcome our witnesses, Ms Emer Neville, president, and Ms Saoirse Exton, equality officer, Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, who are here with us in person.  I also welcome Mr. David Byrne, Technological University, TU, Dublin, who is joining us via Teams.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  We are delighted to have the Irish Second-Level Students Union and Mr. Byrne from TU Dublin with us.  We are dealing today with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality related to norms and stereotypes and education.  Those are recommendations 26 to 31.  We have already engaged with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and other stakeholders from the third level sector, including the Union of Students in Ireland.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to speak about norms and stereotypes in education at primary and second level, especially to speak about secondary level with the ISSU.</p> <p>  We in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality have taken the view that the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly are a blueprint for achieving greater gender equality in Ireland.  Our mission is to create a mechanism for the implementation of those recommendations and our focus is on how to practically implement them.  We will propose, at the end of our term this December, to present a report or essentially an action plan to Government on how to implement the recommendations.  That is the background to our work.  We are very grateful to the witnesses for engaging with us and providing us with opening submissions and for coming in with us today.  I call on Ms Neville to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

As the national representative body for school students of Ireland, one of the core elements of our work is ensuring that students remain core stakeholders in the decisions that affect them.  We strive to represent, uplift and defend the voices of students in second-level education.  When given the opportunity to present on an issue, we are always willing to work to find the solution and it is in this spirit that I speak before the committee.</p> <p>  The ISSU welcomes the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality with regard to norms, stereotypes and education.  Recommendation 26 highlights the importance of a broad subject range that counters gender stereotyping.  School is often one of the very first places students see gender stereotypes, with expectations placed on young girls to study subjects such as home economics and, similarly, on young boys to study subjects such as woodwork or technology.  These stereotypes are exemplified by a lack of resourcing for schools.  It is rare that one would ever see a woodworking room in an all-girls school or a home economics kitchen in an all-boys school.  It is of the utmost importance that schools are given the resources they need to build these classrooms, source teachers and offer these subjects to their students to counter gender stereotypes.</p> <p>  Equally, as stated in recommendation 26(b) and recommendation 30, it is important that we resource schools to, "provide gender-neutral career information and advice from early second level education".  We need to think logically.  If a young woman is attending school and that school does not offer woodwork, technology or engineering, she is significantly less likely to explore those career paths.  They are not available to her now.  Why could they be available to her in the future?  We need to broaden our own mindsets, curriculum and teaching to show students that their opportunities are endless and that they do not need to be confined to what society deems a traditionally masculine or feminine career.  We need to show them that a young man can be a nurse, a young woman can be an engineer and a young non-binary student can be a teacher.  The issues of gender stereotyping in subject choice and career information go hand in hand and the solution for them both begins with education.  It begins in the classroom.</p> <p>  The ISSU especially welcomes recommendation 27, which encourages curriculum review with an emphasis on "gender equality and diversity".  I am sure it is no surprise when I say that our relationships and sexuality education, RSE, curriculum is outdated.  It simply does not reflect the world in which we live.  It does not support, educate or protect our students.  It focuses more on biology than consent - a subject from which we cannot shy away.  In a recent survey conducted by the ISSU, one in three students stated that he or she had not received any form of RSE at senior cycle.  The survey also showed that regardless of whether students received partial or complete RSE, students attending all-boys schools generally felt that their RSE was more comprehensive than those attending all-girls schools.  Our education system has a responsibility to educate young women, men and non-binary people about gender power dynamics, consent and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p> <p>  It has a responsibility to inform our students about the reality of being an Irish person.  Stark statistics from Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Rape Crisis Network show us what that reality is.  One in five young women in Ireland has been subjected to intimate relationship abuse and some 51% of young women affected experienced this abuse under the age of 18.  When surveyed over a one-year period, 80% of adolescents disclosed being subjected to some form of sexual harassment.  Some 47% of adolescents did not know how to report sexual harassment within their school and 247 women have died violently in Ireland between 1996 and 2022.</p><p>Initiatives such as the bystander intervention programme at University College Cork and active consent at NUI Galway are doing tremendous work; they are taking the lead in educating young people at third level and even creating pilots at second level.  There is still a long way to go, however.  There is nothing mainstream, and there needs to be.  We must embed gender power dynamics, consent and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, both online and offline, in our curriculum.  Every day, women are abused, whether it is emotionally, physically or sexually, LGBTQ+ students are harassed and young men are forced to suppress themselves, resulting in outrageously high suicide rates.  Why?  Because of their gender.</p><p> The ISSU believes that while these cannot be the final destination, they are a fantastic starting point to tackling these issues.  Gender inequality is systemic: to truly address it we need an approach that involves the entire sector, that is intersectional and that devotes itself to not just raising awareness or making promises, but taking real, tangible action.</p><p> I again thank the committee for this opportunity.  I am more than happy to elaborate on any of the points I have made.  I look forward to answering any questions alongside my colleague from the ISSU, Ms Saoirse Exton.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.994" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051200002#F00300"><p>I bid the committee members and my colleagues from the ISSU a good morning.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to participate in today's meeting and to be involved in the discourse regarding the Citizens Assembly's recommendations regarding gender equality in Ireland.  I would also like to offer the apologies of my colleague, Dr Aiden Carthy, who is unable to attend today due to prior commitments.</p> <p>  By way of a brief introduction, I believe it would be helpful to start by outlining the context that informed our thoughts and reflections regarding the Assembly's recommendations.  My colleague, Dr. Carthy, is a psychology lecturer with more than 20 years' experience at TU Dublin-Blanchardstown Campus, formerly the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown.  He is also pursuing a research agenda focusing on applied education and is currently leading a number of research projects examining the implications of emotional intelligence, EI, in an educational setting.</p> <p>  I am a research scholar conducting doctoral research at TU Dublin under the supervision of Dr. Carthy.  The aim of my research is to examine the attitudes and opinions of post-primary educators regarding the promotion of students' social and emotional well-being.  I am also currently involved in research being conducted at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, where I am examining psychometric models of depression.  Our reflections regarding the assembly's recommendations arose predominantly out of my doctoral research and are informed by considerations for student, and indeed, educator well-being.  It should be noted that this research was conducted at post-primary level and so our reflections should be considered in this particular context.</p> <p>  I will begin with recommendation 28.  We strongly support the recommendation to provide appropriate initial education and continuing professional development, CPD, including specific gender-related modules, to educators at all levels.  As many as one third of post-primary teachers delivering the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, within which relationships and sexuality education, RSE, resides, have received no training in this curriculum or related pedagogies.  Worryingly, it is also apparent that SPHE may sometimes be assigned to a teacher based on their balance of available teaching hours, as opposed to their expertise in the subject.  Although it is arguably the keystone subject in the well-being curriculum, SPHE currently does not appear to be recognised on the Teaching Council's registration for curriculum subject requirements, which outlines the requisite skills and accreditation to deliver each subject of the post-primary curriculum.  We propose, therefore, that appropriate subject requirements be established for SPHE, which prospective teachers would be required to meet in order to register with the Teaching Council to deliver this subject.  This would oblige all consecutive and concurrent teacher-education programmes to offer a learning pathway that would lead to an accredited qualification to teach SPHE.  Appropriate CPD should also be developed in order to afford accreditation to current teachers.  The introduction of an accredited SPHE learning pathway would potentially reduce the propensity for untrained teachers to deliver lessons in sensitive topics such as sex and sexuality, consent and sexual or gender-based violence.  Emphasising pre-service training would also help to circumvent documented barriers to teacher uptake of CPD, such as work-related time constraints.</p> <p>  More broadly, we suggest that the implementation of recommendation 28, which determines that a base-level gender knowledge and gender-sensitive teaching methods skill set be mandatory for all educators in order to register with the Teaching Council, regardless of their chosen subject.  Again, we would emphasise pre-service training, with equivalent CPD developed for current teachers.  This training could take the form of a mandatory gender in teaching module, which could be offered on all consecutive and concurrent teacher-education programmes and could encompass indicated areas of concern, such as theories of gender, gendered student-teacher relationship styles and gender-sensitive teaching methods.  Mandating a requisite base-level knowledge and skill set for all teachers would be advantageous in addressing known concerns among teachers that may implicitly reinforce undesirable gender norms or stereotypes and achieving a reality whereby all educators would be confident, capable and comfortable in addressing the day-to-day needs of their students.</p> <p>  There is evidence which that recommendations 26, 27 and 28 and many of the issues discussed in chapter 8 might be best addressed in a co-educational setting.  For example, recommendation 26a would arguably be best actioned in a co-educational setting, where gender-typing of curriculum subjects can be less likely to occur.  With regard to recommendation 27b, again it is arguable that these important issues would be best addressed in gender-inclusive environments, including LGBTQI and non-binary identities, where students can learn of and from one another.  In the context of recommendation 28a, the cessation of single-sex schooling would allow for these gender-sensitive teaching methods and pedagogies to be developed specifically for a classroom environment that encompasses all gender identities.  Perhaps more pertinently, the societal implications of these recommendations can be highlighted when considering the assertion of educationalist, John Dewey, who proposed that school is a microcosm of the society in which it exists and which it serves.  With this assertion, it stands to reason that these recommendations should be considered in light of an examination of how well our schools reflect our society.  While Ireland has unusually high numbers of students in single-sex schools when compared with the international community - at 17% and 30% at primary and post-primary level, respectively - sex-segregation ends at post-primary level.  There are no single-sex third level institutes and no single-sex places of work.  There appears to be no analogue in our society that replicates the single-sex context that can be found at primary and post-primary level.  Therefore, in line with the Bill put forward by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in of the Labour Party, we recommend that the committee consider promoting what we argue is the most appropriate context within which to address gender norms and stereotypes by moving to end single-sex schooling.</p> <p>  The recommendations being considered by the committee have the potential to be highly conducive to the pursuit of sex and gender equality in Ireland.  Actioning and monitoring the outcome of some of these measures would precipitate a significant expenditure of effort and resources and would most likely lead to an increase in teacher workload.  Teachers have an extraordinarily difficult, and I would argue, underappreciated, role in our society.  It is imminently clear that they have a very full workload in terms of delivering the curriculum, let alone the accompanying administrative duties.  While the importance of monitoring and reporting on progress as we move towards gender equality is arguably self-evident, we would caution against over-burdening teachers with excessive administrative work and urge that any additional tasks rendered unto teachers as a result of the implementation of any of these recommendations be carefully considered and weighed against their already busy work day.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to have them here, and it is very important that they are here.  I have a couple of questions for them.  Many submissions are sent to various committees.  I do not tend to rank the ones that are most impressive, but that presented by Ms Neville and Ms Exton is up there.  What some groups take 14 pages to say, they have captured in fewer.  There is a real skill to that.  I thank them for the submission.</p> <p>  The bystander intervention programme was mentioned, as was the good work that is being done.  I agree that good work is being done at UCC.  From the perspective of the witnesses, in terms of how we embed the necessary changes, what do they see as being the most critical next steps for the students they represent?</p><p>The ISSU representatives spoke of raising awareness, making promises and taking real and tangible action.  What does that actually look like to them and those they represent?  What do they want to see as a tangible outcome over the next year or six or 18 months, whatever the case may be?  I congratulate them on the work they do.  I will take this opportunity to wish them the very best as they continue to do it and continue to strive forward in this area.  It is not an easy one.  I have huge admiration for their group.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Byrne a couple of questions.  Since he published the report in December 2020 containing the argument against sex segregation in post-primary schools, what engagement has he had with the Department of Education and the Teaching Council on that report?  The dominant approach around relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is very focused on the risks and dangers in relationships as opposed to the more positive aspects of relationships and, more important, relationship building and how people manage the challenges within that.  How does he see that being delivered in a school setting?  I will come back to the ISSU witnesses very briefly.  Have any of their members expressed an opinion on the changes they have seen over the past number of years in how RSE is currently being delivered?  I will leave it at that for the moment. </p></speech>

The ultimate goal is to get to a number where all students have received RSE and there is never a case where a student is not receiving a fully comprehensive RSE curriculum.  By "fully comprehensive", I mean an RSE curriculum where students are learning about consent, all forms of gender-based violence and sex education, not just heterosexuality but all the diversities in that, such as different identities and so on.  At present, from what we see, students are not receiving any RSE.  They are getting free classes in school or they are getting study classes and it is just being ignored at present.</p></speech>

There are other outcomes from my PhD research that I hope will lead to engagement.  The purpose of that first paper was, hopefully, to open a discourse regarding the question of single sex versus co-education.  I am very much open to engagement with the Department of Education, the Teaching Council, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, or anybody that is in any way involved in the decision-making process in that regard.</p> <p>  On the question regarding the delivery of RSE, quite a bit of research indicates the best method to deliver RSE is to be active and proactive.  Some of the recommendations that come from teachers, specifically, are the likes of role playing, music video assignments, video assignments, re-enactments and those kind of things.  Importantly, the structure of our classrooms needs to be considered.  A round table is the predominant structure that seems to be proposed as most conducive but, again, the point made by Ms Neville about free classes is a pertinent one.  It is very consistent in the literature that RSE is being avoided.  There is a major issue with teachers in respect of comfort in delivering RSE.  Again, it needs to begin with training.  Teachers need to be trained in how to deliver RSE in a practical and proactive manner. </p></speech>

It is good to see both of them again in a different context.  I thank them for their work in all the things they do in representing the ISSU as well as their climate justice work.  I also thank David.</p> <p>  A couple of things occurred to me.  One is that we recently had a report from the NCCA around leaving certificate reform, but much of that is ongoing work.  I would love to see how its representatives see the ISSU fitting in to that.  As David said, I very much see the education system as a microcosm of society.  It clearly is not at present.  For one thing, there is segregation based on gender in addition to the issue of the representation of different religions or those who do not practise religion.  It is probably based on fear.  Even if we look at the percentage for primary school versus secondary school, there is a narrowing at secondary school in some ways in that we are segregating people even more at that stage, as if there is some kind of fear around sex and putting people together at this crucial time in their lives.  However, that is where we learn about how to treat each other with respect and understand what consent really is.  It is the critical time to be together and understand each other.</p> <p>  I hope the witnesses do not mind I am using first names to put everybody on a level playing field.  They are more than welcome to do the same with me.  I very much take on board the point that we do not want to overload teachers with more and more.  I certainly heard a lot about that kind of pressure as the spokesperson for the Green Party on education.  We are talking about this, but also the need for mindfulness and the need for education around climate and so on, which is just adding more and more, but much of this is about culture.  I would love to understand the witnesses' thoughts around continuing professional development, CPD, courses as a way to build a relationship between the different generations, how we treat each other in schools and how that flows on to life outside school.</p> <p>  Senator Warfield and I discussed previously how we have not heard very much coming from the Minister for Education around RSE.  I assure the witnesses we will have the Minister before the committee at some point, and officials and the NCCA.  Anything our guests have that they would like to share with us for us to pass on, we will certainly do that. </p></speech>

We are meeting with it today.  We hope to be heavily involved in the new design of the curriculum and to get some members onto the different boards and subcommittees of the NCCA so students are in the room when these curricula are being designed and the thought process is there.</p> <p>  In addition to that, we will be doing our own report on senior cycle that will cover RSE.

Part of that is because students have pretty much never been involved in the designing process.  The Senator talked about culture change.  One of the things we tend to forget, when there is so much emphasis on all of these things we need to add to the curriculum, is these should form the basis of the curriculum and everything else, all the other subjects and the exams, should be based around things such as welfare, consent and climate change.  It is an integral part of the education system and the fact we have neglected it perhaps shows this microcosm of society is quite reflective of reality.</p><p>That is an unfortunate one but it is probably true.</p></speech>

We can consciously focus on teaching RSE in terms of consent and raising awareness of gender- or sex-based violence, but many lessons will come within what is called the hidden curriculum.  It is all the things that are implicitly or tacitly learned in the school place.  That comes down to the culture of the school.  We should also be conscious of a proposed school culture or ethos, which may be very altruistic and aim to be inclusive and open, compared to culture as performed.</p> <p>  As much as we may want to have inclusive culture where we are diverse and open to steering boys towards caring professions or steering girls towards STEM professions, the reality may be that, subconsciously and unbeknownst to some teachers, they may inadvertently steer them towards their gender-type subjects.  It is very important to incorporate that into CPD and initial education to raise awareness of those implicit things.</p> <p>  The big thing from my perspective is also to involve students.  This is highlighted in the report by the NCCA on its review of the RSE curriculum.  Students seem to be unaware of what exactly they are supposed to be learning in RSE.  This is for them and their feedback on the RSE curriculum would be very much valued.</p></speech>

It is quite refreshing to have the ISSU statement in here.  That is the language I am more used to in everyday life.  It is good to see it on the record in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They are very welcome.  I was probably most expert about the curriculum and school when I was there.  When a student leaves school and as the years progress, the student gradually forgets.  It has been very powerful to observe the role of the ISSU during Covid and the pandemic and now on these issues and, as Senator O'Reilly said, on climate action.  The future is bright.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne has just touched on what I always come back to, which is the NCCA review and the responses of students.  I always read their responses into the record because they are the most important for me.  Students were unanimous about the importance of RSE.  They were conscious that while friends and the Internet are sources of information, piecing information together from these sources has shortcomings.  Students also showed real allyship with LGBT kids and their peers in schools in respect of the shortcomings of the curriculum in that regard. </p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, was here last week and I look forward to the Minister, Deputy Foley, coming in as well.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, talked about the parent as the primary educator.  That is fine but LGBT young people can be very good at hiding their identities and sexual orientations and passing as straight at times out of necessity rather than desire.  A parent can be the best primary educator in the world and not realise there is an LGBT kid in the house.  It is very important that the ISSU is fighting for LGBT kids and young people, including non-binary young people.  Has the ISSU had any engagement with the Minister for Education on these issues?</p> <p>  I then have a question for Mr. Byrne.  What are the blockages to an accredited social, personal and health education, SPHE, learning pathway for teachers?</p></speech>

The biggest issue going forward will likely be resources.  It would be quite an undertaking for an institute that is offering teacher training to develop a curriculum and resource lecturers.  It would take a little bit of research because one would want to it right and get students', teachers' and parents' perceptions of what needs to be taught, especially with RSE, because there are issues.  As has been pointed out by Ms Neville, there are significant issues, which are well-documented.  Resourcing the development of the curriculum at third level would be the big roadblock to trying to achieve an accreditation in SPHE.</p></speech>

What I can say is that half the battle is won, because it is widely recognised among students, teachers and parents that SPHE is a very important subject.  I can imagine there would be very little resistance to trying to achieve accreditation.  The only significant issue would be on the part of the third level institutes and their willingness to develop and expand their curriculum to give lecturing hours to the new subject.</p></speech>

I have a frustration.  I am a former chair of the Home Education Network and I home educated my kids for much of their lives.  I have a different perspective on education and I am a proponent of unschooling.  We tend to segregate.  People are experts in education within a system that exists but an awful lot of the education, education that we also receive as adults, is happening outside of the classroom.  There is a fear attached to that because people are getting their information from sources that are uncontrolled.  It is also important that we look at our place as a society and a State in how we inform the education and learning environments outside of school.</p><p>Maybe this is too broad a question, but do they have anything that they could add to these recommendations that would be about education outside of school and how that could support young people and support us as adults in terms of getting to that same place around culture, consent and how we respect each other?  I suppose that is my main question.  It is broad but I wanted it to be on the record of any recommendations that we look at education outside of the school system as well.</p></speech>

What happens in many classrooms is teachers will recommend websites and such like.  That is definitely something that could be used to assist education outside the classroom because it mitigates the fears of it being non-controlled if there are government-developed websites.  We recently did work with the HSE crisis pregnancy programme.  They are developing a website on RSE, etc.  We input into that work.  Such a website will be beneficial for students because if they are not getting their education in the classroom they can go home - it is a HSE-certified website - and get backed-up information about the various topics that are on it.</p> <p>  There is also Active Consent.  They have a website.  I am not entirely sure what it is called.  It is another website that students can use, which is certified.  It has real and good information that would be beneficial to them.  It is something that teachers can point their students in the direction of.  If it is a topic they are not comfortable teaching, if they do not have the knowledge to teach that topic and they feel it would be better coming from that website, they allow students.  It is also something parents can point their children towards if they themselves do not know either.</p></speech>

Many of the resources have been created because there is this inaccessibility in terms of changing the curriculum.  There is already so much out there.  There are all of these experiences and there are programmes, such as Active Consent or Any Time of the Month, which is about periods.  It is really important, in addition to government resources, to compile some form of database that has these resources.  Many of them are free as well, which is brilliant.</p> <p>  The key is getting them into schools.  Many government resources are not used in school, in my experience, because they might be inaccessible in terms of language.  It can be quite difficult for a student to go out and do his or her own research unless that student is someone like us who is heavily involved.  There is a need for accessible websites in terms of language, that the Government makes, tied in with the existing amazing amount of resources that are out there.</p></speech>

I will go back to the point about the parent being the primary teacher or carer.  That is an important point.  I agree with it, but there seems to be a shift as we are putting ever more responsibility onto teachers to educate young people about everything.  We seem to be forgetting that responsibility and that relationship between the teacher and the parent.  There is an ecology of learning in that regard.  The parent is at the centre of it and the school is the next ring out.  In the school linking up with parents and raising awareness of these kind of issues with parents and helping parents to understand some of these difficult issues, some parents will obviously struggle to have conversations around sex, sexuality and gender with their children.  Raising awareness and helping out as much as we can would be a positive step forward because the burden cannot be on teachers alone.  We need to spread it as widely as we can.</p></speech>

I like the phrase "ecology of learning."</p> <p>  The other point, which was brought up at the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, was the responsibility of the media when it comes to leaving certificate around the mental health of young people and maybe to have a moratorium on discussion of a topic for a period before the exams so as not to exacerbate that mental health problem.  Is there something in the media around responsibility, around norms as well, and gender norms and health, because that is where many parents get their information?</p></speech>

Instagram is where I get much of my information from on issues such as consent and period products.  Social media is a tool.  Obviously, it can be harmful.  It is intensely powerful and we must recognise that, "With this power," to quote Spiderman, "comes great responsibility."</p> <p>  I am not sure about a moratorium purely because, as someone who is quite passionate about a variety of issues, regardless of whether I engage with media, it is still something that is constantly in my mind and I am sure that is the same for many young people.  In terms of media such as television shows, movies and providers such as Netflix that young people engage with so much, but also in terms of the actual media, it is important that there are messages of body positivity and that there are messages destigmatising issues such as sex education and periods, thereby using these words that should be normalised and destigmatising everything.  Media has this incredible power and potential.  At present perhaps that potential is not being used in the best way.  Unfortunately, it can be destructive to mental health.</p></speech>

We heard from the third level sector.  This is something that it has recognised as a serious issue, particularly around gender stereotyping.  From the work that they do and from their perspective, how many students are taking additional classes outside of the school setting because where they go to school does not have the resources or does not provide the courses or the subject that they want to do to pursue in third level?  Would they give us an idea of the prevalence of this in their experience?  For example, how many females want to engineering or woodwork, or <i>vice versa</i>in a traditionally female dominated area?  Are there young men or non-binary students similarly affected?  From their perspective, and seeing learners continue on through the education spectrum, what impact is this having on people positively engaging with lifelong learning?</p></speech>

It is an incredibly high number - far too high a number - because they are not getting those options in school.  Speaking from my own experience, out of my class of approximately 20, at least ten were studying other subjects, such as music, elsewhere because the school did not have the resources to offer them.</p><p>Particularly when progressing to third level, if a student cannot access a subject in their school but they decide to study it at third level, they are at a massive disadvantage.  For example, engineering is a subject offered in most boys&rsquo; schools, but if a student from a girls&rsquo; school decides to study it, they are at a disadvantage compared to the boys who have progressed on from the boys&rsquo; school.  The girls are missing out on the foundation course.  We see high dropout rates and things like that because of issues such as this.  Again, in the single-sex schools, if the only subjects they are offering in a boys&rsquo; school, for example, are woodwork, engineering, technology and stuff like that, they will not progress towards options such as caring, music or anything like that because they are not seeing it.</p></speech>

It comes back to representation again.  If you are not seeing yourself in that position and cannot picture it, then it is not accessible to you.  If careers teachers in boys' schools do not have modules on caring, nursing, music and so on, the boys will not even think of doing that.  They will think, for example, that they are decent at maths so they might go on and get a maths degree and become a teacher or they will perhaps think that since they made it through the first year of engineering in senior cycle, they will just study engineering.  The only career options they are getting are what is being presented to them by their schools.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy said, they are being pigeonholed into those careers.</p></speech>

In terms of those who take additional courses outside of school to then progress onto third level, do our guests have any feedback as to what that actually looks like in terms of their lived day?  If there are individuals who are non-binary or their gender is very under-represented in the third level institute that they are going to, how comfortable are they to be there?</p></speech>

However, I know that it can be very difficult for non-binary students, specifically in mixed schools, but in single-sex schools as well, because there is such a gender divide.  We have things such as uniforms, bathrooms and changing facilities are that are cut along the gender divide.  Even newer buildings often do not have gender-neutral facilities.  This can be very undermining for non-binary young people because they are forced to choose.  It is the sort of, &ldquo;Which bathroom do I go to?&rdquo; debate.  That is an integral part of people&rsquo;s identities.  It sounds small but it is vitally important.  Although I can only speak from the experiences of my colleagues and friends, I think it is very difficult to be someone who does not fit a gender binary in every Irish school because of the lack of education and lack of representation of genderqueer people and queer people in general, but also because the school building itself seems to fight against the existence of gender nonconforming people.  That is incredibly unfair.</p> <p>  On additional subjects, I am in fifth year and I do an extra subject outside of school.  I am in a mixed school, so it is not due to gender.</p></speech>

It is a long day.  I come home from school and I have an hour of extra class two days a week.  If you are doing a more mathematical subject such as engineering, that will be much more work.  There will be the project work and more work.  At the moment, we know there is a huge amount of pressure on second level students.  It is increasing every year, not just because of, as I mentioned before, this age of information where we have this constant barrage of crises being thrown in our faces, but also because I genuinely believe a lot of the exams and coursework we are doing do not have some of the key skills that you need when entering the world of work or the adult world.  I refer to skills such as communication skills, presentation skills, teamwork, team building and conflict resolution.  We are not getting these integral skills.  My mother is a teacher and she said that in her experience and from others she talked to, she is just not seeing these very important skills as people enter into third level because they are not taught.  I hope that answer&rsquo;s the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></speech>

I thank them very much for taking their time this morning to come and present to us.  They describe, with such passion, the difficulties that we experienced in our secondary school system and, probably to a lesser extent but it still relevant, in our primary school system, that have been going on for years.  We can talk about these issues and we recognise them.  We know the outputs and outcomes of those difficulties and yet, as legislators and Departments, it is only this year that we have finally put the ISSU on the NCCA.  I want to wish them every success in their placement there.  They should make their voices heard as loud and clear as they possibly can.</p><p>When it comes to choice, if I had a magic wand, I would change it so that every school would have both sexes and would be a gender-empowering environment, which we seem to have really struggled with the past number of years and that is a real pity.  However, it will come down to choice.  As Ms Exton said, if you go to a mixed school, you have the accessibility to the non-traditional female or male subjects.  In our school at home, a tiny number of girls are doing metalwork or woodwork.  However, the culture and environment in the class still has, according to my girls, toxic masculinity.  It is not conducive to learning for them to stay in that environment.  My two young ones at home who are doing junior certificate this year will not do woodwork or metalwork for the leaving certificate because they are both the only girls in their class.  It is not much fun or a nice environment.  Even though we need to recognise that we need to make classes available to all students, whether it is predominantly traditional female classes to males or <i>vice versa</i>, what will we do about the culture and environment that exists when we do make them available?</p><p>Also, I have a real concern that when we add new subjects, we will have to drop some, but which ones?  I heard teaching talking in the media only this morning about how they do not want to be overloaded by things constantly being added to their workload.  What traditional subject would the guests drop to try to empower and to make new and more subjects available?</p><p>On RSE, I do not even need to just take the guests&rsquo; word for it, because I have four young adults at home.  They come from a school that I think is quite progressive.  Yet, their accessibility to RSE has been hit-and-miss, depending on the year that they had it.  RSE should be embellished.  It is probably singularly the most important class and skill set that we need to teach our children for them to be able to navigate, as Ms Exton noted, this constant barrage of crises that the world of social media and information has opened them up to over the past five or ten years.  It is not being taken as treated as seriously or as comprehensively as it absolutely should be.  What directions should be given to the Department and the Minister for Education to show it is not just essential but is absolutely fundamental that we empower our young students with those tools that they should be getting but are not in RSE?  We absolutely must make it fundamental and mandatory and make sure that it is not just two classes that are substituted with study classes.  It should absolutely be far bigger than two classes.  The skills that we need and all of the negatives that arrive in society because of the lack of those teachings are evident in all of our women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s aid organisations.  In addition, it is evident in all the statistics Ms Neville mentioned earlier that our young people are reporting regarding sexual abuse, sexual harassments and all the negatives and nastiness in society.</p></speech>

Hopefully, however, through appropriate education with a societal component - because as the Senator said, it is cultural too - beginning in primary or even before, we need to teach boys to not be that way.  Addressing it in education would be a good start.  We need to teach them that there is another way of behaving.  It really is that simple and yet it is also extraordinarily complex.</p><p>It would be very difficult to break that mould because it is such an ingrained habit.</p><p> As regards training, making the training mandatory would be beneficial in two ways, as I mentioned.  First, we could ensure that people delivering the SPHE and RSE curriculums would be, at least, more comfortable delivering and speaking about sensitive topics because they would have had training.  At the moment, we find that many teachers have had no training or preparation; they just have free hours and are being slotted in to SPHE.  That is part of the trend of people attending to other matters or doing paperwork while students are doing their homework.  Training would be of significant benefit in terms of comfort.  It should be mandatory to be certified to deliver SPHE.  That should ensure that people who are not trained will not be allowed to deliver SPHE and only people who are able to deliver RSE will do so.  It is a significant issue.  I could not agree more.  That is one way we could gather around that problem.</p><p> We have already seen that RSE and SPHE are very much valued.  Teachers consider them to be important but when it comes to the crunch, they are very much devalued in comparison with the core curriculum.  When there are time constraints and there is a choice in respect of emphasising one or the other, teachers will usually emphasise the core curriculum.  Making it mandatory and having people who are dedicated to this curriculum will help to improve the value of the well-being curriculum, let us say, as compared with the core curriculum.</p></speech>

Toxic masculinity needs to be taught out of students.  It is a societal issue.  It is not just happening in schools.  It does make girls very uncomfortable.  I did woodwork for my junior certificate but I did not do it for the leaving certificate for the very reason that it was an uncomfortable environment.  That is only amplified for non-binary students and students who do not fit into certain boxes.  It is definitely something that even an RSE curriculum could possibly cover.  It is something that should be taught at home and at every level, from primary to third level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1050" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Exton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051200002#L00300"><p>There is a saying that people should not teach their daughters to put up with it; they should teach their sons to change.  That is evident from what everyone here is saying.  The fundamental way to combat harmful culture is education.  Education is the key to changing society.  It is really important that in every subject across every curriculum these ideas of intersectionality are reinforced and the ideas of toxic masculinity are destroyed.  As Senator Pauline O'Reilly stated, the school environment is crucial to the adults we eventually become.  Education is crucial to what society will be in future.  When we are at school, we are young voters and we are preparing to enter into the adult world.  All the education we receive will go towards creating active citizens and valuable members of society.  The fact that so much is neglected in the education system, including these things about toxic masculinity, is counterproductive to the development of our society.  It is really important that this is not just about making better and healthier young people; it is about making a better and more healthy environment and future education.</p></speech>

I am sorry for being late.  I was at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts so I missed some of what our guests have said but I have a list of the issues they have covered.  They referred to toxic masculinity.  There are probably a lot of people who do not know exactly what that means in terms of examples.  I do not wish to ask our guests about their personal experience but I ask them to give examples that other people could understand of what toxic masculinity might be.</p></speech>

It is the little sexist jokes that women belong in the kitchen or asking what you are doing in the classroom for a men's subject.  It is little things like that.  They are all typically attached to societal stigma, such as women typically being carers or nurses and things like that.  It is not just in a classroom setting.  It is things like men do not cry - they need to be hard men and act and look a certain way to be a man in Irish society.  If you are not playing Gaelic games, what are you?  You are nothing.  It is that idea that has been ingrained in young men that they should act and behave these ways in school.  Obviously, that makes everyone uncomfortable.  Teachers do not want to stop it because it is what they know but it also makes them uncomfortable to hear it.  There is a fine line.  Sometimes they might agree with the remarks, while at other times they do not know how to stop them.  As Ms Exton stated, it is education that will fix it.  In a classroom setting, it is typically jokes or comments, and sometimes even shoving people.  At times, it can get physical.  That is definitely a worst-case scenario but I have seen it happen.  Ms Exton may have a different view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1054" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Exton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051200002#L00700"><p>The key issue in the context of toxic masculinity is that once it begins in the classroom, it can develop into much more serious things in adulthood.  The thing with toxic masculinity is that because we live in a patriarchal society, it is widely acceptable.  Young men often learn from a young age that it is acceptable and they can get away with certain things.  That can be really harmful in every setting.  At the moment, the message is being sent out that this sort of behaviour is basically all right.  As I mentioned, that means it perpetuates over time.  It is important that the Government, but also teachers, parents, peers and everyone else, reinforce that there is certain behaviour that is just not acceptable.   Teachers need to be trained to recognise that behaviour from an early stage - before it gets violent or to the comments stage.  One of the ways to do that is to have gender-inclusive education, such as talking about menstruation in a class where there are people who do not have a womb.  I do not understand why a class would be split up based on gender.  It could be talking about consent in an intersectional way or talking about pleasure.  We never talk about pleasure in the RSE classroom.  I genuinely think that if we break down these sexual barriers, we will also break down gender barriers.  They are tied into one another.</p></speech>

I completely agree with our guests in respect of the teaching of consent.  It is not just to what one is not consenting, but also to what one is consenting.  I do not understand how consent can be taught without having a positive conversation about that and explaining what it is that one is consenting to so that it can be understood to what one is not consenting  I remember meeting a group about two years ago that was trying to bring that into the curriculum in different ways.  It was really different and advanced.  I had not seen anything like it before that.  When we get to that stage in the context of RSE I will be very pleased.</p> <p>  I note that the ISSU had an interaction with the Department in respect of the junior cycle RSE programme.  The Department is developing a new programme for the junior cycle.  As far as I can see, it has not begun work on the primary or senior cycles.  Did the ISSU get to contribute to the extensive consultation on the junior cycle RSE changes?</p></speech>

It may have taken place before Ms Exton and I were in office.  To my understanding, we have not been involved in work in respect of the senior cycle.  It is possible that the ISSU contributed to the work on the junior cycle.  I am not entirely sure whether it did.</p></speech>

I am not aware from my questioning of the Minister that the work has begun yet.</p><p>I would very much hope you would be involved in this and also that you would have a perspective on what would be taught in the primary cycle as well.</p><p> In relation to what Ms Neville said about menstruation, I spoke to a teacher of young girls who will become aware of menstruation in a few short years.  She is not allowed to teach them about tampons.  I just do not understand it.  She said this is because of the religious ethos in the school.  I do not understand that.  That is a matter of functionality.</p><p> Are there any other examples?  As late as last year, we highlighted examples of problems in the RSE curriculum in relation to homophobic material having been included and having been available.  Are there other specific examples like that, of which Ms Neville is aware, that she would like to highlight here today?</p></speech>

There is also the example, which is happening in all Irish schools, that same-sex material is not being included at all.  It is either not there or it is homophobic.  There is no in-between, unless your teacher is making the active decision to teach it themselves and going against it.</p></speech>

Ms Neville talked about toxic masculinity spilling over into outside the school.  Does this happen in different forms?  Does she that, whether this is on social media or in person?</p></speech>

For example, very often the boys in somebody's class will comment on the girl&rsquo;s Instagram post and will make jokes.  You have the option to share posts now.  This is a big problem because they are sending them to each other.  We also saw the issues of image-based sexual assault, where intimate pictures of women were shared into a Discord chat of thousands of men.  That is happening in Irish schools-----</p></speech>

I personally know girls who have had images shared among the boys in that classroom.  It is a big problem because the girls do not know how to report issues like that.  There are statistics from the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland that show that 47% of adolescents did not know how to report sexual harassment.  Therefore, they just do not do it.  That is why so many women were not surprised when the Discord servers came out, because it was happening in schools.  It is happening everywhere.</p> <p>  For example, teen discos are the worst things that ever happened to Irish society.  Young women and men are being assaulted at those.  Again, nobody knows how to report this.  I do not believe there is a set system, like there would be at third level education.  UCD recently launched one and so did UCC, but that does not exist at second level.  When things like this happen, bouncers are not trained to stop it.  They are not bystanders but they do not stop it.  This again brings it back to the importance of the UCC bystander intervention, because it is not there.  Adults do not even know how to stop situations like that.  I personally know tens of women who have been assaulted at teen discos on the same night.</p></speech>

The same happens to young men.  It is a systemic issue.  Harassment is normalised in second level education.  It all comes back to toxic masculinity, like Ms Exton said.  You need to stop it before it gets physical, because it is creating situations like this.</p></speech>

We dealt with the module on sexual- and gender-based violence already.  Clearly, this cuts into that.  I am conscious Senator Higgins wants to come in.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Exton and Ms Neville for sharing those insights with us.  As the mother of teen daughters, it is chilling to hear about and to know what is going on at school level.  There is a great deal, as Ms Neville said, of incidents of harassment and sharing of images without consent.  These are under the surface and not publicly visible.  It is a real worry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1069" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051200002#M01200"><p>I would begin by saying I am so sad to hear that last piece.  Ms Exton spoke about pleasure.  Dancing is one of the great pleasures in life that gives people a sense of their body and enjoying it.  For me, it was a really empowering thing to go dancing and raving when I was young, from when I about 15 or 16 years old.  It was really important to me because I got a sense of owning and enjoying my body.  It is really sad to hear the idea of that space not being managed properly and not being made a space that is enjoyable and empowering for young women.</p> <p>  We have talked about that culture, but I want to raise two issues.  The first of these is the co-educational piece and where the stereotypes that emerge.  This question is for Ms Neville, Ms Exton and Mr. Byrne.  What is the extent to which stereotypes build up when you do not have that kind of contact and you do not have that exposure?  I talked to somebody who, when they were young, remembered that there was a high wall that was oiled between the boys&rsquo; school and the girl&rsquo;s school.  There was a message that that sent to girls about boys and to boys about themselves.  It was extremely negative.  There is that idea of stereotypes that builds up and that overspills into a college environment in the messages that boys and girls are getting about each other.  One of the arguments that is often used against co-education is the argument that girls will not be heard in the classroom and that they will be silenced there.  It is an interesting issue, because I see that argument being used in the workplace, too.  There is the idea that girls need to be more confident and that they will not be confident enough.  Much research, as I understand it, shows that the issue is really the teachers.  Teachers give boys more attention and more opportunities to answer questions.  In fact, addressing that issue is not about separating people by gender.  It is about the way teachers make a point of ensuring there is that equal voice in the classroom.  Could the witnesses comment on how that issue could be addressed as part of this?  The excuse is often used that we need separate schools, because boys would be so distracted, and girls would lack confidence.  In fact, that can be addressed through a better classroom culture.</p> <p>  Excellent things have been said already in relation to the RSE curriculum.  The witnesses might comment on it.  This is an issue that Deputy Carroll MacNeill also highlighted.  We note that they are starting with the junior cycle and then they will do the senior cycle.  It strikes us that they really should be addressing the curriculum at every level now.  This is so that they start improving things at each level now, rather than beginning with junior cycle and then in a few years&rsquo; time starting to look at the senior cycle.  Do the witnesses have thoughts on that?</p> <p>  Within that issue, there is the importance of not just how we treat the biology and then the consent.  Within consent, there is that issue of respect.  It is not just a matter of how we treat each other.  It is not a kind of mechanical thing, but how we think about each other.  Is that a space where the witnesses feel that absorbed stereotypes, clich&eacute;s and secret assumptions could be addressed?</p> <p>  There is also the point of the wider curriculum.  While the RSE and gender sensitive education are important, often in the wider curriculum it can get dropped.  I am interested in this.  There is much work at the moment around the decolonisation of the curriculum at university level.  That is beginning to happen.</p> <p>  There are also women who are Travellers.  The witnesses will be aware that my colleagues and I sponsored the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  Clich&eacute;s and stereotypes come through about gender in the mainstream subjects.  Sometimes this happens in an intersectional way, for example, with clich&eacute;s about women in African countries, women of a particular religion and women who are Travellers.  We must address those layers of stereotypes in a mainstream curriculum.  Do the witnesses have thoughts on whether that is improving?  Are there areas where it strikes them that students are saying that it does not feel right?  </p> <p>  My last point is on the wider culture in schools, moving outside the classroom.  I spoke at one of the ISSU annual conferences.  I was struck by the motions the students were putting forward.  Even in religious schools, they wanted to have LGBT support spaces or support groups.  How important is it to empower students in their voice within schools so that all of those issues can get flagged?  We often have a very hierarchical version of that.</p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of cycling.  We know that incredibly low levels of girls cycle, and one of the reasons for that is school uniforms.  Another issue is how cycling gets treated and framed in relation to girls.  These are examples of the wider school environment, as the witnesses put it so well earlier, and how we can make that an empowering environment that gives people skills and confidence in their wider engagement with the world.</p></speech>

We will go first to Mr. Byrne.  Those first questions were around the research on co-educational schools.  That was a question I was going to ask, so I am delighted Senator Higgins raised it.  I have discussed it with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in many times in the context of his Bill to phase out single-sex schools.  The low number of what we strangely call &ldquo;mixed schools&rdquo; in Ireland is extraordinary, and Mr. Byrne has given the figures on this.</p><p>It is such an odd phrase that no other country uses.  I would be delighted to hear a response to that.  We will give Ms Neville and Ms Exton the last word if they wish to respond to Senator Higgins's broader comments about culture, decolonisation and other matters.</p></speech>

The point has already been made very well by my colleagues from the ISSU in that regard, including the available curricula and that kind of thing.</p> <p>  There is the question of the delivery of relationships and sexuality education, RSE, which must be connected across all levels of education.  It is a little slipshod currently and it would be very beneficial to have primary inform post-primary and that could in turn inform third level.  There was a very good point as well about the content of the training available.  An aspect that arose in my research was the kind of overlap between subjects such as social, personal and health education, SPHE, RSE and science.  The biology of reproduction, puberty and things like that would have been covered in those subjects.  The responses indicate students were kind of clocking out of RSE when it came to the biological stuff.  I agree there should be more of an emphasis on the softer, more tacit and difficult to address areas such as the stereotypes and that kind of thing.</p> <p>  Many of the points made about reviewing the wider curriculum are reflective of the hidden curriculum again.  Opening a textbook in English, a student is met with a kind of stereotypical representation of women, African people or the other examples that have been mentioned.  Again, that should precipitate a review.  There seems to have been a bit of progress in that regard but we are not quite there yet.</p> <p>  On the content of SPHE, students must be involved with developing the curriculum and identifying the areas that need to be addressed and that kind of thing.  One of the ways we could address that is to incorporate research into the curriculum and have students involved in what is called participatory action research.  Students can do the research themselves.  They can do a survey of how they are feeling about RSE at the beginning and end of the year to see if RSE has any impact on how they feel, including about the curriculum.  They can conduct research projects on what issues may arise from them inside and outside the school.  There are a host of different things we can do in that regard, but again it is about teaching teachers how to do this and supporting students in identifying these matters.</p> <p>  I agree the answer is not separation.  If there are boys and girls in the same class and the boys are dominating, we need to expect teachers to stay on top of it but we must also support them.  It can be exceptionally difficult and boys will be boys in that sense, I guess.  They will try to dominate the class and while we are still trying to educate them out of that trend, we must support teachers so they can manage the classroom in that regard.  That could be subsumed into training before service and through continuing professional development, I guess.</p></speech>

There is an emphasis around managing the classroom sometimes.  I was in a school that had just become co-educational and I was one of six or seven girls in a class of 35.  I am very pushy though.  There is the question of not just simply managing the classroom but having the responsibility to elicit and support all the voices in the classroom.  It is a very important message because the single argument I am told all the time is that girls will not be heard in a mixed classroom.  That is why it is a fundamental matter.</p> <p>  I do not believe this to be automatically true and this is not about a skill that must be managed.  It is the same for the workplace and we are told that women need to be more confident.  Instead, workplaces must value everybody's input in a very thoughtful way.</p></speech>

It is almost, by definition, we accept that boys will behave this way and girls will behave differently.  In a sense, boys are rewarded for dominating the classroom and girls are rewarded for being submissive.  There was an example earlier from Ms Neville of attending a woodwork class for junior cycle but not going back at senior cycle.  That is an absolutely awful lesson to learn and it is reinforced by the dynamic in the classroom.  There was no fault from the student in question but there is something really wrong with how the classroom is being managed when a student does not want to pursue a subject because of it.  It is a very serious matter that must be addressed.</p></speech>

Looking at our history curriculum, for example, it is all men.  There are approximately two women, and they are Rosa Parks and Countess Markievicz.  They were two amazing women but they were not the only two women in history across the world.  There are others, including Bernadette Devlin.  There are many really inspiring people about whom we should be learning but we are not.  It is a completely male-centred curriculum and it is the same across the board.  It is important we recognise it in the review of all these curricula.  There is a recommendation on encouraging curriculum review with an emphasis on gender equality and diversity, learning about more people of colour and LGBTQ Irish history.  We have such a wide history and we learn nothing about it.  It is really important this is all incorporated.  That will play a part in countering toxic masculinity because we will open to different views and diverse histories etc.  Not only would it stop toxic masculinity but it will help nurture a more diverse classroom and education, which is very important.</p> <p>  The curriculum and the school system is currently built against women.  We cannot even cycle to school because the board of management has control over what we wear.  No matter how much we appeal against that, the board can just turn around and just say "No".  It is not just a matter for women; it is also relevant for non-binary and trans students.  They are being forced into wearing these uniforms they either do not identify with or are just not comfortable wearing.  That was particularly evident this year, when we saw windows in classrooms being opened.  People were freezing and nothing could be done about it.  There must be some sort of legislation to stop that.</p> <p>  Uniforms should not be confined by gender.  If a young boy wants to wear a skirt to school, why should we stop that?  If a young woman wants to wear pants, who are we to control what they wear?  I understand the arguments for uniforms, but if we are going to keep the uniform system, we must ensure it is diverse and there are options.  It will make for a better environment for students to be in.  If I refer to the workplace again, one would not be forced to wear a skirt in a place of work and people have the option to wear pants.  If we really want the school system to prepare students for the workplace, we need to have all aspects of that covered, including the way students present themselves in school as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1081" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Exton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051200002#N01100"><p>It is very interesting because in every single other sector of society, discrimination is illegal, but it is not in school.  Why is the legislation different and why is there an exception purely because of ethos?  What does ethos have to do at all with what we wear?  It is an absolute atrocity what is happening with the uniform policies.  I spoke before about how uniforms are down two gendered lines.</p><p>When I began wearing trousers, I got an amount of stares from teachers and peers alike, looking at my legs, because I was not wearing a skirt.  In Limerick, we have ankle-length skirts, which in my school are bright red and absolutely beautiful.</p><p> In terms of decolonisation, my background is in climate activism so, obviously, that is everything for me.  The sole reason the climate crisis is a thing is because of this colonialist attitude where the white, cisgender, heterosexual male is the norm, is the default, and everything else is the other.  That is reinforced by the curriculum, as Ms Neville said.  In my junior certificate history book, there were three women pictured, and one of them was simply associated with Michael Collins, so there was nothing in the curriculum about her and it was just her image.  It is very frustrating to be a young woman and to see this, and to be an activist and to see there are so many narratives that are just taken away from us.</p><p> My mother is from Australia.  As a white Australian, obviously, the history of the people with my colour of skin is, unfortunately, one of intense violence and erasure.  I remember that in primary school we were told that indigenous Australians did not fight back, which is entirely incorrect.  It is incredibly frustrating to have these narratives that we are told and that are reinforced in every single subject.</p><p> It is really frustrating because in a country like Ireland, we have such a diverse history in recent years, but we also have such a rich culture in terms of language and mythology.  I have a big interest in mythology and I have been reading books on how, linguistically, we are connected to Europe and all of these places, which is really interesting, but we do not learn about any of this.  We learn about the European narrative, which is very unusual and strange to me considering we were colonised.  Why have we taken on this colonial attitude?  Why have we erased our own past in ignorance just to fit a narrative which has damaged our own culture?  It is incredibly detrimental because, in terms of climate change, people do not tend to have empathy for anyone else.  We see this incredible attitude towards Ukraine but it is not given towards other countries such as Palestine, for instance, that are undergoing an onslaught right now.</p><p> Everything comes back to the education system.  If we have an intersectional education system that takes everyone and everything into account, we will have an intersectional society that takes everyone and everything into account.</p></speech>

We are very grateful to them for coming in today and also for giving us the benefit of the submissions and the opening statements, and sharing with us their experiences, their insights and their expertise.  It is particularly powerful for all of us to hear from those who are currently in school and in education because, as Senator Warfield said, we can all forget, especially those of us who have been some time out of full-time education.  We are very grateful to Ms Exton and Ms Neville for coming here as representatives of the Irish Second-Level Students Union to share their insights with us.  We are also very grateful to Mr. Byrne and he can pass on our thanks to Dr. Aiden Carthy as well for sharing the insights from their research, which is very useful and will inform our deliberations as we proceed to finalise our action plan on how we implement these important recommendations.  The witnesses have given us some really good, creative and clear ideas and thoughts on that, which we greatly appreciate.</p> <p>  I will adjourn the meeting until 9.30 a.m. next Thursday, 19 May, when we will begin directly in public session and Senator Pauline O'Reilly will be in the Chair.</p></speech>

This is the usual format of direction on privilege which we  read out at the start of the meeting.  </p> <p>  I call now on Dr. Boylan to make his opening remarks, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1091" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051200002#A00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to attend the committee here today.</p> <p>  The Sisters of Charity&rsquo;s transfer to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings, SVH, required them to apply for Vatican permission under the mandatory Canon Law procedure in Canon 1291 for &ldquo;alienation&rdquo;.  Vatican permission was conditional on the Sisters observing certain specified canon laws.  The main objects of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s companies bind them to uphold the values and vision of Mother Mary Aikenhead and the directors and shareholders are committed to the values of Mother Mary Aikenhead.  It is not credible that these values include the provision of services such as elective abortion that are directly contradictory to Catholic teaching.  The concern about Catholic ethos is too acute to proceed unless and until there is full scrutiny of all correspondence between Ireland and Rome.  I have appended note E to the opening statement supplied for a schedule of documents.</p> <p>  The plan is contrary to the recommendations of the 2019 report of the independent review group established to examine the role of voluntary organisations in public healthcare that the State should own the land on which the hospital is built and if this is not possible that &ldquo;any capital investment by the State should only be provided subject to prior agreement on the services that will be delivered&rdquo;.</p> <p>  The Government should directly ask the new owners of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings why they cannot gift, as the Sisters of Charity said they would in 2017, or sell the land to the State.  Specifically, do the conditions set down by the Vatican preclude St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings from gifting or selling the land?  </p> <p>  Prior agreement on the services must include a specified list of procedures including but not limited to abortion according to the 2018 Act, elective sterilisation, assisted fertility and gender realignment surgery and any procedure that becomes legal in the future.  It is incorrect to suggest that the constitution of the national maternity hospital, NMH, would have to be revisited every time a new treatment or procedure becomes legally permissible.</p> <p>  The phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; is a major red flag.  Providing healthcare on the basis of this test removes autonomy from women and gives the sole decision-making capacity to doctors.  These words qualify access to services and enshrine justification for refusing legally permissible treatments.</p> <p>  I attach a letter sent on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, which is a perfect example of &ldquo;clinically required&rdquo; in action and that phrase is interchangeable in medical practice with "clinically appropriate" in denying patients legally permissible services.  In a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister of Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, it was stated, &ldquo;St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has carried out sterilisation procedures when it is clinically required to do so ..., but not for the exclusive purpose of sterilisation.&rdquo; </p> <p>  NMH clinicians who say terminations take place at St. Vincent&rsquo;s must confirm if those are under the terms of the 2018 Act or for clinical indication to save a patient&rsquo;s life. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly&rsquo;s response to the parliamentary question confirms that fewer than five such terminations occurred before October 2021 and that routine terminations do not happen at St. Vincent&rsquo;s.</p> <p>  The original plan to co-locate the NMH as an independent stand-alone hospital at Elm Park has been shredded.  The NMH would be one of four hospitals owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, SVHG, which in turn is wholly owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings. </p> <p>  On 29 May 2017, the chair of the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, insisted, after the Sisters had announced their intention to depart, that the move of NMH to the SVHG site will proceed only on the basis of existing agreements that give ownership and control of the new hospital to SVHG.  That intent has been achieved under the current proposals.</p> <p>  The existing National Maternity Hospital would cease to exist, but the mechanisms to do this have not yet commenced.  The NMH governors have not yet been asked to vote for the dissolution of the 1903 charter, nor the required Act of the Oireachtas passed.  NMH staff would be employed by an NMH designated activity company, DAC, whose board would have minority NMH representation and be subsidiary to SVHG.   The master would be relegated to one clinical director of four in the group.  SVHG would own 99 NMH DAC shares.  The Minister of the day would have one share.  The NMH would have none.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s would nominate one third of members of the NMH DAC board, as well as the chair of that board on a rotating basis every three out of nine years.</p><p>There would only be three national maternity hospital directors, one of whom would be the master, as opposed to reporting to the board.  For example, the CEO of the HSE is not a board member.  There is no security against a future conservative Minister for Health appointing three conservative State directors.  This is not independence.  I should add that I think the golden share is more of a liability than an asset.</p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s business case is undergoing review by the Department of Health as part of new rules to prevent a repeat of the huge overrun in the budget of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am reliably informed that the HSE is unable to put a final figure on the cost but believes it is rising by more than &euro;10 million every month.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s spending audit has not been completed.  Delays to the project have been caused by St. Vincent&rsquo;s withdrawing co-operation between 2014 and 2016, during which there were three mediation processes, of which the first two failed; delay in the Sisters of Charity completing the three stages of their alienation, that is, Canon Law application, civil law registration and HSE approval; and delay in producing the complicated legal documents which were released recently.  There is also a risk associated with committing a flagship hospital to a catchment area of south County Dublin and the east coast for 299 years when the demographic evidence shows higher birth numbers in north and west Dublin and the surrounding counties.</p><p> In the last few years, there has been impressive investment in Holles Street, with a new labour suite, new neonatal intensive care unit, operating theatres, emergency room, foetal medicine unit and upgrading of post-natal wards.  Patient satisfaction is at 95% and clinical outcomes are on a par with the best in the world.  The current proposals are flawed.  In view of deep public and political disquiet, more time is needed to get this project right.</p></speech>

I propose to look specifically at the network of papers released by the HSE approximately a week ago.  I will not deal with the larger question of value for money and whether the State ought to make transfers.  Rather, I would like to look at what would be the most positive outcome that could be obtained if the proposal, as currently put forward, were to go ahead.  I will also look at whether any suggestions could be made which would deliver the outcome which everybody has been at one in seeking, namely, a modern, high-end maternity, neonatal and obstetric hospital that will deliver the services to the women, children and patients for the next 299 years, the period we have to deal with.</p> <p>  I will first address a question that has been the focus of considerable attention, that is, the ownership of the new maternity hospital building.  I watched the discussions yesterday and the submissions on this matter.  Unfortunately, I did not see all of them.  One has to deal with clients as well.  By the end of those discussions, there was a fairly clear position that the State is going to have a leasehold interest in the building and that the first scheduled definition of the lease sets out that any buildings erected or to be erected thereon and together with all additions alterations and improvements from time to time thereto or thereon will belong to the landlord, that is, the property which will be transferred by way of a lease - the leasehold interest.  The HSE will have a leasehold interest but will never own it outright.  The lease includes covenants which control the use of the property and the national maternity hospital company's constitution provides for the landlord to nominate three of its directors.  This is a relationship between the leaseholder and the landlord, which is much more intimate and there is much more involvement by the landlord than one might see, for example, in a question of a ground rent or a similar situation.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to address is the question of what uses the HSE can put this hospital to and how they are defined.  The permitted use to which the HSE can put the new hospital is defined in the lease as follows: &ldquo;In relation to the National Maternity Hospital Area [we will return to that shortly] as a public hospital primarily for the provision of all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital, and a range of related health services in the community and any other public healthcare service or services".  This creates a two-step test for any permitted use of the hospital.  One should recognise that this is in the lease and therefore is a granting of a permission by the landlord to the tenant.  It is a restriction, rather than an instruction.  The restriction is that it can only be where the use is, first, clinically appropriate and, second, legally permissible.  The first of those two tests, I will argue, is both unnecessary and problematic.  It is perfectly correct to keep a legally permissible test and there is no ambiguity as to what that phrase means but unfortunately there is no definition of the phrase "clinically appropriate" within the lease to which one could turn to see what it is that was intended by the parties.  There is, therefore, an ambiguity created.</p> <p>  On RT&Eacute;'s "Prime Time" earlier this week, Holles Street hospital's legal adviser, Ms Murphy, said she was originally very pleased at the insertion of the phrase "clinically appropriate" into the agreement document and then said, "We did not foresee that this would be taken and flipped."  My argument is not for any one particular interpretation of the phrase "clinically appropriate".  My argument is that there are multiple interpretations possible and it is the fact that those multiple interpretations are possible that creates the problem.  This is an undefined term.  Once you have an undefined or ambiguous term, it becomes a source not of constructive ambiguity as we might imagine from the political world - we are all familiar with that idea from the Good Friday Agreement - but, rather, the reason that terms in legal documents are so tightly defined is to ensure absolute clarity between all the parties.  An area where there is an undefined term, the meaning of which is going to be discovered later, is an area where we can anticipate problems into the future between the parties.</p> <p>  Ambiguity results in unexpected, unwanted and sometimes even perverse-seeming interpretations being placed on disputed phrases.  The Minister has said this phrase was introduced at the request of the HSE.  It is my intention to be as constructive as possible throughout my submission and one of the things that I wish to say is that this is very good news.  Were the phrase to be introduced by the counter-party, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, it is possible there might be difficulties in removing it.  If the State realised this is going to cause a problem, it could cause a difficulty once you have constructed an agreement, where the other side has asked for something to be put in, it will cause difficulties if the counter-party asked for it to be taken out.  Here, however, I am proposing that the State should deal with the question of ambiguity that has inadvertently been introduced by the State's side.  There should, therefore, be no difficulty in removing it without damaging the deal.  I believe the State should do this.  If the phrase is not removed, it should be defined by way of a list of controversial procedures which are presented as "including but not limited to", that is to say, a non-exclusive and non-exhaustive list of potential procedures.  This allows for the evolution of medical technology and medical processes in the future.  It does not limit those processes but, at the same time, it distinctly and explicitly addresses all those areas where there may be concerns at the moment as to whether certain services will be available immediately and, perhaps much more importantly, in the future. </p> <p>  To address the constitution of the new national maternity hospital company, the new company which is going to run the fresh, new national maternity hospital sets out its principal object at section 3.1 of the constitution.  It states that the principal object for which the company is established is "the promotion of health, in particular by the provision of all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital, and a range of related health services in the community."  One can see that the constitution of the hospital has been drafted in such a way as to directly mirror the phraseology in the lease.  This means the company&rsquo;s officers are bound to perform only such activities that meet the two-step test, namely, clinically appropriate and legally permissible.</p> <p>  The Minister has a golden share where he can oblige directors to take action if they do not provide any and all legally permissible healthcare services.</p><p>The "golden share" clause in section 5 of the constitution does not require that they be both legally permissible and clinically appropriate.  The Minister's golden share clause only requires that they be legally permissible.  That is strong wording and a very valuable power to give to the Minister.  It really moves the deal forward from the previous test included in the Mulvey agreement.  Unfortunately, the Minister's golden share may only be exercised in compliance with the two-step test set out in the principal object.  The reason for this is that it forms part of the reserved powers of the national maternity hospital's constitution.  All of the reserved powers are explicitly stated to be "exclusively subsidiary and ancillary to the principal object".  </p><p> To step back from all of that, which is like trying to eat a bowl of spaghetti all in one go, what we have is a series of layers of duties that are to be performed by the hospital; a series of requirements the hospital must meet in performing its principal object, its purpose; and a series of restrictions put on the hospital's usage by the lease.  All of those restrictions include the test of clinical appropriateness and legal permissibility.  Because the Minister's golden share is subsidiary and ancillary to the principal object, which is to say that it can only be exercised within that two-step framework, it has been placed too far down the stacked hierarchy of rights and obligations to be able to overrule a challenge to action based on any future interpretation of the phrase "clinically appropriate" in the principal object clause of the new national maternity hospital company's constitution.  </p><p> I will deal with the matter of costs very briefly because, while it was the subject of discussion yesterday, I do not think it is the subject of controversy any more.  The rent is set at &euro;850,000 per year in the lease.  There is a rent review every ten years.  The rent is abated to &euro;10 if the tenant follows conditions on the use of the premises.  In the event the tenant does not follow the conditions placed upon the use of the premises, the abatement is lost and the rent returns to &euro;850,000 a year.  The tenant here will be the HSE and the new national maternity hospital.  Those conditions include a requirement that the tenant not use the premises for any purpose that does not meet the test of clinical appropriateness.  So, not only is there a principal object set out and a requirement in the permitted use clause of the lease that services must be clinically appropriate, but also built into the lease is a kind of penalty clause with regard to any activities that are not clinically appropriate, as interpreted by a future set of company directors.  </p><p> I should stress again that all of this is going to go on for 299 years.  That is the term of this hospital lease.  There is a requirement under the lease that a hospital, whether the initial building or any future buildings that replace it, will provide services of this sort for the next 299 years.  To give the committee a sense of what kind of scope that is, 299 years ago a Medici was being made a duke of Tuscany.  I thank Wikipedia for its knowledge.  That is a very long time ago and, given the enormous changes that have swept society just in Ireland in those 299 years, we can imagine that there will be even more sweeping changes over the next 299 years given the pace of technology.  Despite this, we must consider whether there is sufficient security and certainty in these documents to ensure delivery of the services of that maternity hospital in the manner intended for that very long period.  That means that the rules of the hospital, of the agreement and of the relationship between the hospital and the maternity hospital should be written down together and defined as tightly as possibly so that the agreement will not lead to ambiguity in the future.</p></speech>

I believe there is a fix available for the primary problem.  As was discussed yesterday, that primary problem is one of trust.  Certainty builds trust.  As regards the primary solutions that are available, the Minister acknowledged that for the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to gift or sell to the State the land upon which the hospital will be built is the optimum solution.  Until very recently, the owners of that land were bound by Vatican rules regarding the disposal of assets.  Those rules tied their hands.  The new owners are independent and not tied by those requirements and restrictions.  It presents a chance for a fresh start on that question that there is a new and completely independent owner of the site that is not bound by Canon Law.  It is worth returning to that question.</p> <p>  However, the key point that I want to stress is that, if the phrase "clinically appropriate" were to be deleted from the governing clauses of each of the documents and the descriptions of what may be provided for within the next 299 years, this would, in itself, provide enormous certainty.  It would mean that everything that is legally permissible would be allowed to be delivered in this hospital.  As the phrase "clinically appropriate" came from the State side, it appears that it is within the gift of the State to take that improving action.  I am conscious of the Chair's time.</p></speech>

I know it was at short notice but it was important for us to have an engagement with them.  I have been aware of the work of Dr. Boylan for many years and would like to acknowledge it.

In addition to that are the managers of the 19 maternity services around the country who have come together to support the proposal and the 52 clinicians who have also come out in favour of it.  What I am trying to understand is why Dr. Boylan is at variance with such a groundswell of medical opinion that this is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

In its proper sense, co-location is an excellent idea.  My problem is with the governance and ownership structure.  I have a serious problem with the failure to carry out due diligence with regard to what we will call the Vatican papers, the exchanges between the Vatican and Dublin with regard to the permission the Sisters of Charity got.  The doctors, midwives and so on at Holles Street hospital will not be working for that hospital any more.  They will be working for a private company that is a subsidiary of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which is owned by St. Vincent's Holdings.</p></speech>

For example, the Edmund Rice Schools Trust in education, the Mater Hospital in Dublin, the Mercy University Hospital in Cork and so on, have all divested themselves of direct religious ownership but they maintain a Catholic ethos.  They are quite open about it but we have not seen the Vatican papers, as I call them.  I made the point that the doctors will not be working for Holles Street as it is at present.  There will be a completely new corporate entity.  That entity will be owned by St. Vincent's Holdings company, the directors, or in other words the shareholders, of which have committed to uphold the values and vision of Mother Mary Aikenhead and the Religious Sisters of Charity.  We are being asked to believe those values include the provision of services such as abortion and the other services we talked about.</p></speech>

The only thing I have seen is the letter I appended to the papers, which is the reply from the Vatican that mentions permission being "for the reasons presented" in the application to the Vatican by the Sisters of Charity.  The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, which is the Vatican body that makes these decisions, studied the documentation submitted.  We have not seen that either.  It granted the request in conformity with the petition, which we have not seen.  It also said, "The provisions relating to the validity and lawfulness of alienations", that is, the transfer of church property found in several canon laws, "are to be observed."  In other words, there is Canon Law imposition on the validity of the transfer of the Sisters of Charity's property into St. Vincent's Holdings.  We have not seen any of those papers and we need to.</p></speech>

I would like to dwell for a moment on the consequences of this not going ahead.  Mr. Boylan has worked in this area all his life and dedicated his professional life to it.  Clearly, he is a believer in co-location.  If the Cabinet, for argument's sake, decided not to go ahead with this, I have no doubt he appreciates how many years the building of a new hospital will be set back.  What is his solution to this problem?</p></speech>

That is a good idea.  I have always supported that and have never been against it.  The solution is the Sisters of Charity and the new owners should - if the alienation has taken place according to Vatican stipulations - honour the commitment and gift the land to the people of Ireland or sell it to the State.  We now have new owners who are the shareholders of St. Vincent's Holdings.  They are three people and they can make that decision.  The solution to this lies with the St. Vincent's shareholders.  They are the ones who can solve this at the stroke of a pen.</p></speech>

We were told that, for their own reasons, which include the fact that St. Vincent's is a campus with a number of healthcare facilities on it, and corridors in the new hospital will be interlinked and so on, they did not believe it was practical to gift it.  It is not on the table.  It will not happen.  Since it is not happening, and the sisters are not prepared to gift or sell the land, and bearing those two dilemmas in mind, how then does Mr. Boylan propose we can proceed with this project?

The Sisters of Charity are concerned about the loss of their voluntary status if they gift the land to the State or if the State buys it, but Tallaght hospital is a voluntary hospital on land not owned by Tallaght but on State land.  That sort of arrangement is perfectly feasible.  As I said, at a stroke of a pen, it would sort everything out.</p></speech>

Everyone on this committee wants the State to buy the land.  The ideal scenario is it would be a freehold and in State ownership for eternity, but that is not an option.  I am trying to figure out from what Mr. Boylan is saying, with the two options of being able to purchase it and getting it as a gift off the table, how he proposes we can then proceed to building a hospital the women of Dublin and the women of Ireland badly need?</p></speech>

Until we have sight of the Vatican papers, we will have no clear idea.  It could be that St. Vincent's wants to hold on.  Hospital groups are quite common now around the world.  The Bon Secours, for example, have a large hospital group, which recently merged with the American counterpart.  They have billions of turnover and so on.  It may well be that St. Vincent's wants keep itself as a group.  I notice in the powers of the memorandum and articles and so on of the constitutions that it has the power to mortgage or merge with another like-minded charity.  If the Deputy takes the model, for example, of the Bon Secours, it is a charitable organisation that has merged with a charity from the United States.</p></speech>

We have to ask the hard questions of everybody - all witnesses - obviously.  The HSE legal team yesterday told us that the constitution of the parent company or owner companies - we have three different companies and constitutions, different boards, different directors and so on - was irrelevant because the directors of the new national maternity hospital designated activity company, DAC, are mandated to only follow the direction of their own constitution.  Would Mr. McGarr agree with that?</p></speech>

When a company has a landlord - in this case, the new hospital company will have a landlord, which will be St. Vincent's Healthcare Group - that landlord has certain powers under the lease.  Obviously, what the landlord's companies and constitutions say will be relevant for the ongoing operation of the hospital.  In addition, that landlord company, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, will have the right to nominate three of the directors of the new company.  They will, therefore, be taking those seats.  Although they will be operating under the constitution of the new national maternity hospital, they will have been appointed by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  In doing so, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's officials will have to be acting in accordance with its constitution.</p></speech>

One of the issues here that is causing some concern and is contentious is the term "clinically appropriate".  I will ask Dr. Boylan first.  Is that something in his mind, as a clinician, that is ambiguous?</p></speech>

It allows an interpretation of the law, if you like, in a particular circumstance.  The most egregious example of that was pre-repeal with Ms P, the well-known case of the woman who was brain-dead and the doctors interpreted that it was clinically inappropriate to turn off the life support machines to allow her, effectively, to complete her death because she happened to be pregnant.  That is one situation.  A woman could, say, present herself for a termination at less than 12 weeks, which she is perfectly entitled to make a decision about herself, and the doctor might say he does not think it is clinically appropriate.</p></speech>

That ambiguity is not only present, but it goes to the very core of the interpretation of these agreements and how this hospital will operate into the future.</p></speech>

That is their interpretation.  However, there is simply a difference of opinion and there are different views on what it means.</p> <p>  I will put this to Mr. McGarr.  The Minister told us he will give us a letter of comfort.  He will write to the health committee to give us his view of what that understanding will be.  The fact that it will be on the record of the Oireachtas means it will have some legal standing.

His company was a finalist in the category of personal injury-medical negligence law firm of the year and it specialises in medical negligence, personal injury, probate and employment law.</p> <p>  Dr. Boylan and I share many objectives.  He gave his very valuable time to the cross-party group that had concerns about this, of which I was a member.  I thank him for giving his valuable time.  We also share an interest in women's health and we were on the same side on the eighth amendment.  I share the sentiments the Minister expressed yesterday in relation to the history of the treatment of Irish women in health terms, not just by the church but also the State, over the past 100 years or so.  I have had concerns, as Dr. Boylan has, over the past year.  I have been following this matter closely and Dr. Boylan made his time available to us and to me, personally, and I am grateful for that too.</p> <p>  I will go through some of Dr. Boylan's statements and start with Mary Aikenhead and how St. Vincent's companies being obliged to uphold the values of other Mary Aikenhead organisations.  It is not to uphold the Catholic doctrine but the values of Mary Aikenhead, which are human dignity, compassion, justice, equality and advocacy.  Nobody can argue with any of those.</p><p>Poor Mary Aikenhead died in 1858.  The church's formal position on abortion was established about 15 years later.  I do not think Dr. Boylan can say it is not credible that she would envisage procedures such as termination or sterilisation.  I do not think that we can credibly attribute what Mary Aikenhead would have thought on this.  My view on that is as valid as Dr. Boylan's.  He said that it is not credible that these values, including the provision of services such as elective abortion, are directly contradictory to Catholic teaching.  The Vatican papers are like something out of "The Da Vinci Code".  What vehicle does Dr. Boylan see the Vatican using to impose Catholic doctrine on a State-owned and State-run hospital, which has a constitution that insists not only that these services should be available but also that they must be available?

The national maternity hospital, it would appear, is agreeable to including a list in the constitution of the hospital.  The former master, Dr. Declan Keane, said on the radio the other day that he would have no problem at all with the inclusion of the specific list as I outlined.  I think it can be taken that the national maternity hospital is agreeable to that.  We heard yesterday that the Minister was open to all suggestions.  That would remove a significant degree of concern that many women in the country have, as well as people like myself.</p></speech>

They have confirmed that.  They went as far as they could yesterday without breaching privacy and confidentiality.  Does Dr. Boylan accept that?</p></speech>

It is possible to give relevant details in order to convince people that they are doing terminations.  The ethical code of St. Vincent's Hospital is clearly Catholic.  It is or was run by the Sisters of Charity.  There is no question that the ethical code in St. Vincent's was Catholic, and we do not know if it still is because we have not seen any ethical code.  There is a lot of documentation that we have not seen.  I would like to see documentary evidence to back up statements that were made.  In particular the State, the public and the women of Ireland need to see what I term the Vatican papers.  Otherwise we cannot trust what has been said and what has been done.  Yesterday we heard about the lack of trust surrounding the treatment of women in this country.  Unfortunately we have learned the history of relations with the Vatican in terms of mental reservation, the way people were treated and so on.  I think we need to be careful without seeing the papers.</p></speech>

There is significant difference.  I have no qualms about saying I would have come to this with the same queries as Dr. Boylan.  I will return to where we began.  He talked about red flags.  I think a lot of those were answered yesterday.  On women and women's voices, it is vital that they are heard.  All we heard yesterday were women's voices, and powerful women's voices.  The last three or four masters of Holles Street - obviously, the current one is a man - disagree with Dr. Boylan.  Some 52 clinicians, of whom 18 are women, disagree as do the directors of midwifery in all 19 maternity units across the country, the senior midwives in the national maternity hospital.  These are very powerful strong voices.  What gives Dr. Boylan the belief that he has this right and everybody else has this wrong?</p></speech>

I will pick up on Deputy Lahart's last point that everyone is in favour of this.  Certain people are.  I have to correct Deputy Lahart about that.  A lot of people are not in favour of this because there are too many doubts about it.  There is a lack of certainty and a lack of clarity.  The Deputy mentioned the midwives' statement.  I thought it was quite extraordinary given that nine of the 19 hospitals in the country, where presumably these midwives work, do not provide a full range of women's healthcare.  I just wonder why they are not campaigning for services to be provided in their own hospitals.</p> <p>  The dual employment between Holles Street and St. Vincent's is something that a lot of people do not understand.</p><p>I read recently that 40% of consultants in Holles Street have a joint contract with St. Vincent's.  Dr. Boylan might confirm that.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is for what is known as admitting privileges.  If I am on the staff in Holles Street and I am looking after a woman in St. Vincent's for whatever reason, then I have the right to go to see her there and my liability exposure is protected.</p></speech>

There are existing strong links with St. Vincent's, so it cannot be regarded as totally objective.</p> <p>  An earlier speaker asked why the nuns will not sell the site, which is the key question.  They promised they would gift the site.  It makes sense that they would do so.  The Government says it wants to own it fully.  Why will the nuns not follow through on that promise?  There is some indication in the lease agreement of the reason they will not sell it.  Section 6.4 of the lease states that the landlord, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, will be able to mortgage or charge its freehold interest in the land, without notice, to the maternity hospital 20 years post construction.  It has to obtain written consent in the first 20 years.  The control and influence on the board will be significant in that regard.  It strikes me that this is essentially about land value and not so much the management of the campus.  Can Mr. McGarr estimate the additional land value the lease and the right to mortgage or charge what we are told is public property might add to St. Vincent's Holdings?</p></speech>

I wills say, however, that this is currently a site with some buildings upon it.  There is to be an overlap.  Some buildings currently on the site will be removed.  I know the Minister identified some of those, for example, dermatology.  Offices will be provided in the new building for the use of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.</p></speech>

We currently have a piece of land and the intention is to develop it to the value of between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion by building an additional facility on it.  According to the lease, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have a landlord interest not only in the land that is there, but also in that entire development value.</p></speech>

There was a row about that and there is a real danger of that happening again.</p> <p>  I return to the definition of "clinically appropriate".  The Minister said today that he has no difficulty in setting out that definition.  It is very odd that there is no definition in all of those legal documents, even though there are six pages of definitions in the lease agreement.  The Minister said he will set that out in a note to us.  What weight would that document have?  I know Mr. McGarr started to address that with Deputy Cullinane.  The Minister says his 100% guarantee would be sufficient.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

This will be an agreement.  It is an interpretation note by one party to the agreement.  That is helpful to clarify what one party thought, but it is not the same as saying that this is what the agreement is intended to mean by all parties.  If an agreement could be made by all the parties as to what that definition should be, that would be exceedingly helpful, and it would be even more helpful if it were put in the lease.  If all the parties are <i>ad idem</i>and in agreement about the definition, this document is the place to put it.</p></speech>

The hospital is linked up by corridors.  The theatres, in the design, are all on the same corridor.  The numbers of deliveries in maternity hospitals vary from time to time.  The numbers in Holles Street have gone down by 25% in recent years, while those in the Rotunda have gone up significantly.  The numbers in 2020 were as low as they were in 1994.  One could envisage a situation where there are empty rooms in the national maternity hospital and the theatres are not being used, say on a weekend when there are no routine gynaecological procedures.  What is predictable is that St. Vincent's is overflowing with people on trolleys in the emergency room and the corridors.  Adjoining that are empty rooms in the national maternity hospital.  Then there is the board structure.  There are three from St. Vincent's, as well as three ministerial appointees who will be under political pressure not to have overcrowding in St. Vincent's Hospital while there are empty rooms nearby in a hospital whose operating company is owned by St. Vincent's.  One can easily see how there would be seepage from St. Vincent's into the national maternity hospital space.  If that triggers the &euro;850,0000 per year or gives rise to conflict, the Minister is the person who will sort it out.  I do not think any Minister for Health would say "No" and that St. Vincent's Hospital was to be kept overcrowded to the stage of severe patient safety issues-----</p></speech>

Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, asked if this was a good model which the Minister would recommend.  It seemed that he was like "Yeah, this seems to be a great idea, a Minister having a golden share."  I am somewhat jokingly paraphrasing but he sort of said that this is a good model for a hospital and implied that it was a good model for other things.  Do the witnesses agree it is a good model for a healthcare setting or, from a legal perspective, for the State going forward in relation to capital investment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon McGarr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051200002#H00700"><p>The golden share model has been created to deal with the specific circumstances of this deal.  It was not in the original Mulvey plan and is one of the methods by which the State side has attempted to alleviate the concerns which were clear at the time the Mulvey report came out, when it was to be owned by the nuns.  It was through the holding company, but the nuns were the ultimate owners of the building and hospital.  The golden share was created to deal with that problem.  I do not see that problem arising in many other sets of circumstances.  I would be surprised if the same kind of solution was proposed for other HSE hospitals, for example.  The golden share is intended to be able to tell the directors to provide for legally permissible services.  That is what it says in section 5.3:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister... hold[s] a share referred to as the Golden Share... provide[s] legal protection to the inviolability of the Reserved Powers in the manner provided for in this Constitution, to ensure... the obligations of the Directors as contained in [the] Constitution are complied with and to ensure that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrics and/or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall be available in the New NMH.  </blockquote> <p>The Minister probably read out the same phrase yesterday.  It is a strong phrase to underpin the delivery of lawfully permitted services.  It is not qualified by saying &quot;lawfully permitted and clinically appropriate&quot;. It is unqualified.  Unfortunately, it is only in relation to the reserve powers and only goes so far as those powers are able to go.  The reserve powers are subject to that clinically appropriate and lawfully permissible test.  I am not advancing a particular interpretation as being accurate.  I am advancing the position, which I think has been self-evident over the past week, that it is ambiguous.  There are a number of interpretations that could be placed on it, depending on one's point of view.  That is in respect of now and of people with a shared set of life experiences and does not account for what might happen in ten, 15, 20 or 100 years' time. <br/><br/>The suggestion by the Minister that it would be defined is good and important if it is to be left in but, at the moment, a good reason to leave it in has not been advanced.  It is clear from the golden share that the Minister's intention is to deliver all lawfully available services.  He is not looking to have these things clinically appropriate and lawfully available.  The HSE is the source of its imposition in the deal but it is within the gift of the State to decide not to go ahead with it.  Rather than creating a problem by including a list of definitions which are non-exclusive and asking everybody whether this and that is okay, surely the correct response would be to remove the controversial clause, for which there is not the need that there is for the other definitions.  The reason given is that it is needed to ensure only maternity hospital services are provided but the permitted use clause at the top of the constitution says it is for legally permissible healthcare services by a maternity, gynaecological, obstetrics and neonatal hospital.  If the purpose of &quot;clinically permissible&quot; is to say it is for national maternity hospital usage, it is a redundancy and is saying the same thing twice.  If it is a redundancy that puts the future interpretation of all the protections in the agreement at risk, the correct response is to take it out, as the preference, and, only as second best, to attempt to define it.  </p></speech>

The example I picked was the Bon Secours, which has six or seven hospitals in Ireland.  It has a huge Catholic-based healthcare organisation in the United States.  In that country there are many Catholic healthcare organisations with many hospitals and they are always looking to expand, merge and acquire other healthcare organisations.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have an adult hospital, a maternity hospital, a private hospital and St. Michael's, perhaps, as an elective hospital.  It is a valuable asset and if the directors have the power to merge, what is to say they will not merge with an American Catholic healthcare organisation?</p><p>There are many of them and they are enormously wealthy.

That is not the case.</p> <p>  The terms of the lease, as it is eventually agreed, will include clauses that deal with under what terms can a mortgage be placed upon it and under what circumstances could such a thing happen.  If the Senator comes back to me in three minutes, I will tell her which term it is because I have to land on it in the lease.

In the next session, it is a question I will be happy to ask again because I am not entirely clear on the answer on that.</p> <p>  It just seems that we had a great opportunity here to really put it up to private business, the church or whatever, and set forward a vision for a secular progressive Ireland with a flagship maternity hospital.  It seems that we will not grab the bull by the horns on this one.  That is a real shame.  Women and women's healthcare have suffered long enough.  I would love if the Government had the gumption to seize that bull by the horns.  I will leave it at that for now, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Mr. Stephen Dodd SC provided a briefing for Uplift.  Dr. Boylan has probably seen it.  In part of it, Mr. Dodd SC talks about what I am getting at here.  The religious history, the mistrust and all of that that we have all spoken about is a big part of it but I am beginning to think that this is more about mammon than it is about God, that it is about money and it is about corporate interests.  When Mr. Dodd SC states in his briefing to us that there is a clause in the lease, clause 7, that allows for the permitted use, he states the definition of "permitted use" is crucial.  Clause 1 defines permitted use as "the National Maternity Hospital Area [being used as] a public hospital primarily for the provision of all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services"; it is there again in the title of it.  It goes further on to say that part of the clause in the lease is "provided always that the Permitted Use does not preclude the provision of any private healthcare services relating to the above uses which are permitted or envisaged".  Is this a clause that doubles down on the State leasing the land on the question of private care in that hospital, even though it is built with public money?  Does Dr. Boylan follows, or am I being too convoluted?</p></speech>

They are really concerned about the independent review that was established by then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2018 and the outcome of that review that Dr. Catherine Day was involved in, which recommended in strong terms that it is far better for the State to own the land when there is co-location, and they recommend it very much.  Obviously, that recommendation, that review that was ordered by the Government, is just wiped away and everything else is gone ahead with.  It triggered with me that this is more about the corporate interest rather than anything else and they are doubling down everywhere on it.  I would be grateful to Dr. Boylan for his comments.</p></speech>

I just do not know.</p> <p>  Certainly, on that independent review, Professor Deirdre Madden and Professor Jane Grimson were also very much involved in the review that was chaired by Dr. Catherine Day.  They were absolutely clear, with their recommendation 6.3, that the land should be owned by the State.  Indeed, both the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Taoiseach have stated in the D&aacute;il that the hospital would be State-owned on State land, and that is actually not happening.  As the Deputy says, that is accepted by Government, as I understand the recommendations of that report.</p></speech>

This is about the compulsory purchase issue.  Mr. Dodd SC, in page 62 of his opinion, states:</p> <blockquote> 	Insofar as the State proposes to compulsory acquire the lands, the appropriate legislation is under the Health Act 1947 which confers on the HSE the power to compulsorily acquire lands.  However, significant issues relate to whether the procedure under Health Act 1947 is constitutional in affording sufficient independence in the process for confirming a CPO. </blockquote> <p>In other words, he is saying in this opinion that he has doubts that there are sufficient powers in the 1947 Health Act to allow the State to compulsorily purchase this land.  Would Mr. McGarr agree with him?</p></speech>

It is not to say there should not be restrictions in a lease.  That would be normal.  Rather, it is to ask what would be the effect of the restrictions.

I have not raised any concerns about paragraphs 4(a), 4(b), 4(d) or 4(e).</p></speech>

The restrictions upon the way the hospital can perform must fall within the "permitted use" clause of the lease.  The permitted use clause of the lease defines how the hospital may act.

That is unique to this set of circumstances.  The phrase "clinically appropriate" is problematic.  It is not about the fact that there is a quiet enjoyment clause within the landlord's covenant or, indeed, that there are landlord's covenants.

It is one in respect of which the buyer, who will be separately represented by a solicitor, would ensure the title deeds, charges and requirements needed to prove good title exist &mdash; in other words, that the chain of ownership can be demonstrated and, if there is any hole in the change of ownership, that it can be remedied by, for example, long possession deep within the history of the property.</p></speech>

As with the one in question, you could have a property with a lease and ground rent.  Famously, Guinness has a ground rent and a long lease of 9,000 years, although I think it might be more for marketing purposes than anything else that this is talked about.  One can have an extremely long leasehold interest, and one can have a short leasehold interest, which is still marketable.  It is not determined by the length of the lease.  I ask that if I am to be questioned on land law, I be allowed to go out and get my copy of Wylie or that the questions address the lease before us.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity.  As I said earlier, the preference, which is expressed by everybody at the committee and outside it, would be for the State to own the freehold and the land.  The preference, if that cannot be done, is for the deal done to bring certainty in terms of the delivery of the services that are expected and that everybody agrees are expected to be delivered in this maternity hospital.</p></speech>

One cannot be certain in the world but at least one would know that a known ambiguity would be dealt with.  The two-word phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo;, which goes to the very heart of all the agreements, introduces ambiguity in every layer of this agreement and is within the gift of the State to remove.  That is why it is important.  I am of the opinion that, as Dr. Boylan has said, a good co-location project, and the co-location project that-----</p></speech>

A reference was made to the Elm Park buildings, the ones down on the main Merrion Road, which are sometimes referred to as the McNamara buildings.  When we almost owned those buildings or were close to having them given to us by the State, there was tremendous enthusiasm.  It was considered to be absolutely clinically acceptable that we would site the hospital-----</p></speech>

The nub of the term "permitted use" is that we have clinically appropriate and legally permissible services.  I thank Mr. McGarr for highlighting the fact that the argument we have heard for "clinically appropriate" is that it would indicate that they should be services appropriate to a maternity hospital but that is, as Mr. McGarr said, already mentioned.  We should use the following phrase: "all legally permissible healthcare services by a maternity, gynaecological, obstetrics and neonatal service" and remove the phrase "clinically appropriate".  That would remove a phrase that is undefined anywhere and Mr. McGarr might confirm if that is the case.  That phrase is placed within the lease and within every other document and therefore all of the other matters would need to be interpreted by both the tenant and the landlord.</p></speech>

I am not satisfied with the other aspects of the lease either but that would give significant clarity.  I might ask Dr. Boylan about that phrase "clinically appropriate" as a phrase that is not defined and about how it is interpreted.  Dr. Boylan had started on that point but he did not have a full opportunity to discuss how, for example, the master of the hospital will report to the board and how the board has a role in health policy.  I would like it if Dr. Boylan would comment on that question of how "clinically appropriate" might be applied.  For example, I know there was a suggestion of providing a list of different practices but "clinically appropriate" is not simply a matter of what services are available; it relates to when they might be made available.  He gave the example that in St. Vincent's University Hospital at present sterilisation procedures are given when they are clinically required in relation to another health issue, but not for the purpose of sterilisation itself.  How might the potential input of a board in the interpretation of the phrase "clinically appropriate" and in its influence on a master pan out if it is not addressed or properly clarified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051200002#M01000"><p>From the point of view of the board, if the term "clinically appropriate" is not defined then it is open to the board to interpret what it means because the master reports to the board and the master is directed by the board when it comes to policy.  That rarely causes any problems whatsoever.  I had a problem when I was introducing sterilisation, though we sorted it out.  As I said, the composition of the board has three separate groups of three nominees.  The three from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are committed to upholding the values and vision of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead, which are undoubtedly Catholic.  If you have a conservative Minister for Health who appoints three people who are conservative they may well define "clinically appropriate" in a way which restricts the access of women to healthcare that they are perfectly entitled to.  The term "clinically appropriate" allows for a qualification or a jump that must be made in order for women to access care, which is legal but which may not be interpreted as clinically appropriate by the board, and you may well get a conservative master as well.</p></speech>

For example, if a service that was legally permissible was being interpreted as not being clinically appropriate it may not be available, given that both tests need to be met.</p></speech>

That would clear things up somewhat and would remove an ambiguous phrase from interpretation in that way.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about the value for money issue and the freedom of the State in this matter.  I know it was mentioned that the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, building would be sold and that this might contribute to the building of the first hospital on this site, which will then be given to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We have heard that there is likely to be a 70-year lifespan for a hospital on this site.  Mr. McGarr might clarify the following point.  The rent is &euro;850,000 per year and is only waived down to &euro;10 per year on condition of the permitted use happening in a full and ongoing way.  Is it the case that at the expiry of a hospital in 70 years&rsquo; time the State would be obliged to build a new hospital and maybe another four or five hospitals subsequent to that to ensure it continues in the permitted use?  If it fails to do so, will it be subject to a return to market rent rates, which is currently &euro;850,000 per year on the site?</p></speech>

There is a clause which allows for an interregnum for repairs or other works such as are required to ensure that the hospital can continue, which would be generally acknowledged to include such works as are needed to ensure that if the hospital is to be replaced, rebuilt or refurbished its closure would not be a breach of the lease.  However, it is the case that the lease does not allow for any other purpose for the site.  If another purpose were to start to be imposed on this building in the future it is open to the landlord to take action on that to ensure the use is returned to the permitted one.</p></speech>

Perhaps in 70 years&rsquo; time, a different generation of women might have concerns, and I speak as somebody who has not campaigned for as long as many others here but who first campaigned exactly 30 years for something like repeal.  What would happen if there were such issues?  On a practical level, it was mentioned that the demographics show us that the north and west of the city will be the likely centres of population in the future, and Dr. Boylan might comment on this point as well.  There is no mechanism for the State to end or exit this lease or to exit this practice and it would be obliged to continue.</p><p>Again, that would be publicly.  We are talking about the State potentially building four hospitals in a row over the next 299 years, or five or six hospitals, with those costs.  Are those really the relevant costs in this matter?  Is it a 70-year life cycle plus market rent for another 229 years?  Are those the scenarios?</p></speech>

It is not permitted for a change of national policy, for example.  The Minister was in with the committee yesterday and I am aware that he was concerned about the trust the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would have to have with regard to the State's intentions.  I believe the paperwork is intended to ensure that once this deal is done, it is an irrevocable deal to deliver a national maternity hospital with obstetrics and gynaecological services, and that this is the nature of the usage this building will be put to, with the exception of the reserved landlord areas, the example given being dermatology, within the building.  These are the restrictions put on it.  To demise it, it is triggered only by insolvency, primarily.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Boylan for his tremendous work in this field over many years.  I recognise his knowledge in that area.

The next master will be appointed by that board.  There is risk associated with the construction of the board - the three, three and three.  At some time in the future, a conservative Minister for Health might appoint three conservatives and the three members from St. Vincent's side are committed to upholding Catholic values basically.

In this case, there is an agreement for a three, three, three appointment.  There are two sets of shareholders, namely, the 99% shareholding owned by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the 1% shareholding held by the Minister.  The Minister has certain reserved powers to ensure the board delivers within what is "clinically appropriate and legally permissible", to use the current unfortunate wording.  The current wording, in respect of the Minister's intent, is to ensure that all lawfully available services would be delivered.</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of research going on at the moment. Again, we do not know about the future.  There are gene therapies coming down the road.  There is a technique called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR, which will probably require IVF and the treatment of embryos prior to implantation into the mother.  The church, apparently, has not taken a particular position on this so we are not sure what the ethical guidelines and codes around that will be, so there are risks associated with the structure at the moment.<br/><br/>Subcommittees will be formed and one of the subcommittees is an ethics committee.  That has the potential to cause problems when you look at the board structure because it is a subcommittee of the board so there will be board members on that committee.  Again, we are at risk with the current structure that, if there are conservatives on that ethics committee from the board, that could create serious problems.  Under the current structure, therefore, there are so many risks associated with this it is very hard to see how there will not be conflict, rows and reversions to the courts, perhaps, and back to the Minister, and who knows who the Minister will be.  We have seen the problems in the US with Roe <i>v.</i>Wade being rolled back.  Women's reproductive rights are under threat, under attack and there is pushback all over the world.  This structure creates a risk in that respect.</p></speech>

Will Dr. Boylan pick out a single issue or item that would safeguard against the issues he is concerned about and protect and preserve the full extent of the available and necessary services and research?  This is where we go back to the interpretation of "necessary".  I want to ask this question.  Are there situations where a patient can present in any place, that is, a maternity hospital or anywhere else, where a proposal by the patient may not be acceptable medically or ethically, setting aside altogether all the religious parts of it?

I do not need any background information, therefore, on how important this is.</p> <p>  What has happened to this co-location, which first came about as a result of an accountant's report back in 2008, Government policy in 2013 and four Ministers since?  Is it still co-location or am I exaggerating by saying it is no longer co-location but the proposed new national maternity hospital is a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?</p></speech>

The terminology around clinically permissible and legally permissible has been teased out so I am going to park that for a moment.  Various things have been said about red herrings or misinformation.  I have tried desperately to get all the information and make sense out of it, so I take issue with comments like that from various doctors, I might add, and various people.  It is unacceptable.  Let me look at this.  The co-location is no longer co-location.  The new national maternity hospital will be a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will be owned by St. Vincent's Holdings.</p></speech>

I am talking about the change in autonomy from the woman to the clinician if we go with what is deemed clinically appropriate.

The change is that we are taking autonomy from the woman and putting it back totally into the hands of the clinician, whoever he or she may be.</p></speech>

I do not believe the Holles Street lease, for example, involves the Earl of Pembroke appointing three of the directors and I do not believe it involves the kind of covenants and restrictions on permitted use in this lease.  One is not the same as the other.  Generally speaking, leasehold interests can be as restrictive or as unrestricted as agreed between the parties.  A leasehold interest is not, in itself, objectionable.  The reason a leasehold interest causes difficulty in this case - the difficulty I identify - is that there is a restriction on the permitted use, which, unfortunately, involves an ambiguity.</p> <p>  That restriction, I think, is not intended to cause problems.  That is to say the drafters did not intend there to be an ambiguity; rather, it has been put in there but the consequences are that there is an ambiguity.  An ambiguity in the permitted use of the lease results in a risk of some form of problem down the line with a future set of people who do not share the understanding there now.</p></speech>

There is a permitted use clause that states the hospital's activities must be both clinically appropriate and legally permissible.  The term "clinically appropriate" is not defined.  Even in circumstances were all the parties are in agreement as to what is the definition, unless that definition is reduced into writing and, I would say, placed inside the lease, we would be left with the difficulty that a future interpretation may not comply with what everybody has said they expect it to mean now.</p></speech>

I do not support the current proposed corporate ownership and structure.  It is fraught with risk.  We are on the same page when we want the national maternity hospital to move to a modern hospital.  There is an enormous amount of work that has gone into it by the people at Holles Street and the HSE and so on.  I support that but I am concerned about the risks associated with the current proposed governance and ownership structure.  It is not true co-location, which was in the original plan.  It is the risk involved with the current arrangement that concerns me.  I fully support the move otherwise.</p></speech>

First, there is a new owner of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  That owner has only taken ownership in the past couple of weeks.  As far as we know - and we completely accept - the new owner is independent of and totally separate from the previous owners.  It is ready to make a fully independent decision as to the disposition of the property.</p></speech>

The religious orders have moved out.  I am saying there is a brand new owner.  A brand new owner gives an opportunity to look afresh at the question of a request as to whether the State may either purchase the site, or St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would be in a position to assist by gifting the site.  As a secondary proposition, presuming that is not the case and the matter would go ahead on a leasehold basis, my suggestion relates to the lease.</p> <p>  I am not looking at a piece of paper or agreement where nothing can be saved.  This lease is almost there.  This lease has strong protections in respect of the golden share but, unfortunately, they are made subsidiary and ancillary to the definition of the primary object of the new maternity hospital.  It is the case that this lease is almost there.  My proposal is to delete the references to the ambiguous phrase of "clinically appropriate" and leave it be that the matter would stand as it states in the lease.  These would be services to be delivered in a national maternity, obstetric, gynaecology and neonatal hospital.  Everyone supports that.  Only the services that are lawfully permissible should go ahead.  That is my proposition as the second best option if the land cannot be owned freehold, which everyone else agrees would be preferable if it were possible.  If it cannot, and there must be a leasehold, my preference would be that the leasehold would not include an ambiguous phrase that could possibly cause 299 years of litigation.</p></speech>

Maternity services for women in this country are so outdated.  We had a tour of the hospital this morning and saw a 15-bed ward where women are sharing toilets.  Any delay in services will have a major impact on the health outcomes of many women.  Dr. Boylan knows this and has seen what goes on in the hospital.  Is it possible the State can delay even a single day in delivering services for women in the country?</p></speech>

I have listened to Dr. Boylan and I know he demands great respect, particularly among women.  Nonetheless, I cannot help but think he has pressed all the appropriate buttons in his contribution today that frighten people, particularly in the context of women's health and the hard-fought gains therein.  He is frightening them over the independence of the hospital when there are particular clauses guaranteeing independence over budgetary, clinical and operational running of the hospital.  They cannot be interfered with and are guaranteed in the constitution of the hospital.  He knows that.</p><p>Another element that disturbs me is the subliminal reference gesture to Roe <i>v.</i>Wade.  Dr. Boylan did not mention them by name.  We are all very mindful of what has happened in the United States.  The reference to a conservative Minister appointing a conservative board cannot apply here.  We have a Constitution which is very clear on the role of the Minister.  It states, &quot;the executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government&quot;.  The right to termination is enshrined in the Constitution.  No matter how conservative a Minister is, he or she simply cannot do that under our Constitution.  Dr. Boylan knows that.  This is what disappoints me most about his contribution.  He has pressed buttons that he knows will frighten people.  I have pointed out two of them and there are more.  They are simply not based on fact.</p></speech>

The Minister under the constitution of these companies has the right to appoint three members of the board of the new national maternity hospital.  The board members from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group nominated by St. Vincent's Holdings are committed to upholding the values and vision of the Religious Sisters of Charity.  Deputy Lahart may say they are not Catholic but I think that is hard to believe.</p></speech>

We have not seen any of the paperwork between Ireland, by which I mean the Sisters of Charity and the archbishops, and the Vatican.  We need to see this before there is any further progress.  If we see them we may well be highly reassured.  This may be unique in the world where the Vatican has said to go ahead and build a hospital, that it does not care what is done in it and to do terminations-----</p></speech>

This has been a civil debate, as it was yesterday.  Plenty of us could have severely criticised the Minister for coming in and essentially saying "trust me".  I am sorry but this is what parliamentary scrutiny is about.  It is about digging down into the detail of a proposal and seeking answers.  Until last Tuesday the Government was quite happy to nod through this proposal.  It was only because of people such as Dr. Boylan, Mr. McGarr and many other people who have serious concerns about the proposal and general public outcry that the Government was forced into publishing the legal documents.  We still do not have them all.  We still do not have the critical document in respect of the application to the Vatican.  This is essential.  I suggest members would be remiss in their responsibilities as public representatives if they did not insist on us getting this documentation.</p> <p>  We like to operate on the basis of evidence and fact.  We can only establish the facts when we have the legal documentation.  We need adequate time to consider it.  Essentially, the Minister agreed with this today.  We asked him to request additional time from the Cabinet next Tuesday so we could properly interrogate all of the significant issues that we are all grappling with.  This project will cost at least &euro;800 million.  We know very little about the detail of it.  Everybody must admit there is huge ambiguity about what the legal documents entail and what they will mean for the future.</p> <p>  None of this proposal is in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  A significant element of this is about the promotion of private healthcare, and not only private healthcare but private Catholic healthcare.  There are ample examples of what is happening in this country and people should open their eyes.  Publicly funded property in education and health and the trust funds-----</p></speech>

I wish him, the Deputies and Senators a good evening and I thank them for the opportunity to meet with them to discuss this vital national healthcare project that has already been delayed for far too long.</p> <p>  As a practising clinician and Master of the National Maternity Hospital, I am proud to work in a hospital that has led the way in ensuring women can avail of all their legal rights.</p> <p>  Although the debate has focused on the right to access gender affirming surgery, tubal ligation, termination of pregnancy and artificial reproductive techniques, we should not forget that last year we delivered 7,855 babies to 7,694 mothers.  We had 79,750 attendances in our antenatal clinics and 10,000 attendances in our gynaecology outpatients, all in the cramped, inadequate, antiquated, unfit for purpose buildings in Holles Street.</p><p>It has been difficult to hear claims both in the media and in this room that our fervent support for the proposed move to Elm Park is some kind of surrender to the church.  Legitimate concerns are welcome and deserve every consideration but we must also deal in facts, and I am alarmed by the combination of emotive misinformation and misunderstanding that prevails.  Just because the contracts underpinning the new hospital appear complex, that does not indicate the church stealing influence over women's reproductive choices through clever contractual stealth.  I appreciate members of this committee are holding these hearings in an effort to bring clarity to the issues and I hope that this evening, along with my colleagues, we can allay some of the fears that exist.</p><p> Having spent much time listening to the debate over the past week, I believe four key points remain.  The first is the clinical imperative.  Although the undisputed need for relocation has been stated many times, lest we forget in the maelstrom of irrelevancies, I will continue to remind members that we want to provide advanced level care in an appropriate setting where women and their babies can be afforded the dignity and privacy they deserve.  This can only be provided in a new purpose-built maternity, gynaecology and neonatal hospital.  For anybody to describe the current location as fit for purpose or to argue the definition of a Nightingale ward, where 14 patients are separated by curtains, with very limited toilet and shower facilities, it is clear that he or she has not been in the hospital for some time and cannot have the best interest of our patients at heart.  Women should have single en suite rooms for antenatal, labour and postnatal stays, unless otherwise indicated.  Current investment reflects a Band-Aid approach to a gaping wound.</p><p> The second point for mention is ethos.  The NMH, as a public voluntary hospital, has no constraints on the procedures it offers patients, and I can say with absolute certainty this will continue when we relocate.  The hospital will remain a clinically independent, publicly funded, self-governed organisation with a board composed of nine directors, each with a fiduciary duty to the National Maternity Hospital and a shareholder split, with the most important share - the golden share - belonging to the Minister for Health of the day.</p><p> It would a sad day if the unambiguously supportive views of 52 senior consultants in a letter to the Taoiseach last February were to be drowned out in the public debate by relentless claims that services offered at the new hospital will be curtailed by religious ethos.</p><p> The third point relates to ownership.  There is another misplaced fear that, as owner of the freehold, St Vincent's will have control over the operations of the new national maternity hospital.  I had a conversation recently with an expert in property law, who is removed from the project, who stated a 300-year leasehold conveys effective ownership or freehold equivalent and is an ownership form used across both the city and country for campus developments where there is mixed use or ownership.  The expert gave me a number of examples, including IDA parks, colleges, Dublin Airport, the Central Bank at Dublin Landings, Capital Dock and Connolly Quarter.  Many of these developments have been funded by the State.  The National Maternity Hospital, along with many other hospitals, is an example of leasehold.</p><p> The final point relates to trust.  Why should women and their families trust instruments of the State such as politicians, the religious or the health service, having been let down so appallingly in the past?  Why should they listen to a male master of the National Maternity Hospital tell them that all will be well?  They should not just believe me.  They should listen to the women who were powerful advocates for women's right to choice, such as Mary Higgins, Mary Brosnan, and the many other clinicians who signed the letter we recently sent from the National Maternity Hospital to the Taoiseach.  They should listen to the 400 plus clinicians who signed a letter to the Taoiseach from all hospitals, who work in all specialties, general practice and public health from around the country - and even a colleague of mine who is based in London - who have written to support the proposed move to St. Vincent's.</p><p> Currently, approximately 84%of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country are young women, including my daughter.  All those asked have indicated their support for the project.  These will be the future of our speciality, many of them consultants in the NMH at Elm Park, service users themselves of the new facility, many of them advocates in the repeal campaign, who recently wrote a letter from the Junior Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecological Society, JOGS, of the Institute of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynaecologists, supporting the project and the move and stating they had no concerns about it.  I and my medical colleagues and those in midwifery and nursing in the NMH would not sign up to a proposal that was not going to 100% guarantee the new hospital's integrity and independence.  The reality of failure, due to doubts which need no longer exist, is to turn your back on the urgent needs of Irish women, girls and their children whom my colleagues and I have the privilege of caring for.  I look forward to answering the questions of members as fully and completely as possible.</p></speech>

I know that they are all very busy.  We heard earlier from Mr. Simon McGarr, a solicitor, who outlined that under the 299-year lease the buildings will not belong to the State but to the St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  One of the reasons he says that is due to the use of the term "permitted use".  He says there are restrictions on what can be done within the hospital because of that clause in the lease.  I would like clarification about ownership of the building and what level of restrictions will be on the new NMH when it takes up occupation of the building on its completion.</p></speech>

As everybody probably knows at this point, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is named in the lease document as the landlord.  The solicitor, Mr. Simon McGarr, has pointed to a schedule to the lease which says that the land here and all the buildings that are erected on it belong to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The schedule does indeed say that.  The lease then goes on to say that the landlord gives away the land and the buildings for a period of 299 years.  Whether or not you regard this as ownership would appear to be a matter of perspective.  Some disagree that a 299-year lease is ownership.  I disagree with them.  It was referred to earlier that a minimum period of 70 years is required to be legally considered as ownership.  We have here 299 years.  In particular in relation to the building, for the entire relevant life of the building, it will be in the ownership of the HSE under this lease.  I am absolutely happy and confident in saying to the committee that the building will belong to the HSE.</p></speech>

It is to be used as a hospital.  Again, I understand the perspective of the other solicitor is that this is a restriction.  We would call it a user.  Most leases would have a clause that says what the building is to be used for.  This permitted use clause is clear that the building is to be used as a hospital.  From my perspective, I do not regard that as a restriction or in any way as a worry.  Yes, it is there that the use is as a hospital.</p></speech>

I welcome all the witnesses.  We had some very lengthy discussions with the Minister for Health today in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I asked him if he, as the Minister for Health, asked the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group if it would gift the land to the State.  He said he did, and it said no.  He said it was not for turning when it comes to the issue of the ownership of the land.  If it is not for turning on that issue, it is because it is not gifting the land to the State, so the State does not own the land.  This is not just about ownership; it is about the company structure.  It is about whether it is a HSE hospital or whether it is a voluntary hospital, because that is the issue.</p><p>From Professor Higgins&rsquo;s perspective, could he see a situation where the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would ever allow a HSE hospital to be built on its land?</p></speech>

I cannot answer for St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I will give the answer to the Deputy from the National Maternity Hospital perspective.  We never sought to move to St. Vincent's as a State-owned, HSE hospital.  We have been a voluntary hospital on the site since 1894.  We can talk about the buildings.  The newest building will be 100 years old.  It is therefore time to move.  I will speak about what the voluntary hospitals offer and what we offer.  We can look at element of women&rsquo;s health in this country, such as the termination of pregnancy.  On 7 January 2019, which was a week after I became master, we held our first clinic.  The voluntary hospitals have the capacity to adapt and move much quicker than the HSE hospitals.  There was never a conversation with the National Maternity Hospital, either with my predecessor, with the board, with myself, or with anybody else involved in the project, about moving to St. Vincent's as a HSE hospital.  It is just not on our radar.</p></speech>

Professor Higgins mentioned that those who raised questions about ownership are raising questions that are based on misplaced fear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shane Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051200002#V00600"><p>Correct.</p></speech>

We have to accept the HSE will be the funder of the hospital and the taxpayer will sign a cheque for up to &euro;1 billion and given, as was said earlier, that Sl&aacute;intecare has committed us to public health, public hospitals and public money, it should be a HSE hospital.  Professor Higgins is saying that from his perspective, the current board of the National Maternity Hospital would prefer that it would be a voluntary hospital as opposed to a HSE hospital.  At least, that is Professor Higgins&rsquo;s opinion.  That is the point I am making, which arises from everything I have heard.  I would dearly like to hear from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and I hope that we do.  It would be very remiss of us not to hear from the very people who are now the landowners and who now hold all of the cards.  It strikes me that this is about control for this particular health group because it will be a health group with four hospitals as a portfolio, with three voluntary hospitals and one private hospital.  That is what this is about.  They do not want a HSE hospital.  That is the only reason that they will not gift the land to the State.  That is the only reason why we have ended up with a very convoluted, complicated, legal, contractual company arrangement.</p></speech>

First, we are a public hospital.  I know that the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; has been bandied about.  I know that the previous witnesses used the word &ldquo;private&rdquo; quite a lot.  We are a public hospital.  We are funded by the State.  We have a very strict funding arrangement with the State through a service-level agreement, SLA.  We have compliance statements every year that assure the State that we are providing the service for which we are being funded.  There is no question about the model of care-----</p></speech>

I have other questions.  I raise the point about the protection against merging with another healthcare group.  The Bon Secours model was mentioned.  Do the witnesses have any comment on that?  In other words, the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group could merge with another foreign or domestic healthcare group.  That would strand the NMH to some degree or would make it part of a property portfolio.</p> <p>  My second question is about how the geographical location would not meet future population demands.  In other words, the hospital will be out in Donnybrook while the population is growing and birth rates are in different parts of the country.</p> <p>  The appointment of conservative directors by conservative Ministers essentially is dictating and influencing the future direction of the hospital.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of the seepage of patients from an overcrowded accident and emergency department in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital requiring bed space in the NMH.</p></speech>

I will pass to Professor Higgins on the medical question.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about the protection against merger.  I think the Deputy said that St. Vincent&rsquo;s could merge with another healthcare organisation.  This raises a point which bears repeating, even though we have all discussed it.  There is a conflation here of ownership and control.  I believe that the Deputy&rsquo;s question derives from the fact that St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is the owner.  However, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is not in control of the new national maternity hospital company.  It cannot therefore direct a merger.  There is no mechanism for it to do that.  We have all talked about the other hospitals in the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, of which there are three.  They are all housed in one company.  The national maternity hospital in the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is housed in a separate company, which is specifically designed to ensure that there is no outside interference, whether this is by way of merger with another hospital or by way of religious interference.  There is no mechanism in the document or rulebook, which is the constitution of the new national maternity hospital.  This new national maternity hospital company is a registered charity.  It is bound by its own principal object, or the reason it exists, which is for the promotion of health and, in particular, for the provision of maternity and associated services.</p></speech>

There has been a worry, which is legitimate - I do not want to suggest that any of the worries and concerns are anything other than legitimate - that three directors from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, three directors from the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street or three directors from the State might decide to take this company in a different direction.  It was stated earlier that the directors could change the constitution of the company.  That was not an accurate statement.  I feel the need to correct the record in that regard.  In the rulebook or constitution of the new company there is a set of powers for the board.  They are the board&rsquo;s directive.  They say how this hospital is going to be run.  They are only capable of being amended with the consent of the Charities Regulator, as was stated, but also with the unanimous consent of every single director, and of the Minister for Health.  That statement is to correct the record.</p> <p>  My last legal point is in relation to the point about a conservative director who might take the company in a particular direction.  Yes, boards of directors do influence culture in organisations, but boards of directors under the Companies Act and under the Charities Act have very clear obligations to act in the best interest of this company and to promote its charitable purpose.  It is not possible for directors to go outside of the rulebook, which is the constitution.  There are two sets of laws, the Companies Act and the Charities Act, imposed upon them to act with due skill and care, in the best interests of this company.</p></speech>

Yet, I think he quoted the numbers at the moment as being the same as they were in 1994.  In fact, therefore, the numbers are still quite high.  The numbers are approximately 7,500 babies to approximately 7,500 mothers.  Our current location was never fit for purpose for those sorts of numbers.  However, Deputy Lahart&rsquo;s question is valid.  Numbers are one thing, but complexity of care is another.  We are seeing an ever more complex cohort of patients now, when taking into account factors such as age, BMI, artificial reproductive techniques, medical and surgical comorbidities which now allow for patients to become pregnant where previously they might not have done.</p> <p>  Dr. Walsh is the director of foetal medicine.  She can talk about the number or referrals that we get.  We get a significant number of referrals for foetal medicines.  These are labour intensive and expertise intensive.  We get those referrals from all over the country.  They are not just in our Ireland east catchment area.  I will not go any further on that, because I think that Dr. Walsh might like to come in on that.  Our benign gynaecological services are going up.  Gynaecology always loses out.  Maternity services cannot wait.</p><p>Patients come in in labour and they deliver.  Postponement and cancellation of gynaecological procedures happened an awful lot in the recent pandemic.  We have significant waiting lists, particularly in some areas.  A new hospital with increased bed numbers and facilities will allow us to develop our gynaecology service and provide appropriate gynaecology services to our patients.</p></speech>

On the need piece, we have the capacity and demand to fill the campus in its current location.  Over time, the Rotunda and the Coombe will also have increased service demands.  Ultimately, co-location is a policy for all maternity hospitals.  I do not think we have a concern that falling birth numbers or the geographical location of the hospital will affect demand; if anything, it will be the opposite.  There will not be many women in Dublin who will be offered a single, en suite private room for all of their antenatal and postnatal stay who will not make that extra journey in a benign setting.</p></speech>

We all recognise the outstanding work that is done in Holles Street.  I had my children there and my grandson was born there.  I have the height of regard for the hospital.  The fact that 95% of patients express satisfaction with it is a tribute to the staff and to the fact it is an independent hospital established by charter and has 100 governors.  Its status will change significantly under the new arrangement whereby it will go from being an independent hospital to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a bigger hospital.  That is the governance arrangement.  Is there concern about that?</p> <p>  On the term "clinically appropriate", we are looking for a definition.  The Minister has stated that he will provide one.  We look for it to be written into all of the legal documents because those documents are littered with that ambiguous phrase.  Professor Declan Keane said recently he would welcome a definition in the documents including a list of the services but not limited to those services. Would Professor Higgins welcome that?  Is he looking for that definition?</p> <p>  This will need various approvals.  We are not or should not be up against it next Tuesday.  There are many other stages to go through, one of which is the approval of the governors.  When does Professor Higgins expect to bring a proposal to his governors?  What is the timescale in that regard?</p> <p>  The business case would look at birth rate and that kind of thing and whether it stacks up to have this move.  What role has Holles Street had in the preparation of that business case, which, we note, has not been signed off?</p></speech>

Ms Murphy can take on the wholly owned subsidiary issue.  It is not a wholly owned subsidiary.  The Minister has a golden share.  That is an important point.  Ms Murphy might also talk to the governance of the hospital.</p> <p>  On "clinically appropriate", there are three stakeholders in the creation of this suite of documents.  I understand and appreciate the concern although it was never the intention of the words "clinically appropriate" to cause that level of concern.  We have no issue with defining the term or, if the three parties agree, with its removal from the documents.  I state that on behalf of the National Maternity Hospital.</p></speech>

That company has two shareholders: one is St. Vincent's and the other is the Minister for Health.  St. Vincent's has 99 shares and the Minister has one golden share.  If I had my time again as a legal drafter, I might have given the Minister 100,000 golden shares.  The legal effect would not change, however.  There is a perception it is 99 versus one but that is not borne out in the documents.  What matters is not the number of shares one holds, but the powers attached to the shares.  The ordinary shares have very few powers.  I understand that for the layperson ownership means control but I spoke already about conflating ownership with control.</p></speech>

He has got it wrong.  I was a young woman in the early 1980s.  I had an abortion at that time and had to go to Liverpool for it.  I campaigned against the eighth amendment as a young woman and then lived through the years that saw the darkest of things done to women, from what happened in the Kerry babies case to Savita Halappanavar.  That runs deep because of what is at the base of it.  I do not know if Professor Higgins has read Emily O'Reilly's wonderful book <i>Masterminds of the Right</i>in which she traces succinctly the shadowy forces that brought in that referendum and, later, the Maastricht protocol, which stopped abortion coming into our country.  They did not wear habits and were not traipsing around corridors with veils on them; they were top officials linked to organisations like Opus Dei and the Knights of St. Columbanus.  They were deeply embedded in the health service and the Civil Service and they saw to it that Ireland maintained an extraordinary conservative agenda in relation to women's reproductive rights.  We have broken from that but people like me, though probably not so much the younger generation who did not live through it, have a bitter taste in our mouths.  We want to see a national maternity hospital fully owned and run by the State.</p><p>I dispute what has been said about it being owned according to the lease.  It is not my dispute.  It can be seen in the St. Vincent's fact sheet.  I have read the details into the record of the D&aacute;il.  It disputes what has been said.  It asks who owns the land the new national maternity hospital will be built on and it states:  &quot;The land is owned by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.&quot;  Who will run the hospital?  The hospital will be run as part of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We have spent the week teasing out these questions.  We have got some clarity on some things but not on many more.</p><p>I am delighted to hear Professor Higgins say he would welcome the introduction of a definition into those documents in respect of the worrying clause relating to &quot;clinically appropriate&quot;.  We worry about that.  Who says whether it is appropriate that somebody has sterilisation or an abortion?  Who says it is appropriate how they have their baby?  If it is not the woman and she does not have a say, then who is telling her what to do with her body?  I hope Professor Higgins accepts that as bona fide.  I think the world of St. Vincent's and of these doctors.  I met Dr. Walsh the other night in the RT&Eacute; studio.  I have nothing against the witnesses.  This is not personal, but they have to understand where it stems from.  It is totally legitimate.</p></speech>

The reference to emotive misunderstandings did not apply to anyone in this room.  In recent weeks, however, terms like "the nuns", "public juridic body" and "private" have being used to try to convey that some shadowy figures are involved.  Now that the narrative has moved away from the nuns because the nuns have divested their interest in St. Vincent's, it is not a topic of conversation anymore.  Now we are moving to terms like "private practice".</p><p>I want to correct that because the public has a right to factual, accurate truths in this debate, and it is a very important debate.  I am aware, as I said in my speech, of the hurt that has been caused to women and their families for decades in this country, but I am representing a group of people, clinicians, nurses, midwives, doctors and administrative staff, who dedicate their lives to the provision of all services that are legally permissible within the State.  Those are the same clinicians who wrote to the Taoiseach and who advocated on behalf of women's rights during the repeal campaign and many other situations.  They are being portrayed as people who will decide what is appropriate or not.  They provide everything.  The hospital we work in provides everything.  It happens to be a voluntary hospital and, as has been stated several times, the hospitals that are not providing a full termination of pregnancy service, for example, are all State-run, State-owned, State-funded hospitals.  A week after the introduction of the legislation we were providing the service across all streams of the legislation.  I am defending my colleagues.</p></speech>

Does he understand that we are here to voice their concerns?  We all are here to achieve the one objective, which is a state-of-the-art national maternity hospital, which should have happened decades ago.  I want to give Professor Higgins the opportunity to confirm that he understands why people are cynical.</p></speech>

It is to try to correct some of the factual inaccuracies so that whatever picture is being given to citizens and to women is factually accurate.

I do not think it was helpful, but he has clarified it and acknowledged it.  That is very welcome.</p> <p>  Professor Higgins also said in the opening statement that he had spoken to a legal practitioner who is an expert on property.  Will he elaborate a little more on that?

I understand that.  I am just saying that it is a pity we could not get more information on that because it would have been useful.  That type of expertise is very helpful in terms of giving clarity to the public, so perhaps that person might be able to speak publicly over the weekend.  It would be useful.</p> <p>  Turning to Ms Murphy, the master has said that he would welcome more definition in the constitution on the meaning of "clinically appropriate".  We discussed the definition of "clinically appropriate" with the Minister for hours yesterday.  Stuff was read into the record and the Minister is going to provide further clarity.  Would Ms Murphy agree that it would be useful if it was more explicitly defined in the constitution of the hospital?</p></speech>

When we were drafting the document and we included that the services that would be provided were all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services, I felt it was a two-step test and a positive statement that all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services would be delivered.  I did not expect the debate which ensued.  In light of that debate, as Professor Higgins has mentioned, where the three parties agree to a definition or to removal, I am absolutely satisfied with that.  However, my role is adviser, not decision-maker.</p></speech>

If there was a more explicit definition of "clinically appropriate", people would rest a lot better.  Is it possible or can we have further definition on that?  It appears to be an issue for many people.  Obviously, when there is a debate on things there can be an unintended development, and this is the unintended development.  It was obvious to the layperson that this was going to be an issue.  I believe that a more explicit definition would be useful.</p></speech>

In the previous session the mortgage and being able to borrow against the asset came up again.  Ms Murphy spoke to us at length in a meeting last night about explaining the differences in that regard and how it can and cannot borrow against it.  Will she explain that again because it arose in the previous session, where it was thought that it would be able to use the buildings as an asset to borrow against?  People have a concern about that.</p> <p>  The other matter is if she can explain clause 6.5.  Will she clarify whether the right of first refusal is gone after 30 years?  Does that mean the HSE would no longer have the first right of refusal after 30 years but it does have it in the first 20 years?</p></speech>

We missed a portion of the earlier session because we were in transit, so if I am not in the right domain the Senator is free to correct me.</p> <p>  The right of first refusal clause in the lease means that, and this is a very unlikely scenario but we have included it for absolute clarity and to protect the State, if St. Vincent's proposed to dispose of the land and wanted to transfer its freehold ownership to a third party it convenants, which means it promises or undertakes, to offer the HSE the first refusal.  St. Vincent's deciding to exit healthcare is extremely unlikely territory, but we wanted to have all bases covered.  If that event occurs the option agreement is triggered, and the content of the option agreement is to allow the HSE the right to be the first person.  Now, the HSE might say it does not want it either, but if the HSE wants to become the freehold owner it has the first refusal right.</p> <p>  The mortgage is slightly earlier at clause 6.4.  There are two steps to this analysis.  I do not think we got into this yesterday so the Senator is free to tell me if I am not in the right domain.  The first question is: does the landlord have an ability to secure a mortgage over the site?  The second question, and for me it is the much more pertinent question, is: what would that mean for the HSE, the tenant?  There is an ability, a technical one, for the landlord to mortgage the site, but the landlord has no real interest so I do not believe it could or would ever practically occur, but the ability is there to mortgage the site.  The mortgage, if there is one, can have no effect on the rights given to the HSE.  The HSE's right to own the building for the 299 years is a superior right and, effectively, would trump any right.  Any mortgagor could only get an interest that would have no impact on this, which is why-----</p></speech>

The Deputy said the land was owned by St. Vincent's and that the fact sheet states that.  I wish to correct this.  While the Deputy is right in saying the fact sheet refers to the land being "owned by SVHG", it then goes on to state that it will be, "leased to the State [...] for a period of 299 years".  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group does own the land.  We are all agreed on that point.  Where we differ is that the organisation is giving it away for 299 years.  The fact sheet then goes on to state, "The hospital building will be owned by the Irish State".  Therefore, I would not wish to give the impression that there is a difference between us.  What I am saying is entirely consistent with the St. Vincent's fact sheet.</p></speech>

These agreements are governed by Irish law and only by Irish law.  Canon Law does not have the force of law in Ireland.  It has the status of the law of a foreign jurisdiction.  We often use the example that if a community of French people came and set themselves up in the midlands of Ireland, they might internally bind themselves to the rules of French law, but that does not give it the force of law here.  Canon Law governs the faith lives of communities of religious organisations in this country and throughout the world.</p></speech>

I must state as well, however, that I fully appreciate that for the public this is not a straightforward deal.  The point I have come back to continually is that we have three contributors, or stakeholders, involved.  The State is obtaining the delivery of public health services and it is giving the grant to fund the building.  We also have St. Vincent's, which is giving away the site for 299 years so we can build the hospital.  Then we have the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street, which is giving its hospital.  Therefore, because there are three stakeholders, we have put in place a suite of documentation to align all our interests and to ensure the health services can be effectively provided.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Lahart, had started touching on the notion proffered earlier that perhaps seepage from St. Vincent's Hospital, when there is spare bed capacity, could somehow trigger the &euro;850,000 annual rent clause.  In Ms Murphy's professional opinion, would that trigger it?</p></speech>

St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a registered charity and because of that it has a legal obligation to get value for its asset, unless it is applying the asset to another charitable purpose.  In plain language, what that means is that one charity can give to another charity something for free, if the other charity is doing something the same as the first, that is, the charitable delivery of healthcare.  If the other body, however, decided to commercialise the asset, say by building an apartment block, then St. Vincent's could not allow that other party to build such an apartment block and make a great deal of money from doing so for free.  Therefore, St. Vincent's and its advisers were quite right in saying it was a registered charity and that it had to show it was looking after the asset and only giving it for the &euro;10 rent annually if the site is used to run a public maternity hospital.  It was necessary to state that if that was not being done anymore, then it would be necessary to increase the rent to &euro;850,000.  That is to comply with charity law and, I believe, for no other reason.</p></speech>

Ms Murphy mentioned the fact of the hospital clause.  Again, actually, nobody has disputed that as the permitted use.  I refer to a maternity, gynaecological and obstetrical municipal hospital.  The particular issue highlighted was the phrase "clinically appropriate".  I would appreciate our guests commenting on this aspect, in respect of their preference regarding its removal or definition.  If we have a definition, then I am concerned that it will not simply be a matter of which services are provided, but of which services and when they are provided.  I say that because it is one of the key concerns we have.  For example, I refer to a situation where certain services may be theoretically available, but perhaps not practically available because of a particular policy or ethos or clinical direction.  I would like to hear our guests' preferences in this regard.  I refer to references to "all clinical" services and it being read that way by our guests.  The fact that it was read this way is already a strong signal that there is an issue with this aspect.  I refer to lawyers reading these documents and understanding them completely differently, as well as the legal line in the next few years.</p> <p>  Regarding any building, any hospital, on the premises, is it not the case that it will be the property of St. Vincent's holding group in 299 years?  Is it also not the case, because we have this obligation, and it has been taken on, to continue to build a hospital - and Deputy Shortall asked about the business case in this context earlier - and therefore we are looking at a situation whereby there will be four or five successive maternity hospitals to be built on the site, with the accompanying costs from doing so?  Is it not the case in that context that we would revert to a market rent of &euro;850,000, perhaps in 70 years' time?  It was mentioned that it was felt it would be time to move on in this context in 100 years.  What happens then in 70 years' or 100 years' time if a new hospital wishes to move-----</p></speech>

Regarding the first point made about the clinical appropriateness, I think we have all acknowledged - we certainly have acknowledged - that over the course of the last week this has caused enormous concern, where we had not previously seen such concern in respect of our interpretation.  Turning to whether this phrase is to be defined or if it is to be completely removed, if it is to be defined, then that must be a non-exhaustive list of clinically-appropriate procedures which will be offered to a patient in the timeliest of fashions.  Timely will of course come into this, and we certainly would facilitate a definition stating that, as we currently do, we will provide all services in a timely fashion to our patients.  We will be more than happy to engage in this regard.  As I said at the start, though, there are three stakeholders involved in this suite of documents, so they would all have to be engaged in any such endeavour.</p> <p>  Moving to the buildings and hospitals, we have been on our current site for more than 100 years.  The most modern buildings on the site will be 100 years old by the time we move.  It is clearly acknowledged in healthcare now that a building has a lifespan of 50 years to 75 years. </p></speech>

I thank the Acting Chairman, the Deputies and the Senators for their time and for affording me the opportunity to present to the committee these proposed planning regulations.</p> <p>  As the Acting Chairman mentioned, they consist of the Planning and Development (Street Furniture Fees) Regulations 2022, which waive section 254 street furniture licence fees for the remainder of 2022 for tables, chairs and associated outdoor dining.  As we all know, like many other sectors, the hospital and restaurant sector, and, indeed, the wider tourism sector, suffered the brunt of the measures to manage the Covid pandemic in recent years.  I take this opportunity to commend all those and their representative groups on the positive way in which they engaged with the Government and the wider local government sector to work through what was a difficult two years.  They are still bearing some of that brunt now.  Business is, thankfully, improving but they still require support.</p> <p>  They have been subject to both temporary closures for considerable periods and to other restrictions, which have taken a heavy toll.  We are committed to providing the necessary supports to assist these sectors.  We have done so already, as the committee will be aware, through approximately &euro;1.5 billion in rates waivers to business, many of which are in the hospitality and restaurant sector.  This week, the Government made the decision, which I am sure we all support, to retain the 9% VAT rate at a saving to the sector or cost to the Exchequer of &euro;250 million.  When one looks at all the other business supports that we have been able to provide through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and various other schemes, billions of euro in supports in business supports have been provided to keep businesses viable and, most importantly, to keep people working in what is a very important sector.</p> <p>  By way of clarification, there is no fee for awnings, canopies and heaters.  We have exempted them as well from planning, as the committee will be aware, on a permanent basis.  These regulations are extended to ensure that there will be no further fee for the remainder of this year for street licences for installing tables and chairs to facilitate the consumption of food outside hotels, restaurants, public houses and other establishments such as coffee shops.  That is being reduced on a time-limited basis for the current year from &euro;125 per table to zero.  Furthermore, it remains the position that no fee will be applied on a permanent basis, as I stated already, in respect of awnings, heaters and ancillary equipment.</p> <p>  Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, I am required to obtain Oireachtas approval for any exempted development regulations or regulations amending fees for street furniture licences.  Before I can sign them into law, I am presenting here to the committee.  I am grateful for the committee facilitating the time to do this.</p> <p>  This is an important measure.  Relatively small, costing in the region of &euro;500,000, it has impacts on particular local authorities such as Dublin City Council, DCC, and Cork.  We are working with them too on that.</p> <p>  This supports the outdoor dining experience for our citizens as well.  It supports the continued pedestrianisation of many of our streets, which I very much welcome.  I have had the pleasure of visiting many pedestrian streets in my constituency and throughout the country, in Cork, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other places.  It is something I would encourage local authorities to continue with.</p> <p>  This defrays some costs allowing businesses to supplement their income by additional dining facilities there.  It is a continued measure to support these businesses in post-pandemic times following the effect that the pandemic has had on their bottom line.</p> <p>  Further to today's presentation to the committee, these draft regulations will be subsequently approved by a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by the planning Act.</p><p>They will come into force as soon as they are signed by me, as Minister.  If approved by the Oireachtas, it will be my intention to sign the regulations into law at the very earliest opportunity.  It goes without saying that I will be happy to take any questions members of the committee have, or indeed comments or feedback. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien and thank him because I know he has a busy schedule.  I do not have any questions but I have some concerns.  I want to flag these concerns but first I recognise the constructive, imaginative and responsive approach that the Minister and his officials have taken in terms of addressing the challenges around Covid-19, around business and enterprise and developing new place-making.  I know this is central to the Minister's policy and he believes in it himself.  I have visited Malahide in the heart of his constituency, and the only thing I would do is straighten the hill but I cannot.  It is a great place.  You can see the buzz there.  However, that presents challenges.  I was talking to a number of the people there because I have taken the train many times from D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p></speech>

Will I meet the Minister in the Grand Hotel?  It is an amazing place.  It is similar in Dalkey, in Monkstown village and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, as well as in other parts of the country.  I acknowledge the importance and the significance and I believe it is here to stay.  We must be realistic.  It is good that it is here to stay.  It creates expanded opportunities for tourists but also for us, as people.  More people have discovered more about what is around the corner from their house as a result of Covid-19 in terms of open space and public realm and that it is brilliant.</p> <p>  I have two concerns.  One is that we do not allow what is a temporarily exempted development to become permanent development.  We have seen many badly-designed, hooked-up bits of wood, timber and awnings which are not very stable.  This is grand in an emergency but it is not how we should have it in the long term.  I am mindful that if we let things slip, before long seven years will pass and we will have these makeshift structures around the place.  I am very conscious of this in areas of architectural conservation but wherever they are, they should be right, safe and fit for purpose.  We need to be mindful of that in the long term.</p> <p>  More importantly, my real concern is on disability.  There is an Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters that has strongly advocated for the cleaning up and taking away of excessive street furniture, but more importantly, of A-boards.  A-boards are part of this clutter on our streets and I would like to see no A-boards for the next while because every time someone puts up an A-board that says &ldquo;my shoe shop is here&rdquo;, the next guy puts up another A-board.  I counted 25 A-boards in D&uacute;n Laoghaire the other day.  I am a former director of the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, which is a wonderful charity.  We are constantly approached and challenged about what we can do.  The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, is another organisation.  There is an awful lot of street clutter.  We know from public bodies and insurance companies that there is an excessive amount of claims in regard to public space and the public realm.  All we can do is put in measures.  I am not saying this needs legislation.  It needs a conversation with local authorities to ascertain how we can we stop the proliferation of A-boards, particularly in the interim while this is going on.  There is no need for them, quite frankly.  The second, question is how can we do a safety audit.  Most local authorities have a disability officer.  I suggest a simple letter from the Minister to the local authorities asking their disability officers to audit these structures on an ongoing basis, just to be sure they are not presenting an issue for children in buggies, people with disability and hearing- and visually-impaired people, because it is a genuine concern and a challenge for them.  We need to be mindful of that and address it.  </p> <p>  I have also seen a number of temporary, disabled parking spaces being taken out by local authorities.  I am shocked.  In Dublin, local authorities have taken out &ndash; I photographed them on my phone and I can share them with members &ndash; disability bays and have put up temporary flooring to facilitate the extension of the footpath.  Now we have a situation in some shops in Dublin city and county where the space we had for public realm seating has now become an area for displaying vegetables.  Some, only some, greedy retailers are taking advantage of that.  We need strict guidelines but it is about working practically with the disability officers and the local authorities to ensure it is monitored.</p> <p>  That is all.  I am not against it and I support the whole thing.  We do not need a whole plethora of legislation.  Let us keep this simple but let us engage and say to the local authorities that this is a challenge.  It is on a temporary basis.  It may go onto a permanent basis in the long term.  That is my concern for the disability sector and for people with buggies and so on.  We should be mindful not to develop some sort of a precedent or misunderstanding that these could become permanent structures without the proper and necessary planning consents.  I am supportive of it and will wrap up with the point that it is about engagement in the communication with the local authorities that they be mindful of these particular challenges.  I thank the Minister and his officials for coming to the committee.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022051200002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for his observations and his questions.  I very much appreciate his broad support for it.  We have been clear with local authorities.  Accessibility, particularly for those who may be physically impaired in any way is really important.  To go back to the letter to the committee from back in July 2021, we have been clear that is why the licensing system is in place.  It is so that someone would apply for a licence along with the plans and it is intended to ensure that a planning authority can control appliances being placed on public roads or footpaths in particular to prevent obstructions or other hazards to persons using the public road or footpath.  The responsibility is with the local authority in the assessment of the licence application or indeed in the granting of a further extension to a licence that may have expired.  That still pertains there.  I will come back to the issue of clutter because that is a bugbear of mine too.</p> <p>  A section 254 licence application has to ensure that the wider area is accessible, usable and convenient to all those who wish to use or pass through it, while also ensuring that any alternative street lay-out arrangements proposed in order to facilitate further outdoor dining such as relocation of designated, accessible bays on temporarily pedestrianised streets are appropriate and fit for that purpose.  I have seen cases where some accessible bays have been moved but I can speak for my own local authority, Fingal County Council, as I know the position well in Malahide.  It has been able to reassess where the accessible bays are and to move them to more appropriate places.  I can assure the Senator that they have all been replaced.  Across every local authority, if anyone has an example of any disabled-access parking place, if one is used for another purpose, it is replaced in order that there is no reduction in their number whatsoever.  It is clear under the Planning and Development Act 2000 that under this licence arrangement, licences have to be sought but the convenience and safety of road users, including pedestrians, is paramount.</p> <p>  I have also seen cases where local authorities have now moved on with more permanent plans.  I have been in Princes Street, Cork.  Cork City Council has done a fantastic job in bringing the streets back for use for the people, and frankly, taking cars off the streets.  We need to be doing that anyway.  In my view, one of the advantages to come out of dealing with an emergency situation like Covid-19 is that we have been able to expedite some of these measures.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did superb work in the Senator&rsquo;s area in regard to accessibility and active travel.  We want to see that.  Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan will also know this from the experience in Dublin Bay North, and the work that has been done throughout the country.  I encourage local authorities, which have the funding to do it, to look at permanent plans to improve the public realm.  We have to do it.  I have seen it myself.  I will use the example of my own home town that Senator Boyhan referenced where, for example, in New Street, Malahide, you will see families, kids on bikes and on scooters and people of all different ages having a cup of coffee or a bite to eat.  It actually takes a road space that had 39 parking places and traffic going up and down and gives it back to the people.  It takes a while.  Some people are wary of change and that is fine.  We have to work with people as we work through change, but it works and it supports business.  We are supporting business because we are supporting jobs.  We support vibrant towns, villages and city centres.  Look at Capel Street in Dublin, a place that was clogged with cars is now more accessible.  I can assure members that the principle behind all of this is to make sure that it is accessible for all our people and that no hindrance is put in the way of people who have issues with access.</p> <p>  As for the A-boards, it is a bugbear of mine too.  Some local authorities manage very good by-laws in that regard.</p><p>Fines may be issued and there are other ways of advertising where premises are.  That is managed through each roads department within local authorities.  We have no difficulty with the suggestion, and although it is a function of the local authority, we could encourage them further in that space.  I thank the Senator for his support and observations.  I wish him a happy birthday as well, if he does not mind me saying it before the committee.</p></speech>

Changes were made as a result of Covid-19 and they arose because of an unexpected situation.  They have given us the opportunity to re-examine this area of public policy, particularly for councillors around the country who deal with the question of street furniture in general.  In Ireland we have far too much street furniture and sometimes it is inadvertent, such as it is with junction boxes, bollards and all sorts of things that different sections of each local authority often put in.  When it comes to adding street furniture that might animate a space, such as tables, chairs, benches and so on, sometimes local authorities are very conservative.  One of the issues the authorities cite for the conservative approach is that national legislation outlines the fees and process for applying to use these kinds of tables and chairs.</p> <p>  I would like us to get to a point where we devolve this function entirely to local authorities.  I am not certain why we need national legislation to regulate tables and chairs on streets.  If we cannot let local authorities do it, I am not sure what we can let them do.  I very much have confidence in them in doing that.  In 2014, as chair of the economic committee on Dublin City Council, I dealt with a report on table and chair usage in outside areas.  We found that there may be places, particularly in outer suburbs, where we would want to put table and chairs to animate villages because we wanted businesses to thrive but to do it in places like Raheny, Finglas or Ballymun, businesses had to go through the exact same procedure and process as somebody who wanted to do it on Grafton Street.  There was no recognition that these were totally different requests.  In one case it may have been about retailers taking public space and using it for profit but in the other, such action may form part of a broader push by a community to make villages better.</p> <p>  I appreciate this can be a very contentious issue between retailers, even if it is just about pedestrianisation.  It is really not a space in which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government should be involved.  It is a space for local authorities.  I say to the Minister that, when it comes to the trajectory of the matter, I would like to see this responsibility completely devolved.</p> <p>  We would have to see some uniform standards, and the points made by Senator Boyhan, including around disability concerns, should be paramount.  We must be very careful not to do anything against them.  Equally, we must recognise the space we are discussing is public so there should not be a for-profit advantage to be gained for one retailer over another or different forms of competition.</p> <p>  Nevertheless we want to animate our spaces and have a night-time economy.  We have very restrictive national legislation that limits a local authority's ability to create an outdoor food court at night.  There would have to be a process for an event licence or casual trading licence.  This is something I would like to see the local authority doing rather than the Department.  I hope it is something we will be able to get to over time.</p></speech>

He mentioned communities, and where any of them want to install street furniture, seats, bedding or whatever else, the local authority does not need a licence.  I encourage any groups to enhance their public space.  Much good public realm work has been done throughout the country and there are very good plans in our towns and villages, both rural and urban.  Community groups are encouraged to engage on that and see what they want.  The local authority, based on agreement, can move forward and does not require a licence.</p> <p>  I know the Deputy knows that today we are seeking to extend the waiver of the fee.  That is to support retailers and jobs in a particular sector that has been so badly affected by Covid-19.  Secondary to that, we have used the opportunity to look at how we can use our spaces better.  The legislation outlines the process and the licensing process in the local authority.  Effectively, the decision-making on the granting of a licence is a devolved power to the local authority because the authority is in a better position to make that decision.  It will know that one street is better than another and what is appropriate in terms of accessibility, along with what business and types of functions can happen.</p> <p>  The measures around pedestrianisation through the Covid-19 period have been broadly welcomed.  In some cases they were initially contentious but people have seen how they worked right through the winter and not just in summer months.  It is about making our towns and villages-----</p></speech>

There is still too much specification about what needs to happen for someone to apply for this.  For example, there is a big space in Ballymun with the plaza and the Axis theatre.  I have no doubt they could put out tables and chairs on the plaza and it would make things safer and there would be passive policing.  These are all positive, but to do this, the parties involved need to put a notice in the newspaper, apply to the local authority and give a drawing of where they would put everything.  The fees are specified in legislation but I know we are waiving them now.  Overall, it is a level of central control that the Irish State is hooked on.  I do not see why we should establish that type of both process and fee structure at a national level.  I would like to see it at a local government level with protection for people with disabilities.</p> <p>  It is not what we are discussing today and I welcome the waiver because it gives us more time.  Getting to a point where we look at this again, I would not like to see a national fee but rather a fee structure or the freedom for a fee structure allowing us to incentivise this work.  In some cases it could be the council going to businesses and asking them to put out tables and chairs because it wants streets to be more animated.  It may want more tables and chairs in an area that is difficult to police because it might add to passive policing.  It may not be about businesses looking for profit but rather local authorities trying to animate the space.</p></speech>

I take the point made but the Deputy can trust me when I say we are not trying to micromanage anything at a local authority level.  The devolved power on decisions is for them.  Taking the Axis theatre and the plaza in Ballymun, which I know well, if that centre makes an application, it will need to give some view or picture through the licence application to Dublin City Council of what it will look like.  That is required for assessment of disability access etc.  The process has been pretty efficient over the past two years and we have learned much from Covid-19 in that space about how we can be pragmatic and efficient.  Most important, we have seen how people get benefits from this.  It is not just a measure for profits in retailers in any way, shape or form and it is about giving our public spaces back to people.</p></speech>

We could devolve more power to the local authorities and it is one thing we could do.  I know it has been done in housing, for example, and we should do it more.</p></speech>

I fully support the extension of the waiver.  It is a very sensible move and we supported it when it was introduced.  One of the very positive actions in the past year or year and a half is that we have seen these measures and the difficulties of many businesses, especially bars and restaurants, in having to try new things.  Those new things have proven that outdoor activities work.  We were speaking earlier about the example in the Minister's constituency of Malahide.  The work there is wonderful and brought much vibrancy to that part of the village.  There are also examples in the city centre here, including on South Anne Street, South William Street and Capel Street.  It is really good to see and, in fairness, I acknowledge it.</p> <p>  It is important as we move ahead to ensure this continues to be done right.  I have five very quick questions that I would not mind the Minister responding to.  They do not necessarily speak specifically to the extension of the waiver but they are relevant to it.</p> <p>  Despite the waiving of the licence fee, we are getting much unlicensed street furniture, which causes all sorts of difficulties in managing that furniture etc.  Is the Minister aware of that problem and is the Department discussing with local authorities about how best to address it?  The particular problem is with people who are visually impaired or other mobility issues.  It is really important when we do the right thing with outdoor activity that we do not in any way inhibit what is already a very difficult environment for the visually impaired or wheelchair users etc.</p><p>Is that something the Minister or his officials are concerned about and thinking about?</p><p> There is an issue around protected structures and awnings.  It is not that I want to be in any way restrictive but we need to manage this stuff right, especially in areas where we have very valuable built heritage.  Has the Minister any thoughts on that and particularly the position from January of next year?</p><p> Another concern I have is not far from here some entrepreneurial drinks manufacturers have started providing the partitions for the outdoor spaces and are using these as free alcohol advertising.  That is contrary to both the letter and spirit and policy of Government policy and legislation.  Is that something the Minister is aware of or concerned about and is there something that can be done to ensure it does not happen?</p><p> My final point is that it will always come down to the fact all these things are only as good as the ability of the local authorities to manage them, process the licensing and enforce them.  I spoke to officials in a number of local authorities yesterday and today.  They are concerned their enforcement and licensing capacity is limited.  Dublin City Council, in particular, has concerns as it is losing many staff to other local authorities.  Is the Minister satisfied there is appropriate staffing there?  Where local authorities are looking for additional staffing to manage this how can he assist them?</p></speech>

We appreciate it.</p> <p>  Unlicensed street furniture is an issue in places.  I am aware of it.  To answer his question directly, the Roads Act allows the local authorities to remove material on the public road, or indeed the pathway, that is unlicensed.  That requires resources - to speak to the last point the Deputy made - to have the capacity to do so.  We have engaged with our local authorities.  We have over the past year, as he will see, provided further posts, especially in the housing area.  There are approximately 350 right across the country.  We are working through the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and County and City Management Association, CCMA, to see what further resources will be required in this space.  It is kind of acute in our own city of Dublin, Cork, Galway, though it has a better tradition of pedestrianisation, and others.  We are engaging.  I am particularly conscious of DCC because much has happened very quickly.  We discussed this with officials as well and are engaging through the CCMA and LGMA, with DCC and any other local authority that feels it needs further assistance in this space by way of resources.  I assure the committee and the Deputy that any reasonable request for additional resources in this space will be met positively.</p></speech>

DCC gets a bad enough rap for all sorts of things.  Some of them are its fault and some are not.  It is important the public know at this point in time businesses are being given the opportunity for outdoor furniture for free and, therefore, there is no reason somebody should not have a licence at this point in time.</p></speech>

I agree completely.  We need to ensure this affords an opportunity for us to further advise people and publicise the fact the regime is being extended and people can apply.  They can apply for new licences and extension of licences and those will be granted where appropriate.  It speaks to what Deputy McAuliffe was saying earlier.  It is devolved to the local authority officials as they are the best people to make the decision and we are not putting in street furniture in places that are inappropriate or going to hinder people in getting about their daily lives.</p> <p>  On protected structures and awnings, I mentioned in my opening statement that we have exempted outdoor heaters, awnings and so on full stop.  If a person wanted to put an awning on a protected structure he or she would require planning permission.</p></speech>

With some areas of architectural conservation, protected structures and so on planning permission will be required.  It is an important point and I am glad to have the opportunity to further clarify that here.</p> <p>  The point about the use of the partitions being mainly used by drinks firms is interesting.  I have seen it right across the place.  It is something I will raise.  The Government, and in fairness the Oireachtas, have moved in a direction on drinks advertising that we all support.  Over the past two years, many of the larger drinks manufacturers provided awnings, umbrellas and various other items free of charge to businesses that were struggling.  We now need to look at how we can use a more uniform approach.  In some counties they have.  New Street was referenced.  The Deputy will see the local authority has provided the street furniture as well as the awnings and partitions in order that they are uniform.  They look better, frankly, as they are not a mish-mash of various drinks brands and so on.  Again, that is something some local authorities have been pushing and others have not.  I take that point and will pursue it.</p></speech>

In many ways the hospitality sector was almost accidentally revolutionised by restrictions during Covid.  Just last December I found myself having a late-night drink outdoors outside Courtney's in Lucan, one of my locals.  I would never have dreamed of doing that during the height of winter a couple of years ago and I'm sure Courtney's would not have dreamed of offering it as somewhere to dine at that point in time.  It is cold, it is dark, it does not make sense and yet it does.  It is completely and utterly practical.  It makes sense from a business perspective and creates a very enjoyable and, at the time, safe social experience.</p> <p>  Many businesses in the hospitality sector used that as an opportunity to increase their footprint.  Some of them did it in car parks or in backyards.  I am thinking of the graveyard in Kenny's in Lucan.  Others did it spilling onto the streets.  That is the street furniture aspect we are discussing in the context of our public spaces.  During Covid, we all got to see the value of the public realm.  Local authorities up and down the country, including my own South Dublin County Council, invested hugely in the upkeep of the public realm during that time when we as a society really needed it.  Street furniture injects vibrancy into villages and for that reason what the Minister is bringing is really welcome.  However, it only injects vibrancy when it does not spill out onto the street in a way that becomes a trip hazard or in any way inhibits accessibility and when it is aesthetically pleasing and fits with the character of a village.  Thinking in particular of the winter months when some places might store their items up, we should not allow dismantled outdoor areas on footpaths.  We need to ensure that is not happening but I absolutely welcome this.</p></speech>

I fully support these measures, the extension of them and their possibly being made permanent.  It has led to a resurgence of the hospitality industry and to a very positive public space and amenity.  However, at the same time during Covid we have seen a proliferation of coffee bars popping up in former car showrooms, car parks and areas that are not aligned to existing hospitality provisions.  It is not aligned to particular bars or restaurants at the moment but places that were not heretofore hospitality venues.  I am a little concerned that in the new culture we are embracing we are discriminating and setting businesses back, or perhaps with a lack of enforcement facilitating unlicensed competition for existing premises and service providers.  This is by virtue of our now having this casual provision that is not, in many cases, going through proper licensing and is not subjected to the proper provisions, even though they look like they are.  It is aligned to this so I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Higgins is correct when she refers to places being used that one would never have thought would be and referenced two bars in Lucan.  It helps them and also improves the experience for people.  It makes them more accessible in many instances and uses space that was not used before.  The Department with responsibility for enterprise worked with my own Department and, as members have seen, a lot of parklets were put in through Covid.</p><p>To be honest, some of them could be improved on in terms of how they look, but their retention should be considered and I encourage local authorities to do that rather than deciding to remove them now that the pandemic is over.  Frankly, we can do with fewer car parking paces and we will have to do that - to change how we do things - if we are serious about the active travel piece, which we are as a Government and an Oireachtas.  I do not want spaces that have been used more productively being given back over to cars.  I encourage local authorities to consider how best they can make permanent the measures that were taken through Covid.  They should do so through the proper processes and with the aim of improving our public realms throughout.</p><p> Senator Seery Kearney mentioned enforcement, which is really important.  A local authority can withdraw a licence if the holder does not adhere to the conditions of the licence.  Local authorities need the resources to do so and we will provide them where they have insufficient resources.  I have seen the proliferation of coffee bars and vans and things like that.  They served a great purpose right through Covid.  There is a coffee bar at St. Sylvester's, my local Gaelic games club.  It is run by a couple of lads who are doing a great job.  They are getting an income and the business is licensed.  No one would have thought of that before.  I could pick 100 such businesses.  I take the Senator's point in respect of unlicensed operators who may be competing against ratepayers.  That is something we have to balance.  I take that point completely.  That is the reason for licensing and the fact that carrying out a commercial enterprise in a particular area, for example, requires planning permission.</p><p> People's outlook on how they shop, dine, get a cup of coffee and go out and about has been really positive through Covid and we want to harness that.  What I want to do with this one small measure, added to a lot of others, is to make it easier for people to do their business outdoors and to be able to walk or cycle to places safely, park their bike and have a cup of coffee or tea.  I am grateful for the support of the committee in this regard.  As I stated, I will certainly take members' comments on board.  We have an opportunity now to harness the good things in the context of how we managed our public spaces through Covid and make them more permanent.</p></speech>

Some very good points have been made in respect of the importance of enforcement and how it has to be resourced to ensure this does not impact on people with disabilities.  We have seen that public space being put back into public use works best when it is done in a managed and planned way.  New Street in Malahide is a very good example of that, as is D&uacute;n Laoghaire and what has happened in Cork city.  That is not to take away from what others have done elsewhere.  When it is done on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, however, it can be a bit more chaotic and create more problems.  Local authorities should be encouraged and resourced to do this in a planned, coherent and managed way.  That is the way to go and it should be supported.</p><p>I wish to ask the Minister about two related measures he is bringing in.  This is very much about putting life back into towns, villages and public spaces.  He recently announced that he is getting rid of the full rates refund that many local authorities sometimes got in the context of vacant commercial units.  That is a very welcome measure.  I flagged with him previously that there is a loophole, especially in the context of newer commercial units that may have been built ten or 15 years ago but are not fully completed.  They are still considered shells and my understanding is that they have never been subject to rates, so they escape from paying rates and, potentially, from the measure being considered by the Minister.  Does he have a plan to shut down that loophole?  How will he address it?  It is important that he does so.</p><p>I refer to the other measures he announced recently in terms of getting more development into cities through the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund and the subsidies for developers in the context of apartments and viability.  Developers consider a viable project to be one including a minimum of 15% profit margin.  Will that viability allow for that 15% profit margin?  What measures will be in place to curtail that?  What is the view of the Minister in that regard?</p></speech>

As regards the first issue he raised, some local authorities have taken a very good and planned approach, with uniform barriers and awnings and that type of thing.  We want to encourage that because it improves aesthetics.  Other local authorities need support to make sure that is improved and we will do that.  There is a need to consider uniform measures and what best suits the town or village.  We have learned a lot in the past two years.  In fairness, much of it had to happen very quickly.  It was right and proper that it happened.  We can now refine it.</p> <p>  As regards the commercial rates waiver for vacant units, I am serious about doing that.  I noted the Deputy's comments in this regard in the D&aacute;il when we were debating this issue last week.  The current situation is that owners of vacant commercial properties in most local authorities may have a right to a refund of up to 100% of their commercial rates if the premises are vacant, they cannot get reasonable rent or they are planning to redevelop the premises.  Using new regulations under section 9 of the Local Government Act, however, I intend to restrict that use of commercial rates vacancy refunds, although I will give local authorities discretion in that regard.  It may be reasonable to allow a refund, such as in the case of a power station, for the sake of argument.  I refer to the power station in Lanesborough that is currently vacant.  We have to work through it.  It seems simple to say that we do not give a rates waiver on anything that is vacant.  We are going to give local authorities the ability, however, to say that a shop is not open, has not been open and is not finished.</p> <p>  As regards the point in respect of what were seen as newer developments that are not completed, mar dhea, I am considering that too.  The Deputy referenced Clongriffin in particular in our previous discussion on this.  It is a valid point.  There are units that were built there in 2008 or 2009 that are still not occupied and are availing of the refund.  We are working through this right now.   We flagged it.  It will start from next year.  We will need that lead-in time.  In effect, it will give local authorities the ability to tell property owners that they will not get a rates waiver on a premises or, in some instances, decide that they can get a waiver for a valid reason.  I have given the example of State infrastructure that is being repurposed.  That discretion has to be allowed.</p> <p>  As regards the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund, which is a viability fund, it is clearly focused on inactivated planning permissions in the five major cities.

While the waivers of fee are welcome, it was a short-term and temporary measure, albeit one that identified a problem of which many people had been aware for a long time.  I refer to the lack of flexibility in respect of having things like markets and open markets in Dublin.  I worked with the Dublin Flea Market for a long time, trying to get a space for it.  Eventually, the company had to be wound up.</p><p>I have worked with groupings that were looking at having night markets along the same lines that are in places such as Thailand.  Every stage of that process was interrupted by either bureaucracy or local authorities saying that they could not help because they did not have the powers to do it.  I welcome these measures.  I take on board all the points that have been made, for example, on the private annexing of public space and disability access.  </p><p> I am very glad the Minister commented on how we need to tackle the car culture in our city and making it more liveable, walkable and bikeable.  That is very important.  However, there is a much wider issue in this regard of devolved powers to local governments to allow them to set their own by-laws when it comes to traffic management in certain areas in order to provide, say, for outdoor markets.  This is a welcome step, but we need to go much further.  Has the Minister plans for a review of this or to bring forward legislation that would devolve this power to local authorities?</p></speech>

As I mentioned to Deputy McAuliffe earlier, the operation of licence arrangements, even prior to Covid, is a devolved power to local authorities.  They decide whether to grant or refuse a licence, what type of licence they give and what is included in that licence.  This means the scope of it, for example, how much street furniture is allowed.  It is rightly with them.  All local authority functions have a basis in primary legislation.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 just sets out the process.  The application of it and the granting of licences and all that is devolved to local authorities.  I have said it here, I have heard it from a number of Senators and Deputies, and I have heard it particularly from Dublin City Council, DCC, to be fair, and Cork City Council , that where more licences than other local authorities have to be processed, sometimes additional resources are required, and we will provide them.  I would positively look at any reasonable request that come in.</p> <p>  To be fair, we learned a lot over the past two years as to how, perhaps, where licences were not granted before, they were this time.  I talk about New Street in my own town of Malahide.  There have been talks about pedestrianisation or partial pedestrianisation and what we would do going back to 2004.  It is the same in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other places as well.  We have seen that in South Anne Street too.  It has been done, so people can actually see how it works now, which is a very good thing.  </p> <p>  If there is a refinement required in the process at a local authority level, it is open to the local authority to do that.  All we are doing is setting out the basis for granting the licences under the Act.  The operation of it is with the local authorities.  I assure the Senator that they have as much as devolved powers as they need in this space to be able to look after their own areas.  </p> <p>  I fully support what she said.  I want to make sure that our cities, towns and villages are more accessible, walkable and bikeable and that we reduce the dependency on cars and make every town, village and part of our city allow for the pedestrian, family and cyclist first.  We should not allow for the car first.  A situation that we have seen work very well through Covid is that people are now able to sit down and have a cup of coffee or tea on their main streets or paths and enjoy what is there, and spend more time in their towns and villages with their families and friends.  That is what it should be about.</p></speech>

We will have two sessions today.  The first session will consider the issue of protecting the right of the child to his or her history and identity, including his or her genetic, gestational and social origins, and ensuring that existing children born through international surrogacy arrangements can exercise their right to their history and identity, including their genetic, gestational and social origins.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, and his colleagues, Ms Sarah Groarke and Dr. Karen McAuley.  I also welcome clinical child psychologist Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill, who is attending online.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory relating to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.  I remind those present to wear masks where possible throughout the meeting.  </p></speech>

I apologise for not being able to make it in person.  Advances in reproductive technologies present challenges to us all.</p><p>Medical advances and new technologies have plunged mental health professionals and legal professionals into ethical and psychological quandaries that were unimagined prior to the birth of Louise Brown, the firstborn IVF baby, in 1978.</p><p> For nearly a century, the world of psychology believed that the welfare of children was best served in a family where a child lived with two biological heterosexual parents.  This view has been challenged by recent advancements in technology, which have invited us all to embrace a much wider and more inclusive definition of "family".  Psychology has been playing catch-up with medical advances, and all of the advances in thinking need to be enshrined in our legislation.</p><p> Mental health professionals have voiced many concerns but, over time, the longitudinal studies in the areas of surrogacy and other assisted technologies have allayed some of these.  I will briefly set out some of the concerns psychologists had when these technologies became more widely available.  Would the array of new family forms impact negatively on parent-child relationships and children's psychological development?  Would children with surrogate mothers have some sense of having two mothers, which might then impact on their attachment to their social-biological mothers?  Would some of the challenges that arise in adoption arise with surrogacy?  In 2011, Dr. David Brodzinsky highlighted that secrecy about origins and non-disclosure of adoption were associated with poorer outcomes for adopted children.  This prompted concerns about how information about assisted conceptions might be imparted to children.  Would these families be stigmatised or marginalised by societal norms and culture if there was an ethos of disclosure?  How could legislation respect the child's right to his or her history and identity and ensure marginalisation was not a feature?  How could best practice in the provision of transparency and access to records be ensured?</p></speech>

I believe Professor Susan Golombok and Dr. Vasanti Jadva will be appearing before the committee in a couple of weeks' time.  They have undertaken extensive research and longitudinal studies in this area.  I will reference their 2012, 2015 and 2017 studies.  They have addressed many of the concerns that psychologists and other mental health professionals might have had.  In a longitudinal study, they followed four groups of children: egg donation families; gamete donation families; 42 children born through surrogacy; and a control group.  The families were studied when the children were aged one year, two years, three years, seven years, ten years and 14 years.  They referred to this as the sixth phase of their longitudinal study.</p> <p>  Their research findings were heartening.  At all ages, attachment measures - child-parent relationship measures - supported that children born into any of the assisted reproductive technology, ART, groups rated slightly better on attachment measures than the families in the control group.  Part of this good early attachment was put down to the fact that these were very wanted children.  The absence of a gestational connection did not interfere with development of positive parent-child relationships.  Fathers were slightly less involved at the one year mark in the sperm donation group, but this difference was no longer evident when the children were three years old.  In the surrogacy group, there was slight dip in measures of children's psychological adjustment at seven years of age.  This was to be expected, as it is at this time that children develop an awareness of the biology of reproduction.  At seven years of age, less than 50% in the ART donor groups had told their children about their conception.  In the surrogacy group, almost all parents had told their children.  At the one year mark, 90% of families were still in contact with surrogate mothers.  At ten years, 60% were in touch.  The failure to tell children was generally related to parents' fear of othering their children.</p> <p>  The concerns regarding the legal position of children born through surrogacy needs to be addressed urgently.  Interestingly, an eminent psychologist in this area - Dr. Mali Mann - made a Freudian slip in a paper she was presenting a number of years ago.  In so doing, though, she coined the terms "birth other" and "biological other", clearly defining the social mother as the person with the mothering function.  Donors and surrogates had an "other than mothering" function.  We urgently need legislation to protect the relationship these children have with their functioning mothers and to afford them all the legal privileges, inheritance rights and so on afforded children who are not born through surrogacy.  The State needs to legislate to ensure existing children and all future children have access to their histories and identities.  In some extreme situations, access to the history of two donors and one surrogate may be required.  The legislation needs to be agile so that future technologies, whatever they may be, can be accommodated.</p> <p>  The preponderance of research in adoption and surrogacy studies points to the value of full disclosure.  Children's responses to being told vary from interested and curious to totally disinterested.  They are seldom distressed.  When children are introduced at a young age to information about their parentage, outcomes are better.  Fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies should be required to support parents in introducing age appropriate information about parentage at a very early age.  An undertaking to do so should be mandated by these agencies and psychological support should be offered.</p> <p>  Parents' reluctance to disclose to their children has been linked to a lack of education on why and how to do this and fears their children will be marginalised.  Changes in legislation can pave the way for inclusion of previously marginalised groups, as we have clearly seen in recent years with progressive legislation regarding gay marriages, divorce etc.  Legislation that includes new family formations protects the needs and rights of children and families.  Just because people become parents in non-conventional ways does not make them less capable parents.  Legislation needs to treat all of our children equally and to offer children born through surrogacy all the privileges offered to children born in more conventional ways.  Their choice to trace or not to trace their parentage will be an individual choice, but access to records about their births and-or parentage should be made accessible to them in early adulthood.</p></speech>

Our office submitted our full observations on Monday.  Therefore, I will only hit on a number of important points in this statement.</p> <p>  As committee members are aware, the Ombudsman for Children's Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body that was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Under that Act, the OCO has two core statutory functions: to promote the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age; and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.</p><p>Our office has previously expressed the view, and continues to hold the view, that provision should be made in law for the rights of all children in Ireland born through surrogacy.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 presents a significant opportunity to provide clarity for children who will be, and have been, born through domestic and international surrogacy.  However, as outlined in our office's observations, we are of the view that the Bill, as it stands, does not have sufficient regard to children&rsquo;s rights and that a number of issues need to be considered further to ensure the Bill will be child centred and rights based.</p><p> Ireland has an obligation under international law to respect, protect and fulfil the rights set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, for all children in Ireland born through domestic or international surrogacy.  In this regard, we are concerned about the absence of provision in the Bill for children born through international surrogacy and the Bill&rsquo;s silence as regards children already born through a domestic or international surrogacy arrangement.  The OCO acknowledges concerns that a double standard may arise if parental orders are granted in respect of a child born through commercial surrogacy abroad.  The objective of maintaining the integrity of a domestic prohibition of commercial surrogacy is understandable.  However, categorically excluding the possibility of recognising the relationship between a child born through international surrogacy and his or her intending parents will have immediate and grave consequences for the child and is contrary to the UNCRC and the European Convention on Human Rights.  We recommend, therefore, that the Bill include provision both for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and for retrospective assignment of parentage and parental responsibility in both domestic and international surrogacy arrangements.</p><p> Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that the best interests of the child be treated as a primary consideration in all decisions relating to a surrogacy arrangement that affects the child.  Although this principle is partially reflected in some of the Part 7 provisions of the Bill concerning surrogacy, we believe these provisions can be strengthened to align the Bill fully with the principle set out in the UNCRC and the standard set out in Article 42A of the Constitution.  Therefore, we recommend that the Bill explicitly provide that all decisions made in respect of a surrogacy arrangement that affect the child must have regard to the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</p><p> We welcome the fact the Bill provides for the recording of information relating to the origins of children born through domestic surrogacy on a national surrogacy register and that it allows children aged 16 and 17 to apply to obtain such information.  However, we believe further attention needs to be given to the provisions relating to children&rsquo;s access to information, with a view to aligning the Bill fully with children&rsquo;s right to preserve their identity under Article 8 of the UNCRC and with an approach that respects the evolving capacities of children.  In this regard, we encourage consideration to be given to amending the Bill to provide that information on the origins of children born through international surrogacy and children already born through surrogacy must be recorded, and to provide that applications to obtain identifying and non-identifying information on origins may be made by a child or on behalf of a child by the child&rsquo;s parents or guardian, without limitations as to the child&rsquo;s age.</p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to any questions.</p></speech>

Ms Nic Dhomhnaill referred to the longitudinal studies and stated that disclosure may not happen where there is a lack of education or understanding of why it should, or where there is a fear of othering the child, yet best-practice experience in psychology suggests and strongly supports the idea that full disclosure from the very beginning is the correct way forward for the child.  One of the difficulties in parents' discussions relates to what sort of language happens in this context and how to equip children with age-appropriate words in order that they will have an understanding of what is private information versus what can be publicly shared.  I would welcome Ms Nic Dhomhnaill&rsquo;s thoughts on that and on how we could best build in a mechanism that would ensure that parents would be equipped to have those discussions and on how they can be continuously supported.  Most important, how best can the child be continuously supported in that regard?</p> <p>  Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's area of expertise relates to cases where there is family breakdown and the effect of separation on children.  As the law stands, mothers of children born via surrogacy are in an especially vulnerable position in Ireland because they have no legal relationship with their child and, therefore, in a case of family relationship breakdown, there is often a weaponising of that child to the detriment of both the child and the mother with whom, as Ms Nic Dhomhnaill pointed out, the child might have had a very good relationship.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caoimhe Nic Dhomhnaill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#C00400"><p>On the telling of the child, in my clinical practice I approach that by telling him or her that he or she has been co-created, in order that the parents will be supported with their telling of the child.  My experience has been that the parents' level of comfort or discomfort with what is disclosed to the child steers what they are going to say.  The success of telling a child relates very much to whether the parents have mourned their journey through infertility and are then in a position to deal with the reality of what they need to say to the child.  I think we are all agreed the best practice is disclosure and the longitudinal studies point to that.</p> <p>  The disclosure needs to happen in a very age-appropriate way.  I heard a story of a little boy in a GP's waiting room recently saying aloud that he had three mothers.  It needs to be done in such a way that the child will know where it is appropriate or not appropriate to say it, without stigmatising the surrogacy in any way for the child.</p> <p>  Another issue that often is not considered relates to the fantasies children may have about a surrogate mother, and this is where education and some psychological support is of great benefit.  Much work that has been done shows that if a parent, or any idea of a parent, is absent, the fantasies of the child has of that absent other will, invariably, be extreme.  They can involve a fantasy of, say, a very benign figure who might come and rescue the child in adolescence when he or she gets into conflict with his or her parents, or they can be malevolent, whereby there can be a fear that the surrogate mother might eventually come and want to kidnap him or her.  They are the aspects psychologists can help with.  More psychological support needs to be provided to help people with that disclosure to uncover the fantasies a child might have.</p> <p>  Children can also sometimes have a fantasy that his or her mum and dad have gone to a lot of trouble to get the child.  That is important because if a child thinks that is the case, whether because they travelled to Ukraine or wherever, that can leak out in the child thinking he or she has to be good.  Many of the issues I have seen with children born through surrogacy arriving into the practice have related to how the information has been given to the child.</p><p>I agree with the Senator regarding weaponising.  The most tragic cases I have seen in family breakdown have been when assisted reproduction has been weaponised in the legal battle and custody.  I fully support the legislation to protect the rights of biological and non-biological mothers in surrogacy so that this cannot be weaponised when people separate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1820" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#D00200"><p>In that regard, the reason for surrogacy, certainly for heterosexual couples, is generally because the woman cannot carry a child to full term.  In a second relationship, the father may go on to have other children.  In that regard, I have seen the role and access of the mother diminishing as siblings are born and that where there is a very strong bond and attachment between the mother and child, there is a loss the child experiences as the mother cannot go in and argue her access rights because she is afraid.  My view is that the Judiciary would be very sympathetic in such a situation, but who would want to be the mother to test that?  The impact of that on the child and the possible confusion for the child would be significant.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  To follow on from the remarks of Senator Seery Kearney in respect of information given to the child, how does early discussion about a child's identity impact his or her understanding and how he or she feels about the conception method?</p> <p>  Public services are limited and have long waiting lists.  What solutions or systems do our guests envisage to enable children to quickly and easily access counselling when it is needed?  That question keeps coming up with me recently.</p></speech>

All the research points to very good outcomes.  I remember when I started work with children born through IVF, there was always speculation as to how these children would do and how the disclosure would affect them.  The children are doing well.  I would not move towards a belief that these children will need counselling.  What is really important, however, is how they are told.  The fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies may well have a role in that regard in, first, considering with people why they might tell or not tell and hearing their ambivalence about doing so.  Senator Seery Kearney spoke about weaponising in family breakdown.  The most heartbreaking situations I have seen in family breakdown are when the children are told at the point of the breakdown.  That can be prevented by going back and making sure early disclosure happens in an age-appropriate way.</p></speech>

What is his recommendation or what does he see in that regard?  Services are currently limited, with long waiting lists.  What option could be considered?  I totally agree with his remarks in his opening statement in respect of children's rights and the best interests of the child.  For me, that is the priority here and I welcome that.  I know it is his priority as well.  I totally agree with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#D00600"><p>As regards what has already been said, Ms Nic Dhomhnaill put it very well.  The idea here is that we need to start the conversation long before the child is born.  The intended and surrogate parents, as well as the clinics and any other parties that may be involved, need to discuss how this will work once the child is born.  The information needs to be clear.   There is a need to gather that information.  As we stated, we recommend that children get full access to information when they desire it.  As such, that information has to be gathered.  If one is gathering it, one needs to educate the people involved that the child be informed as soon as possible in the appropriate way, as Ms Nic Dhomhnaill stated.  That is the way forward.  It is about how one minimises any trauma that may come from the circumstances.  I refer to the idea that children always wonder who their parents are and what they thought about them.  Whatever the parental background is, children try to figure it out.  If one is honest and open with a child in an age-appropriate manner, things become much easier.  That has to happen with the professionals with whom the child deals.  For example, the GP, the gynaecologist and anyone who had interaction with the child in the first few years has to be honest and open about the background.  Those are the sorts of things that need to be considered.  That is a question of culture as well as public services.</p></speech>

Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's remarks in respect of this already happening are very important.  There are stories from the background that can be put out there and from which we need to protect children and families.  It is about trying to prevent future trauma.  The best interests of the child are very clear in that regard.</p></speech>

We have heard some lovely stories and what I have taken from them is the need to ensure we are listening to the stories and what our guests are saying and then get the Bill right.  That is what the families and surrogate parents want.  This will be a really good Bill but we need to ensure we address all the issues going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#D01000"><p>I thank Ms Nic Dhomnhnaill and Dr. Muldoon for their statements this morning.  There is no doubt these children are very wanted children.  We have seen that in recent weeks via testimony of parents who have come before the committee.  However, it is clear from the discussion this morning that there is a Pandora's box of psychological issues surrounding surrogacy.  My first question is for Ms Nic Dhomhnaill.  As a person who works in the area of child psychology, particularly in the context of families where the parents are undergoing a divorce, she has obviously seen cases where children feel some form of responsibility or guilt for the separation of their parents.  That can tie into feelings of abandonment that can be very damaging to a child's sense of self and strong core identity.  I ask her to comment on the possible psychological effects of a child finding out that he or she was conceived through surrogacy and then having to wait until attaining the age of 16 or 17 to request identifying information that he or she will possibly never receive.</p><p>My second question is for Dr. Muldoon.  I wish to put on record comments by the commissioner for children's rights in Ukraine, where commercial surrogacy is common and, indeed, a growing business.  The Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Children's Rights, Mykola Kuleba, has stated that surrogacy in Ukraine is unregulated and violates children's rights.  According to him, surrogacy is the exploitation of women by private businesses in order to earn income and meet the needs of adults, but it violates children's rights.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	I am categorically against commercial surrogacy.  It is the objectification of the child and its positioning as a commodity. </blockquote> <p>What is the view of Dr. Muldoon on those comments?  How does he consider that surrogacy protects the best interests of the child, their right to identity and their access to origins?  It leaves these children in statelessness for years because adults have focused on their rights rather than those of the child.</p><p>Dr. Muldoon's role as Ombudsman for Children involves the investigation of complaints about services provided to children by public organisations.  On Tuesday, Deputy O'Gorman apologised on behalf of the Government to all of those who had been hurt by the legacy of illegal birth registrations in this country.  Is it possible that the complex nature of international surrogacy and particularly the manner in which the rights of the children, surrogates, donors and prospective legal parents can come into conflict may lead to a future apology to persons who are hurt by this system being necessary?</p></speech>

My understanding and reading of the research is that the surrogate mothers do not have an intention to have and rear a child and that becoming a parent is about the intention to become a parent.  The surrogates are reporting non-attachment to the children in question.  I am in favour of legislation and of disclosure to children based on the view of Dr. Mali Mann, who has done a lot of research in the area, which I have mentioned.  That view is that the surrogate mother should not be promoted in the child's eyes to a status that is in any way on par with that of the social or functioning mother.  That is really important in the disclosure.  The surrogate mother should be disclosed as another person who assisted in the child's coming into the world while the absolute significance of the functioning parents is maintained.</p> <p>  On the age at which children should have access to their records, I am not sure.  I would need more time to think about it.  I would have thought 18 but I am hearing discussion of 16 or 17 this morning.  On the basis of my background in child psychology and adolescent psychology in particular, I would say that there is a peak of adolescence at which issues of identity reach a crisis point.  This is referred to as the individuation stage of adolescence.  All of the crises, including anorexia, bulimia and self-harm, are much more likely in what we call the middle phase of adolescence, the ages between 14 and 16.  It is really important to consider the developmental stages of adolescence and to look to the age at which someone can seek out their records as being one beyond that peak of adolescence.  I am not sure that the age of 16 is beyond that peak.  That is my concern.  It might be used as a weapon against the biological or functioning parent.  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon would like to address the other issues.</p></speech>

I will also mention that the question of yesterday's apology is not relevant to today's committee meeting so there is no obligation to respond.</p></speech>

From our point of view, we are against commercial surrogacy.  We are very clear in that regard.  The best interests of children need to be protected from the possible exploitation of anybody, whether child or mother.  We are in agreement on that.  We also believe that the rights of children need to be protected by legislating and creating opportunities now.  That is what this committee is here for.  This is about creating an opportunity so that there will be no future need to apologise to anybody.  A great amount of work is being done with regard to international rights standards.  I might ask my colleague, Ms Groarke, to go into that a little bit further.</p></speech>

We cannot regulate what happens in another jurisdiction and whether that jurisdiction prohibits commercial surrogacy but we can regulate to ensure that, once children are brought home to their parents in Ireland, their best interests are the paramount consideration in determining what happens to them.  This is not only to provide clarity for those children and their families but is also mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and, more importantly, by the European Convention on Human Rights.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1834" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#E00600"><p>I was listening to the contributions on my way here.  I have a few questions.  I might start with Dr. Muldoon and his colleagues.  We need regulation because things are going to happen whether we have regulation or not.  People can have a certain view and be against something but it will happen regardless of whatever decisions are made by any person who is in government.  I would like to get Dr. Muldoon's views on that.  There are children who are in urgent situations because of their parents, whose family status may not currently be recognised, having very serious medical issues.  What would Dr. Muldoon recommend in that regard?  Is there a course of action that could be taken urgently in respect of those children?</p> <p>  I also have questions for Ms Nic Dhomhnaill with regard to child psychology in general.  There are all sorts of different types of families in the modern era.  I welcome that.  There are people who parent alone.  There are people who have one, two, three or four parents.  There is a whole range of situations.  It does not matter to me whether there is one person parenting alone or ten parents or whether those parents are male or female.  I would like to get Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's general view.  With regard to child psychology, there is a range of issues that all children face which may have no connection or link to surrogacy.  There could be what some would deem a traditional family, that is, a mother and a father, a female and a male, and 2.5 children, in which everything looks great from the outside but those children may, for whatever reason, be seeing child psychologists regularly.  I am not saying that as a criticism.  I am a big believer in counselling and I believe that play therapy should be available in all schools and that all children should have some type of play therapy because it is very good for them.  The point I am trying to get to is that it is really important that we do not in some way single out children born through surrogacy as having issues that other children do not have.  It is really important that message goes out loud and clear from the committee today.  I would like to get Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's views on that.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon could go first and address the question of regulation and those urgent cases in particular.  I am conscious that this committee will operate for, perhaps, three months and will then produce a report and that it will be some time before all of that gets into legislation.  There are some really difficult situations out there and I am interested in Dr. Muldoon's views.</p></speech>

We have to move forward with this.  Again, the idea of the Bill moving forward without regulating for international surrogacy and retrospective parental rights just cannot be fathomed.  We need to prepare.  We have children who are currently in that limbo and whose parents do not have full legal rights in respect of consent and various other issues, whether in the area of education, medicine or other matters.  We need to prepare legislation for that as quickly as possible.  That is why the preparations being talked about relate to pre-surrogacy arrangements.  We should look at the process as starting as early as possible so that we know who is in charge and who will take what responsibilities and at what stage.  We should also allow for a post-birth scenario.  Should anybody change his or her mind, there must be some sort of a framework that allows for those disputes to be settled and for decisions to be made as quickly as possible, which is again for the benefit of the child.</p><p>The best interests of the child suggest that at no stage should he or she be left without somebody who has full parental rights who is willing to accept them.  That is crucial in order that those children can be looked after in the best way possible.  That is the legislation members, as legislators, need to bring forward so we can protect all those children.  Regardless of where they are born and what the background is, when they come back to Ireland they should have the right that they deserve, and that every other child has, because it has been set out in a regulation in an appropriate manner.  The best interests of the child are served that way.  Again, for children in their current circumstances, we need to know we will look at the retrospective scenario so the legal limbo is taken away and there is clarity regarding who has rights in that regard. </p></speech>

Any pathologising of these children is something that belongs way back.  It belongs in the early 1980s.  Psychology has moved way beyond any pathologising of children who are born in different family formations.</p></speech>

I thank all our witnesses for being with us.  It has certainly been very interesting.  It has been particularly interesting to hear about the research outcomes.  In 2011 or 2012, I was involved in the launch of the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal survey so I was particularly interested to hear about the research Ms Nic Dhomhnaill referenced.  It is very interesting to hear that 90% of families were in contact with the surrogate mother after the first year and 60% of them were in contact a decade later.  When we think of how that lady's life may have changed in a decade, it is quite an incredible feat and shows the strong bonds and connections.  Ms Nic Dhomhnaill's response to Deputy Funchion on the rate of psychological outcomes being better when there is assisted reproduction is also very interesting.  I have a couple of questions on those studies.  Will she give us a little more information about where they were conducted, how people were selected or came forward to participate and, most important, whether anything has been done to track these or other families since 2017?</p> <p>  I note the two major considerations from the Ombudsman for Children's Office - it encourages that consideration be given to amending the Bill around "the origins of children born through international surrogacy and ... [those] already born through surrogacy" and how they are recorded and, in particular, that the application to obtain identifying and non-identifying information should be done "without limitations as to the child's age."  I would love to learn a little more about how that might work in practice and why the ombudsman is saying "without limitations", given what we have heard from Ms Nic Dhomhnaill.  Our remit as a committee relates to the international aspect but, if possible, I would love to hear whether Ms Nic Dhomhnaill believes the committee should make a recommendation on those two key recommendations she has given us, through domestic surrogacy.</p></speech>

The children probably have not reached the appropriate age.  A six-phase study has just been started.  There are biases in the fact the rates of psychological adjustment are better in this group of children because education in this group will be different.  If members of this group can afford to pay for surrogacy, they are of a different socioeconomic status.  There are lots of issues in the study.  I have not looked at the control group.  I will need to dig into it a little more to see whether all of that has been controlled for in the control group.  I just wanted to put on the record the psychological adjustment is good.</p></speech>

There are a number of points and I will try to be as brief as I can.  An important point for us to raise on what is currently provided for in the Bill relating to the ages at which children may obtain identifying and non-identifying information, and the ages at which a parent or guardian will do so on their behalf, is the rationale for what is provided is not clear to us.  There are a couple of issues.  First, we are concerned about the fact that while a child is defined in the legislation, broadly, as a person under the age of 18, when it comes to the whole question of applying to access information, 16- and 17-year-olds are being defined as adults.  That is not appropriate from a child rights perspective because it removes the scope of any additional safeguards and supports a child might benefit from having the option of accessing by virtue of being under the age of 18.  The Bill should be consistent in respect of access to information about identity and should consistently apply the definition of a child as a person under the age of 18.</p> <p>  The second piece around the recommendation we made is about having regard to the international children's rights standards, where children's rights to information about their origins and preservation of their identity are held as children.  The international standards, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, etc., do not prescribe a minimum age at which children should be able to exercise that right.  Quite an agile approach is provided for, which is that the child is the rights holder and the person entitled to exercise his or her rights as a child.  The role and responsibility of parents is to support children in the exercise of their rights in accordance with children's evolving capacities.</p> <p>  We appreciate it is challenging but we suggest the committee might like to think about providing for a more agile approach rather than looking at the whole question of minimum ages because it is quite precarious.  If committee members feel the need to look at prescribing a minimum age, whether it is what in the legislation right now or another age, we encourage them to think about the specific purpose of prescribing that minimum age.  What will it achieve for the child? </p></speech>

These rights are not granted by their parents, or obtained by their parents and dispensed to them, but in fact something they hold in their own persons from before they are born all the way through.  That is important and, consequently, it is particularly important their identity is preserved.  I read the ombudsman's more extensive submission, which relied heavily on the UN convention and the role of principles.  The witnesses were about to elaborate on the EU and I would like to afford them the opportunity to do that.  If we have a mechanism, and the committee has heard about the Canadian model in which prior to any commencement of a fertility journey there is an obligation for counselling and setting out agreements of contact expectations, everybody should go into it very clearly with their eyes wide open as to what expectations are made of them.  That moves through to the surrogate holding her own bodily integrity throughout, which everybody wants to ensure.  We have also heard from a UK lawyer who appeared before the committee, Ms Natalie Gamble, who talked about the safeguards that could be put in to ensure there is no exploitation of the surrogate and the key payment marker points to look for.  I see those matters reflected in the Verona principles mentioned in the ombudsman's submission.</p> <p>  I would like to afford the representatives the opportunity to reply to that, but before we do so I will state two things.  First, children in Ireland are left in a place of statelessness, not because parents are focusing on their own desires and putting themselves first, but because there are appalling delays in the courts system in Ireland.</p><p>As part of the process of getting an emergency travel document, any parent bringing a child home to Ireland has to give an undertaking to issue court proceedings immediately upon his or her return, and that is verifiable.  There are delays such that some children in this State will have already started school and still not have been through the courts for the parental recognition of the father, even though court proceedings will have issued.</p><p> Second, any apology that may be due in the future will be due to the children who are being let down and failed by the State in the here and now for the fact they have no right of legal relationship with their parents and with their mother in particular.  An apology will be due to those children if we do not act and legislate.</p></speech>

I refer back to the European Court of Human Rights judgment which I mentioned.  As we know, the court judgment in Mennesson <i>v.</i>France and the court's later advisory opinion provided that domestic law must provide a possibility of recognition of the legal relationship between a child born through surrogacy abroad and the intending parent.  That, interestingly, is framed within Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right of the child to private life.  That means the child's relationship with his or her parents is viewed as an inherent part of his or her identity.  That is the point I wanted to make on the European Court of Human Rights.<br/><br/>The Senator briefly referred to children being left stateless and we are concerned by the risk that, though the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children should have a nationality and that this should not be affected by the method of the child's birth and where he or she is born, in the case of international surrogacy, there is a risk a child will be unable to receive the nationality of his or her intending parents and that he or she will remain stateless for some time.  I want to reiterate that, in our observations, both the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children and the Verona principles which the Senator referred to are clear that the state of the intending parents is responsible for ensuring statelessness does not occur and for providing the necessary assistance to ensure the child obtains the nationality of the intending parents promptly and after the child's birth.</p></speech>

At a point when people are supposed to be preoccupied with their babies or young children, there are lots of other preoccupations.  We need to think from a psychological point of view about how it impacts on attachment if parents are preoccupied with something else.  I agree with all of what has been said before and that the issues are for the state of the intending parents because intention is important.  The surrogate leaving the legal rights with the surrogate mother does not consider that she never intended being a parent.</p></speech>

At this time intending parents do not have a right to the equivalent of maternity leave.  While some employers are good on that point, there is no right for same in domestic legislation, so this is something we need to address.  In an international context there is also a need to place that responsibility on the state of the intending parents, but from a surrogacy perspective, the recovery of the surrogate mother also needs to be enshrined in domestic law.  We will have to have a recommendation on the equivalent of maternity leave and extend that to the domestic situation.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?</p></speech>

The following might be an unfair question to put to Dr. Muldoon.  We have discussed regulation and that is best practice, which is what everyone wants to see and that regulation is starting from as early as possible.  There is a pre-birth parentage model and there is something similar in Professor Conor O'Mahony's report from 2020, which is invaluable and holds a lot of the key things we need to be doing.  Do the witnesses want to comment on that?  If they do not want to answer, that is fine.  The pre-birth parentage model is the way to go rather than post-parentage because it marks out that surrogacy is another way to parent and is very different from other forms of parentage like adoption.  Sometimes people compare or link surrogacy and adoption but they are two very different processes and we need to make that very clear.  We have time and I always ask a pre-birth versus post-birth question so why change the habit now a few weeks in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1868" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Groarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#G02400"><p>I am happy to take that question.  When we were looking at what model we thought would be appropriate and in the best interests of the child, we considered the report of the special rapporteur on child protection and the children's rights standards that are set out in the Verona principles in particular and what they are seeking to guide states in doing in implementing those child rights principles.</p><p>In our observations, as the committee has seen, we have proposed, similar to the rapporteur's report, that a pre-birth model of transferring parentage be established in domestic legislation and that the 2022 Bill be amended to take this into account.  We were particularly guided by the Verona principles.  Adequate pre-surrogacy arrangements are provided for in the 2022 Bill.  Those arrangements include the consent of the surrogate mother and the parents of the donor, and that independent legal advice has been given etc.  If the surrogate mother is permitted to confirm her consent for a period of time after the birth, there is no impediment from a children's rights perspective to having a pre-birth transfer of parentage in place.  That is why we made that recommendation.  We also think, as the special rapporteur has outlined in his report, that this would involve an application for parentage to the courts, alongside pre-authorisation of the surrogacy on the basis of a set of pre-surrogacy arrangements.  That would allow for an assessment of the best interests of the child to be taken into account by a court before the surrogacy is proceeded with.  Doing that would allow for judicial oversight all the way through the process and not just after the birth.  It would also ensure clarity for that child from day one.</p></speech>

We will hopefully be offering that information to the child in the future.  If the process starts earlier, people get more of a chance to adjust and there are still opportunities, post birth, to adjust again.  I think that is the best possible way of making a framework work.</p></speech>

I would be answering off the cuff if I tried to respond about the pre-birth model or the post-birth model.  I think the pre-birth model might include delays before the intending parents go wherever they are going for their baby.  I see the dilemma.  I have seen children in practice where there have been three- and four-year delays around parental orders.  I have not thought clearly about the issue.</p></speech>

That point relates to the maternity leave aspect of the issue.  I am interested to hear from Ms Nic Dhomhnaill in that regard.  Will she give us context about the attachment between mothers and their babies, and the benefits that mothers, in particular, gain during maternity leave?</p> <p>  I note that in her opening statement Ms Nic Dhomhnaill spoke about all legal privileges that are not currently with children born through surrogacy.  She mentioned, in particular, inheritance rights.  Perhaps this is a premature question when surrogacy is still relatively new, but do we have any information as to whether there is a psychological impact on children who may not feel fully part of a family?</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon outlined two further and clear recommendations in his statement.  He suggested we should include provision for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and the retrospective assignment of parentage.  As a result of any research his office has carried out on that matter, has Dr. Muldoon guidance to offer us as to how that could be best achieved through the committee and its recommendations?</p></speech>

Its lack really disadvantages children who have been born via surrogacy and have come into the country.  To quote D.W. Winnicott, there is no such thing as a baby; there is only a mother and baby.  A baby cannot survive.  During that early stage, when a child is four months old, six months old, or whatever, the primary caregiver plays a role in the stage of preoccupation.  During that stage, a mother is preoccupied with her baby.  These children are disadvantaged if the mothers cannot avail of maternity leave.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman also asked about inheritance rights.  As children's knowledge evolves and they become aware, it has the potential to be divisive in families if other siblings have more entitlements.  That is a big issue.</p> <p>  Another issue I have been thinking about relates to grandparents.  It is a lineage of which the children are deprived.  The grandparents do not have any legal rights.  If children do not have some legislative connection to their mothers, what is the situation with regard to grandchildren?  What relationship do the child's children have with the biological mother or non-biological mother, in some surrogacy cases?  </p> <p>  There are considerable connotations with regard to child development.  There is the possibility for a split, for divisiveness between siblings.  There are also issues relating to the maternal preoccupation stage and the relationship between mother and baby.</p></speech>

She asked about retrospective arrangements and in responding, I would like to give a frame for the recommendations we have made.  We want to bring all those children, whether they were born prior to the commencement of the Bill or will be born in the future, to same level.  We must ensure those children are not experiencing differential treatment on the basis of when they were born and the framework in which they were born.  In providing for retrospective surrogacy, we noted that provision was made for the making of retrospective applications in the original drafts of the Children and Family Relationships Bill in 2014  It is not clear why those provisions were not carried through to the 2022 Bill.</p> <p>  We see precedent for providing for retrospective recognition of parentage in the Children and Family Relationships Act in terms of donor-assisted human reproduction.  The international standards recognise that parentage cannot be determined on the basis of the same standards that might apply in future, under the framework of the 2022 Bill, because those standards were not previously in place.  Adapted criteria are required to be placed there for those applications.</p> <p>  In terms of international surrogacy arrangements, we have recommended in our observations that a post-birth framework should be put in place.  As I mentioned previously, a framework must be put in place to recognise the relationship between a child and his or her parent arising from an international surrogacy.  That does not mean we should automatically recognise parentage.  The UN special rapporteur on the sale of children and the Verona principles have made clear that a process needs to be put in place to give discretion to a court to examine what is in the best interests of the child in such a situation.</p></speech>

I know what I mean when I use that term.  I know where I draw the line between commercial and compensated surrogacy.  Domestic surrogacy is a compensated surrogacy because there is provision for childcare and all the things that should be attendant to a surrogate mother on this journey.  However, there is no internationally accepted definition.</p><p>One of my concerns is that in the conversation relating to commercial surrogacy, where places such as the US and Canada are the only ones that same-sex couples, in the main, can go to, if we either fail to define it or define it incorrectly, we will have a difficulty.  If we rule out payment, say that there cannot be payment in any circumstances, ban it and introduce some sanction, the State will have difficulty finding a way to proceed.  In such circumstances, we will be discriminating against children - children will be born regardless - and we will also close down the possibility of parentage for a number of same-sex couples.  A question that arises in this regard relates to how we resolve the fact that there is not an internationally recognised definition.  When the term is used, there is at times a drawing towards the most exploitative end of things.  Nobody who is paying a fee in the context of surrogacy, which can be well over $100,000 in Canada, is contemplating exploitation.  In fact, Canada is where there is a very good model for ensuring that nobody is exploited.  I would welcome that perhaps we discuss for a little how we might overcome the concern I have outlined.  How do we start grappling with this matter?</p></speech>

We are looking at a situation where a child is born somewhere else and whether will we provide him or her with the rights if his or her intended parents are living in Ireland.  From that point of view, we need to create a framework which allows that to happen.  However, we also need to ask ourselves a series of questions as to what is in that framework.  As the Senator said, there will be changes over the next ten years.  Different methods of surrogacy will affect things.  We have to future-proof it as well.  The questions should be about what is in the best interest of the child.  We need to figure out what questions we want to ask about how this came about.  That is probably the way forward.  As the Senator said, there will always be grey lines between what is compensated and what is commercial.  There is no benefit to drawing it in a numerical way.  We need look at the questions.  That is where the court has to be very clear that it asks deep questions about how this came about.  Again, if there is a very clear pre-surrogacy framework, then that suggests somebody is taking care of everybody involved.  The level of money is not the only exploitation.  You can be exploited in other ways, such as by means of intimidation.  There are all sorts of other ways.  It is important to make sure that the care is taken at all steps.  From our point of view, it is about what is in the best interest of the child once they are born and that is the crucial part.  They then come back to Ireland or their intended parents are living here.  That is the crucial part.  There is no safety or clarity.</p></speech>

I refer to the best interests of the child being treated as the paramount consideration.  That should be the thread that guides all of the thinking and deliberations in terms of legislating and then in terms of what happens in practice in the context of the legislation.  We appreciate these kind of concerns.  I am not sure if this is relevant to the Senator&rsquo;s question about double standards, but we support the prohibition on commercial surrogacy in a domestic context because we regard it as the strongest way to mitigate against the risk of the sale of children.  At the same time, we recognise that commercial surrogacy happens in other jurisdictions where we have no control.  The key thing, as Dr. Muldoon said, is we need to face that reality and not look away from it.  We need to legislate for that reality in a way that upholds the best interest of the child.  Not legislating will not serve anybody&rsquo;s interest, not least the child&rsquo;s.</p></speech>

We need to be alive to that possibility.  Parents carrying out due diligence will look to a future of some day having a rational &ndash; or perhaps irrational &ndash; teenager, and there will be a heap of things thrown up, even if they have disclosure from pre-birth all the way through.  There will be things thrown up and parents want to be able to answer those questions and want the child&rsquo;s history to be the most ethical one possible.  They do not want a story that involves an element of coercion or exploitation.  That is recognising that parent after parent has come in and said that they do not want that association for their child.  This is their child&rsquo;s story at the end of the day.  It is the child&rsquo;s life and being.</p></speech>

Our second session will consider the issues paper furnished to the committee by the relevant Departments.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Conor O'Mahony.  Before we begin, I am required to repeat the note on privilege and housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory relating to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House and any member attempting to do so will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.  I remind those present to wear masks where possible throughout the meeting.  I invite Dr. O'Mahony to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I apologise for being unable to attend in person on this occasion.  My submission will focus on the issues paper provided by the Departments of Health; Justice; and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to the committee in advance of its hearing on 7 April that raises a number of concerns regarding recommendations made in my report of December 2020 that examined children's rights and best interests in the context of donor-assisted human reproduction and surrogacy in Irish law.</p> <p>  It is somewhat regrettable that the three Departments never took the opportunity to contact me following the submission of my report to raise these concerns and to afford an opportunity for them to be discussed further.  It was also regrettable that I did not have sight of the issues paper prior to the hearing on 7 April because this made it very difficult for me to respond properly to these concerns during my own appearance at this hearing.  For this reason, I am grateful to the committee for providing me with the issues paper and giving me an opportunity to respond to it today.</p> <p>  In brief, the main points raised in the issues paper regarding the recommendations in my report were that they would leave Irish courts with no real choice as to whether to recognise international surrogacy arrangements, would leave foreign surrogate mothers with fewer protections than Irish surrogate mothers, would give rise to practical difficulties in arranging court hearings before children born abroad are brought to Ireland, would be inconsistent with existing legislation relating to citizenship and passports and would give rise to constitutional concerns with respect to the retrospective reassignment of parentage from birth parents to intending parents.</p> <p>  Having carefully considered the issues paper and done further analysis on it, it is my considered view that these concerns are based on an incomplete understanding of the recommendations and the associated legal landscape and are beset by logical inconsistencies.  On the first two points, the recommendations in my report provide an outline for a legislative framework for the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements where and only when they meet minimum standards, including in respect of the protection of the surrogate mother, and that an Irish court would have to assess whether or not those standards were met and would have a clear basis for refusing to recognise those arrangements if these standards are not met.  The Government&rsquo;s current proposal of leaving international surrogacy entirely unregulated by excluding it completely from the assisted human reproduction Bill does neither of these things.  It leaves foreign surrogate mothers with no protection whatsoever under Irish law and creates a situation where applications by intending parents for parentage and guardianship will invariably be approved with no opportunity to consider any of the legal or ethical issues arising in respect of the surrogacy arrangement.  As such, the Government&rsquo;s proposed approach ignores the very issues about which concerns are raised in the issues paper.  It allows for a situation whereby Irish couples can bring children here in circumstances where surrogate mothers were seriously exploited or did not properly consent and allows for the parents to be recognised eventually as parents or guardians without any scrutiny of the treatment of the surrogate mother.</p><p>For this reason, the only way to apply protection and safeguards in Ireland to the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements is through bespoke legislation, as recommended in my report.<br/><br/>The claims made in the issues paper regarding practical difficulties in hearing applications for recognition of international surrogacy before the child is brought to the jurisdiction are very much overstated.  Remote court hearings are already an integral feature of our courts system following the Covid pandemic.  Short notice is not a problem of any real significance.  It is possible in most cases to predict the date of birth of a baby pretty accurately to within a couple of weeks.  The hearings can be scheduled in advance.  In the event the baby is very premature, the baby will in that circumstance have to stay in hospital for some time anyway and will be unable to travel.  Therefore, any question of time pressure to allow the child to be brought to Ireland does not arise in that way.<br/><br/>The rationale in my report for recommending that the application is heard before the child arrives in the jurisdiction is that it is the most effective way of giving an Irish court a choice of refusing to recognise the international surrogacy arrangement, which is one of the concerns the issues paper expresses.  This may be because the surrogate mother has not genuinely consented, local laws have not been observed or the child's right to identity has not been protected.  It would leave these issues to be resolved in the country where they arose and avoid the cross-jurisdictional challenges that would arise after the child has been brought to Ireland.  These would make it more likely that an Irish court would gloss over problems with the surrogacy arrangement on the basis that the child is now living here and has established a family relationship with the intending parents.  Having said this, it is important to stress that if it is felt it is more practical to hear applications for recognition of international surrogacy arrangements after the child has been brought to Ireland there is no reason in principle this could not occur.  This is not a basis or adequate justification for leaving the recognition of international surrogacy arrangements entirely unregulated.  It would simply be a reason to hold the application and court hearing after the child arrives instead.<br/><br/>Questions of inconsistency with existing legislation governing citizenship and passports ignore the fact that the legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas and open to modification by it.  It is entirely within the gift of the Oireachtas to adapt citizenship legislation to the unique requirements of international surrogacy.  For reasons already alluded to in the earlier session, it is in the best interests of the children involved to do just this.<br/><br/>The issues paper makes a claim that constitutional issues would arise if legislation allowed for retrospective reassignment of parentage from birth parents to intending parents.  This relies very much on a Supreme Court decision from 2009 in McD <i>v.</i>L.  This position is a flawed interpretation of the constitutional case law.  It relies on a Supreme Court decision that was not concerned with the issue of surrogacy or the issue of retrospective assignment of parentage.  The decision did not establish constitutional rights of sperm donors.  In fact, it found they did not have constitutional rights.  Contrary to what the issues paper claims, it did not draw any distinction between known donors and unknown donors since it was only concerned with a known donor.  It simply did not consider the position of unknown donors.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, to claim that McD <i>v.</i>L establishes that it would be unconstitutional to retrospectively remove parentage from a known sperm donor, and that by the same token it would be unconstitutional to retrospectively remove parentage from a surrogate mother, is a distortion of the judgment.  In the absence of any legislation governing assisted human reproduction at the time of the judgment, the entitlement of the father to parentage flowed solely from his genetic relationship to the child and existing legislation governing declarations of parentage.  If an unknown donor were to have become aware of the identity of his child and then applied to a court for a declaration of parentage, the unknown donor would have been entitled to this declaration in exactly the same way as the known donor.  There is no distinction between the two.  Nonetheless, as we have heard in previous hearings, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 did legislate to allow for the retrospective removal of parentage from unknown sperm donors.  Therefore, it is quite clear that McD <i>v.</i>L does not establish any general principle to the effect that the Constitution is an impediment to legislating for retrospective removal of parentage.<br/><br/>The relevant section of the issues paper, having relied entirely on McD <i>v.</i>L, ignores the more recent and much more relevant decision of the Supreme Court in MR <i>v.</i>An t&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir in 2014.  This is the only Supreme Court case we have that directly considers the question of surrogacy.  The court stressed that the regulation of surrogacy is quintessentially a matter for the Oireachtas and called on the Oireachtas to enact legislation in this area.  This clearly establishes that the Oireachtas has a very wide latitude in deciding on the appropriate approach in legislating for surrogacy and that the courts would be very unlikely to find any law enacted in this area is unconstitutional.  While surrogate mothers, unlike sperm donors, would have constitutional rights in respect of the child, those constitutional rights, like any constitutional right, would be open to legislative intervention and limitation aimed at securing the best interests of the child.  We already see examples of this in adoption law, for example section 31 of the Adoption Act 2010.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons it is my considered view that the issues paper fails to provide convincing reasons in support of rejecting the recommendations made in my 2020 report.  The points made in respect of international surrogacy and retrospective recognition of surrogacy arrangements are internally inconsistent and based on a flawed understanding of the constitutional case law.  Moreover, no rationale is provided for the rejection of other recommendations made in my report, including on the right to identity which was discussed in this morning's session.  It remains my firm view that the Government&rsquo;s proposals will result in legislation which is contrary to Ireland&rsquo;s commitments with respect to the child's right to family life, the right to identity, the best interests principle and the principle of non-discrimination.  I am very happy to discuss all of these points further with the committee.</p></speech>

I am glad he has an opportunity to respond to the issues paper.  It is only fair given that it comments on his comprehensive report.  It is important to begin by stating Dr. O'Mahony office is on a statutory basis.  He has a statutory responsibility to report to the Government on legislative effects that impact child protection.  He was commissioned to engage on the report.  I want to say this and park it.  It establishes more than adequately his objective bona fides on this.</p><p>In his more comprehensive submission document Dr. O'Mahony quotes Mr. Justice O'Donnell in the more recent case of MR <i>v.</i>An t-&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir.  I emphasise that Mr. Justice O'Donnell is now the Chief Justice.  In his judgment he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It is surely most clearly and profoundly wrong from the point of children born through an unregulated process into a world where their status may be determined by happenstance, and where simple events such as registration for schools, attendance at a doctor, consent to medical treatment, acquisition of a passport and even joining sports teams may involve complications, embarrassment and the necessity for prior consultation with lawyers resulting in necessarily inconclusive advice....The need for legislation is even more urgent today. </blockquote> <p>We need legislation.  We need a framework that works and protects the rights and interests of everybody in this, particularly with regard to the child and child protection.  From what I can gather, and from what we can gather from what Dr. O'Mahony has said to us, is that we are looking at a framework that involves an initial threshold for parents that is assessed in Ireland when they are embarking on a surrogacy journey.  This needs to be mandated or overseen by an authority or judicially.  We need this threshold.  We also need an oversight mechanism to safeguard the surrogate mother and ensure her consent.  Ideally this would be done before a pregnancy begins.  There should be guidelines that are overseen or checked.  Into this would be added a body of knowledge from an authority with experience of the country and specific clinics within it.</p><p>Then we have a system of a baby born and judicial oversight of an application, perhaps for an interim parentage order until there is a full parentage hearing in the Irish courts when a baby comes home.  Within that we need a bespoke change to citizenship requirements so it is not just the father's DNA but perhaps the mother's.  That then opens up the possibility of same-sex female couples availing of surrogacy also.  Is that more or less what we are looking at, in practical terms?</p></speech>

There are points of detail there that could vary as to the exact sequencing of those steps and the exact forms those steps could take.  To take the Senator's last point on the citizenship issue first, it is very important that is included.  Ideally, you do not want to have the situation of statelessness alluded to in this morning's session arising for any child.  The Verona Principles are very clear on that.  It is not in the best interests of children to be left stateless in circumstances where the law of the jurisdiction where they were born does not recognise them as a citizen of that country but equally they are not yet recognised as a citizen of Ireland.  We also know from existing experience there can be delays in reaching the point where citizenship is granted.  That is why my report recommended that in the best interests of the child you would deal with the citizenship question at the same time as you would deal with the parentage question, rather than having a separate process that might result in a hiatus during which the child is stateless.  The issues paper essentially dismissed that recommendation on the basis that would create difficulties with existing citizenship legislation.  To my view, that is not an adequate response to that.  If there are inconsistencies with existing citizenship legislation then you amend that legislation through miscellaneous provisions of this Bill.  That is what the Oireachtas is there to do and it can do that at any time.</p> <p>  Very briefly on the MR decision, it makes clear the courts see the existing gap and the lack of regulation as being problematic for children and as not being in the best interests of children.  The courts want the Oireachtas to legislate in this area.  They have stressed the decisions to be made as to the detail of that are ones for the Oireachtas and not for the courts.  That gives us a very clear signal the risk the issues paper alludes to of potential challenges resulting in laws being declared unconstitutional in the future is a very low risk because the courts have made it very clear the social policy nature of surrogacy is such that it is really for the Oireachtas to make those decisions and the courts are really very slow and reluctant to get involved in second-guessing those decisions.  As such, the Oireachtas has a very wide latitude to adopt something, whether it is exactly along the lines the Senator just outlined in her questions or some variation on that theme.  They key point I want to make there is that is all within the gift of the Oireachtas.  When saying we cannot do x, y and z because of a risk of unconstitutionality, you would need to establish very clear reasons for doing so and I do not believe that has happened to date, or is especially likely given the tone of the MR judgment.</p></speech>

I am reading a 2018 document from the UN special rapporteur and wish to cite a portion:</p> <blockquote> 	There is growing unease that the practice of engaging surrogate mothers in States with emerging economies to bear children for more wealthy intending parents from other States entails power imbalances and thus risks for both the children and surrogate mothers. </blockquote> <p>As Government Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, I am sure Dr. O'Mahony shares those concerns.

We know there are many different combinations and permutations as to which parties provide the necessary genetic material in a surrogacy arrangement.  Ultimately, from the point of view of the international children's rights standards that guided my work for my report and the work of the UN special rapporteur, they do not have all that much to say about the different versions of surrogacy and exactly who contributes what to the process.  What the standards say about their key guiding principles including best interests, non-discrimination, right to family life, right to identity and those principles, particularly the non-discrimination element, make it very clear the circumstances of the child's birth, including which parties contributed which genetic material, should not have any bearing on the level of legal protection for those various rights a child enjoys.</p> <p>  As to the issue of various emerging economies and different levels of regulation and so on, this is precisely why I am concerned with seeing regulation in Ireland of international surrogacy arrangements that would provide clear standards that must be met before Ireland recognises any international surrogacy arrangements, in order to avoid precisely the kind of concerns the Senator has alluded to arising.  The Government's proposed approach of leaving the issue entirely unregulated completely fails to address that because it creates a situation where the child is brought to Ireland, there is nothing in place the parents must prove or no standards they must meet.  They simply find themselves, two years after the child is born, with a guardianship application that has no consideration whatsoever of the nature of the surrogacy arrangement or the standards applicable in the country where it took place.  My concern is that approach, that absence of regulation, magnifies the concerns the Senator has alluded to there and that if we are really concerned about them the approach to take is to have bespoke legislation that puts in place strong regulation.</p></speech>

There are different possibilities with respect to what exactly you put on the birth certificate and what you keep on the separate register.  There are complications that arise from each of those various reports so the recommendation in my report was there needed to be a further and more detailed piece of work done about the implications for the system of registration of births in order to work out the most appropriate model.  What I am very clear on is the identity of the surrogate absolutely needs to be recorded.  That needs to be available to the child.  My recommendation was it should be available to the child from birth and not only at a particular age.</p> <p>  Whether the identity of the surrogate is recorded on the birth certificate itself or in a separate register is quite a technical and complicated question on which further work needs to be done that goes beyond the scope of the report I produced.</p></speech>

I ask that he outline his views on this.  What additional safeguards could be introduced to ensure foreign surrogates are as well-protected as Irish surrogates?</p></speech>

The Government's proposal of leaving international surrogacy completely unregulated provides foreign surrogate mothers with no protection whatsoever.</p> <p>  As to how you could go about this, again, there is a range of ways to approach it.  You could mirror exactly the protections provided in the domestic framework proposed in the Bill in respect of the laws governing international surrogacy arrangements.  There is no reason in principle why you could not make them completely equivalent.  The risk associated with that approach is if it is too prescriptive it may have the result of excluding a significant number of international surrogacy arrangements from the scope of the legislation, which ends up creating a separate problem, namely, you then have couples going abroad, bringing children back to Ireland and then finding themselves in the same difficulty we currently see them in, which is like a limbo or twilight zone.  For that reason, looking at the issue from the perspective of the child and again the principle of non-discrimination whereby the child should not be discriminated against based on the circumstances of his or her birth, my view was given the international nature of it it would be preferable to set minimum standards that must be met in every case but then also allowing for a degree of flexibility to recognise different jurisdictions will do things slightly differently.</p><p>It is to try to avoid a situation where there are too many children born through international surrogacy finding themselves excluded from the legislation simply because it is too prescriptive.  That was the position I arrived at in the report but, as I say, one could, in principle, completely equalise those sets of protections.  What should not be done and what is no answer to the concerns about protection for the surrogate mother is to provide no protection whatsoever, and that is where we find ourselves if we leave international surrogacy completely unregulated.</p></speech>

International commercial surrogacy exists, and because it exists and we cannot wish it out of existence, it is not within the gift of the Oireachtas to completely prohibit recognition of international commercial surrogacy.  That is clear from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  Therefore, if we are to take our human rights obligations seriously, strong regulation in the best interests of the child is the appropriate response to concerns about international commercial surrogacy.  Prohibition is neither realistic nor within our gift.</p></speech>

In the first meeting we had, it was great when he appeared in the afternoon session because in the first session I felt there was no sense of urgency from some Departments.  There was a sense that it was impossible and of wondering how we could do it.  As has been detailed in Professor O'Mahony's paper, since 2020 there is a range of solutions.  That is what has struck me in all the committee hearings over the last number of weeks.  While it is complex, there is a bunch of solutions staring us in the face.  I am glad Professor O'Mahony had the opportunity to come to the committee and to put on record his response to the issues paper.  He also gave us a very detailed brief.</p> <p>  Professor O'Mahony said in his opening statement: "It is my considered view that these concerns are based on an incomplete understanding of the recommendations and the associated legal landscape, and are beset by logical inconsistencies".  On the last occasion he was before the committee, it emerged that there has been no further contact or follow-up from the Government of any of the Departments since he had done his paper.  Now that this committee has held a number of meetings, has there been any follow-up from the Government with regard to his 2020 paper?</p></speech>

In my three years as special rapporteur, my approach has been to maintain an open-door policy in my dealings with Departments.  I have always been very happy to discuss any of the issues arising, be it specific recommendations made in my reports or more general issues arising in everyday law and policy work.  I have always been happy to have those conversations.  I have had conversations at various points with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about ongoing work in their remit.  That is a very helpful and productive way to do things, especially on something as technical and complex as surrogacy, to ensure people are not speaking past each other.  It would have been good, and still would be good, if there was an opportunity to have some of those conversations to try to work out some of those points of detail, but to date it has not happened.</p></speech>

When it came up at that meeting with Professor O'Mahony that they had not been in contact, I thought they would have realised that they should be in contact and that they would get in contact in the interim.  I cannot speak for anybody else, but I am delighted to get his response back and to have him here today to put it on the record.  I believe that much of the work Professor O'Mahony did in 2020 is the framework for us.  In my view, it makes our work very easy, even though I know it is difficult.  I am not trying to dismiss the difficulties or any potential issues with it, but we have a really good framework and I hope that it is what we will be using in our report.  I will certainly be advocating for that.</p> <p>  Again, I thank Professor O'Mahony for all his work.</p></speech>

It is great to have him before the committee again.  There is always a great level of clarity when he appears before the committee and I welcome that.</p> <p>  I am grappling with all these legal issues, so forgive me.  As unknown donors can become known donors through DNA, it is important to sever those rights.  Where do we sever those rights?  There is a dispute in the issues paper regarding the retrospective recognition for children, saying one cannot remove parentage retrospectively.  Will Professor O'Mahony elaborate on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1910" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#N01000"><p>It is a tricky point.  I will say a little more about the Supreme Court decision in McD <i>v</i>. L.  That was a case in which a lesbian couple had a child using a sperm donor who was a friend of theirs.  When the case came to court, it concerned a dispute which had subsequently arisen.  The original agreement had been that the parties would have an arrangement whereby the sperm donor would be known as a favourite uncle but would not be the child's father.  It was a private arrangement they had come to, but there was no legal framework for it at the time.  A dispute subsequently arose.  The father applied for guardianship and access to the child and the case ultimately came to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court made a number of findings in the case, one of which was that it made it very clear that it reaffirmed the long-standing position that unmarried fathers in Irish law have no constitutional rights.  They have a number of statutory entitlements to make applications to the court to be declared a parent if there is DNA evidence, to be appointed a guardian and so forth, but the Constitution provides no rights to unmarried fathers at all.  That was one of the core findings of the case.  Second, notwithstanding that, the court said it is normally in the child's best interests to have the opportunity of knowing the parent and, therefore, the case was remitted back to the High Court, and ultimately a decision was made in which access was granted.<br/><br/>What we see from that case in the issues paper is that, following McD <i>v</i>. L, in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provision was made for retrospective allocation of parentage in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction where people had a child using a sperm donor or an egg donor before the 2015 Act came into effect.  That retrospective reassignment of parentage was allowed in cases where the donor was unknown to the parties, but was not allowed in cases where the donor was known.  Until I saw the issues paper, my understanding of the rationale for that was that it was based on a sense that where there are known donors there is more scope for disputes between the parties and that, rather than encouraging those disputes or allowing them to bubble up to the surface, it would be better to leave that outside of the framework of the parentage allocation, whereas if the donor was unknown, the scope for that dispute would not arise in the same way and, therefore, one could proceed and allocate parentage retrospectively.  The issues paper clarifies that this was not the rationale in the 2015 Act.  The rationale was instead an understanding that the known donor had a constitutional right which could not be abridged by the Bill whereas the unknown donor did not have a constitutional right.  I cannot quite understand how McD<i>v</i>. L was interpreted in that way seeing that the Supreme Court found that the sperm donor has no constitutional right at all, irrespective of whether he is known or unknown, so that distinction cannot be drawn from the judgment.  There was no consideration of unknown donors in the judgment.<br/><br/>Second, on the question of the entitlement to apply for parentage, it applies equally to known donors or unknown donors.  As the Senator said, if an unknown donor were to become known, the donor could make an application under the existing legislation in the Status of Children Act 1987 to get a declaration of parentage in exactly the same way as a known donor would, yet the 2015 Act legislated to allow for retrospective reassignment of parentage away from that father.  From that point of view, McD <i>v</i>. L simply does not say what the issues paper says it says in respect of the constitutional rights which are enjoyed in this context by sperm donors.</p><p>Regarding the surrogate mother, under existing law the surrogate mother would like any other mother be recognised as having constitutional rights in respect of a child born to her.  That arises largely because she is currently recognised as the child's mother.  Of course, as we saw in the MR <i>v</i>. An t-&Aacute;rd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir case, it is open to the Oireachtas to amend the law to remove that presumption that the surrogate mother would be recognised as the child's mother.  The Oireachtas is very clear in saying that the decision on how to handle that issue is a decision for the Oireachtas and not for the courts.  I reiterate the point I made earlier that we have other examples of law.  Section 31 of the Adoption Act 2010 allows for adoption orders to be processed without the consent of a birth mother if it is deemed to be in the best interests of the child to do so.  That would also have the effect of transferring parentage away from the birth mother and to the adoptive parents in that case.<br/><br/>To my mind, it is very clear that the Constitution imposes no obstacle to laws that would allow for retrospective reassignment of parentage in surrogacy cases.  From a children's rights perspective for all the reasons we have heard in all of the hearings to date, we know a cohort of children are living in this disadvantaged legal world who have already been born through surrogacy arrangements and who will be left behind if the Bill proceeds in its current state.  For all of those reasons I strongly recommend the legislation should include provision for retrospective allocation of parentage.  I reiterate my analysis that there is no constitutional impediment to do so.</p></speech>

I went to another meeting and I am back again.  It has been meeting after meeting.  In his opening statement, Professor O'Mahony spoke about exploitation.  What form does that take?  The people I have spoken to regard their surrogate mother as an extension of their family.  We have all heard the lovely stories about the family all being one.  I want to hear more about what exploitation might mean and how we should tackle that in our proposal.</p> <p>  At our last meeting I asked some of the families who had been through surrogacy if they believed that transferring parental rights to the intending parents should happen before the birth of the child or after.  Should we support the idea of birth certificates that mark the surrogate mother for tracing purposes later in life?  </p> <p>  We cannot impose laws for other countries as we have seen in our discussions with witnesses from the different surrogacy groups who have appeared before the committee.  What core standards does Professor O'Mahony believe should be in place to ensure we protect the rights of all parties involved and provide for proper identity tracing?  I again compliment him on all his good work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1914" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#O00400"><p>On the question of exploitation, I agree with the Deputy that we have many examples of cases where there was no question of exploitation, but that it is not to say that the risk does not exist.  The risk exists and is well recognised by international human rights bodies and in the literature.  There is a wide range of possibilities when it comes to surrogacy.  When we legislate to regulate the recognition of surrogacy arrangements, we need our regulations to be sufficiently robust that they can deal not just with the best-case scenario but also with the worst-case scenarios.  That means sometimes requiring people, who have the very best intentions and who would never do anything that would be exploitative, to jump through a couple of additional hoops just to ensure we have a framework that is also sufficiently robust to deal with people whose intentions are not so benign.  That is important to say.  The law must be able to cater for the worst case is as well as the best.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what form exploitation might take.  The key issue there is the whole question of the extent to which the surrogate is genuinely giving free and informed consent and is genuinely looked after in terms of the necessary provision of medical care, legal advice and so on.  The question of compensation is an entirely different debate which members are all very familiar with; I will not get bogged down in that.  That question of ensuring genuine free and informed consent is at the core of ensuring we do not have exploitation.  At the minimum from that perspective, international surrogacy arrangements in the Irish courts must have a framework for confirming whether the surrogate mother gave genuinely free and informed consent to the arrangement.</p> <p>  If we leave it unregulated, which is what the Bill currently proposes to do, in practice a couple would engage in international surrogacy and then bring the child back to Ireland.  Let us say it is the typical case where the father has provided the sperm donation and there was an egg donor.  In those circumstances the father would be able to go to court and apply for a declaration of parentage because of the genetic connection.  That would be granted simply on the basis of the genetic connection with no consideration of the nature of the surrogacy arrangement.  The mother, who does not have a genetic connection, would not be entitled to be recognised as a parent but would be entitled to apply for guardianship after two years, which would give the mother many of the important rights in respect of making decisions for and caring for the child.</p> <p>  At that point if the mother has been caring for the child for two years, that application is almost certain to be granted.  If we choose to do it that way, none of those processes allow for any consideration of whether the surrogate gave genuinely free and informed consent.  Nor do they allow for any consideration of whether the child's right to identity was protected, that there was a framework in place for ensuring the donor was known and that there is a register allowing for tracing and so on.  Leaving it unregulated ignores those risks and makes it certain that the applications will be granted.  The issues paper took issue with my report on the basis that my report did not provide sufficient protection for the foreign surrogate and that it made it highly likely or certain that the application would be granted.  Both of those problems loom larger in the proposed approach of leaving international surrogacy completely unregulated.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about transferring parental rights pre-birth or post birth.  My report recommended the pre-birth model which I believe is more in line with the relevant international children's rights standards.  I know that the Office of the Ombudsman for Children took the same view earlier this morning.  Having said that, post-birth is still better than a lack of any regulation, if that makes sense.</p> <p>  On birth certs and tracing, I reiterate what I said to Senator Keogan which is that my firm view is that there needs to be a mechanism for tracing identity, including the identity of the surrogate mother and any donors of sperm or eggs.  That could be in the form of a register.  What exactly goes on the birth cert is a tricky and complicated question.  The surrogate mother's name could appear on the birth cert with some sort of notation to that effect.  It would also be possible to leave the surrogate mother's name off the birth cert but simply have the relevant information in the register separately.</p> <p>  From an identity perspective, the Bill currently proposes that none of this information would be available until the child is 16.  If we think about what was said this morning about the importance and benefits of early disclosure all of which was discussed in my report as well, we are saying in law that even if the parents of the child wanted to share that information with the child earlier, the law prohibits them from accessing it.  To my mind that is completely contrary to children's rights.</p> <p>  The last point related to legislating for other countries.  I reiterate that we can only do what we can do.  That is why my view is that our law needs to stipulate a degree of flexibility that recognises the limits of what the Oireachtas can actually achieve.  We should set minimum standards that we can stand over and accept as a country, but also allow a degree of flexibility that recognises the simple fact that it is a very wide and diverse world.</p></speech>

I agree that non-regulation is not fair.  I agree with him on the need for bespoke legislation to deal with that.  I also agree with Mr. Justice O'Donnell who said we need that legislation now more than ever.  I do not come from a legal background which is why I value so much Professor O'Mahony's legal expertise and insight which he is providing today.</p> <p>  I have three questions arising from his contribution today.  The first relates to citizenship and the proposal around being provided for in advance of the child arriving here.</p><p>That would hugely reduce stress on families, and it would be a very progressive and positive move.  Hypothetically, is that soon enough if we are to make a determination on citizenship?  What happens if, for some reason, a determination fails?</p><p> With regard to the Verona principles, we do not want a child ending up stateless.  A child will obviously have assistance from the country in which he or she is born.  From an Irish perspective, what happens if the determination is no?  If so, is it too late?</p><p> In terms of the advice on the protection of an international surrogate mother, Professor O'Mahony said it may still leave some children in the situation in which they find themselves in today.  Is there a way of dealing with that?  There probably is not.  If we apply standards, unfortunately some cases may not meet them.  What happens in such a situation?  How do we factor that in retrospectively?  Is that possible?  Is it fair?  Is it legally possible to apply standards retrospectively?  If so, how will that affect children who have already been born through surrogacy?</p><p> In terms of an age limit of 16, earlier today the Ombudsman for Children said he feels the age of 16 is not legally practical and does not know where it came from.  The age of 18 is the age of adulthood and consent.  The ombudsman feels that if we put in the age of 16, we could perhaps have a negative impact on other children's rights at the ages of 16 and 17.  Professor O'Mahony has proposed we do not have a limitation.  Does that same concern arise?  Does he feel that by removing the age limitation, we will remove that whole question for other rights as well?</p></speech>

As the Vice Chairman alluded to, there is a big advantage to making the decision before the child is brought into the jurisdiction because, if it is not made, we run into the practical difficulty we currently have as to the child's actual entitlement to enter the jurisdiction and must come up with an <i>ad hoc</i>solution that allows the child to be brought into the country.  Again, that is all part of the rationale for why I felt it was better to have a single court procedure that would take place between the birth of the child but before the child was brought into the jurisdiction which would determine parentage and citizenship, so that by the time the parents sought to bring the child into the jurisdiction, everything would have been squared away.<br/><br/>What if that were to fail?  That is tricky because we must strike a balance if we recognise there are significant potential concerns about surrogacy arrangements, such as the position of a surrogate mother, but also in respect of the child.  We know there are risks around the law and the sale of children and there are risks around issues that relate to the protection of the right to identity.  There is also the question of what if there is an arrangement that did not comply with the local framework.  In that case there could be a clash between the laws of two different jurisdictions which could end up quite complex.  For that reason it is fair to say there needs to be a basis on which we will say there will be certain arrangements we will not recognise.<br/><br/>The question then becomes when that should happen and, in my view, that should happen as early as possible.  If we are not going to grant recognition because, for example, the surrogate mother did not adequately dissent or because local laws were not observed, we need to find that out very early on and that then becomes a dispute between the surrogate mother and the intending parents in the jurisdiction where the arrangement took place, which must be resolved under the laws of that jurisdiction and in its courts.  It is kept in one jurisdiction and it avoids it becoming a cross-jurisdictional issue where the child is now in Ireland and we get into all sorts of very significant complications around enforcement, recognition of judgments, conflicts of law and so on.  If we all agree there are certain red lines we would wish to draw to say these are the types of surrogacy arrangements we would not be happy to stand over, then there needs to be a possibility of our courts saying they are not going to recognise particular ones.<br/><br/>Where would that lead to?  That leads to a slightly separate point, which is a point I made earlier about the protections we would provide in our domestic law for the foreign surrogate mother.  If we make those completely equivalent to the protections we would provide in domestic law, they will end up being quite detailed and prescriptive.  As the detailed and prescriptive regime we might have domestically might differ from the regimes in other jurisdictions, they might not always align and that would increase the number of cases in which our courts would look at an international surrogacy arrangement and say it has not met the requirements for recognition in this country and therefore they are not going to grant recognition.  What does that mean in practice?  It means children are back to the same situation I have already outlined, which is that the father with the genetic connection could receive a declaration of parentage, he would have to go to court to get that and that may take a certain amount of time.  The mother could only ever become a guardian, could never be recognised as a parent and would have to wait up to two years to make that application.<br/><br/>In my report, to smooth over that particular issue with the mother and the two-year wait for guardianship, I proposed a halfway solution to steer people towards the best practices that would meet the standards we would like to see met, which would be to say, if a person meets those standards, he or she will be eligible for full parentage.  We have heard from the families repeatedly that parentage is what they want so that is an incentive for them to adhere to the highest standards.  On the other hand, if there are cases that fall short of that in certain circumstances, for example, if people use an unknown donor and, therefore, the right to identity could not be traced, they would not be entitled to parentage but could still apply to the court for guardianship.  That would mean the application would have to be heard by the court and decided in terms of the best interests of the child.</p></speech>

My fear from his response to the issues paper and from his opening statement is that by having the application via a virtual hearing, which is acceptable to me, and where it emerges there are problems with consent or something along those lines, parents find themselves in a situation where the child is refused entry to Ireland.  What does that mean?  Do the parents need to establish a home in the country in which the baby was born?</p> <p>  I believe it would be much better to have a regime in place that dealt with consent and issues and had some foresight before a pregnancy begins.  That would be the preferable safeguard for everybody, including the child who may by citizenship and a genetic link to his or her father have a right to be an Irish citizen but not a right to come to Ireland because of a consent issue.  A safer sequence of events would be to have a vetting of the factors that go into a surrogacy agreement within Ireland.  I understand we are dealing with a different jurisdiction etc., so there is complexity, but I believe that it would be better to have a checklist.</p> <p>  In 2012, while Alan Shatter was the Minister for Justice, a document was issued that was necessary for the issuing of an emergency travel certificate, and that is what is used.  That involves a member of the embassy overseeing the DNA testing in the presence of the surrogate mother and her presence is about assessing whether consent is given and whether there is an understanding.  The document is to give an assessment in that meeting.  It is a case of us doing it by using the body of knowledge that would arise around that country and perhaps the clinic within that country, because that can vary.  I ask Professor O'Mahony to comment on the sequencing of events.</p></speech>

It is a little tricky but it could possibly be smoothed over and we could have a position where it would be seen as just the authorisation or green light to the Irish parents that would allow them start on a journey that will lead them to another place later in Irish law.  We could have that, acknowledging there would be a certain degree of limitation in the event of it clashing with something in the law of the jurisdiction where the arrangement takes place.  Ultimately, that law would have to take priority because it would be the law in effect in that jurisdiction.</p><p> My terms of reference for the report required me to look to the international legal framework and output of the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.  The UN special rapporteur is quite clear in stressing the importance of having the opportunity for the surrogate mother to have the chance to raise an objection after the child is born.</p></speech>

In that jurisdiction, if the parents are on the birth certificate, those parents have all the rights that flow from it.  The minute they step on a plane and come back to Ireland, they suddenly do not have the right to consent for medical treatment or such things.  The two elements are not mutually exclusive.  We can have a presumption and a green light if it looks like everything is there with a follow-up remote hearing and perhaps some interim arrangement that checks in and verifies that payments are going directly to the surrogate.  There would be safeguards in place that must be proven along the course of the pregnancy.  Ultimately, there would be a hearing that gives an opportunity for the surrogate to object so she is maintaining bodily integrity and has an opportunity to voice an objection to say the process was fraudulent or otherwise, for example.</p></speech>

The complexity arises when the surrogate raises an objection.  I may have misinterpreted the Senator but it sounded a little like she was mentioning that the surrogate would raise that objection in the hearing before the Irish courts.  No matter the legal framework, we would not want to recognise surrogacy arrangements from a jurisdiction that did not ensure the surrogate had consented freely.  If the surrogate was raising an objection about an absence of free and informed consent, that objection would be more appropriate for raising in the courts of the jurisdiction where the arrangement took place.  They would the one who would ultimately determine authoritatively whether the surrogacy arrangement met the requirements of local laws.  That is the same way it would happen for our domestic framework that we are looking to enact; if the surrogate raised an objection, the Irish courts would determine that.</p> <p>  This raises the tricky question that if a surrogate in another jurisdiction raises a claim in that jurisdiction's courts stating that she did not fully consent, how would the Irish system respond?  There could be a position where we would simply say we would recognise whatever judgment those courts reach.  That is one possible solution.  That raises the question again of where is the child and whether he or she is here or there.  If a child has already been brought here but the courts of the other jurisdiction were to decide that it was not a valid surrogacy arrangement in that jurisdiction due to a problem with consent, it gets into some difficulties around conflict of laws and enforcement issues for that judgment.  These could potentially be overcome but in some ways there would be fewer variables if the child remained in the jurisdiction where the child was born until that dispute could be fully resolved.</p></speech>

Many of the recommendations in my report and aspects of the document speak to the potential downsides and consequences where people stray outside the lines.  Much of that is aimed at encouraging the best practice in the first place.  In the event that people are very careful and selective about which countries they go to and the arrangements in which they engage, making sure everything is completely on the level from day one, the prospect of things going wrong in that way and difficulties arising at a later point would be greatly reduced to begin with.  That is not to say it would never arise and, of course, things can happen and mistakes can be made.  People try to eliminate that prospect and my judgment was this would be the lesser of two evils and it would be better than to have such a case rather than a case with a looser framework allowing more scope for some of those risks to come up on a more regular basis.</p></speech>

I have put these questions to different witnesses and a concern I have is that this committee is to last for three months.  Today we have had the ombudsman before us and we have had great witnesses before, particularly families involved with surrogacy.  What is Professor O'Mahony's opinion on that, particularly as the legislation is so important?</p> <p>  I am asking about the timescale first because while this is not criticism of any Department, this matter will fall under three or four different Departments.  I said the last day that I wonder whether there should be one Department leading this and working with the other Departments.  When dealing with matters and going from one Department to another, they all do their best, as the witness knows, but sometimes it just does not work.  What is Professor O'Mahony's view on the time allowed to our committee?  Is the work doable or do we need to look at a longer timescale, practically speaking?  There is also the issue of this falling under so many different Departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1929" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#Q00900"><p>On the timeframe question, there is no doubt the committee has been given a bit of steep hill to climb to do all this in three months.  I commend all the committee members on their hard work and it is very clear people are putting in an enormous amount of time and effort and are taking the matters incredibly seriously.  I know many members are prefacing questions by saying how complicated the issue is and they are still learning but it is clear that all the members are very much getting their head around the topic despite the complexity.  It is a result of the hard work everyone has put in, which is fantastic to see.  There is much to do and three months is a very short amount of time in which to do it.  The report must also be produced.  I know well in my job, where I write many reports, that much time and effort goes into writing the report after putting in the time to gather information in the first place.  It is a very short timeframe.</p> <p>  Aside from the work of the committee, the target of getting the Bill done before the summer recess is very tight.  It is in some senses an arbitrary target.  I know people in the Civil Service and legislative system more generally might say it is a slightly na&iuml;ve comment because things can change from year to year, including the order of business.  It has taken us years to reach this point and of course we would like to see this done quickly.  We would all like to see that there would be no further delay but whatever we enact will regulate surrogacy in Ireland for a generation.  Realistically speaking, there is not going to be an appetite to come back and tweak this in a big way any time soon.  I am certainly of the view that it would be much better for this to take another six or 12 months, if necessary, to get it right rather than putting through something now that is incomplete or where there may be difficulties and it remains how we do things for 20 years or more.</p> <p>  Ideally, I would rather see the committee given a little more time and space to really do its work to the best possible standard.  Looking at its current form, I would rather see the Bill coming back around next year than being enacted in its current form.</p></speech>

I would not mind working through the summer to get the Bill through correctly and as quickly as possible.  How does Professor O'Mahony feel about all the different Departments being involved?  To me, that is a big question.</p></speech>

There is a reality that the nature of the topic cuts across the remit of several Departments.  It is part of the reason it has taken so long to get where it is.</p><p>It is also part of the reason why it is so hard to get consensus on this issue because when one has that many different stakeholders who all have their own views and priorities, it can be very difficult to get them all on to the same page.  There is no doubt that is a significant complicating factor in formulating this legislation and in arriving at the best possible result.  As the old saying goes about too many cooks, which might be a little too harsh to use in this context, it is just the reality that the more people that are involved, the more variables there are in the equation and it makes it harder-----</p></speech>

I certainly acknowledge that it is a factor here which definitely makes the whole issue much harder to deal with.</p></speech>

There is a misunderstanding in some of the questioning that has been going on that we need to talk about in regard to the birth certificate.  Where a child is born in a country, their birth is registered in that country and they receive a birth certificate which is a legal document.  When the person applies for a passport, and when all of the legal issues in Ireland have eventually been dealt with, the passport forever and a day shows that the person's citizenship is of Ireland but the place of birth on the passport states the city and the country where the person was born.  We have had discussion as to whether the surrogate mother should be on the birth certificate or not and how that should be.  That is not in the gift of the Irish Government to legislate for.  We are talking about a measure by which we can ensure the identity and gestational information of the surrogate mother, and the donor if there is a donor involved, are registered and that there is a requirement to register it.</p> <p>  There has been a misunderstanding in the committee, and the professor&rsquo;s discussion this morning highlighted it to me to be fair, which is that it is not in our gift to legislate for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1938" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051200002#R00700"><p>In the international context, the Senator is correct.  The other issue which further confuses this is that this Bill is also dealing with domestic surrogacy.  The situation, of course, would be slightly different with respect to domestic surrogacy and a decision would need to be made on the domestic surrogacy framework about how the birth certificate addresses that question.  In respect of international surrogacy, what the Senator said is exactly right.  That creates a further decision to be made on whatever provision is made around how the birth certificate would be handled by the domestic frameworks.  Would it be aligned with the position of international surrogacy arrangements or would there be some differential position between the two?</p> <p>  I go back to the key point for me - I do not have a strong view on what exactly the birth certificate says one way or another - that there must be a mechanism for the child to trace his or her identity.  There must be some form of register that includes details about the surrogate mother and about any donors that is accessible, as I have already recommended, from birth through the parents initially and then through the child as the child matures.  The Senator is correct in saying that arrangements for the registration of births in the other jurisdiction is a matter for that jurisdiction and not a matter for the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

While these children have a right, absolutely, to their identity and to their gestational origins, and nobody is disputing that we need a mechanism that preserves that, they also have a right when presenting themselves to keep that information private.  A birth certificate that mandates or obliges a surrogate mother, and a donor perhaps, to be named on the certificates, as has been suggested on this committee by one of our members, undermines that right to privacy for that individual.  When the person goes to get married he or she will have to produce a birth certificate at that stage as an adult and at that point he or she may not wish to go into that detail with the registrar, or whatever, but that does not mean that the person is not fully cognisant of all of the information.</p></speech>

The other implication is on the position of the family.  On the one hand we discussed this morning that there are many good reasons for early disclosure and the evidence points to that being the best approach.  At the same time, there is also the reality that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that it is for parents to guide their children in the exercise of their rights.  The Irish Constitution provides strong protection for the autonomy of the family to make certain decisions for itself.  From that point of view, if parents have good reasons for perhaps wanting to delay the point at which they would let the child know, then the birth certificate may also cut across that if it includes all of that information in the way that the Senator has outlined.</p> <p>  The converse of that on the other hand, in talking about the family having the right to make this decision, is that the current proposals are that none of this information will be accessible to the child or to the parents until the age of 16.  These proposals take that decision away from the family and it is the State saying to families that it thinks it is not in the best interests of children to find out their full identity until the age of 16, which is a very difficult decision to stand over.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach will be aware, committees undertake detailed work that does not lend itself to consideration in plenary sessions.  While our work is intensive, our collective remit is extensive and the approach taken enables Parliament to engage with the partners, public bodies, and the public in general, in a meaningful and direct manner.</p> <p>  As for today's meeting, I look forward to a constructive engagement that will hopefully be of mutual benefit to the Taoiseach and to us as committee Cathaoirligh.  We will now proceed directly to the substantive part of the meeting.  I ask the Taoiseach to make his opening statement.  You are very welcome Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I wish to recognise the important role of Oireachtas committees in providing advice to the Houses of the Oireachtas on a range of matters in their sectoral areas, including on legislation, policy and the public finances.  The work of committees is an essential support to, and a great enabler of, efficiency and effectiveness in the work of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would like to thank you, as committee Chairs, for your contribution in this regard, especially given the challenges of the past two years.  Today is an opportunity to discuss issues of interest to us all and as I look forward to an interactive engagement, I will keep my introductory remarks brief.</p> <p>  This Government came into office in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis.  The Covid-19 pandemic affected every part of our society and at all times, in seeking to protect the lives and health of our people, the Government was deeply conscious of the extraordinary burden that the necessary public health restrictions placed on everyone.  The unprecedented sacrifices made by people, and our comprehensive vaccination programme, unquestionably saved lives and reduced illness.  The very significant level of intervention by Government, to the tune of over &euro;20 billion, was essential to support workers and businesses, and to protect the economy.</p> <p>  With the pandemic receding, we saw economic and social recovery taking hold last year.  Unfortunately, with Russia&rsquo;s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, we now again face some uncertainty.  Our first priority must be to provide protection for those fleeing the war in Ukraine and, as members know, significant work has been and is being done to provide accommodation, income and other supports for people arriving here.</p> <p>  On the economic front, Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine is disrupting international supply chains, increasing energy costs and damaging confidence in the global economy.  The Government recognises the impacts on households and businesses, especially with increasing energy and other prices.  We have already taken steps to help ease the impact, through grants to households for energy costs, temporary reductions in excise duties and VAT on fuel, as well as substantial, targeted supports for those most vulnerable in receipt of the fuel allowance.  We have also taken a number of measures to support heavily impacted sectors, including haulage, farming and hospitality.  In total, taking into account also the cost of living supports in budget 2022, we have provided more than &euro;2 billion to help households, families and businesses.</p> <p>  Over the past year, as the pandemic has receded, we have seen recovery take hold in our economy.  Employment is now at record levels, accompanied by a strong rebound in consumer spending and in private investment.  Growth in modified domestic demand, a good proxy for the domestic economy, was 6.5% in 2021.  The year 2021 also saw substantial growth in foreign direct investment, FDI, with the highest employment creation figures ever in a single year despite the challenge of Covid-19.  More than half of the new investments announced in 2021 went to regional locations, with FDI employment growth in every region.  In 2021 we also saw the highest annual increase in jobs in our indigenous businesses supported by Enterprise Ireland.  This job growth took place in all regions, with almost 70% of new jobs occurring outside of Dublin, and particularly strong growth in the north west and south east.  We continue to see a strong performance in Exchequer returns, with underlying trends a positive sign of the strength of the domestic recovery.</p> <p>  Our recovery has been supported by implementation of the Government&rsquo;s economic recovery plan.  This plan outlines how we are preparing our society, our economy, and our people to seize the opportunities that are to come, in particular in the areas of green and digital, while striving to improve our quality of life and safeguard our continued prosperity.  Overall, despite international uncertainties and the challenges we face, we expect the economy to grow by about 4% this year, unemployment to fall to close to 5%, and a Government deficit of less than 1%, which is a remarkable performance that speaks to the resilience of our economy.</p> <p>  Housing, of course, remains a priority for the Government.  In Housing For All, the Government set out our ambitions to transform the provision of housing in this country.  We aim to increase the supply of housing to an average of more than 33,000 units per year over the next decade.  This is the largest ever multi-annual investment programme for housing, with in excess of &euro;20 billion being made available through to 2026.  Supply is absolutely key in this agenda.</p> <p>  Climate action, and putting our environment back on a sustainable path, is also at the very centre of our work as a Government.  Climate action can enable us to protect the environment and develop new jobs and new sectors that can thrive in a decarbonised world.  No-one should underestimate the enormous challenge we face in halving emissions by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  In tackling this challenge, we need to bring people with us through a just transition.  That is one of the reasons the Government has committed to enhance social dialogue, to listen and engage deeply with employers, trade unions, and wider social partners, on the profound challenges we face.</p><p>Our experience in the Covid-19 pandemic has, I believe, underscored our deep appreciation for our public services, in particular our health service.  We owe all who work in our health service a deep debt of gratitude.  It is incumbent on us to redouble our efforts to support the transformation of our health service by implementing Sl&aacute;intecare.  In 2022, we will spend a record &euro;21 billion on our health and social care services.  This will allow us to reduce waiting lists, increase capacity, protect our most vulnerable, and deliver the right care, in the right place at the right time.</p><p> I could continue with many other policy priorities for Government but I am conscious that we have limited time so I will stop here.  I look forward to hearing the contributions from all members and to engaging on the issues raised.</p></speech>

Before we move on to the next part of the meeting I will do a quick recap on the procedures that we have agreed.  We will take questions from cathaoirligh in groups of three.  They will be called upon in order of their appointment under the D'Hondt model, followed by non-D'Hondt committees.</p> <p>  Members will be delighted to hear that the next information I will outline is an abbreviated version.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  A time limit of two and a half minutes was proposed, but in a spirit of generosity, and as a reflection of the generous nature of my own personality, we are going to up that to three minutes per Cathaoirleach.  Cathaoirligh will put their questions in groups of three and the Taoiseach will be given four minutes to respond to the questions of each group.  As our time is limited, we will be using the clock and adhering to the time limits.  In the event that somebody is not present, I will move to the names in the group below.  As a result, I might call people earlier than indicated.  Without further ado, the first person up is Deputy Howlin, Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, but as we agreed in the Standing Orders, he is also the Leas-Chathaoirleach of this committee as well.  He has a double function here today.  He should lead the way.  He will be followed by Deputy Quinlivan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1952" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#B00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas, a Chathaoirligh, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach.  I feel like an interloper because I am not a Cathaoirleach, so I get to do the work without having the remuneration, which is good.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has a very broad remit.  We have been concentrating on Brexit very strongly in the initial parts of this term, but I do not want to talk to the Taoiseach about Brexit today.  Normally, because of the current situation I would have lots of questions about that, but the committee very recently made a visit to Moldova and Romania.  As the Taoiseach is aware, they are countries that are at the forefront of the humanitarian response to the extraordinary humanitarian crisis that has evolved after the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine.  The response of those two states has been amazing and hugely impressive.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach four related questions in that regard to which he might respond.</p> <p>  Ireland has undertaken to take 500 refugees from Moldova, complex refugees requiring specific supports.  We have not been able to ascertain exactly the situation with them.  If he does not have the information now, the Taoiseach might be able to indicate to us what progress we have made to date in dealing with the pledge we made and what further pledges in terms of taking some of the 100,000 plus refugees that are in Moldova, a very poor country?</p> <p>  Moldova is also in need of financial support.  We have given &euro;1 million, which is a paltry amount.  We met the health Minister there and the health infrastructure is under enormous pressure.  I know we give considerable sums to international organisations, but the committee was anxious that we would give cash directly to the health systems and other government agencies in Moldova.  Is this something the Government has contemplated?</p> <p>  We were hugely impressed by the degree of preparation those relatively poor countries have made in regard to preparing for refugees.  What have we done to prepare for a further influx of refugees that is now likely?  Has the Taoiseach engaged with those countries to see how we can replicate some of the preparations they have made?</p> <p>  I am going to stay within the time allocated, so my final question is as follows.  On the trip to Moldova, we engaged with it on its application, together with Ukraine and Georgia, to join the European Union.  They are very realistic about what is required of them and the timelines that might be envisaged.  What are we doing to enhance our bilateral relations with those potential candidate countries?  We are aware that we do not have an embassy in either Moldova or in Georgia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1953" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#B00400"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for coming.  As he well knows, D&aacute;il committees do very important and often excellent work.  The committee I chair is the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We have done a lot of work in the past year or so on issues of corporate enforcement, sick pay legislation and permits among other issues, involving a significant workload engaging with stakeholders to get expert advice, producing well-researched reports, scrutinising and strengthening Bills.  As the Taoiseach is aware, a lot of the work goes under the radar, as it should do.  Many committees, however, are under huge pressure due to their workload and I would like to request additional resources to support members with administrative support on Private Members' legislation especially, but also with pre-legislative scrutiny.  We need additional resources in the Oireachtas Library and Bills Office and to support the work we do in committees.  A significant burden is currently placed on existing staff, who already do a fantastic job, but additional resources would greatly help to address this.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could have a look at that and see if we can get additional staff, in particular in the Bills Office and in the Oireachtas Library, to do more research work, which we all need.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach might be aware that the most Oireachtas committees will have received a letter from the Joint Committee on the Good Friday Agreement regarding part of its terms of reference.  It concerns consideration of the extension of the special invitee status of Northern Irish MPs to other Oireachtas committees.  At the launch of the National Economic and Social Council comprehensive report on a shared island, which the Taoiseach said was a hugely significant initiative, he said our goal is to work through all-Ireland partnerships to invest for a more connected, sustainable and prosperous Ireland for all.  He said we are working intensively now on a whole-of-government basis to make it happen.  Surely one aspect of that would be to facilitate any Northern Irish MPs who may wish - I understand some may not wish to attend - Oireachtas committees as special invitees.  Does the Taoiseach agree that all committees should try to include Northern Ireland MPs as special invitees?  Will he commit to moving this forward, and will he work to ensure that all barriers to the proposals are removed.  The situation currently is that committees are being asked to look at it individually and I do not think that is the way we should go forward.  We should come up with some sort of solution to this.  I understand there is legal advice in that regard, but if the will is there we can get around this.  They are my two questions, the first on resources for committees to make sure they can work properly and effectively and, the second, to consider the issue of special invitees to be able to come to all committees if they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1954" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1583" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#B00500"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach.  The Joint Committee on Justice is probably one of the most, if not the most, legislatively heavy committees in the Houses.  It processes a very significant body of legislation.  In the first term, in the first year of the sitting year of the committee, we processed 50% or more of the entire Government legislation published in that term.  We have been managing this proactively.  We have allocated 50% of our slots and available time to legislation, be that pre-legislative scrutiny or Committee Stage referrals, and from that we have now completed pre-legislative scrutiny of 18 Government Bills that were referred, including stakeholder engagement submissions and oral engagement at committee.  We have also processed ten Government Bills through Committee Stage and beyond.  We have processed five elective modules at this stage for the committee's own interest, which includes such topics as GDPR; civil liberties during the pandemic and whether the balance was struck; and issues of domestic and gender-based violence.  We have upcoming modules on the coroner system and we are considering policy areas on the decriminalisation of small quantities of prescribed narcotics.</p> <p>  There is an interesting broad range of elected modules within the committee as well.  In addition to the Government legislation and our own electives, we have also had five Private Members' Bills referred for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Of those, the Dying with Dignity Bill in particular took some considerable time and engagement.  We received 1,400 submissions from members of the public and interested parties on that, which took some intensive engagement.</p><p>Ultimately, the Bill was not considered fit for purpose or ready to progress, due to drafting errors and legal errors.  However, it did raise important policy issues.  We were glad to have the opportunity to consider it.</p><p> The asks to Government are quite straightforward and simple.  We have a legislative-heavy workload.  We are very much up for the job in getting through it and processing it.  I would make some points.  One is that there is tendency from the Department to refer a plethora of items for pre-legislative scrutiny at one time.  We may therefore get a bulk of Bills referred over the course of one or two days.  Then the trail goes cold.  We also have an issue with Committee Stage legislation.  We tend to reserve a committee slot each month and we have Committee Stage referrals coming through.  However, on occasion, the Department has pulled a Bill at short notice when a Committee Stage was scheduled and, because of the timelines and Standing Orders etc. it is not possible then to re-engage another meeting.  We hate to see a slot going to waste, particularly when there is such a busy schedule.  We stressed to the Department before that a back-up list should be created, whereby if a Bill is not ready for Committee Stage for whatever reason, another Bill should be substituted so that we can make the most of the time and that we can optimise it for all.  That has not happened to date and perhaps the Government could look at that.</p><p> As a concluding remark, I will give an example of the system working well.  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill recently went to Second Stage in the House, having been published.  I noted that it took on board, and the Minister acknowledged in her opening speech, a number of recommendations from the committee.  This was probably the first Bill that has gone full cycle in this D&aacute;il in that it came to us for pre-legislative scrutiny, it went back to Government, it was amended and adopted, and then it went to Second Stage.  I was very pleased and the committee welcomed the fact it included a number of our recommendations.  We thank them.  That is an example of the system working well.  I thank the Taoiseach for being here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1956" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#C00200"><p>First, in relation to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s point, we have approximately 29,000 - I can check those figures for the Deputy - Ukrainians who are fleeing war.  We did undertake to take in 500 from Moldova.  I will check the specifics on that and I will come back to the committee and to the Deputy.  I will take on board what he said about financial support.  Initially, in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the war, we tend to allocate the humanitarian assistance through the United Nations bodies, through international NGOs, the WHO, the UN, UNICEF etc.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the 1 million people going to Moldova.  I am very concerned about a country like Moldova and its capacity to absorb what it has to absorb.  I will talk to my colleagues in government to see if we can do something more specific to Moldova in relation to financial supports and any other capacity supports that we can help with them with, such as logistical or rapid response teams that might be able to help in certain respects.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of Moldova&rsquo;s application to join the EU.  I am on the side of those who believe that we should accelerate the European perspectives of the neighbourhood.  I see it from a fundamentally geopolitical perspective.  If you look at what happened in 2004, when we took in ten new states, many of those had different and varying levels of economic and social development.  Yet, it is unquestionable now, looking at it from this point in time, that was an overwhelming success.  There are concerns more laterally with some countries that joined and about whether they were ready.  However, the bottom line is that if those countries were not in the European Union now, they would be vulnerable and they would feel vulnerable to the kind of aggression that Ukraine is experiencing.  The European Union cannot complain about Russian meddling in the neighbourhood, be it in the western Balkans or in the eastern neighbourhood, if the EU is not moving purposefully to facilitate the application pathways of countries such as Georgia and Moldova.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that they are realistic about their prospects.</p> <p>  We have taken further steps to engage with those countries on the measures they have taken.  We have tended to move on the hotels and on any vacant accommodation that is available.  It is now increasingly clear is that many Ukrainian people prefer the multiple occupancy at the moment.  They would prefer to stay with their network of people with whom they have come in.  They are sometimes reluctant to go into an individual house, for example, if they have been in a congregated grouping for a period of time.  They probably get strength from their networks.</p> <p>  The next phase will be to reconfigure a range of properties that have been identified by a team that the Department of Housing, Government and Local Heritage put together.  These were former local authority executives who looked at a range of buildings.  They have said that these can be more readily reconfigured in the short term to provide locations for families and for people who are fleeing.  The pledged aspect of this needs to be accelerated.  It has been a slow process.  In terms of the Irish Red Cross, many of the properties pledged have not emerged.  Yet, there is anecdotal evidence that it could be made speedier.  There are all the vetting issues that go with that.</p> <p>  In terms of bilateral arrangements under the global strategy, there is room for us within that European neighbourhood to increase and expand our footprint as we continue to expand our diplomatic footprint across Europe and across the world.</p> <p>  Deputy Quinlivan raised the point of the need for supports for the committees.  I would have thought that would have been a job for the Oireachtas Commission.  I will check with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as to what type of bilateral engagement has taken place between the commission and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and about the overall envelope that is allocated.  My understanding is that there has not been too much agitation around the envelope, although &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; might be the wrong word.  I do not get a sense that there have been huge demands.  I will be careful what I say now, because I might be inviting demands.  Normally the Oireachtas Commission gets a sizeable budget.</p></speech>

It has been substantive.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point about the loading of legislation and then a valley period and the withdrawal of Bills at short notice.  That should not happen.  There should be a back-up all of the time to make sure that is a continuous pipeline of legislation.  Justice is one area where there is a significant pipeline of legislation.  That has always tended to be the case.  I am interested in what the Deputy is saying.  There are different perspectives on pre-legislative scrutiny, which has probably gone far beyond what people might have envisaged it to be originally.  There are essentially two Committees Stages now as well.  That lengthens the time for legislation to get through the House.  Originally, my sense of pre-legislative scrutiny when it was conceived and agreed in 2016 was that it would be a technical pre-legislative scrutiny to make sure the Bill was literate and that it made sense etc.  However, it has become a much a bigger operation now.  That is something that will come forward in discussions.</p></speech>

I also thank the Taoiseach for coming in.  It is good to have this type of engagement.</p> <p>  I know that Deputy Lawless' committee has much legislation but we have had a lot as well.  Even just the name of our committee - the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - shows the range of topics and wide remit of both the Department and committee.  I will briefly run through some of both the topics and legislation at which we have been looking.</p> <p>  We had many of the issues that emerged from the time of the mother and baby homes with regard to the Institutional Burials Bill 2022 and information and tracing legislation.  We have now also started looking for submissions for the pre-legislative scrutiny stage of the redress scheme.  They nearly all sort of came together, let us say, within the last year or year and a half.  We were delighted to be able to actually get through them, however, particularly with Covid-19, and also to able to bring so many witnesses physically into the D&aacute;il even during Covid.  We were delighted to achieve that.</p> <p>  Some of the more topical issues we have been looking at include children with disabilities waiting for assessments of need.  We have been looking particularly at the report by the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, on child poverty, particularly in the context of Covid-19, and how that was really brought into sharp contrast for everybody.  We also had the opportunity, which was brilliant, to hear from children themselves with regard to Covid-19.  They were able to Zoom in to the committee to talk about their experiences.  Being a children's committee, we want to do more of that.  Also, for everybody's information, it is the European Year of Youth.  It is something we will hopefully be able to do a little more of, which at this stage will probably be after the summer recess.  We also considered the general scheme of the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill.</p> <p>  Some of my questions have been addressed.  They are kind of a combination of what Deputies Quinlivan and Lawless asked about regarding resources and the logistical aspects with the Department.  A lot of the legislation has come together.  I acknowledge some of this legislation has been on the books for a long time and so I can understand how that happens but, for example, ironically, the work life balance and miscellaneous provisions Bill has been referred to us.  We are actually under serious pressure to try to get that done and yet that is a piece to which we really should be giving a lot of time.  I am not sure exactly whose remit that falls into but there may be a better way of streamlining or planning some of the legislation because committees need to look at topics as well.  I know we need to prioritise legislation but it is good for committees to look at topics like, for example, child poverty, and to be able to do really good reports on that.  Sometimes, it feels like we get bogged down in all of the legislation and there is not as much time for topics.  I imagine that can be an issue for the Department too because a huge amount falls to it, particularly now in the context of everything that is happening in Ukraine.  That also falls to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p></speech>

We all know the pandemic was an incredibly stressful time for all involved in public health.  I would not fault anyone for wanting to step away now that we appear to be coming through the worst of it.  However, my fear is that it represents a huge loss in institutional memory in the health service.  Is the Government concerned about this?  What is the timeframe for filling these posts once they become vacant?  Does the Government intend to look outside the public service to fill the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, post specifically?</p> <p>  The other issue is that back in 2019, there was commitment from the Taoiseach of the day to bring cervical testing back to Ireland and halt the sending of smear tests abroad for testing.  We all know the reasons why.  It is now 2022.  All the cervical samples from Irish women are being sent abroad for screening.  Does the Taoiseach intend to honour his predecessor's commitment?  Does the Government intend to ramp up our testing capacity?  Traditionally, we were only able to do approximately 10% of smear tests taken annually.  When does the Taoiseach expect the samples to be tested again in Ireland?  What target percentage of tests does the Government hope to test domestically into the future and by when?  Again, I understand if the Taoiseach does not have those answers; he might come back to me.</p> <p>  I want to get back to some of the previous questions regarding resources.  With regard to the national children's hospital, the committee has now, to an extent, been bounced into the issue of trying to bring in people.  I welcome the fact that we are getting the opportunity now to open up the issue to the public.  We appealed to the Minister yesterday, however, that we just do not have the time to bring in as many people as we have.  I know there is a potential decision on this next Tuesday-----</p></speech>

We were talking about meeting on Friday for another number of hours.  We are really racing against the clock here.  It is not of our making.  I can understand the urgency of trying to get this across the line but if we are really serious about D&aacute;il scrutiny and dealing with this issue, I am appealing that we need time as a committee.  We need resources as well.  It is again to back up what some of the other Chairs said; many of the staff are exhausted at this stage in relation to the amount of stuff that is going through committees.  We need that additional support for which the members are calling.</p></speech>

Many of the great challenges of the State the Taoiseach mentioned at the outset, including the war on Ukraine and its knock-on effects on the price of fuel, the cost of living and so on fall to the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  I must say, we have a committee that is comprised of 14 incredibly engaged members from across all parties in the Oireachtas.  I pay tribute to them for their work week in, week out.</p> <p>  We have undertaken a huge amount of work on  significant legislation that is priority legislation for this Oireachtas such as the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and more recently, the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022, which is going through now.  We played a big role in proposing the carbon budgets, which went before the Oireachtas recently.  We are doing other work around the legislative load around how we face the challenges of our State, particularly with regard to climate, environment, biodiversity, the built environment, grid development and so on.  We have had very positive engagement with other committees.  I particularly pay tribute to Deputy Cahill, Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with whom we have worked closely.</p> <p>  I wish to mention three particular issues.  They are not necessarily questions but I would certainly invite a response.  They are important issues to think about.  In our committee, we set out the huge opportunity for Ireland towards the end of this decade and into the next few decades in renewable energy, and for Ireland to become an energy exporter.  There is a concern in the system that unless we start to prepare for that now very seriously and diligently, we may miss the boat on it and other countries will get ahead of us and we will be last.  That would be remiss if that was the case.</p> <p>  There is a concern around the aligning of city and county development plans and the work of relevant bodies such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and other relevant bodies as per the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and how their operations will align with their duties under the Act.  That is just something to put on the Taoiseach's radar.  It is a very difficult challenge for those bodies to align their operations with the 51% cut and the net zero target and so on.  I would not at all pretend that it is straightforward but it is something on which there needs to be a whole-of-government approach and, certainly, leadership from the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p> Equally important is the challenge we have on communications with respect to climate.  We saw recently that when the rubber hits the road with climate action we struggle as a country.  The committee has engaged with people, and over the past 18 months we have become very educated on the issues.  Perhaps we are guilty of not conveying to wider society the challenges that exist.  Something to put on the Taoiseach's radar is that a serious effort needs to be made by the Government and all of the Oireachtas to highlight the challenges relating to climate action, whether it is cycle lanes or road projects.  The recent controversy regarding turf is related to this.</p><p> I want to pick up on Deputy Quinlivan's point on resources.  I accept the Taoiseach's comment that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is the appropriate body.  He mention the Parliamentary Budget Office.  There is a strong case to be made for a similar resource to educate all Oireachtas Members on the issues relating to climate, many of which are extremely complex.  The members of all the committees would value such a resource.</p></speech>

The latter will give unprecedented access to birth records and is very important.  There was the burials legislation and now we have the payments legislation.  There are also other issues.  I pay tribute to the fantastic innovation that children are able to use Zoom for Oireachtas committees.  We need more of this in terms of citizenship and linking our children and young people to the democratic process.  It is a fantastic initiative.  If there is anything we can do to assist with this and add to it, I would be more than delighted.  Yesterday, I met a young student from Kerry, Daith&iacute; &Oacute; Loinsigh, who won a competition to deliver a video to sell to his peers the idea of a career in the public service.  I did not think it was the greatest prize of all, but first prize was to interview the Taoiseach.  He was happy enough to come in and interview me.  We need to do more of this.  It is very important.  Well done on that.</p> <p>  On child poverty, there were recent data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which are quite interesting, regarding the interventions the Government made in respect of pandemic payments and unemployment subsidy payments.  Only for those, we would have had a potentially far worse number of families and children at risk of poverty.  In fact, in the past year or two there were reductions in the number of people at risk of poverty because of the interventions.</p> <p>  With regard to children with disabilities, we need to have a comprehensive review nationally on where we are going with the various Departments.  Before I came into government, I was concerned about how Progressing Disability was progressing and about the relationship between the health side and the education side.  We need to be very pragmatic in the context of the interventions and approaches for children.  This is one of the reasons the decision was taken to remove disability from the Department of Health and have it dealt with by a separate Department, which is the Department with responsibility for children.  Health is enormous given the range of responsibilities.  There is certainly more work to be done.  I hear what the Deputy said about resources.</p> <p>  More generally on resources, consistent points have been raised by different Chairs.  I will ask the Secretary General of my Department to discuss with the Secretaries General of all the other Departments logistical arrangements and engagement with this committee and with the committee Chairs.  I will engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission on the broader issue of resources.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised an issue in respect of which there are two factors.  I am loath to speak about people's career choices, career pathways and the decisions that individuals are entitled to make about where they want to go.  Certainly the Chief Medical Officer and the deputy chief medical officer have been two exceptional contributors to the national cause with regard to Covid-19 in particular and in the context of other issues.  There is strong capacity in the public health division in the Department of Health.  I wish both of them well.  People go to the private sector.  The private sector watches talent in the public sector.  Very clearly, there was a lot of interaction between the private sector and the public sector during Covid.  The private sector has got an insight into certain potential movers and shakers.  I am not saying that is the case with these individuals, but it is a reality and we need to take it on board.</p> <p>  With regard to cervical testing, I do not have a specific timeline.  We would probably never have had a CervicalCheck programme if the decision had not been made to go outside but that leads to issues with regard to quality control.  It is preferable that we move as fast as possible to create our own domestic capacity for testing across the board.  Investments are happening and the Minister might have referred to this recently, either at the committee or through publicly issued statements on the investment taking place.</p> <p>  On the national maternity hospital, the Government published all of the documentation.  This has been going on for nine years.  I watched a small snippet on the television over the past couple of days in which some of the people working in Holles Street were saying that this has been going on for nine years and that they are extremely concerned about how long more it will go on.  Over the past 12 to 14 days, I have not heard any clear explanation of the difference between the impact of a leasehold of 300 years and a freehold on the clinical operation and financial independence of the new maternity hospital.  I have not heard it.  I do not quite understand how a leasehold of 300 years impacts on the independence of the hospital.  I cannot see how it does.  No one has explained to me yet how it does.  I take the Deputy's comments in good faith but there is parliamentary function and Executive function, and the Government has to consider this.</p> <p>  People thought decisions had been taken at the end of the process that involved Kieran Mulvey, when he was brought in by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to knock heads together.  He got an agreement.  The most recent public debate on it was when it surfaced during the by-election.  We went back and the current Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, negotiated it with his team in the Department of Health and significant changes were made, particularly with regard to the length of time of the lease.  It is now for 300 years as opposed to 140.  It is many times the expected lifespan of the hospital so the State will get back its investment many times over.  We had decided we needed three State or Government appointees on the board but after the Mulvey process it was only one.  There is a constitution and an operational licence from the HSE for the hospital.  All of these legally not only guarantee but oblige the hospital authorities to provide all lawfully permissible services in the State.  This has been exhausted over quite some length of time.  No doubt over the coming days it will be also.</p></speech>

It is almost two years since the Government was formed and prior to that there were many more years of discussions and toing and froing.  The only objective of the Government is to provide a 21st-century hospital for the women of Ireland and a neonatal centre of excellence.  The current confined conditions of the neonatal unit are nothing to write home about.  There has been exhaustive engagement with all of the authorities.  The whole idea is co-location and to co-locate a maternity hospital with a tertiary hospital of the size and scale of St. Vincent's.  It has been policy for 25 years to co-locate.</p></speech>

That is not a bad idea in terms of resourcing the Parliament in general.  The Oireachtas has to develop a more collective identity on climate change.  We attempted to do this in the past.  For example, the previous D&aacute;il had an Oireachtas committee on the climate.  It did not get unanimity on many issues, and the recent debates are showing that we still have some distance to go.  The carbon tax is one issue and the turf issue is an illustration of that.</p> <p>  All the warnings are extremely grim; what is ahead of us is bad.  The Cabinet committee was given a presentation during the week which was grimmer again, particularly for the children of our children regarding the world they are going to inherit if we do not do something fairly dramatic as a society to change how we behave.  We cannot be saying the bigger countries must do it because every country must do it.  There is potential in it economically for us with regard to jobs and so forth, but I am very worried that because it is still intangible and way in the distance for many people decisions will always be delayed.  If we get into a state of high dudgeon over what we did two weeks ago, I really worry.  We do not have the resources without some revenue streams.  There are two reasons for the carbon tax.  One is that it affects behaviour, and that is based on international research.  Second, it gives us resources to carry out retrofitting and environmentally-friendly farming and to protect against fuel poverty.  The money does not grow on trees, and we need resources to address climate change.  We will need a consistent stream of revenue in some shape or form to address it.</p> <p>  That is just one aspect of it.  There are many other aspects and there will be other challenges coming to the Oireachtas with the carbon budgets and carbon ceilings for each sector.  This is going to be very challenging politically.  I am not getting partisan on this, but it is going to be challenging all round.  It is going to stretch all politicians as this becomes more manifest as we flow through the law.</p> <p>  On wind energy, we have the legislation passed.  I am very taken with this.  We have to get the wind energy right.  It is interesting that many indigenous companies are emerging now in the wind energy area.  I do not wish to be local about it but I attended the Cork Chamber of Commerce dinner last week and it was interesting that, for the first time, of the three companies that won awards two of them were in the offshore space.  That is a sign, perhaps, that the enterprise base is responding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1988" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#F00700"><p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to present a couple of the policy issues being dealt with by the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The first is forestry.  The committee has devoted a lot of time to forestry and, unfortunately, the sector is under extreme pressure.  Afforestation levels are the lowest since 1946 and the failure to meet the programme for Government planning targets has resulted in a missed opportunity to remove 8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Farmers have walked away from the afforestation scheme, with just 100 farmers planting land in 2020.  This is due to ongoing issues in the forestry licensing system, incompatibility with the green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and linked issues which have seriously damaged landowners' confidence in forestry, none more so than farmers with forestry which is fatally infected with ash dieback and who are left with dying or rotting trees on their land.  These farmers have not been fairly treated when compared with comparable diseases in agriculture such tuberculosis, TB, and brucellosis.</p> <p>  Intervention is needed.  I ask that everything possible be done to address this issue to try to restore farmer confidence.  First, we must ensure a fair scheme is available without delay to those who are suffering as a result of ash dieback.  I suggest that farmers with ash dieback be allowed to claim premium on re-afforested land for the 15 years of growth of the new plantation.  Following the recent legal review of the forestry licensing system, what changes are expected to ensure we have a system in place that is capable of processing licences within a reasonable timeframe of 120 days, including all support schemes such as native woodland conservation, forest roads and ash dieback?  Has the legal review concluded that the thinning of forests is an essential part of woodlands maintenance and that, therefore, a licence to thin should not be required?  This is one of the major logjams in the system.  To convince farmers to play a key role in climate change mitigation we must first make sure farmers are properly supported.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to address briefly is climate change.  We have had joint committee meetings with the climate action committee.  It is essential that we meet the targets in the agrifood sector and in agriculture generally.  A separate budget has to be put in place for farmers to invest in modern technology in order to meet the targets we have under climate change.  The current targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, budget and its ceilings will not incentivise farmers to do what is necessary.  A few days ago the committee met with people to discuss solar panels and the problems they have getting solar panels in place on farms.  There is a requirement for planning permission.  We have to remove VAT on the panels and deal with access to the grid for surplus electricity.  There is a lot of technology at present for the management of slurry, with infrastructure in farm buildings such as rubbers, slats and so forth, and there is ongoing technology on feed additives.  However, it will cost money for farmers to put all this modern technology in place.  A separate budget for incentives to embrace this modern technology would greatly enhance our ability to meet the targets we have set for emissions reductions under climate change.</p></speech>

We all understand there was a Covid-19 pandemic and part of the failure is down to that.  We will not dispute that.  There is an investment of &euro;2.7 billion in the roll-out of the scheme, and there is no argument that it is badly needed in rural areas.  However, there is no sign yet that we are achieving value for money.  The target for the first year of the national broadband plan was 115,000 homes to be passed by the end of January 2022.  National Broadband Ireland, the company tasked with delivering the roll-out, failed drastically to meet that target and passed just 27,000 homes and premises.  Since then, we had the first remedial plan and then there was a second remedial plan, which set a target of 60,000 homes for January 2022.  That failed, and the figure I have given shows it passed just under half that number.</p> <p>  This week, the Committee of Public Accounts received further correspondence from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications informing it that another updated, interim remedial plan had been agreed with a new target of 102,000 homes and premises to be passed by January 2023, which is still way below the original target that was set for the first year.  The situation is becoming farcical.  This is plan number three and we are not even reaching half of the target that was agreed.  The committee also received correspondence from the Department which sets out some of the possible reasons.  It refers to blocked ducting and Covid-19.  The Taoiseach is aware that in the first part of 2021 communications was not one of the industries that were shut down.  Communications continued going and, indeed, NBI was out on the road because its vans were knocking around and they seemed busy.</p><p>We understand there would have been some restrictions because of people being out due to being close contacts and so on.  I raised concerns in the last D&aacute;il and with previous Ministers with regard to the nature of the contract, the fact there was no competitive tendering and just one bidder, and the fact this involved a big risk for the State and the taxpayer.  As I said, &euro;2.7 billion of public money is being invested.</p><p> It is clear that targets are being missed.  Will the Government apply sanctions if the targets are not met?  I have had mixed messaging on that.  I was told by Ministers before the contract was signed that there would be but the Minister informed me earlier in this D&aacute;il, when it was sitting in the convention centre, that there were no penalties.  Rural Ireland needs to plan and everybody is on the one page on that.  However, there is a concern that time is slipping by and I am not totally convinced by the reasons being given, which are in regard to blocked ducting and other things.  These are things we would expect.  Covid does not account for 13 or 14 months of a delay and reaching less than half the targets that we should be reaching.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.1991" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#G00200"><p>I welcome the Taoiseach.  As he knows, the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands produced a report earlier this year on the Pensions Commission recommendations.  One of the key issues for the committee in overcoming our pensions challenge over the next 50 years is the introduction of legislation banning mandatory retirement in employment contracts - both new contracts, as well as being retrospectively applied to current work contracts - giving people the option, if they wish, to work beyond their present retirement age.  It is the view of the committee members that it would be wrong to force people to retire at 65 and then have to wait until 68 to access a pension.</p> <p>  The committee considered a technical paper produced by the Pensions Commission which pointed out that while increasing the State pension age has the greatest impact on reducing pension expenditure, a substantial increase in the employment rate of older workers would also reduce future expenditure.  This paper points out that the difference between increasing the pension age to 68 compared to increasing the employment rate of older workers by ten percentage points over the next 50 years is just 0.3% of GNI*.  This shortfall has already been made up thanks to the higher participation rates in our workforce revealed by the CSO earlier this year.  Surely, if as much effort was put into removing barriers to facilitate older people working longer as there has been in pushing up the retirement age, we believe it would be within our capacity as a country to increase the number of older people working by an average of one fifth of a percentage point a year.</p> <p>  If we remove the forced requirement to retire at 65, many workers will continue to remain in employment.  This is not just because of the changing nature of work, particularly here in Ireland, where we are moving from more manual employment to technology-based or even remote-based employment, which allows people to continue to physically work for far longer, but also because some of the financial realities of living in Ireland today mean people will have to work longer to be financially secure in their retirement.</p> <p>  There is an argument that if we allow people to work beyond their 65th birthday, we are closing off promotion opportunities for younger staff in an organisation.  However, the Civil Service has overcome this challenge for senior positions by filling such posts on a seven-year basis, thus allowing new thinking and younger people to compete for such roles.  There is no reason that, for a change, the private sector cannot take a leaf out of the public sector book.</p> <p>  My questions are as follows.  First, when will the Government make a decision on the pension age eligibility?  Second, will the Government introduce legislation banning the retirement age in employment contracts?</p></speech>

I call the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about this issue.  When this Government came in, the licensing situation was very difficult because of a lot of legal actions that were taken against licences, and reforms and legislation were passed to try to speed that up.  As to the current indications, first, a new national forestry strategy is being developed that will build on previous strategies and give a strategic framework.  In particular, the forestry licensing plan sets a target of about 5,200 new licences for this year, which is 30% above 2021 and will mark an increase in licensing output.  The Department is also engaged in a number of initiatives to reduce the backlog of licences which is currently impacting landowners.</p> <p>  The Deputy has previously referenced with me the issue of the thinning of forests and the necessity for a licence for that activity.  It is a very fair point and I will come back to him with regard to the legal opinions on that.</p> <p>  In terms of support for farmers and the points Deputy Cahill has raised, I will engage with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to the ash dieback challenge and how that may be overcome, but also with regard to income streams.  I mentioned in an earlier contribution the whole idea that part of the carbon tax will be allocated to farming and that there would be an income stream for environmentally-friendly farming schemes.  The Government took a decision on the riparian scheme recently, whereby income supports would be available to farmers and we took away some of the necessity to apply.  I accept these would be very small areas of plantation of 1 ha or less by waterways.  I am anxious that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would move with some speed to implement that.  We need more urgency around afforestation and tree planting.  We have a natural climate for tree planting in this country and we really need to get with it.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of a budget for technology, a point he has been articulating for some time.  It is something that, again, could be considered in terms of the utilisation of the funds that come in.  I have visited companies that produce the rubber slats, in particular the company in Galway, which is internationally renowned.  The impacts are quite significant in terms of reduction of methane and there is no doubt that better technology on the farm can reduce methane and emissions.  It is going to be an accumulation of all the various strands and initiatives that gets us to the end result and there is no one silver bullet that will enable us to do that.  I take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s idea of a fund for technology.</p> <p>  With regard to the point about solar panels, the Deputy mentioned the three aspects of planning, VAT and access to the grid.  The latter is essential and it has not happened as quickly as it should have - I understand there is an issue to be taken up by the Minister in respect of microgeneration.  Again, planning restrictions for smaller solar farms should be less.  For example, we have a ridiculous situation where schools have to apply for planning permission for a small few panels.</p> <p>  To come back to the point made by Deputy Leddin, we are in the middle of an existential crisis and we need to act.  However, of course, as soon as we do that, there will be another chorus of opinion that we should not do that.  That speaks to the earlier points about the collective will across parties to get things done in regard to climate.  I find tremendous energy within the farming community to respond to this challenge through innovation, and that does not often get said.</p> <p>  I will talk to the Minister in regard to the points Deputy Stanley has raised.  First, the contracts were signed some years ago, before this Government came into office.  We all want broadband in remote rural areas.  Covid did have an impact, as the Minister made clear to me.  Some &euro;225 million was committed for 2022 under the national development plan.  I can understand targets being missed in respect of Covid-19 but, again, the Deputy has raised certain points and he said it is now the third plan.  I will go back to the Minister and then come back to the Deputy in regard to the specifics of that.</p></speech>

These are addressed in the updated interim remedial plan, UIRP, and sanctions are accruing with regard to non-delivery of those milestones.  That is what NBI stated.</p><p>That needs to be followed up on.  We cannot continue to let this drift.  It is important that they be delivered well and on time.

We should take away the legislative barrier to facilitating people in the private sector to work longer.  In the year 2000, Ireland was ranked 16th on the European Union league table for life expectancy.  This year, we are ranked number one.  I did a double take when I saw those figures because I did not expect us to be ranked number one.  That will be the story for the next decade in terms of European life expectancy and life expectancy generally, notwithstanding obesity and other challenges.  The modern world has to reflect that.  The only qualification I would offer is that I have a sense people want to cherry-pick the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions for the more palatable aspects, but are less inclined to cherry-pick the contents of its report for the less palatable political implications.  There will be difficulties ahead.  The Government will make decisions in the next number of weeks around the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions.  I know that the Deputy's committee has reported on that matter and that there are many issues which arise.  I note the point he made about the technical paper in which it was pointed out that if the working life age was extended and there was no barrier to people working longer, it would reduce costs.</p></speech>

I chair the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  The big issue for our committee is the publication of the Future of Media Commission's report.  Its publication is extremely important on a number of levels, not least for our public service broadcasters and for the print and online media at local, national and regional level as they face major challenges from new global platforms and changing audience preferences in how content is delivered.  That Future of Media Commission launched a public consultation in December 2020 and received inputs in the form of more than 800 submissions.  It held a series of thematic dialogues which was very important and it was great that happened.  From the committee&rsquo;s point of view, this issue is of great importance.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, we spent months upon months dealing with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  There is considerable concern among not only committee members but also the stakeholders we have heard from about the future of public service broadcasting, public service content and regulation, and, more importantly, with regard to broadcasting, Internet content and the funding of public service broadcasters.  In the background to all of that, we know the impact that has had on democracy, disinformation and media literacy.</p> <p>  As stated, we spent months dealing with the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  We met the stakeholders but all the time we, as a committee, have felt we were doing this with one arm tied behind our backs.  In order words, in a vacuum of not having that report.  We cannot move forward.  I know it is with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I understand that there are big decisions to be made.  What I hope to elicit from the Taoiseach today is a date for the publication of this report.  It is extremely important.  I take this opportunity to make three earnest requests of the Taoiseach when the Government establishes this commission.  The first is that it would be fully resourced.  The second it is that it would have real legal teeth.  I have felt some pushback from the Department in this regard.  If the commission does not have an individual complaint mechanism in place, it will be futile.  I would ask the Taoiseach to ensure that is part of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.2001" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#H00700"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for joining us.  This is an important engagement.  I do not often avail of an opportunity to agree with my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.  He is not here, sadly, to hear me endorse fully his proposal that a greater level of consideration be given to the matter of resourcing our committees.  All our committees work hard and assiduously,  Often, however, it appears we are working away in our own bubble.  The issue of resources is important.  Having said that, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is a committee of some significance.  During the past 25 years, however, never have there been such circumstances in which the work of this committee is under the spotlight to such a degree, especially having regard to the change in the European and national landscapes.</p> <p>  Briefly, I would raise a few issues with the Taoiseach.  The first is regarding Northern Ireland.  How does the Taoiseach respond to an assertion on the part of the UK Government that its intention to unilaterally tear up the Northern Ireland protocol is in the protection of the Good Friday Agreement?  That seems to have been contained in official press releases in the past 24 hours.</p> <p>  Second, acknowledging the crisis of confidence in political unionism, a reluctance on the part of the largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, to enter a power-sharing Executive and further polarisation heightened by the dialled up rhetoric in the course of an election campaign, has the Irish Government a role in dialling back from some of the more polarised rhetoric?  How, for example, can the matter of extreme polarisation be dealt with, particularly having regard to the sensitive and contested issues such as legacy, culture and language?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the challenge for Irish nationalism and for British unionism is to respect the integrity of each other&rsquo;s position?  In this regard, let me signal, on behalf of my committee and on my own behalf, strong support for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s shared island concept and for his work in that regard.  If I could be so bold, I ask him to prioritise this work in the context of his remaining months in office because I believe it is extremely important in the search for solutions.  I thank the Taoiseach for the engagement he has undertaken.</p> <p>  Third, on the matter of the Middle East peace process, our committee furnished a pretty detailed report last year.  It was with regret we noticed the matter was not subjected to any form of D&aacute;il debate.  The Taoiseach will tell me that this is a matter for the Business Committee and not a matter for his office.  However, I am sure he has some influence with the Whip's office.  However, more importantly, does he still see any role for Ireland in the context of the Middle East peace process and has he raised the issue with his international colleagues?</p> <p>  Similarly, last year our committee furnished what we believed was a very important and detailed report on the matter of Covid vaccine equity throughout the world.  Again, however, and unfortunately, we felt that we were talking to ourselves.  However, now that Covid has moved down the agenda, I remind the Taoiseach of its importance and perhaps an important influential role Ireland might have as an advocate in ensuring Covid vaccine equity on the international stage is kept very much on the agenda.</p> <p>  In respect of defence, the current war in Ukraine has placed European security and defence at the top of the agenda.  We see the ever-changing landscape across Europe, even today with Finland, Sweden, Austria and Denmark all re-examining their roles.  I put it to the Taoiseach that our long-held status of being neutral or non-aligned is unsustainable.  How does he see us moving along from that?  I refer to the really important report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is a matter of importance to our committee.</p><p> Moving along from that, I refer to the important report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is a matter of importance for our committee.  I know it has not gone before the Government yet.  I believe there is an urgency there, as well as an importance.  I would ask that the Taoiseach, for example, on the matter of its implementation, might look at what the previous Government did on the matter of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I ask that there would be an implementation role for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department because without having the influence of the Department of the Taoiseach, it might move down the agenda in a way that might give rise to a source of dissatisfaction for some.  The issue of the budget has been mentioned by the Minister, but he will need the Taoiseach&rsquo;s support and the support of the Government because of the low morale in the Defence Forces.  How does the Taoiseach see it?</p><p> Finally, there has been mention of a citizens' assembly.  I, as a committee chair, do not see that as a way forward.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might like to share his view with us.</p></speech>

I am the chair of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I agree with my colleagues on the resourcing of committees.  The workload for the staff is very heavy.  We need extra staff within the committees.  The communications unit has to be resourced as well.  I support the call for that.</p> <p>  Our committee has done quite a bit of pre-legislative scrutiny.  The only observation I have to make on that is that the outline of the contents of the Bill should be provided as part of pre-legislative scrutiny.  There should not be a situation whereby we get a segment of what will be in the final legislation with a huge amount of coming through on Committee Stage.  Pre-legislative scrutiny should include the heads of the Bill and it should give an idea of the content of the Bill.  It should not just be a portion of the content with rest to come later.  That would take away much of the confusion around pre-legislative scrutiny.  It should include the heads of the Bill and what will be in the Bill.  What we are finding is that we are being asked to do pre-legislative scrutiny, but we do not get large segments of the Bill until Committee Stage.  That makes it difficult for us to pre-legislative scrutiny.  We, as a committee, are required to sign off on something, but we do not know the full contents of the Bill and its full subject matter.</p> <p>  We have done extensive work around a range of areas.  When the committee was established, we looked at aviation and produced a report on it.  We very much advocated the use of rapid antigen testing in our report on aviation, which was produced in December 2020.  It took a while for that to come into being but we welcome that it has.  We ask that the national aviation policy review would get under way straight away.  Cork and Shannon Airports have fallen behind Dublin.  It makes no sense in terms of balanced regional development.  They have gone down by 12% while Dublin has gone up to nearly 85%.  That needs to be looked at and we ask for that to be expedited.</p> <p>  The national broadband plan falls under our remit.  There has been progress on that, but we have to look at where the blockages are.  The blockage at the moment is in the inter-relationship between National Broadband Ireland and some of the other providers using some of its infrastructure.  That needs to be joined up.  I believe that would bring things up to speed.</p> <p>  National cybersecurity falls under our remit.  We have held extensive consultations on it.  The national digital strategy was launched by the Taoiseach in February of this year.  We would ask that the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, would be fully resourced.</p> <p>  We had the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, before the committee.  A number of unidentified planes were detected off the coast.  Two of those did not have transformers and they could not be identified.  They were both Russian planes.  Would the Taoiseach support investment into primary radar services?</p> <p>  We produced a report on the national development plan, NDP.  We welcome that the public works contract is now being reformed.  We are going to work on that.  An Post falls under our remit, which is quite extensive.  We basically want to see sufficient supports being put in place in that regard.</p> <p>  That covers the range of areas we have looked at.  The legislation we covered included the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Act, Road Traffic and Roads Bill, the Air Navigation and Transport Bill and the communications Bills.  These are the asks of the committee and I would welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on the same.</p></speech>

It is tying that in with the future of democracy and of media literacy.  That is extremely important.  We would hope to be able to make a decision on this soon.  However, I would be upfront with the committee  and say that the fundamental issue will be how we fund media into the future.  This has been the subject matter of previous Oireachtas committees.  It will be a matter for the committee to take on the challenge.</p> <p>  The objective is to have a free and independent media to underpin democracy and the fundamental values we share.  We can see from Ukraine what the likes of Russia and authoritarian regimes want to do.  We see the proliferation of fake news and the deliberate attempts to manipulate media and news.  We need a different funding template for Irish media into the future, which encompasses all strands, such as broadcasting, print and online.  That funding template must have complete separation between the State and media in terms of influence, or any perception of influence, by the State over annual funding allocations, etc.  That is the view I hold.  If funding is to be wholly from the Exchequer, there is always the danger that a future or a current Government could decide in a budgetary cycle to say it is going to clip the media's wings and say it is taking out so much.   That would not be satisfactory for the independence of the media, which should be at an arm&rsquo;s length from the Government.</p> <p>  We see even in the European Union that governments are now influencing their own media and there is a proliferation of what is called "government media" and government media channels.  It is important that we avoid that in Ireland.  Those are the issues that are exercising the Government at the moment in terms of decisions we have to take and the funding template for media.  We want to publish the report with decisions and recommendations that the Government is going to take on this.  There is no doubt that on the broadcasting front, public service content is under pressure.  The national broadcaster is under financial pressure.  I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  On the other side, into the future, there need to be checks and balances from a public expenditure perspective.  There are now good systems in place with the Committee of Public Accounts, etc.  Hopefully, those decisions will be taken in the next number of weeks.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the resourcing of the commission.  There were comments earlier about a drain from the public service.  We will have to get real about pay rates.  We are establishing commissions and policing mechanisms that are going to police some of the biggest private sector operators in the world.  That will have an impact on how we attract talent into the State side, in order to enable us to achieve the objectives of legislation.  There must, therefore, be an open mind on how that resourcing happens and the level at which pay and conditions are set for certain key people who we will require to do this job competently.  Fully resourcing the commission will involve that.  It will also involve numbers because it will be a significant body.  There can be no foot-dragging from the beginning in relation to that.  It must also have legal teeth.</p> <p>  On the issue of the individual complaints mechanism, I would ask that the committee would reflect on that too.  It is popular to do that.  We must make sure that we do not create a scenario that would tie up any future commission in a plethora of individual complaints that would be to the detriment of the more strategic objectives of the commission.  It is possible the commission could do nothing other than individual complaints into the future.  We, therefore, need to be careful about how that is designed.  I am just being honest here and expressing my own thoughts on that because I have not had an opportunity to do so in a public platform.</p><p>We need to give very serious consideration to that as well.  Nobody wants to have the committee tied up almost from the get-go in terms of that strand, as opposed to the other strands that it needs to work on a policy or strategy front and so forth.  There are many examples around agencies that we have created.  That is the reality.  That would not necessarily be the intention, but that could very well be the outcome.  </p><p> I hear what Deputy Flanagan said on the level of resourcing.  This has been a consistent theme of this meeting.  A Secretary General will talk to Secretaries General, but I think it is more of an Houses of the Oireachtas Commission issue as well and what it is seeking from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We certainly did not get an impression, as I said earlier, that there were any major issues here in terms of the overall envelope for the commission.</p><p> On Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s assertion, I regret the juxtaposition of any idea that unilateral legislative initiative to circumvent the protocol is about the Good Friday Agreement.  I would have an opposite view.  Any unilateral legislative by the United Kingdom Government that would seek to undermine or circumvent the protocol would have a very destabilising impact on the Good Friday Agreement and would be very unhelpful.  I have communicated that to the British Prime Minister.  We had a very frank and honest discussion on Tuesday morning last.  I stressed that I felt the best pathway was towards an intensification and a professional engagement between the United Kingdom Government and the European Union in respect of the operation of the protocol to minimise any impacts on the free flow of goods into Northern Ireland.  I believe that is attainable and it was close to being attained last autumn.  Lord Frost made a very unhelpful intervention when he raised the European Court of Justice the night before the Vice-President of the Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, was publishing his proposals on medicines, sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and customs.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi&rsquo;s proposals came following detailed consultation and engagement with all of the northern parties and with northern businesses and industry.  This was a result of significant collaboration by him.  In addition, he engaged with the European member states.  He went much further than perhaps some member states would have wanted him to go.  It was an awful pity that Lord Frost intervened at that stage to try to derail it, essentially, and put unionism in a difficult position as well.  Unionism&rsquo;s main concerns were on the movement of goods and trying to minimise checks, which I understand.  I understand where unionism is coming from and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi does too.  The whole idea was to see if we could minimise the impact of the operation of the protocol but the goalposts keep on changing.</p><p> I also said to the British Prime Minister that the British Government cannot continue to say that the European Union is being inflexible, is not moving and now we must have a change of the mandate, whatever that means.  That is not true.  There has been consistent movement from the European Commission but it has not been reciprocated.  As a result of the lack of reciprocation, there has been a growing erosion of trust on the EU side.  No matter what is produced on the EU side, it does not get reciprocated.  There is an absence of clarity around what the British Government&rsquo;s landing zone is in respect of these negotiations and there has been a continuing and consistent lack of clarity as to what the British Government&rsquo;s landing zone is in respect of the protocol issue.  It seems to change and now we are into a new iteration of this with the idea of a unilateral legislative initiative in the application of the protocol in British domestic law.  That would be a breach of an international treaty, which would have very significant negative repercussions for the European Union&rsquo;s relationship with the United Kingdom and, indeed, with ourselves as well.  </p><p> In my conversation with the British prime minister, I reiterated that unilateralism is not good here.  The Deputy will know from his experience that what had underpinned the peace process before, leading into, and post Good Friday Agreement has been both governments working together.  That has been the anchor of the peace process and of the journey we have all been on collectively.  There have been great gains as a result of the two governments working to anchor that.  Unilateralism flies in the face of that key point.  It is extremely important that unilateral actions are avoided because they will only work to the detriment of the situation.  We both agreed that it was very important and imperative that the institutions would be restored and that the democratic mandate given to the elected representatives by the people of Northern Ireland would be upheld in the form of taking seats in the Assembly and forming an Executive.  </p><p> I spoke to all party leaders in the North.  They all said to me it is their view that restoration of the institutions should happen.  The DUP was very straight up in saying it wants the protocol issue resolved before it goes into the Executive.  The leader of the DUP made it very clear that taking up the role of deputy First Minister was not an issue or an impediment to taking up office.  I take all leaders in good faith.  If there is a will, there is a way.  I believe sincerely that there is a landing zone for resolving the issues.  One example is the medicines issue.  That was highlighted way back as a big concern and issue.  There were some legitimate points raised on the UK Government and unionist side.  It was comprehensively dealt with.  It is an illustration of progress that can be made.  However, that was all done on the EU side, obviously in engagement with the UK Government.  Nothing ever comes back, and that is a problem.</p><p>  On resourcing and the heads of the Bill, I will talk to Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell again some time perhaps on that.  The pre-legislative scrutiny could go on for quite a significant time as well if we were just at head of Bill stage.  I take what he said in that some aspects are missing.  I understand that point.</p></speech>

I did not get a chance to address Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s earlier point because it was kind of an extensive contribution on European defence, but on the security defence issue, cybersecurity comes under that remit.  We cannot deal with cybersecurity on our own.  In fact, cybersecurity can only be dealt with on a collaborative basis.  When we had a terrible attack on our health service, other countries came to give their own experiences - Poland being one and the Ukrainian Government being another.  </p> <p>  I was in Estonia recently, where Ireland is now a participant on the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.  It is named NATO but it was set up by Estonia way back.  An increasing number of countries have joined it to learn collaboratively about cybersecurity threats, preparedness and all of that.  More of that will be required into the future.  We have beefed up our national cybersecurity team and will continue to do so.  The national digital strategy is part of that.  In addition, I will support primary radar services.  Again, as Deputy Flanagan said along with Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, the Commission on the Defence Forces dealt with aviation, sea and conventional forces, as well as the cybersecurity piece.  The Government will have a series of meetings on defence issues and the Commission on the Defence Forces&rsquo;s report in terms of the resources that will be required and how we map that out and timeline that.  It is clear that we need to enhance our defence capability for protection purposes.  </p> <p>  We need a broader debate on the neutrality issue, in response to Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s points, through a citizens' assembly.  Although he may not feel it is not optimal, I accept fully and respect his position on that.  However, I feel, at the moment with the war in Ukraine, as much unity of purpose we can retain in the country can tackle that is preferable to having a debate on the neutrality question, which could divide people right now, when we need as many people as possible working to the same agenda in respect of our humanitarian response to the Ukraine war and supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s application for EU membership.</p></speech>

An dream deireanach n&aacute; an Teachta Bacik agus an beirt Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, Carrigy agus Cassells.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.2015" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#L00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for engaging with us as Cathaoirligh of the committees today.  I am delighted to be here in my role as Cathaoirleach of the relatively new Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which, of course, is a time-limited committee.  I thank the Taoiseach also for his engagement with our committee to date and his continued engagement.</p> <p>  We were established in December with a nine-month timeframe from the date of the first public meeting.  We held our first public meeting on 3 March and the deadline for our report is, therefore, early December.  We have a wonderful secretariat and a very engaged membership and, of course, our work is focused on the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which we regard as establishing a blueprint for the achievement of a more equal Ireland, a genuinely gender-equal Ireland.</p> <p>  We have approached our work in a modular fashion dividing up those 45 recommendations into a number of modules with a view to preparing what we see as an action plan for Government in December, that is, a plan to bridge the recommendations themselves and Government implementation of them.</p> <p>  We model ourselves on former Senator Catherine Noone's Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which, of course, was established following the Citizens' Assembly on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and which provided a practical report as to how to implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  It is in that spirit that we view our work.  We are not reopening the substantive policy issues that the Citizens' Assembly reviewed.  Rather, we are looking at how their recommendations may be implemented.</p> <p>  We have finished two modules and have almost concluded a third module.  The first module we considered was the recommendations of the assembly on constitutional change - recommendations 1 to 3, inclusive.  We have also concluded hearings on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence recommendations and we are reviewing currently recommendations on norms and stereotypes in education.</p> <p>  If I could focus on the constitutional recommendations, and I asked yesterday in the D&aacute;il about these in the context of the Taoiseach's questions on citizens' assemblies, the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality made three recommendations relating to the Constitution.  The first proposed a referendum to strengthen the equality guarantee in Article 40.1.  The second sought to expand the definition of the family in Article 41 to cover non-marital families.  The third sought to amend Article 41, specifically, to take out the sexist language currently within it and to offer gender-neutral protection for carers.</p> <p>  My direct question is whether the Government will commit to holding a referendum or referendums in 2023 to give effect to these recommendations.  I should say that, as a committee, we are engaging closely with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on this and have sought that he and the Government might make that commitment.  Indeed, we will be providing the Minister shortly with a position paper setting out a series of options for wording because we want to move the debate on.</p> <p>  We are conscious there is a general political will to have these referendums.  The Taoiseach has indicated that too.  There is a positivity in Government to this but it is really how we get to the point where we have got a wording that we can build a consensus around and that we go to the people on.</p> <p>  Finally, more broadly, at present we are seeing quite a number of new citizens' assemblies, either established or proposed.  It is positive because these are useful and valuable mechanisms for achieving a deliberative form of democratic decision-making.  I am an advocate for them, but what we heard from Dr. Catherine Day and, in particular, from the individual members on this Citizens' Assembly, was the need to ensure that citizens see their recommendations taken seriously by legislators and Government and, indeed, brought into effect and implemented, and that, without that sort of direct linkage between the report of each assembly and changes in policy, we may see less faith in the power of the Citizens' Assembly and, indeed, less good will among citizens towards engagement with them.  I thank the Taoiseach for his responses on those.</p></speech>

I am here as the Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Autism.  First, I thank the Government for its support in the setting up of the committee and, indeed, for nominating me as Chairman of that committee.  Like Deputy Bacik's, it is a time-limited committee limited to nine months.  Currently, we are working on the work programme and plan to sit in public session from June onwards.</p> <p>  We plan as a committee to look at policy, the implementation of policy and the legislation relevant to people with autism.  We will be meeting in public and hearing from people with autism, their families, their friends and their representative bodies, as well as Departments and Government agencies, and Ministers also.</p> <p>  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, and a working group is currently developing an autism innovation strategy in line with the programme for Government.  My question is, should the strategy address such issues as long waiting times for assessment of needs, limited access to assessment, and intervention of services and support for children in schools to ensure full inclusion in education?  I welcome the recent comments from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, with regard to supports at third level through his Department.  We have serious issues.  In a Commencement matter I raised this morning in respect of Athlone alone, there are eight families that do not have a place for their child in September and who are looking at a return journey of over 100 km each day to secure a place for their child.  The strategy should also address support for people with autism to ensure meaning employment.  A recent survey by AsIAm stated that 85% of persons with autism are unemployed or underemployed.  How could the strategy benefit the lives of people with autism and their families?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-12a.2017" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2022051200002#L00500"><p>I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for his time and his engagement here today.</p> <p>  In the Seanad we are currently assessing and going through the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  We spent another three hours last night in the Chamber going through some 200 amendments on this Bill.  It is extremely important legislation - probably one of the most significant in a generation - because we will regulate an unregulated sphere.  At present, it is the wild west.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach spoke earlier about a free and independent media and he was quite right.  As a former journalist, it worries me that so many of our citizens now rely on social media as their news outlet.  The Taoiseach referred to a free media.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as free news.  It costs a great deal of money to produce news content.  I fear for that industry.  That is why I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment that the future of media report will be published soon.  As matters stand, the funding model or business model is broken and we need to talk seriously about how that will be fixed.</p> <p>  Returning to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, the main thrust of what the Bill would achieve, of course, is the establishment of a media commission and the establishment of an online safety commissioner, for which there is a pressing need.  I cannot stress enough the need for this because of the amount of online abuse and online hate.  Yesterday, we were discussing abuse in sport with the CEO of the Federation of Irish Sport, Mary O'Connor, herself a much decorated sportsperson.  We asked Ms O'Connor directly, in terms of abuse, were the social media giants doing enough to stamp out abuse and she said categorically, "No."  Ms O'Connor spoke specifically about the impact it was having on young female athletes - body shaming - and the impact on them leaving sport as a result.  These are the consequences of an unregulated sphere in social media.  These are the devastating impacts on young girls.</p> <p>  The special rapporteur, Professor Conor O'Mahony, came before us at the committee.  Professor O'Mahony spelled out frankly for us that we need to intervene and that it is having a devastating impact in the area of online abuse.  In the area of the proliferation of gambling, massive giants make multibillion euro profits.  Senator Malcolm Byrne and I have tabled a number of amendments, including one that would make directors of these companies personally criminally liable.  When that was published and when the media covered it, why was there a circling of the wagons by these companies?  They have no fear of fines.  The proposed fines in the legislation are a pittance to these guys.  Facebook Ireland makes &euro;40 billion in revenue in this country alone.</p><p>The money generated in shiny glass offices in the docklands cannot be a shield against proper accountability and proper scrutiny.  As Ms Mary O'Connor said yesterday, not enough is being done to protect young female athletes in this country.  We need to protect them.  Those shiny glass offices can be shattered and I have plenty of rocks.  I praise the Government and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, for bringing this legislation forward, as it will be the first time we will tackle this issue, but it needs to be strong enough so these guys have respect for this State and its laws and the young people of this country, in particular, are protected.</p></speech>

The first point is I appreciate the work she is doing and the fact it is timebound.  I wish her every success.  We will do everything we can to be supportive of the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality.   On the constitutional issues, again, several Ministers have briefed the committee on the matters under their aegis.  On the referendums that may arise from the ctizens' assembly, and officials across Departments are working to develop proposals, she is correct to say wording will be key, as I know from my Oireachtas experience.  We have to be clear and we have to try to make sure there is not mission creep, or it does not become a broader agenda in respect of all sorts of issues people would like to include, or the difficulty will be we may never get agreement.  In other words, the perfect can be the enemy of the good in respect of these issues.  I will be making fully sure we understand the implications and so on.</p> <p>  We are supportive of and would like to move on the recommendations on the referendum contained in the citizens' assembly but wording will be key.  The timing is getting on for late autumn, if we are honest, because I am a believer in having a proper lead-in period for explanations.  Sometimes, the time we give to the Referendum Commission can be tight relative to the campaign and the vote.  Personally, I have not been a great advocate of holding all the referendums together because it runs against the idea of giving the fullest information and the widest debate among the public.  Wording will be key and developing a consensus on that wording across the Oireachtas will be very important.  I look forward to working with the Deputy in that regard.  We are open and positively disposed to having referendums in respect of those issues identified by the citizens' assembly and that will be fine-tuned, if I heard the Deputy correctly, by the committee, which will move into an implementation phase.  We welcome the idea of an action plan for implementation and the Government will work in parallel with that.</p> <p>  On future citizens' assemblies, we have said there will be two more on issues many Members are anxious to have assemblies on; a public one on drugs and drug abuse and the policies and strategies to combat that and another on the future of education, in addition to a citizens' assembly on neutrality, as I have discussed, if that is agreed.  That broader issue is a potential one as well.  There is a balance.  It is interesting that the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment, chaired by former Senator Catherine Noone, worked, but there was quite a significant difference between the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and what the committee eventually came up with, although it was at least a base on which the committee worked to get agreement.  It was not easy to get a pragmatic resolution from that committee.  It is quite interesting if we look at who voted and in what direction and so on, but we will not say any more about that.  It was done and it was a good outcome, ultimately.</p> <p>  Deliberative forms are good models.  We always have to respect the rights of directly elected representatives of the Oireachtas in respect of decisions and our parliamentary democracy, but deliberative democracy is an important strand to our wider democratic framework.  We heard earlier from Deputy Funchion that children were able to Zoom into the committee she chairs, for example, and give evidence, which is a further extension of that idea of participation and engagement with the Oireachtas.  So far, these deliberative forms have been a healthy influence on democracy.  We have an opportunity for the committee to follow through on this and demonstrate it even further.  We can also follow through on the two assemblies currently running on biodiversity and the mayor for Dublin, in line with the Deputy's point, and put their recommendations into action fairly quickly.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Autism chaired by Senator Carrigy is, again, time-limited.  There needs to be a focus on autism at post-primary level.  As Minister for Education, in 1998 I was involved in recognising autism for the first time as a special category in education.  It had not been recognised for pupil-teacher allocation ratios up to that point.  I am concerned post-primary has not moved at the same pace as primary at all.  There should be an obligation on all post-primary schools to be open to taking children with autism.  It is more resource intensive and perhaps they cannot take in as many children.  That is why the opportunity should be shared.  In some districts at present, it is left to one or two schools to take in young people with autism.  It needs a centre.  It is not just about a unit within a class; it needs a full centre within the school.  There are some very good examples of where it is fantastic and very well done, but every second level school should be obliged to take in children with special needs right across the board, especially those with autism.  We can learn more and it is working very well in some schools.</p> <p>  Assessments are also a very big issue.  I said there needs to be greater harmonisation between health and education.  The assessment issue is now a very significant one in the context of recent judicial decisions.  The 2005 Act has never been implemented in a comprehensive way.  We also have to look at the models very carefully because some of them are not sustainable at present.  What I mean by that is we need to be far more flexible in how we assess.  There is an issue at the moment with capacity in the public sector to do what is expected regarding the demand.  There needs to be a review of assessment in light of recent court decisions and how we combine assessment, intervention and identifying the correct programmes for each child in terms of where he or she is on the autistic spectrum.  We need a very varied programme to facilitate and accommodate that.  Each child is different in many respects and each child will need an individual education plan and programme.  Primary schools and specialist schools are very up for this.  The progressing disabilities services programme is working to create centres but, on the other hand, there seems to have been a dilution of therapists in special schools, which should not have happened.  The multidisciplinary approach within schools can work and at present we should make sure special schools, at a minimum, retain multidisciplinary teams.  That would get rid of a lot of frustration for many parents, where they cannot get access to anything at the moment, which is not satisfactory.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of progress on employment but we can do an awful lot more to facilitate employment for young people with autism.  There needs to be greater supports.  Many supports are there but they are not fully utilised, such as financial incentives to employers and so on.</p> <p>  Senator Cassells raised the matter of the online media regulation Bill.  The Government has brought in that legislation and is very anxious to deliver it.  There is increased regulation across Europe on this and there is no doubt social media is a key platform.  I will make the point individuals have to behave as well.  What we are seeing on social media is shocking.  I do not understand what is going on in the world of sport where after every game or every match some vile commentary is uploaded to attack a sportsperson.</p><p>It reflects very badly on the individuals who do that.  The companies say they are developing algorithms and all sorts of mechanisms to try to deal with this and head it off at the pass.  There must be strong regulation.  It is a very worrying situation, especially for children and young people.  It is damaging to the health of children and young people.  We must protect our children and young people from the abuse and from the very negative influences on them.  The online media regulation Bill will be a key factor in that.</p><p> I commented earlier that we need to get it right.  We need to ensure we have a commission that works.  It must work.  There can be a tendency to do what will play well.  I do not mean that in the context of what Deputy Bacik said.  A number of bodies we have brought into the regulatory or appeals side have become snowed under by the volume and there is no satisfaction.  The public are making complaints.  Let us take the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I am not blaming it or any other body but speaking just as a Deputy and forgetting about being Taoiseach for a moment, would I recommend someone go to GSOC with a complaint?  It would depend on the gravity of the complaint and so on but I would have to forewarn the person that this could take years.  We need to weigh that up in whatever architecture we create.</p></speech>

It is our constitutional framework and it is everything else.  However, we need to be honest with people as well.  We can create all the mechanisms but if they become a function of a body that does not work subsequently then it fails.</p></speech>

We in the Oireachtas repeatedly get calls for commissions of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  That is very much a failure of existing bodies that should be doing this work habitually and regularly.  If one were to count all the commissions of inquiry we are being asked to set up, the costs would be enormous but all those costs are resources that are taken from somewhere else.  I find in childcare and children I am worried about what resources we are making available to the child at risk today.  There is a balance somewhere along the line.  I do not have all the answers on that but I share that as this is the right forum in which to do so.</p></speech>
