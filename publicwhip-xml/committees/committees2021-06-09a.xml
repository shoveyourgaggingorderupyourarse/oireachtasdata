We are now looking forward to a discussion with the farming organisations.  I welcome the following representatives of farming organisations: from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, and Mr. Tadhg Buckley, director of policy; from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, Mr. Pat McCormack, president, and Mr. John Enright, general secretary; from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, Mr. Dermot Kelleher, president, and Mr. Eddie Punch, general secretary; from Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, Mr. Colm O&rsquo;Donnell, national president, and Mr. Brendan Joyce, national council member; and from Macra na Feirme, Mr. John Keane, president, and Mr. Denis Duggan, CEO.  All witnesses are joining remotely and are welcome to the meeting.  We have received the witnesses&rsquo; opening statements, which have already been circulated to members.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website, where they are publicly available.  The committee has agreed that each group will be given five minutes in which to present its main points, before we go into questions and answers.</p> <p>  I will read the note on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the meeting who are in a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or to the extent to which their participation is covered by the absolute privilege of statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Cullinan, president of the IFA, to make his opening remarks.  He is asked to keep to five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and committee members for the invitation to address them today at a critical juncture in the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  I am joined by Mr. Tadhg Buckley, my colleague from the IFA.  As we are all aware, negotiations around this CAP reform are at a difficult stage.  The talks in Brussels failed to find a resolution in the negotiations two weeks ago.</p> <p>  I will first address eco-schemes and the impact they will have on farmers.  This is another way of redistributing funding from farmers.  It is a fundamental change.  Funding under Pillar 1 will be between 55% and 60% of the original funding, which is a huge cut.  Under the current proposal, the national average will be a cut across the board and the new amount available will also be paid based on current national averages.  It will be difficult for many farmers to get back the 30% that is being taken out.  Any farmer who is farming with high environmental ambitions needs to be funded for that.  If the EU has to get more funding to achieve that, so be it because that is what needs to happen.  This is another way of flattening the payment.</p> <p>  The IFA has taken a position on convergence.  We had extensive convergence in the previous reform when a position was taken that convergence would increase to 75% by 2027.  That has been our position on the issue and the Minister took that position at the previous round of negotiations in Brussels.  I am referring here to internal convergence.  What we are trying to achieve is to keep farmers viable.  This is very important with regard to convergence.</p> <p>  Funding from the national Exchequer is going to be important.  I am referring to national co-financing.  At a minimum, the Government has to fund up to 57% of Pillar 2 funding.  We in Ireland have been good at developing schemes.  We already have nine schemes in Pillar 2 and 33% of the money is going to environmental measures.  To refer back to eco-schemes, given that we have these nine schemes in place, there should be a lesser eco-scheme in Ireland.  That is a point worth noting.  </p> <p>  On the good agricultural environmental conditions, GAECs, we are especially concerned about GAEC 2 because it has the potential to impact 300,000 ha throughout the country, not just in one area.  My understanding is that all the lands that qualified for the basic payment scheme, BPS, under the previous reform will qualify again. Obviously, there is a word of caution around that.  However, that is the position at the moment and we sincerely hope that continues. </p> <p>  We also have a proposal on the definition of &ldquo;genuine farmer&rdquo;.  This is important because we cannot have any leakage from the budget in the current CAP reform.  It is essential that all the funding goes towards genuine farmers, those who get up in the morning to do the work, whether it is calving the cow, lambing the ewe or ploughing the fields.  This is essential.  A farmer should have to show some financial output from the farm, whether on sales or other outputs.  That is important. </p> <p>  On long-term leasing, if we want generational renewal, we must look after younger farmers and it is important that lands become available for them.  We are looking for a proper mechanism for trading the entitlements of farmers who continue to lease out their entitlements after a two-year period.  It could be a trading system or the farmer leasing the entitlements could be given the option to buy them.  </p> <p>  The programme for Government includes a clear commitment from all three Government parties that the &euro;1.5 billion from the carbon tax will be ring-fenced for a proper environmental scheme.  This is essential.  We have to be certain that that money is separate from the funding provided under national co-financing.  Having that money available to develop a proper environmental scheme would mean more funding would be available in Pillar 2.  We need more targeted payments.  We need to get the suckler cow payment up to &euro;300 per cow and the sheep payment up to &euro;30 per ewe.</p> <p>  Another sector that is vulnerable in this reform is tillage.  An environmental scheme must be put in place for the tillage sector.  I know we have the straw incorporation measure but that needs to evolve and be further developed and a proper scheme is also needed.  That is the IFA position.  I will be glad to take questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#A00500"><p>Mr. Enright, our general secretary, and I are delighted to be here.  The challenges facing Irish agriculture are unprecedented challenges.  In tandem, CAP reform is putting more and more bureaucracy ahead of farmers and EU funding has been cut.  We have had various discussions with Department officials - the Chair mentioned names - in autumn 2020 and throughout this year in which they said there was not a cut.  However, there is a cut.  The reality is that there will be a cut of approximately 2% to the single farm payment this year.</p><p>That, in effect, is a cut.  Farmers have been asked to do significantly more for less.  There is a huge aspiration, from an environmental point of view, to deliver more to the European taxpayer for less.  I will go through that in more detail.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Cullinan that the definition of "genuine farmer" needs to be addressed.  Funding needs to go to the people who work the land, depend on it and keep it in good faith.  When we take everything into consideration commercial farmers could face a cut of anything between 40% and 50% to their single farm payment between one or other linear cut and convergence.</p><p> Convergence is a pet topic of mine.  We represent the family farm structure and much of that structure is on small and medium-sized holdings.  The aspiration to flatten the payments and make all people equal under convergence is great.  The reality, however, is that will not happen without giving consideration to the overall envelope the farmer has.</p><p> We saw in the previous round under convergence that the target was at 75%.  Small holdings and efficient holdings - they had to be efficient and have a decent output to exist - suffered substantial losses.  I am not talking about people with huge single farm payments but people with single farm payments of between &euro;8,000 and &euro;16,000.  They found themselves substantially penalised under convergence.  They were infuriated, it is fair to say, when they found out that some of the beneficiaries had multiples of a single farm payment.  We need the Minister to continue to hold tough on the 75% figure.  We cannot allow it to go any further.</p><p> There is a lot of talk among politicians and bureaucrats, at home and in Brussels, that front-loading has the potential to address these issues for farmers.  We need to get a strong and deep analysis of that going forward because it may not be the case.  We need far more information and research done on front-loading and the beneficiaries.</p><p> As regards capping, the ICMSA strongly supports the &euro;60,000 cap, with no frills or ribbons.  It is very simple to implement.  From a genuine farmer perspective, it is not that long ago that we sat at similar forums, and perhaps the same forum, albeit physically rather than remotely, when we were trying to define the "active farmer".  Europe has failed on the active farmer.  As a generation of farmers, farm leaders and politicians, we cannot afford to fail as regards the genuine farmer.  It is imperative that the genuine farmer is defined and that he or she is the person who is working the land and who needs the support.</p><p> In our submission, the ICMSA proposes a minimum stock on density.  We are not talking about an over-elaborate measure.  In excess of 5,000 farmers are not keeping three cows on 50 acres.  How genuine are those farmers?  That is very questionable.  We need to see some mechanisms put in place to preserve agricultural activity.  Where that does not happen, questions need to be asked about the continuation of entitlements and the continuation of benefits under convergence.</p><p> Conditionality is a new concept.  It is not long since we used to travel to Brussels to meet the then European Commissioner, who happened to be from the island of Ireland.  The issue then was simplification.  Now, it is about conditionality.  We seem to see more and more conditions, by which I mean environmental and various other aspirations as we move forward.  With less funding available, and at a time when farmers are becoming the scapegoats for many things in this country, we need to discuss conditionality with the Department in earnest, including its implementation and tolerance of it among the farm organisations.  We need to see that around the CAP reform.</p><p> Mr. Cullinan alluded to the eco-scheme, which will be cut, potentially, by between 20% or 30%.  The likelihood is it will be either 25% or 30%.  We saw under greening in the previous round of CAP that if a farmer grew grass, he or she was green.  In the same way, we need to have the minimum of implications at farm level for farmers to be involved in an eco-scheme as we move forward.  The ICSMA believes that hedgerow management can play a significant part in eco-schemes going forward.  The last thing we want is to undermine any environmental scheme that will come through in Pillar 2.</p><p> As regards Pillar 2 and interventions, we need to see an agri-environment scheme that is attractive to commercial farmers and all other farmers, with a significant increase in payment.  A payment of approximately &euro;10,000 would make it a meaningful scheme.  It is absolutely imperative that generational renewal is part of Pillar 2.  While we may need to look after our young farmers, the greatest tool to make land available to young farmers is to look after our older farmers.  We have seen that in the past with various retirement schemes.</p><p> It was extremely disappointing to read the Department's targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, proposals, where dairy investment schemes would not be eligible under TAMS moving forward.  We talk about environmental aspirations and reducing the energy usage.  It is absolutely imperative that these new modern technologies, whether it is electronic milk pumps or efficient cooling systems, are in place.</p><p> From a carbon footprint point of view, the dairy calf and beef scheme is the most efficient type of beef production on this island.  We need to see the aspirations in the previous budget beefed up under Pillar 2.  </p><p> While milk prices might be at 34 cent or 35 cent per litre now, we cannot afford to forget the rainy days we had in the past.  We need to have emergency price supports in place as we move forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to speak on CAP reform today.  The breakdown of talks in Brussels is nothing unusual at this stage of a CAP reform; it is like a dance.  They are supposed to be meeting until the last day.  The sticking points are around convergence, the eco-scheme and the so-called CRISS, or front-loading.  The trilogues are like the bonfire of the vanities, with grandiose ideas about the green deal, a fairer CAP, the farm to fork strategy and the biodiversity strategy.  All of these could collapse on their first engagement with reality.</p> <p>  The reality is that the CAP budget is being steadily eroded by inflation.  The cake is getting smaller.  Farmers are being asked to do more for less.  The CAP allows each member state the flexibility to design its own CAP programme but insists on boxing them into a model that does nothing to solve the big-ticket issues.  We are still stuck with the contradiction of the 2013 reform, where convergence was meant to help farmers with the biggest income deficiencies but rose to the challenge by taking from the small suckler and sheep farmers with small payments per farm but above the average per hectare.  As a result, negotiators at EU level are trying to reach a compromise that will leave nobody happy.</p><p>The reason for all this is that, more and more, CAP reform is a process whereby the views of everybody except the farmer are front and centre.  EU negotiators are fighting over irrelevancies because they are totally detached from farmers on the ground.  Covid has made the process even more detached from farmers and their representatives but this process has been in play for quite some time now.  Looking at the eco-scheme battle, there is deadly combat over whether it is 20% or 30% of Pillar 1 when, in fact, nobody is asking how come we lost the old rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, which was a fantastic job for farmers that put real money into their pockets.  Nobody who talks about a green deal has the faintest idea of the damage done by land eligibility penalties to farmers who were more biodiverse and environmentally friendly under the second last Minister.</p><p> If the EU wants a greener CAP, then reward the farmers who are less intensive and want to participate in a worthwhile agri-environment scheme.  The ICSA has proposed that a scheme should have the potential to pay up to &euro;15,000.  We have outlined this in previous engagements with the committee, but has anyone been listening?  This needs to be targeted at cattle, sheep and tillage farmers, most of whom are not viable or are barely viable.  Otherwise, we are sending a signal that anybody who wants to farm must be a dairy farmer.  In order for that to work, we need to make the eco-scheme in Pillar 1 relatively straightforward for less intensive farmers who do not require a nitrates derogation.  The eco-scheme must not have too many conditions attached, or it will not be possible to pay for many of the actions we would like in a proper agri-environment scheme.</p><p> On convergence, the harsh reality is that the EU has shirked its responsibility to make the CAP fit for purpose.  The Treaty of Rome aspirations have been thrown into the bin as the budget has been reduced over several reforms.  The cake is not getting bigger; it is actually getting smaller.  We cannot give more farmers the same worthwhile slice they were getting.  It looks like the final outcome will be the lowest payment will have to reach 85% of the average by 2026.  This is a noble aspiration, except for the fact that it takes from the already strapped suckler, sheep and beef farmers, especially those with low hectarage and above average payments.</p><p> The solution to this proposed by the Commissioner for Agriculture is the complementary redistributive support for sustainability, CRISS.  The ICSA favours insulating smaller and medium sized farmers from convergence cuts.  We would like to see a system that allocates more support for the first 40 ha.  The CRISS is insufficient and it is not funded.  Instead, it takes a linear cut from all farmers, which is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and does not do enough.  Department modelling suggests that if payments to all farmers are cut by &euro;54 million, an extra &euro;20 per hectare for the first 30 ha can be given.  This will not make any worthwhile difference. </p><p> In our view, the family sized cattle, sheep or tillage farmer is desperately dependent on CAP supports.  This means we cannot ignore the elephant in the room.  According to the 2019 Teagasc national farm survey, the average payment from Pillar 1 on a dairy farm was &euro;280 per hectare.  A suckler farmer got &euro;240, a beef farmer &euro;290, a sheep farmer &euro;245 and a tillage farmer got &euro;320 per hectare.  How can it be fair that a very profitable dairy farm, which is less dependent on CAP subsidies, is getting more per hectare than suckler or sheep farmers on a per hectare basis?  Beef and tillage farms are not getting much more; these systems of farming used to get the lion&rsquo;s share of CAP supports.  We have seen the areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments slashed, while more than 20 years ago the old headage payments were targeted at suckler, sheep and beef farms.  They were all viable as a result.</p><p> It is a very interesting fact that in the year 2000, the average dairy farmer got &euro;5,500 from CAP supports.  In 2009, that had increased 400%, fourfold, while suckler, sheep and tillage farmers saw an increase of between 20% and 50%.  However, the dismantling of price supports, such as intervention, had a devastating impact on ICSA members.  I am asking now, is it fair that dairy farmers, who are investing six figure sums in massive expansion programmes, are getting more money per hectare than suckler, sheep, beef and tillage farmers who are badly in want of it?  The national farm survey states direct payments are 120% to 160% of the income of the dry stock cohort compared with 31% dependence for dairy incomes.</p><p> The reality is that whatever happens in EU talks over the coming weeks, we have hard decisions to face up to in Ireland.  The ICSA is very clear.  Like my colleague, Pat McCormack, we think payments should be capped at &euro;60,000, no ifs or buts.  The cap should be &euro;60,000.  We believe that suckler, sheep, beef and tillage farmers should not be cut per hectare.  They should be supported much more through payments linked to their enterprise and also through agri-environmental schemes that are targeted at them.</p></speech>

We do not have to see dairy farmers take less if we can guarantee some small and medium farmers, and cattle and sheep farmers, get more.  We also have to be realistic and say the CAP is totally inadequate to achieve this.  It is vital that: the State fully fulfils its obligations to co-finance the rural development programme; the programme for Government commitment of &euro;1.5 billion in carbon taxes is delivered in addition to co-financing; every possible euro through Covid and Brexit funds is delivered targeting beef and sheep farmers; and the CAP is no longer used as a means to deliver six-figure sums to big businesses and feedlot owners.</p></speech>

I also welcome members of the joint Oireachtas committee to the hearing.  The Common Agricultural Policy has served farmers well since it was set up many years ago, but this reform has got to be the reform that brings fairness to how farmers are supported in future.  The three main objectives of the reform are fostering market resilience and a diversified agricultural sector, environmental care and climate action, but perhaps the one we really need to focus on is the basic objective of strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of rural areas.  CAP payments are the vehicle to do this, not for a small cohort or for commercial farmers, the likes of Larry Goodman and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, but for every farmer.</p> <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a duty of care to the approximately 125,000 farmers who are recipients and beneficiaries of payments.  Payments were established based on what was going on from 2000 to 2002, which is 20 or so years ago now.  The European Commission recommendations to Ireland, as a member state, indicated it is time to continue with the convergence model and move towards a full flattening of payments per hectare.  That is 100% the position of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association regarding convergence.  I ask members at today's hearing not to forget that Ireland has enjoyed, because of external convergence, no cut to the overall budget.  That is because 60% of farmers in this country are on payments less than the national average.  In fact, half of them are on payments of less than &euro;200 per hectare.  It is a myth that the most productive and commercially-based farms are those with the highest historical payments.</p><p>Figures from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine show the most productive farms are those in receipt of payments of between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per hectare, which is approximately the Irish average.  There is a duty of care for members, as legislators, to ensure we get fairness in this CAP reform.</p><p> The eco-scheme has been mentioned by some of the previous contributors.  Internal convergence and the way greening was administered did a rank injustice to farmers.  At the start of the previous reform, greening for one farmer meant a payment of &euro;30 per hectare and a payment of &euro;300 per hectare for another farmer for carrying out the same measure, that is, the retention of permanent grassland.  In 2019, one farmer could receive &euro;48 per hectare and another farmer, possibly next door, could be on &euro;210 per hectare for carrying out the same measure, namely, the retention of permanent grassland.  Why pay one farmer &euro;162 more than the other for carrying out the same measure?  This is why the eco-scheme has to be fair.  It has to be a level playing field.  We must have suitable actions for all types of farms and enterprises and a legitimate expectation that all those farmers will get a uniform payment, per hectare, for carrying out similar environmental and climate objectives.  It would be a travesty if this House adopted any other course of action.</p><p> The front-loading of payments was part of the reason the current CAP trilogue negotiations broke down.  The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association is strongly advocating for front-loading to be included because, some would say, some farmers will lose due to having a high payment per hectare on a small number of hectares.  This is the vehicle to ensure they get a front-loaded payment.  It is a complementary redistribution income support for sustainability.</p><p> If we have a capping, as some of the other farm leaders have spoken about, of &euro;60,000 to any one recipient with no account for labour units, &euro;22 million would be available to target the complementary redistributive income support for sustainability, or CRISS, payment.  This will incubate and cushion any farmer who may be exposed to internal convergence.</p><p> On the viability of commercial farms or those representing commercial farming, what about the other 66% of farms which are not viable?  Let us not forget, viable farms are farms which can support a labour unit.  Those enterprises are doing well and have traditionally done well given that they can pay a labour unit.  The other 66% of the farms the length and breadth of rural Ireland are vulnerable, do not have enough farm income and cannot support a labour unit.  Then we have sustainable farms which must have an off-farm income to help with their farm income if they are to remain viable family farms.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the time he has given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Macra na Feirme to today's meeting.  It is refreshing to hear some of the comments from farmers and, from my point of view, the perspective of young farmers on issues, especially on CAP, in the context of the challenges which faced our sector in terms of CAP and the potential future impact of the climate action Bill, the farm-to-fork strategy and how they could impact on future pathways for young people and farmers into our sector.  It is against that background and in that context that Macra na Feirme is firmly behind the following proposals and statements.<br/><br/>On CAP, over the past 25 or 30 years, we have had many promises on generation renewal and supports for young farmers.  Now more than ever, we, as young farmers, need policies which deliver real and positive impact for our sector.  With the number of farmers under the age of 35 now at less than 5%, fundamental change is needed to ensure the long-term survival of our sector and that the sector flourishes and embraces and practises the changes which are needed.<br/><br/>We have an opportunity in this CAP to go beyond the promises made in previous reforms to deliver targeted supports which will make a positive impact in terms of young farmers entering farming and our commitments on the environment and change.  Young farmers have always been at the forefront of driving and embracing change, be it practices on farms or embracing technologies.  The elevating of generation renewal to one of the nine key objectives under these CAP proposals is a clear signal from the Commission to member states that supports targeted at young farmers must be a key priority and merely maintaining the <i>status quo </i>will not be enough to deliver on what is required to improve and encourage generation renewal.<br/><br/>Under the schemes introduced in 2014, Macra na Feirme welcomes the introduction of both the young farmer top-up and the national reserve.  Continuation of these is crucially important, but a continuation of a fully funded and committed national reserve for the period of this CAP must be at the forefront of the measures to encourage generation renewal.<br/><br/>Macra na Feirme, along with its partners in Europe, the European Council of Young Farmers, CEJA, fundamentally supports the position that 4% of direct payments from Pillar 1 must be ring-fenced for young farmers and young farmer access.  We have seen 2% ring-fenced for this purpose under the current CAP, but it is felt 4% must be ring-fenced for young farmers to ensure they are supported and aided.  The interventions which fit under that 4% must support the business of young farmers.  We have heard mooted at European level tying supports for organic and other schemes into young farmer schemes is a possibility.  Not all young farmers will be able to access or use these schemes.  That intervention and similar interventions which will not directly impact young farmers cannot be supported out of the 4% aligned for young farmers under Pillar 1 payments.<br/><br/>We have also briefly spoken about the commitment that there be no backsliding on the contribution for young farmers, both on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 payments.  Of the supports under the current CAP, approximately 6% is ring-fenced for young farmers between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 payments.  It must be ensured that there is no backsliding by Ireland and other member states on that commitment at the upcoming negotiations.<br/><br/>The supports under TAMS were touched on briefly.  The maximum investment upper limit of 80% is being talked about.  That must also be secured.  We have seen how young farmers have responded under TAMS, given that &euro;186 million has been spent by young farmers and contributed under that scheme.  That must be continued over the course of the next CAP.<br/><br/>Macra na Feirme sees and looks for flexibility in the five-year rule in the definition of young farmers.  We have seen many young farmers who take over the farming enterprise at 20, 21 or 22 years of age no longer meet the criteria for young farmers when they are 26, 27 or 28 years old.  I am not sure whether anyone could conclude that is a reasonable or appropriate place for us to be.  Maximum flexibility must be outlined for young farmers and the five-year rule, both in terms of access to investments and to national reserve and top-up payments.<br/><br/>What ties into that is the commitment for the forgotten farmers from 2008 and 2009 who fell through the cracks in the previous negotiations.</p><p>We welcome the commitment of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, not to forget those farmers in the current CAP negotiations.  There is ample opportunity to make provision for them in this CAP reform.</p><p> On the current position regarding generational renewal and the elevating of the key priorities, the position on financing schemes such as a succession or land mobility scheme has not been ascertained under the national CAP strategic plan.  This is hugely disappointing from our point of view given that land mobility was directly called out by the Commission in its proposals under the current CAP.</p><p> We need to ensure fairness for young farmers and the older demographic in the Pillar 1 payments.  This also applies to Pillar 2 payments and succession schemes, which must deliver for young and older farmers.  As previous speakers touched on, these much be financed and access to land for young farmers taking over should be encouraged.</p><p> The definition of a genuine and active farmer must be robust and must deliver on the promises that have been made.  Supports must be delivered to the farmers who are farming actively on the ground, who are getting up in the morning and doing the work.  It is no longer acceptable to simply direct payments to guys who are not farming on the ground.  Supports must be targeted at ensuring farmers who do the work on the ground, day in and day out, have access to payments.  The Minister also needs to hold strong on the 75% convergence and ensure smaller holdings are not unduly impacted.</p><p> To summarise, young farmers need real delivery under the current CAP proposals.  Generation renewal needs to be provided for and we need to provide a future for the young farmers who are currently engaged in farming.  Those thinking of entering farming in the coming years need to see a clear pathway as they move forward.</p></speech>

The organisations they represent have come through a lot of issues with us over the years.  I will keep my contribution brief because I am aware that other members wish to contribute.  I mentioned to the Department a while ago that 40% of farmers receive less than 5% in direct payments, with 8% receiving less than &euro;1,500.  I will not name individual farmers but I have a list here showing that some are receiving single farm payments of &euro;300,000, &euro;250,000 and &euro;220,000.  The Department has indicated that reducing payments to these guys would not make a hell of a big change for the guy on &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000.  At the same time, it sends a very negative message when some people get payments of &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000, while other farmers with sizeable lands, perhaps hill land or land obtained at a bad time, are not even getting &euro;5,000.  That is the bottom line.</p> <p>  I will direct two questions to Mr. Dermot Kelleher of the ICSA.  The early retirement scheme is very important, as are other issues, but is it fair that a farmer with a dairy herd of 300, 500 or up to 1,000 cows would get the same payment per hectare as a suckler or sheep farmer?  The second question is for Mr. Kelleher or anyone else.  What is the best use of rural development programme, RDP, funds in this context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#E00400"><p>I thank Deputy Collins for his questions.  A per hectare payment is one thing but the issue is the number of hectares.  Many suckler and sheep farmers have 40 ha or less.  This is why they were all taken down in approximation.  The guy with 300, 500 or 1,000 cows also had plenty of hectares and his cheque is huge.  Per hectare does not really matter.  Consider what happened the last time with the ordinary sheep or suckler farmer.  Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v proved this years ago when he did the work.  The average dry-stock farmer in a disadvantaged area has under 40 ha.  The majority of small farms in the western half of the country, although not all of them, are around 40 ha.  If the number of hectares is the qualification criterion, the farmer with 40 ha who is drawing between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000 per year would be taken down because of convergence.  It would be lunacy.  It would bring the farmer on a payment of &euro;100,000 down by &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 but it would bring a lad on &euro;11,000 down to &euro;9,000.  It would kill him altogether.  I know farmers whose payments were reduced from &euro;11,000 to the &euro;9,000.  They had 40 cows and were working hard.  They were above the national average.  That is scandalous when there are big farmers and industrial farmers making big money.</p> <p>  As for the second question, the most appropriate way to use the rural development budget would be to have a good scheme that would deliver payments of &euro;15,000 under a REPS and higher payments under the suckler, sheep, beef data and genomics programme schemes and beef schemes.  The view that no one but a few big lads are viable is not the truth.  In truth, most lads are managing, getting bits of farm income and working hard.  Over the years, payments to small farmers have been cut and we have been kicked to touch.  I hope this answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I have a few points I want to make, and one single question that is not from me but from a group of farmers in the west.  When I said I was meeting the boys here - and they are all boys, I did not mean that as a pun - I said I would put their question to the committee.</p><p>This morning, the committee had a very good engagement with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While we talked about the issues around the ecosystem, there was very little debate about the social dimension of this CAP.  I want to raise this with the witnesses because it is very important.  From communication and engagements with the European Parliament and the negotiating teams, it is clear there will not be a compromise on the social dimension in the CAP.  When we refer to a social dimension we mean employment law and so on.  It is very important that the farmer representative bodies are aware of this and keep their eye on the ball.  The witnesses might share with us some of their views on that.</p><p>There is another issue I am particularly interested in, and I will direct this question to the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  An article in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>last weekend touched on the INHFA's campaign on the farm retirement scheme and Natura payments under CAP.  I am aware that we are restricted for time but perhaps the witnesses could flesh that out a little bit because it is very important.</p><p>On the CAP negotiations generally, the challenge will be to align sustainable farming with EU climate ambitions.  That is the nub of the issue and the difficulty.  We know the CAP negotiators must cut a deal.  Let us be honest.  A deal will be cut and it is important that we advocate for equality and safeguards for our economic and environmental performance.</p><p>My question was suggested to me by a group of farmers from the west.  Consider, for example, a farm with 20 cattle on approximately 40 acres or about 16 ha.  A number of farmers in Ireland solely outwinter their cattle, are not overstocked and do not put out slurry or chemical fertiliser.  I emphasise that point and that these places do exist.  Will it be permissible for such farmers to outwinter their stock in ring feeders, for example, with hay or silage?  We know that with cross-compliance checks this has not been permitted.  There are farmers who are successfully operating very sustainable smallholdings and supplementing other income.  We are going to see cross-compliance checks, including with regard to the social dimension.  I ask this question on behalf of that group of farmers.</p><p>Will that be permitted under the new CAP arrangements?  Will the prohibition be lifted?  These farmers are not putting slurry on the ground and they have relatively good land.  They have been successfully farming and outwintering cattle all year around.  They have very few veterinary interventions.  These are successful, sustainable and small-time farmers.  How can they be assured that they can continue to operate?  I would like Mr. O'Donnell to respond because that is an important issue.</p><p> I want to refocus.  I take on board the message the witnesses have given us and the points they have made.  I ask the representatives of the INHFA to address those two critical points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#F00200"><p>Generational renewal is massively important going forward.  It has been clear for some time that land mobility and having access to land is a major problem in this country.  I mention the way we farm these areas in parts of rural Ireland where there is a successor.  The retiring family needs some source of income in order to hand over the land where there is an heir within the family model.  I benefited when our family was being reared.  My father and mother handed the place over to me at a time when they could benefit from the early farm retirement scheme that was in place then and that brought them up to the old age pension rate.</p> <p>  We have incentives in place, such as the young farmers scheme and possibly TAMS, for young farmers but we must also look at the other side and enabling the retiring farmer to retire with dignity.  When my father handed the farm over to me, he could not help me.  It was part of the terms and conditions of the scheme and if he was found standing in a gap, he would lose his payment.  This was ridiculous and is something we should learn from.  The amount of acquired knowledge that my father was in a position to hand over to me should be something that is nurtured and incentivised in any succession model.  That is what we are looking for.  The Government and Department should look, on a limited basis, at the instances where there is a successor to continue that tradition of farm family succession.</p> <p>  The second point was on the Natura payment.  We were referring to the need to ensure there is an action for designated land in an environmental scheme in Pillar 2.  Also, there is potentially a need for this as an incentive and an entry level requirement in the eco-scheme for farms with designated land that have additional costs, State-enforced costs and 38 notifiable actions with which they have to comply.  Those farms are carrying the burden for this State on the 14% of land that is designated.  That is a small number of farmers and we have the ability, in this CAP reform, to support them and ensure the lands with the highest biodiversity in Europe are looked after.</p></speech>

There are a number of such farmers but the reality is that the average dairy herd in the country is probably much closer to 80 than it is to 100.  There are a lot of full-time - and I say this in earnest - commercial farmers with 50, 60 or 70 dairy cows who lost out substantially in the last round of convergence and who have the potential to lose yet again.  Is that right when the beneficiary could be a landowner with an off-farm job earning in excess of &euro;200,000?  If one goes to Ornua or Bord Bia and sits around the table, they market our dairy and beef products on the family farm structure and model.  If we are to be serious about that model, it has to be protected under all aspects of CAP reform, particularly under convergence.  The claim to represent farmers was also mentioned by others but the reality is that there are a lot of efficient small to medium-sized dairy farmers out there who took a hell of a hit the last time around.</p> <p>  If Senator Boyhan was asking the question about ring-feeders, he should have asked it when Mr. Brendan Gleeson and other Department officials were before the committee this morning because it is his team that goes out, patrols farm and decides whether farmers are compliant and have to take a financial hit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#F00600"><p>I will comment on how the funds are distributed.  If we look within the EU, 80% of the money goes to 20% of the recipients.  In Ireland, 56% of the money goes to 20% of the recipients so we have a far fairer way of distributing the funding here.  We all know there are concerns and issues around that and the issue can be divisive.</p> <p>  This is a fundamental change we are all going through and there are two points to make on it.  We have the green deal, biodiversity, the farm-to-fork strategy and all of that.  Those measures are fine and we all want to support measures around climate change, as farmers have been doing for years, particularly in taking methane out of the atmosphere and into our hedgerows, grasslands and trees.  That has been done and we need a proper measurement of that.  That is one point.</p> <p>  We also need a fairer distribution of the money.  We all understand that is what we need to do.  However, the funding has changed from farmers being rewarded for producing good quality food to carry out environmental measures.  What has happened is we have had a massive reduction in the budget from 50% of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, a number of years ago to 30% of the MFF now.  This is the fundamental problem we have.  There is not enough money coming in and it is difficult for us as leaders and farmers.  The Government needs to ensure we get the maximum co-financing.  Other speakers mentioned the &euro;1.5 billion.  This funding has to be directed at farmers and the Government has a responsibility to do this.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan mentioned employment law and that was not picked up.  That is something that is in the social aspect of this reform as well.  It is about conditions around people being employed on farms.  We have the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which deals with that and we also have the Health and Safety Authority.  It is not as big an issue in Ireland as it is across the EU and there is regulation around that already.  We do not want double regulation coming off this reform.</p></speech>

First, I asked a question that farmers from the west posed and I did not get an answer.  This is not a politician's question; these are farmers' questions.  A small farmer related a simple scenario involving a farm of 40 acres and I am going to tell him I could not get an answer, so that is of concern to me.</p> <p>  Second, on the social dimension, I share Mr. Cullinan's views and I articulated them this morning.  I am not suggesting further layers be added.  I totally agree with Mr. Cullinan.  However, the issue is not discussed anywhere in the papers before us today, nor was it mentioned by any of the farm representative groups.  I am deeply concerned by that.  I raised the matter with the Department and it has agreed to provide a paper or two on it.  The reality is that from the documentation we have seen, this is going to be an issue.  It is an issue and, therefore, it is important that we prepare for it because this is the social dimension.  We talk about the eco dimension but there is a social dimension also.  I fully agree with Mr. Cullinan.  We are not at loggerheads and I will continue to support him in all of that.</p> <p>  I want to go to back to this issue, although I know other members want to contribute.</p><p>I posed the scenario of 20 cattle on approximately 40 acres.  The farmer is sustainable, is not using veterinary medicines and has been very successful.  One farmer is 16 years at it and is making a living, so it can be done.  It is not overgrazing, but feeding all year round.  The land sustains that.  There is no seepage, no silage and no fertiliser.  It is, effectively, organic farming without organic certification.  Who is supporting them?  Will they be allowed to continue to operate the way they have successfully operated, as I think they should be, in a very old, organic and holistic way?</p></speech>

I give a special welcome to Mr. Keane.  This is his first meeting in his capacity as president of Macra na Feirme and I wish him the best.</p> <p>  I have two questions and if the witnesses have time to touch on them over the course of the meeting, it would be great.  Otherwise, there can be written responses afterwards.  First, we heard Mr. Keane speak about Macra na Feirme's proposals for supporting newer and younger entrants into the sector.  Could the other organisations articulate if they have proposals to do that?  The second question relates to the debate about the genuine farmer.  Do the organisations have definitions of a "genuine" farmer?  That might be helpful to the committee in its future deliberations.  For example, is the definition in terms of stocking rates that is in place for the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme a sufficient barometer in that regard?</p> <p>  On the substance of what we are discussing here, which is essentially the distribution of CAP funds, my view, and I am interested to hear if the organisations share this view, is that the fundamental problem we have is the EU budget itself.  I believe all the organisations and their members were sold out.  The Government agreed to a fundamentally bad deal that saw the proportion allocated to CAP reduced from 37% to 30% of the overall budget.  At the same time, we will contribute billions of euro more in net terms to that EU budget.  Do the witnesses accept that therein lies the fundamental problem?</p> <p>  With regard to the issues in respect of redistribution measures, I am struck by a line in the opening statement from the ICMSA.  It says: "Basing a policy on a payment per hectare is very crude ...".  Do the witnesses accept that basing payments on production levels in 2001 is also crude and that another way had to be found?  When discussing redistribution measures, we have heard their views on convergence.  I have met with a number of the organisations and Irish Government officials over many years to discuss CAP funding and every time convergence was mentioned the case of farmers with small holdings but high entitlements was cited.  I was therefore surprised that the witnesses were not jumping for joy when the front-loaded CRISS payment was proposed at EU level, because that would alleviate the concerns of those farmers in some way.  Do they support such a measure for precisely those farmers who have been at the forefront of so many concerns over the past number of years?  Then there is the issue of capping.  I welcome that the ICMSA in its opening statement, and the INHFA has also alluded to this, supports a payment upper limit of &euro;60,000 without any loopholes.  I am interested to hear if the other organisations support such a proposition.</p> <p>  We are dealing with a scenario in which there is a fundamental inequality in the CAP payment system in Ireland.  Do the witnesses accept that?  Mr. Cullinan said that he accepts there is unfairness in the CAP system.  Do the witnesses accept that there is a problem when there has never been a coherent proposal put forward by the Irish Government or any of the main established farm organisations on how to address the inequality and unfairness in the system?  Let us be clear about it.  At present, there are young farmers breaking their backs working full time on their land and they receive &euro;180 per hectare in Pillar 1 CAP payments.  At the same time, there are people sitting on their backsides, with their land leased out, receiving several multiples of that in payments that are based on the production they were involved in 20 years ago.  For me, that is fundamentally unfair.  Unless we are able to put forward proposals for dealing with it, we do not have credibility in simply opposing the three measures of convergence, front-loading and capping that have been set out to address it.  I want the organisations to outline their positions for addressing the inequality and unfairness that have allowed, as has been said, the Larry Goodmans and sheikhs of this world and others to draw down hundreds of thousands of euro, and millions of euro over the term of a CAP, while most of the farmers the witnesses represent are struggling to make ends meet.  We must have definitive proposals on how to address that, and I am interested in hearing them.</p> <p>  I note that the IFA is due to protest on Friday.  I do not like to be critical of any farm organisation as I work with all farm organisations, but in the context of the talks on CAP the IFA is essentially protesting in support of the Government's position in the talks.  To return to my opening point with regard to the EU budget, with the benefit of hindsight would it not have been more appropriate and would we not have been able to ensure that all the farm organisations would have come together if action had been taken and tractors brought onto the streets at the time the EU budget was being agreed?  Rather than protesting in support of the Government, they would have come out against the sell-out by the Government and the EU Commissioner at the time, who facilitated the position we are in now.  We are essentially fighting over the distribution of a smaller CAP cake.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I referred to that previously, but I will reinforce where young farmers are coming from and touch on the Deputy's point.  We find it wholly unacceptable that a young farmer who has taken up farming in the last number of years, has made significant investment and has future ambitions to develop the farming enterprise might be across the ditch from or is leasing land from someone who is not actively and continually engaged in farming or who has ceased farming for a number of years but who continues to draw entitlements based on active work that is over 20 years old.  If one looks at any business sector across the rest of the economy, I doubt that it could be justified at any stage.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the definition of the active farmer.  As young farmers, we are used to being defined.  I mentioned earlier the limitations that exist in terms of the definition of the five-year rule.  As regards what our definition is of an active farmer, to be delivered under the next CAP, we have submitted this on numerous occasions to the Department.  In terms of the payments granted for the delivery of public goods, the mandatory completion of health and safety programmes and the implementation of minimal agricultural activity, for example, stocking rates and cropping rates set by each member state, a point we have made many times over the last number of years to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is based on a report which we commissioned in 2017 and 2018 on delivering a continuous professional development programme for farmers to engage with.  That framework needs to be established.</p><p>Through it, we can monitor the training and development of farmers.</p><p> The issue of succession planning has been mentioned.  We are strong advocates for the development of a succession scheme that delivers for older and younger farmers and links with what we have been promoting in recent years through our Land Mobility Service, which is a collaborative partnership approach.  The penalising nature of previous schemes was mentioned, in that the older farmer could not appear outside the farm gate or else his or her payments would be threatened.  That is not a way forward and does not proactively encourage younger and older farmers.</p><p> The issue of capping payments was touched on briefly.  Macra na Feirme supports the &euro;60,000 cap with the proviso that it takes into account the labour units incurred on the farm.  For young farmers who are taking over and developing farms, particularly at this time, it is important to know how the growth and development of the business will be supported through payments.  Applying a simple cap of &euro;60,000 without taking cognisance of the impact it might have on the financial viability of the enterprise is a proposal that needs to be addressed.</p><p> The Deputy's final comments were on ensuring the future and how the budget was not enough.  We agree that the overall CAP budget has not been enough, but that is the hand we have been dealt.  We must ensure that there is a future for young farmers and that supports are ring-fenced.</p></speech>

We need to combine them with the definition of "genuine farmer" and the issue of leasing entitlements.  We have been clear on this.  We always advocate generational renewal.  It is important in any sector that young blood come into it.  Where funding is concerned in that regard, we must consider giving people who are leasing entitlements out, particularly over the long term, the option of selling them.  The Government needs to implement a capital gains allowance to provide the incentive of a tax-free lump sum.  A retirement scheme was mentioned.  It would go a long way for someone who wanted to give up farming and continue leasing out his or her lands if the rental income was tax free.  We should take that route.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the genuine farmer.  In our view, there should be activity on the farm and the financial output in the accounts should be based on sales.  A farm needs to have a minimum level of sales and activity.  That is critical.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about convergence.  We need to stand back and consider where we are now.  We have convergence and eco-schemes.  The negotiations reconvened last week.  At that point, the CRISS was a voluntary measure for member states.  It needs to remain voluntary.  It is up to each member state to make a decision on same.  When payment capping and all of the other measures are included, this is a major change that redistributes funding across the board.  We are clear on capping, in that we do not want to see funding going to Larry Goodman or the sheikhs.  It needs to go to the genuine farmer who is doing the work.  In light of what is coming down the tracks, though, particularly with convergence and how the eco-schemes will be developed, our farmers need to get rewarded.  The money in the eco-schemes is being taken from supports for farmers for producing cheap food and turned into an environmental measure.  At a minimum, the farmer has to get back the amount of money that is being taken out and should be rewarded if he or she is doing more.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the IFA's position on the budget.  As far back as last July, we were clear that there was not enough money in the budget.  With the greening measures, the green deal and the impact of same, there needed to be an increase in the budget.  As to whether it is a sell-out, the budget is what it is.  We were not satisfied with it at the time.  The Deputy asked why the IFA was only taking action now.  We have not done so to date because we were in the midst of Covid last July.  There was a slight break in the pandemic at the time, but there was no way I was going to put my members at risk by having them go out on the streets even though we were very frustrated.  We must look at the budget.  It was not last July that the problem with the budget arose.  It has been decreasing since 2001 from 50% to 32%.  That is where the budget stands.  It has been eroded over time, which is a major concern for us.</p></speech>

New entrants always cite the issue of land availability as prohibiting them from starting out, be it through a long-term lease or the inheritance of a farm.  The retirement schemes of the late 1990s were very efficient and successful in transferring land from one generation to the next via long-term leasing or on a permanent basis.</p> <p>  Regarding the redistribution model, the Deputy spoke about the payment per hectare being a crude method.  While it has merits, the national envelope ideally needs to be taken into account.  I say that unashamedly.  If we are to protect family farm structures, some of which are hanging on by a thread, including in the dairy sector, we need to take into account the overall payment.  There is no point in a family farm with a single farm payment of &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,000, &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000 or whatever the case may be losing substantial sums of money to beneficiaries whose lands may be let.  In other times, we often sat across the table from politicians in Brussels talking about the active farmer, but none of us succeeded in clinching the deal on defining what an active farmer was.  In fact, we probably made more ground on defining what it was not than on what it was.  If we can get the definition of "genuine farmer" right, though, many people will be happy.  I will give an extreme example.  Under the convergence model, a farmer renting from a landowner who is a retired farmer could see his or her payments cut while the payments to the landowner, who is letting the land entitlements tax free, could increase if the area is below the national average.  That has to be wrong.  The Deputy referred to it being an historical payment and asked whether it was right to base it on activity almost 20 years ago.  Is it right that there could be a beneficiary who has not farmed in the past eight, ten or 12 years and has let his or her land?  It is not.  That would be farcical.</p> <p>  Regarding the CRISS, I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Enright, who is anxious to contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#H00400"><p>Mr. O'Donnell mentioned a figure of &euro;22 million in terms of capping.  We support the capping of payments.  The &euro;22 million is equivalent to &euro;176 per farmer.  If there is to be an effective CRISS payment, there must be a linear cut across every farmer's payment.  There must be a clear analysis of what that means for every farmer.  There could be unintended consequences.  People in receipt of large payments were referenced in the presentations.  A farmer in receipt of &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 will qualify under CRISS just as a farmer in receipt of &euro;1,000 will.</p><p>We said that convergence is crude, which it is.  As our president said, in many cases, a person who is not farming and has all his or her entitlements leased will gain under convergence.  Peat farmers who are getting &euro;10,000 will see their payment cut to increase a payment to somebody who receives &euro;35,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000.  If that is not crude, I am not sure what is.</p><p> We set out clearly in our submission details of what we believe defines a genuine farmer.  We said that the ANC minimum stocking density should be applied.  A farmer should also have a certain level of output from his or her farm.  We have, therefore, set out exactly what should be done in that regard.</p><p> We also set out the need for generational renewal programmes under Pillar 2, both for the young farmer coming in and the old farmer retiring.  These are not in place at present and are needed if we are serious about this issue.  I will leave it at that.  Those are the important points.</p></speech>

Many of the issues have been covered.  To use a badly used phrase, we are where we are and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  Any CAP negotiations or agreements I recall have all started out with the promise that it will be a simpler CAP.  That has never happened in any CAP.  If we are to go on that premise, God knows what is coming down the line.</p> <p>  In that regard, on this occasion, we have long been promised a simpler CAP, which we know it will not be.  We were promised much more subsidiarity and flexibility nationally.  I put that question to the witnesses.  We are aware that, once the CAP has been agreed, the Department will have to go to Brussels with a national strategic plan.  What input, if any, have the farming organisations had in the process of preparing the national strategic plan?  What consultation, if any, has the Department had with the farming bodies, as stakeholders?  If there has been consultation, what progress has been made?  What further progress needs to be made?  What input would the witnesses like to have in the formation of that plan?  If it has as big a role as has been promised, this is where we will probably have the most input in how we will affect CAP for our family farmers going forward.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#J00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and Senator Daly.  The Senator, in his overview, may be right about a simpler CAP.  He mentioned the word "subsidiarity", which is one of the key planks of this reform.  On the other hand, we heard some stakeholders here calling for income tests and outputs per hectare.  This will put an excessive administration burden on the Department.  This is unacceptable.  We cannot allow a situation to develop where farmers who own or are renting land or aspire, as citizens of the EU, to carry out an agricultural activity on the agricultural areas they are holding are not supported.  That is a right they should be able to exercise.  Imagine people would not be supported from CAP because they must show they are a genuine farmer.  I guarantee the committee that I am a genuine farmer.  My payments at the start of the current reform were &euro;50 per hectare because my quota was frozen during the reference years due to the commonage framework plans.  That is a long history lesson, which I will  not go into now.  I consider myself to be a genuine farmer.</p> <p> To respond to Deputy Carthy on the issue of defining a genuine farmer, we cannot exclude part-time farmers in the regulations.  Part-time farmers have a God-given right, the same as anybody else, to be thought of and referred to as a genuine farmer.  We put forward a definition of what that should be to the Department and I hope the definition adopted will be inclusive.</p> <p>  By the way, we are not supportive of the long-term leasing of entitlements.  Carrying out an agricultural activity on the agricultural areas of the holding at the disposal of the farmer within a two-year period is our position on the definition of a genuine farmer.  The leasing of entitlements is not an agricultural activity.  That is our position.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Joyce, who has a few comments to make in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Joyce" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#J00600"><p>I will come back on three points raised by Deputy Carthy, namely, convergence, capping and front-loading.  Our position is very clear.  We are in favour of capping at &euro;60,000 with no loopholes, frills or spills.  The INHFA position in that regard is that the absolute limit must be &euro;60,000.</p> <p>  We are in favour of 100% convergence.  That will deliver for 72,000 farmers in this country.  The majority of farmers will benefit from full convergence.  That is the position of INHFA.  We recognise that it may create some complications for some farmers with smaller hectares and higher per hectare entitlements in that they would be unfairly hit.  That is why CRISS was brought in.  A comment was made that CRISS would be available to every farmer but we could target it.  In our case, we suggest targeting it at the first 15 ha.  If we combine 10% funding of CRISS with a cap of &euro;60,000, that would deliver, according to our figures, &euro;80 per hectare on the first 15 ha.  That would mean every single farmer would receive more than &euro;300 per hectare on the first 15 ha.  We ask that the Department verify those figures because up to this point, we have not seen any modelling done by the Department around CRISS.  We are calling for that to take place because as other speakers mentioned, that insulates the vulnerable farmers.  The convergence model delivers for the majority of farmers.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question on protests on Friday.  In our view, any farmer who takes to the streets in support of a lower convergence and is not in favour of CRISS is not delivering for 72,000 farmers in this State.  In actual fact, such farmers are not delivering a fair result in this CAP negotiation.  I will make that clear and I want that message to go out to all legislators here.  We are advocating for a fairer CAP.  We are using an historical payment system that dates back 20 years at this stage.  Younger farmers who have taken over farms are, in many cases, depending on something their fathers have done before them.  This is a time for change.  There are hardships within certain areas; I do not disagree with that.  There are ways of overcoming those.  People and farmers need to hear the real facts.  CRISS will deliver and convergence delivers for the majority of farmers.  We need that point to come clearly across. </p></speech>

We might look at farmers with average-sized land.  Many farmers with small landholdings are being significantly impacted by redistribution.  Take, for instance, the example of a farmer with 35 ha who had a single farm payment of &euro;12,500 in 2014, which is not a big payment.  That farmer's single farm payment dropped to &euro;10,500 in 2019.  It will drop to &euro;7,000 in 2026, with eco-schemes at 25%.  If the farmer manages to qualify for eco-schemes, that would bring the payment up to &euro;9,260.  There may be a cost incurred in complying with eco-schemes, however.  That farmer, who is farming 86 acres, therefore, will take a significant hit in terms of the single farm payment.</p><p>These are not farmers with huge landholdings.  They are farmers with average-sized land who are farming with entitlements that are slightly above average.</p><p> The core issue, and I think Deputy Carthy touched upon this earlier, goes back to the size of EU budget.  The size of the EU budget, set as what it was, has created real challenges when it comes to redistribution.  When we are looking at convergence, which is now increasing to a minimum of 75%, and we also have eco-schemes, we need to understand the economic impact of those two forms first before we can make an informed decision on what the CRISS is going to look like.  As a previous contributor said, we do not have any figures from the Department on what CRISS is going to look like.  In modelling that was prepared in 2019, CRISS was not even modelled.  Our figures show that if 30 ha were topped up, it would come up at around &euro;45.  If you take farmers with 35 ha and a &euro;12,500 single payment going down to &euro;7,000, they will gain nothing under CRISS.  It will be more or less the same.</p><p> We are saying we first need to understand the impact on payments for convergence and eco-schemes before we make decisions.  That is why we think from the perspective of CRISS that it should remain optional for member states.  Let us get the economic analysis from our Department first to see the impact is going to have.  Then we can make an informed decision about whether we should introduce it or at what sort of levels it should be introduced.  Trying to do something when we are completely in the dark, in our view, from an economic perspective, is not a sensible thing to do at the moment.</p></speech>

However, we will agree to differ.  On Macra na Feirme, Mr. Keane said he agreed with the &euro;60,000 cap.  The only problem at the moment, as he will be aware, is that young farmers, many of whom are happy enough, can go only to 90 ha and get &euro;22,500, plus the top-up.  That brings them to about &euro;27,500 or &euro;28,000.  Where does the &euro;60,000 come in on Mr. Keane&rsquo;s side?</p></speech>

The &euro;60,000 relates to a young farmer who has taken over an established enterprise.  That limit is impacting there.  The point in terms of the capping from our point of view is that currently there are many enterprises which are a number of family farm members farming, be they brothers or sisters together with parents and, oftentimes, grandparents.  We feel that putting a cap on that right now as a blunt instrument without allowing or having provisions for that intergenerational piece, where potentially you could have three generations working on a farm, could have a very negative impact on the potential for more than one family member - both young and older - to continue farming, thus placing the farm both at a viability risk but also placing it at risk in terms of the breakdown of the farm structure, the viability of the farm, and whether some individuals within the farming enterprise have to separate out to alternative practices.</p></speech>

I say that just as a note of interest.</p> <p>  I have one question for all of the witnesses.  Have they tried posting out a simple piece of paper to every one of their members asking them to fill it in and to state which they would prefer?  In that way they would get a good feel for what is going on.</p></speech>

I will deal with a few of the points.  First, we set a &euro;60,000 cap.  It is not that we like caps, but it is that the average payment is &euro;9,000 per farmer.  In a world where we cannot even pay a living wage to the average farmer, it is illogical in our view that if you give one farmer &euro;60,000, you would also give that farmer extra money to hire in labour.  The marketplace and the taxation system have to cover the cost of hired-in labour.</p> <p>  In terms of young farmers, we have always supported the national reserve and the 25% top-up.  We would say there needs to be consideration given to young farmers who do not want to get into dairying.  Dairying is a logical and good choice for some young farmers, but for a lot of our members, who are young folk who are getting into farming, because of fragmented holdings, land quality, or the sheer risk investing hundreds of thousands in new milking facilities, they should be given options to farm in sucklers, sheep, or tillage, as an alternative to the high capital investment in dairying.  That is where we want to see, for example, an agri-environment scheme is attractive to young people starting out and can pay up to &euro;15,000, for example.</p> <p>  In terms of the definition of "genuine farmer", we have said clearly there must be an upper limit on the number of years a farmer can lease out entitlements.  We accept that people will lease out entitlement in the short term, because of illness, or some issues like that, and there are people who need to lease in entitlements, but prolonged, by which we mean for seven years or more, leasing out of entitlements has got to stop.  If nothing else happens, we need to form an agreed position on this around this and other tables.  Also on the genuine farmer, we have said the areas of natural constraint, ANC, minimum stocking rates should apply and the donkeys should be ruled out.</p> <p>  In terms of getting our members' views, we have asked them through various formats.  We are using, for example, WhatsApp and messaging for people to give their feedback on various issues.  Obviously, that is more of a thing with Covid-19, but we hope also to go back to real engagement with people around the table.  In general, the CRISS, the convergence, and all of these issues are substantially linked to the EU looking for farmers to do more and more for less and less.  However, there is a &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU, NGEU, piece, which was agreed as part of the EU budget negotiations.  The farming and natural resources sectors across all of Europe got a mere &euro;17.5 billion from that, &euro;10 billion of which was for just transition and &euro;7.5 billion to top up rural development funding.  We think that is inadequate.  We think Ireland's share of it is smaller still.</p> <p>  If we come back to these contentious issues, we have to get more money into the budget.  The carbon &euro;1.5 billion that was a programme for Government agreement needs to be extra money over and above the co-financing obligation that will be part of Pillar 2.</p><p>We need to ensure also we are fighting as part of this negotiation.  Whether the eco-scheme is set at 25% or 30% is akin to moving the deckchairs as it is playing around with figures.  We need to get more money into the schemes and if we want CRISS, we need more money to top that up.  If we want to have a fairer CAP, we need more money for the farmers who are most vulnerable to the current convergence model, and in our view those are cattle, suckler, sheep and tillage farmers.  They are the people who need more money out of this and we have to find a way of doing that quickly.</p></speech>

I said it earlier to the officials from the Department but I remember asking a question in the D&aacute;il when Brexit was in full swing and the T&aacute;naiste stated the Government would bring it up if there was a deficit.  We must focus on that, in the line of getting more money, as Mr. Punch has talked about, into the pot.  It was mentioned earlier but in fairness to any Minister, under CAP, as one of the organisations said, a minimum stock is needed.  Under CAP, we cannot bring it in because of some world trade agreement or rules.  It is true they have it in under the ANC but they cannot do that under CAP.  Where there is land being leased and payments going with it and there is someone sitting down looking at the farmer busting himself or herself outside the door, that type of stuff must come to an end.  I do not care whether the farmer is farming full time or part time, he or she must be looked after because if we do not do that, we will not continue to have farmers.  As regards young farmers as well, we must help them and encourage them as much as possible going forward.</p> <p>  I will be very clear that my honest opinion is we must go down the road of convergence.  We have to try to divide the money up as best as possible.  Some people will be affected but we must bring in systems that will help them.  The cap will be over &euro;50,000, or &euro;1,000 a week.  We should do that and get the income of every farmer, especially on family farms, up to a viable level.  Earlier on, a size of 35 ha was talked about.  My understanding is that the average size is 32 ha and there are farmers who have missed out on moneys.  People will not get paid for what they did 20 years ago.  As a contractor, whatever baling farmers do, they will not get it this year unless they go out and fight for it.  We must ensure we look after all farmers as best as is possible.</p> <p>  Those at the very top were mentioned.  I know there are not many but looking at what has come out in the media about payments of &euro;245,000 and &euro;145,000 and all of that, it is inflating the whole situation.  I know that is just ten pictures taken of ten different people.  It is not going to make anyone at the bottom any richer but all that must be cut out because it is not portraying the system in a good manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#L00400"><p>One of the questions the Deputy asked was whether we sent a piece of paper out to our members.  All I can say is we have had numerous consultations with our members during Covid, although it has been difficult.  We have had two rounds of regional meetings.  We came out with six key objectives for this CAP reform.  They were based on listening to our members on the ground.  One of the areas Deputy Fitzmaurice brought up was the armchair farmer.  If he can believe it, that was one of the key issues coming up when we were doing the meetings up and down the country.  I explained earlier on that we have, in our objectives, an objective of dealing with armchair farming and long-term leasing.  That needs to go back in and there needs to be a trading system around that.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree that we cannot afford any leakage out of this reform.  What the Deputy says is right.  The budget has been decreasing and this is the ultimate problem here.  What we must do with the scarce resources available is to ensure they are going in the right direction.  I am talking about targeted payments.  We have been working on this for quite a while.  We already have a targeted payment for the suckler cow and the ewe and we must continue with that.  We have more funding coming into this.  Members should remember that national governments must, at a minimum, co-fund up to 57%.  We must ensure that happens and that co-funding is not mixed with the &euro;1.5 billion from the carbon tax.  That is absolutely essential because two things need to happen.  First, we must have a proper environmental scheme and the money is now ring-fenced for that.  Second, we can use more of the targeted payments in the Pillar 2 for a proper payment for suckler cattle and sheep.  That is the direction we need to go in now.  We must keep the money with the people who are doing the work.  I could not agree more with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#L00600"><p>I thank the Chairman and all the participants.  I have two quick questions.  The first is for Macra na Feirme.  Either the IFA or the ICMSA can answer the second.  I do not agree with all of the contributions made by the representatives of the farming organisations, although I agree with some of them.  Mr. Keane spoke about new schemes and additional interventions for the new generation of farmers and young farmers.  I fully agree with Macra na Feirme on that because if we have no young farmers coming through, we do not have great hope for the industry going forward.  Will Mr. Keane flesh out what Macra na Feirme would like to see done in that regard in the next round of CAP?</p> <p>  I raise the second issue with the IFA and the ICMSA because they mentioned it.  Mr. Cullinan spoke about targeted schemes.  One scheme I would like to see reintroduced is the early retirement scheme.  When we met the senior officials from the Department this morning I and many other members raised the early retirement scheme.  It is to be paid for with the same pot of money so it will compete with other targeted schemes.  Consequently, if we introduce an early retirement scheme, it will be to the detriment of other schemes or areas.  The previous early retirement scheme was very successful.  My own parents availed of it, as did many other families across the country.  I know it was left somewhat open-ended and we would need to apply tighter restrictions if it were to be reintroduced.</p></speech>

We outlined a number of things we are looking for from this round.  As mentioned, these include the ring-fencing of 4% under Pillar 1 payments, inclusion of the young farmer top-up under that, a fully-funded national reserve so we can ensure it is fully funded for the entirety of the period of the CAP and, finally, that this is fully ring-fenced for young farmers.  As I noted, we have heard at European level that the inclusion of other interventions under this scheme cannot be included in the pot of funds set aside for young farmers.  It can all be aligned to the ambition of organics and the other schemes that are available but cannot come from the pot of funds allocated to young farmers.</p> <p>  On the Pillar 2 payments, the previous early retirement scheme has cropped up a number of times.  We have submitted a detailed succession scheme to the Department setting out what we see as a collaborative and partnership model that will deliver succession to both the older and younger generations and would be funded under Pillar 2.</p><p>Key elements include that it is delivered within the time period of this CAP, that it is funded from Pillar 2 payments, that the entirely of the land is transferred before the end of the CAP period and that it is a collaborative model.  Under the previous early retirement scheme, we saw older farmers penalised.  They could not go outside the front door for fear of their payments being removed.</p><p> In addition, in terms of delivering for young farmers, the development of the start-up grant scheme has been mentioned at Commissioner level in terms of installation aid which is being used by all bar six member states, including Ireland, under the CAP.  It has been shown to be quite a successful measure in other member states.  We see it as having a number of parts, including grant aid for the start-up of business.  Businesses in other sectors on the island of Ireland have this and we do not see why it should not be applied to young farmers.  As part of this, and it links back to one of our earlier proposals, there should be a continuing professional development framework and credit lines for young farmers to access training and development.</p><p> Access to land and credit have been mentioned as major barriers to young farmers entering farming and establishing their enterprises.  What we see as key issues include the roll-out of financial instruments under Pillar 2 payments to encourage access to land and credit, and making finance available at competitive and favourable rates for young farmers to allow them to compete.  If I might be allowed, we have mentioned our Land Mobility Service.  It has been called out by the Commission.  I might ask our CEO, Mr. Duggan, to briefly discuss it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021060900002#M00200"><p>We have submitted proposals to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and at Commission level, to support a land mobility service.  For members of the committee who are not familiar with it, it is, in essence, a matchmaking service that deals predominantly with putting together older farmers and young farmers outside of a family relationship to instigate shared farming partnerships, leases or other types of collaborative arrangements to support generational renewal.  Since the foundation of the service in 2012 and 2013, it has put together more than 700 such partnerships with, on average, 140 arrangements per year.</p> <p>  In 2012, before the service started, Dr. Pat Bogue, who is familiar to some committee members from various research he has undertaken in agriculture, did a survey in which he found that 48% of full-time farmers did not have an identified successor.  The Irish Farm Accounts Co-operative, IFAC, which is the farm accountancy firm, did a farm survey report in 2021 which found 77% of farmers over the age of 55 had no definite succession plan.  It is not necessarily that the farmers in either report had no heir, that they were bachelor farmers or any such scenario.  Many had sons and daughters but they were in professional careers, scattered to the four corners of the world or not yet ready to take on the family farm enterprise.  It is something they might want to do in ten or 15 years time but there may be a desire for mum or dad to step back from farming before the next generation is ready.  This is where the Land Mobility Service has stepped in.  We have been seeking to have the service scaled up and supported under the next CAP.  We have made detailed submissions to the Department on that basis.</p></speech>

We all accept people need to be able to retire when they come to a certain age.  Over the years, we have lost a lot of older people in farm fatalities, which is a tragedy in itself.  The problem we have comes back to funding and resources.  We have to channel the resources in the best way possible.  We are looking at the vulnerable sectors.  We started off speaking about viable farmers, particularly farmers relying on funding from Pillar 2.  Obviously if we have a retirement scheme, the money will come out of that and we will leave other sectors short of finances.  It comes back to the original problem of there not being enough money in the budget.  We have to target the money at the vulnerable sectors.  Looking at it, if people retire from farming now and sell their entitlement to get out of farming, the money going back to them should be tax free.  We have a system whereby the rental income from leasing the land is tax free.</p></speech>

Perhaps the word "early" needs to be taken out of this.  Perhaps this is where there was a significant issue in the past.  People aged 55 were going into what was an early retirement scheme and perhaps it was not sustainable.  We certainly need to look at the model to see whether we can have a retirement scheme that will be beneficial, in particular where there is a family transfer and there would not be the availability of money from a lease.</p> <p>  If the average age of farmers now is 57 or 58 years, when we roll on three years the average age of farmers will be over 60.  The committee members are the people who are elected to do the business and govern the country.  One of the main reasons young people are not going into the industry is that if they were to do so today, they would get the same price as their grandparents got 30 or 35 years ago.  We have not seen a move forward in food inflation, and that has to go hand in hand with this round of CAP reform.  The current position is not sustainable.</p> <p>  The conversation was about eco-schemes, greening and various measures.  We have the farm-to-fork strategy and climate action.  We have all these regulations to comply with as farmers and to suffer the consequences of them, whether it is challenging output or the costs associated with compliance, and all for the same price our forefathers in the generations that went ahead of us received.  There needs to be a clear message from our public representatives that food inflation has to go hand-in-hand with CAP reform.</p></speech>

They stated the loss of funds issued must be addressed through flexibilities, including the Council's general approach.

We have been engaging with the Department on an ongoing basis.  The Department cannot make a decision on the strategic plans until negotiations are concluded in Brussels.  This will frame the direction of travel.  What is absolutely essential in all of this is that we need a financial impact assessment on all of this.  A fundamental change is taking place.  There will be a massive cost to farmers.  We also have to be very careful with the schemes we are devising with regard to costs incurred and income forgone.  Planners will be coming in to devise the eco-schemes.</p> <p>  I will also answer Deputy Browne's question on the loss of funds.</p><p>We must ensure that those funds are ring-fenced and stay in the system in Pillar 1.  If we are advising on environmental schemes, it is essential that there is not a loss or another cost involved for farmers because of more leakage.  We do not need the two-year learning here.  Farmers have learned quite a lot over the years.  Basically, funding from Pillar 1 us being shoved into Pillar 2, which not a good idea, full stop, from my perspective.  The learning is that we are going in the wrong direction of travel with this.</p></speech>

Equally, we need to see the ink dry at European Union level.  We also need to see a commitment at national level and co-funding decided in order to take the creases out of the national strategic plan going forward.  We need to have the maximum level of national discretion as we move forward.  It is imperative that we have the maximum amount of co-funding.</p></speech>

Not much work can be done on the national strategic plan until the job has been completed at EU level.  We must ensure all the co-funding and other promised funding is provided, including the &euro;1.5 billion from the carbon tax.  There must be no three-card trick whereby one fund is used to cover the other.  We have had a lot of discussions at the CAP committee as well.  There will have to be a plan and we will have to look after the farmers who are in need of help.  Some need more help others and some sectors are in dire straits.  We need to look after them.</p> <p>  Without going around in circles, my grandmother used to say to me long ago, "Remember boy, enough always wants more."  We have people out there living on a fixed income of &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000 a year, yet we are afraid that fellows on &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 will be upset if we take a few pounds off them.  We must be fair in our dealings with everyone.  Using hectares might be a crude measure.  The whole system must be looked at, including what each person is drawing down.</p></speech>

In our latest presentations and engagement with the Department, the early indicators would be potentially positive regarding the eco-scheme.  That might address Deputy Browne's question.</p> <p>  It is crucial that there is equal opportunity for extensive and intensive farm systems, and that they all have equal access.  We will get more with a spoonful of honey than with a jar of vinegar.  We need to incentivise participation by all beneficiaries.  The 125,000 beneficiaries should have an equal opportunity and have measures that are tailored to the needs of the various farming systems.  That is very important and would address the incubation period referred to by the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the potential loss of funds.  It appears the Department is on a good foundation and trajectory to ensure there will be no money left behind.  While it is mandatory for the member states, it is voluntary for the farmer.  My point to Deputy Browne is that it would need to be such that all farmers can access it equally.</p></speech>

I touched on the CAP strategic plan earlier, but overall there is disappointment in the lack of ambition and support for young farmers under the draft plan we have seen.  I mentioned this and Mr. Duggan mentioned it in the context of land mobility and other services not being included.  It is hugely disappointing, having been engaged in the process over many years.</p> <p>  To directly answer the question on eco-schemes, Macra na Feirme believes that maximum flexibility is certainly required.  Any scheme must be inclusive and accessible to all.  If we are looking at our contribution and requirements under climate change and the delivery of targets that will be outlined in other forums, it is crucial to ensure the scheme is accessible and inclusive of all 120,000 plus farmers.  The penalties of excluding people from it would be financial but would also have bigger ramifications on our commitments in other forums.  The schemes must be progressive and they must be complementary.  In times past, we have seen legislation and schemes that have not necessarily complemented what is being done by individual farmers on the ground.  Those are the key objectives we have for the delivery of effective and equal schemes, and to deliver the best results for farmers and for the ambition of the CAP.</p></speech>

The impact assessment of the Mercosur trade deal has been delayed.  I was speaking to IFA members from south Tipperary recently.  They feel they are being made to jump through every hoop imaginable and the Mercosur deal has the potential to make an already difficult situation even harder for them.  They raised the issues of inflation and the cost of living, which they say is never factored into the needs of the sector.  That question is for the IFA.</p> <p>  My next question is for the ICMSA.  Its members are being asked to do more and provide affordable produce at the same time.  The CAP has shifted its focus from enabling farmers to produce food at affordable prices to the green transition.  Have any of the organisations here ever been asked to discuss with the Minister or EU officials the prices they expect to see in supermarkets right across the bloc if all this happens?</p> <p>  My next question is for the representatives from Macra na Feirme.  While elevating generational renewal as a key objective under the current CAP is welcome, the organisation said that it wanted a minimum allocation of 4% of direct payments ring-fenced for young farmers.  That seems to be sliding back to 3%.  What kind of an impact would a reduction by 1% have on young farmers?</p></speech>

I have been very close to this in my position as vice president of the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations, COPA.  The position is that the Mercosur process has been slowed down because it has to go through the political system.  The view politically is that it is not going ahead at the moment.  If it was to go ahead, it would be very concerning, especially if we couple that with what is happening in the UK, which will, more than likely, do a trade deal with Australia.  If that were to happen, it would be even more critical that we do not have an EU-Mercosur deal.  I return to CAP, the green deal and the farm-to-fork strategy.</p><p>There is no way that we can allow the EU to import beef from a country that will not have the same environmental standards that we will have in Europe going forward.  From that point of view, that trade deal cannot happen.  We speak about inflation.  We all know the prices that farmers receive today are similar to those they received 30 years ago.  A lot of this has been the pressure coming from discounters.  Deputy Martin Browne may have seen recently that we took up this issue with one of the international retailers.  It tried to silence us by seeking a court injunction against us.  We were able to prove that we want to fight on for farmers.  We proved last Friday that it was not able to obtain that injunction against us.  That is very important in the battle of the price of food going forward.  </p><p> To sum up, I am delighted that we had an excellent discussion today and a debate with all the farm organisations.  One message is coming out here and Deputy Carthy alluded to it, which is the problem is there is not enough money in the pot.  We are scrambling for an increasingly lower budget and there is no point in saying anything else; it is very divisive.  We must ensure the funding is distributed in the fairest way possible, which is not easy.  We must look at alternative ways of getting funding and the Government has a duty to ensure we get the maximum funding from the pillar and from national co-financing and that the &euro;1.5 billion is ring-fenced.  Tomorrow, we are going out to highlight all of that.  We want to do two things.  The impact all of this can have on rural towns and villages of Ireland is highly concerning.  Approximately 300,000 people are employed in our sector in rural Ireland.  That is a massive number of people.  If one takes in the rural economy, that is approximately 11% of employment overall.  Local towns and villages are only reopening after Covid-19.  The last thing we want to see is a long-term impact on agriculture that will affect the viability both of us as farmers and of all the businesses in rural towns up and down the country from Donegal right down to west Cork.  The reason we will be getting out there on Friday is to explain this to people on the ground, as well as for our members to send a clear message to the Government and to the Minister that he needs to conclude the talks in Brussels and get a proper redistribution of this funding in a fair and equitable way for all farmers, as well as ensuring that the viability of farmers can be sustained.  While people here have stated that only a cohort of farmers is viable, what we are trying to do - it is difficult -  is to get from 30% and to have a lot more farmers viable into the future.  That is what we are about. </p></speech>

Unfortunately, we are asked to do more for less.  It comes to Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s and Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s earlier point, the overall budget is the issue.  If the budget was substantially increased, maybe we would be in a position to deliver in an economically sustainable way.  We need ask ourselves the questions in respect of prices and price recovery and, from being involved with the European Milk Board, EMB, on the cost recovery pricing model, the French have done significantly more in that regard and we need to look at that French model as we move forward.  I always say it is nothing short of hypothetical to talk about doing trade deals with non-environmentally conscious countries and nations.  The Mercosur trade deal and any potential from a European point of view to execute that trade deal is nothing other than talking from the two sides of the mouth.  We all have an obligation and a duty as the CAP talks continue.  There will be national discretion to put in place a model and a funding mechanism to support the family farm model as we know it today.  Ultimately, it will support and drive rural economies across rural villages and towns.  What happens arising from this CAP reform will dictate where agriculture will be when we hit the next decade starting in 2030.</p></speech>

The Mercosur deal, as it was, will be a total disaster for this country.  At present, environmentalists are calling for our beef herd to be cut.  Our suckler herd is probably the most efficient, grass-fed, environmentally friendly way of producing beef.  If we outsource that to places like Brazil, where they cut down rainforests, we would be using air miles and ship miles and all this carry-on.  Therefore, it does not make a whole pile of sense.  Our suckler herd is very good.  In all fairness, the suckler herd and the sheep flock are keeping the lights on in many rural parishes, especially in the western half of this country.  That is why we need more funding and need it to be shared fairly.  There is a duty of care on our Department and country to look after all farmers, even small drystock farmers.  There has to be a duty of care to all farming families.  We cannot be kicking them into touch because some other fellow says they are unviable.  If you go into any mart in Ireland, you will see very few fellows.  We will see the other fellows going home who are ageing.  There is unviable and there is viable.  If we take some of the Teagasc research farms, we would be all in the truck because their results were shocking.  Any farmer with half a brain would not be as bad as them.</p></speech>

I would like to recap on a couple of the issues that came up today.  It is worth bearing in mind that under conditionality, all farmers are now required to comply with a basic set of conditions.  All farmers have to do this.  We are all farming to a set of conditions.  It is only fair to think that we would work and continue on the trajectory of going for flattening of payments, to finally bring some fairness, after 20 years, and some equality in respect of how farmers are supported.  I mentioned at the start that main general objective is to strengthen the socioeconomic fabric of rural areas.  This is vitally important.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have a duty of care to ensure that this happens.  That is the best way of keeping those small areas vibrant, as well as that social dimension spoken about earlier by a contributor.  This is the way to do it.  I would say that a front-loaded payment will protect those small farms and high value entitlements with the top-up on the first 15 ha.  There is a deliver up to &euro;80 per hectare.  Put an end to this gravy train once and for all and cap payments at &euro;60,000, with no labour units allowed.  That point was well made by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  On the eco-scheme, we need to ensure that we have equal opportunity, equal access and a uniform payment per hectare.  This will ensure, if it is done with an incentivisation for entry-level schemes, that there would be no money left behind.  The pot is a taxpayers&rsquo; pot of money.  This proposed 20%, whether it is 20%, 25%, or 30%, is no longer something that is God-given or that belongs to any individual beneficiary.  It is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We can see now why the budget has not increased.   It is because of how greening was seen as a failure and a bad way of distributing funding for the benefit that was expected from environmental ambition.  Finally, I would tell the Minister that the 70,000 farmers who would benefit are the majority of farmers in this country, were we to go for full convergence and were we to use the other tools at his disposal.  Many of these farmers are farming on a land type that leaves them very productive.  They are delivering excellent farm products.  However, what about the public goods and the ecosystem services that have never been acknowledged in any previous iteration of CAP?</p><p>We need to ensure that "agricultural activity" extends to acknowledge public goods and the delivery of ecosystem services, which are of considerable benefit to this country annually.</p></speech>

It amounts to &euro;14 million over the course of the CAP period.  That sounds like an insignificant number, but when one considers the ambitions that we have set out in terms of the inclusion of a fully funded national reserve, including the additional supports that we are seeking under Pillar 2 payments, and an additional stream of young people coming into farming as a result who will need to be supported under Pillar 1 payments, the consequences of not supporting or fully funding those ambitions will be felt far beyond the impact of the payments.</p> <p>  As has been stated numerous times, the ambition to support young farmers, drive generational renewal and elevate it to one of the nine key objectives must be at the forefront of the Minister's mind and the minds of those involved in the CAP negotiations.  For the past 20 or 30 years, we have spoken about generational renewal and encouraging young farmers.  We have spoken about generational renewal since my father was involved in Macra na Feirme, which was not in the past ten years.  The issue of young farmers has always been talked about.  We stand at a point when we need constructive, supported and fully funded measures to drive generational renewal.  As has been stated, the average age is shoving 60 years.  Were that the case in medicine, teaching or any other sector in our economy, it would not be facilitated or tolerated.  We need fully funded supports for young farmers so as to drive generational renewal.  They have shown a commitment to engaging in new practices and changes that are environmentally friendly and sustain the agricultural sector.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.</p></speech>

Essentially, it provides that a Minister constitutes a relevant body, but the Government does not.  On that basis, a number of amendments have been tabled to provide for the insertion of a Minister and the Government of Ireland.  The Government and the Minister should be operating as one and accountable as one.  The rationale for these amendments is to ensure that the Minister and the Government are held accountable in regard to their performance under the climate Bill.</p></speech>

It relates to the 2015 Act and not the 2021 Bill.  The role of the Government throughout this climate Bill is central to its operation and entwined with the efforts to be made.  Every ceiling, budget and plan are matters that the Government must approve.  Regardless of whether additional obligations may be attached to the Government lawfully, the overall target as set in the legislation is something that the Government must clearly consider.  It is a statutory obligation being created and it is almost certainly justiciable.  It is something we have certainly considered to ensure the targets are justiciable and enforceable.</p> <p>  Even without any broad, sweeping obligations, the Government remains the executive power of the State and is therefore answerable to the courts if the legislation does not fulfil the targets set therein.  However, the proposal to include a requirement on the State raises significant constitutional, questionable and incompatible legal issues for the role of the Executive.  It therefore cannot be supported at this time.  We do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

What is the difference between the 2015 Act and this Bill with respect to the assurances that the Government is seen as one and the same with the Minister when it comes to accountability?

The national climate objective talks of "a climate resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally-sustainable and climate-neutral economy".  When it comes to developing the roadmap of action the roadmap is pretty much confined to the climate dimension of this.  There has been some concern in the committee that although there is a biodiversity plan it falls outside the remit of the committee, which is one thing, but it also seems to fall outside the remit of the design of the climate plan.  Equally, there is a growing interest in the concept of a circular economy, on which I know the Minister of State is working.  That again raises wider issues than our own climate inventory, which is purely looked at from the point of view of production within Ireland and does not look at practices that might give rise to emissions in other countries.</p> <p>  For Report Stage, would the Minister of State consider whether the roadmap of actions that he will look at under this Bill should be extended to look specifically at initiatives in the area of biodiversity and the circular economy?  In other words, will he look at the entire supply chain not just the elements that are produced within Ireland and so have a wider remit?</p> <p>  This committee, in its deliberations, have found it a bit difficult to see that biodiversity challenges are not always co-produced with initiatives that are positive from a climate point of view.  Sometimes there is conflict.  Most of the time they work together but not all of the time.  How can a balance be struck?  Should the Bill in some way recognise the wider dimensions of policies that, I think, should be included?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#D00800"><p>This Bill focuses on emission reduction and a lot of things are contingent on climate action.  Obviously there is a clear link between biodiversity and climate change and there is a clear link between biodiversity and the circular economy.  However, that does not mean everything that is affected by climate change needs to be stuffed into this Bill or that there needs to be actions produced as a result of this Bill on everything that is affected by climate change.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, we are developing biodiversity plans, a circular economy action plan and new circular economy legislation.  To make a general or thematic point, rather than see this Bill as being the repository for all of the things that we need to do to help the climate, really it is focused on emissions reduction.  All of the other legislation that the Government is producing should be climate compliant and help in those aims.</p> <p>  I will not give a glib answer.   I am willing to consider whether the scope of the climate action plan should be extended into areas like biodiversity or circular economy actions.  I am also aware that we are developing these aspects separately in other areas.  It is important that we draw a line somewhere and scope this legislation correctly.  With any legislation or project one must draw boundaries if one wants to make sure that one arrives at a destination on time.  Yes, I will consider this matter and anybody who wants to talk to me about it is welcome to contact my office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#D00900"><p>I am concerned that the Minister of State's response indicates a certain rowing back on the understanding when it comes to climate action.  We have had significant discussions at pre-legislative scrutiny and within the committee.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has acknowledged that climate action and biodiversity action are one in the same and need to be addressed the same.  Climate boundaries are ecological boundaries, which must be recognised.  We have had discussions on nature-based solutions and his response clearly indicates why my amendment to incorporate nature-based solutions and a definition of nature-based solutions within this legislation should have happened.  It is really unfortunate, and is looking even more unfortunate, that the Government voted my amendment down but I will resubmit it on the next Stage.</p> <p>  We and the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity crisis which were discussed in parallel because they are so connected.  Biodiversity needs to play a big part in the reduction of climate emissions and if it does not then we will have missed an opportunity.</p> <p>  When we respond to climate change and climate emissions we need to be absolutely certain that we do not impact further on our biodiversity or environment.  So any actions that are taken must either have no impact on biodiversity or, preferably, enhance biodiversity.  We have seen recent examples where trees were planted, which facilitates carbon storage, but they were planted on peat.  Therefore, the biodiversity impacts were enormous but there was also an impact on carbon so when landslides happened there was a great deal of carbon emissions from the peat.  We cannot separate the two elements.  The Minister of State's response gives me cause for concern because it seems that we have now rowed back on this.  I ask him to come back to me on it because this is a really important discussion that we need to have.</p></speech>

Having the phrase "carbon leakage" in the legislation without a definition is pointless and is only lip service.  This is a very complex and serious area.  A lot of the efforts that we make here in Ireland will count for nothing unless we fully account for the risk of carbon leakage.  While we reference carbon leakage in the legislation it cannot be enforced without a legal definition.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#D01200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to consider the matter.  There might have been a slight presumption of it being unnecessary.  First, I do not think that climate proofing is quite the same.  We have defined the climate objective as "a climate resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally-sustainable and climate-neutral economy".  To shrink that to emissions only would seem not to be in tune with the definition that has been set out in the Bill.</p><p>It also leaves these elements working in their own silos, whereas I think there is a feeling in the committee generally that biodiversity and the circular economy or supply chain should be more integrated so they are not looked at individually.  They must be looked at in the sense that there can be trade-offs and those should be done openly.  The other thing is we are setting up quite a strong framework for implementation with cross-Government capacity for delivery which is different from leaving items in their own silos.  When we define the broad objective in this way the cross-Government framework should in some way seek also to encompass that.</p><p> My last point is that, unfortunately, some areas of sequestration that could be very useful in potentially creating income in the agricultural sphere are not currently counted in the inventory of emissions.  Therefore looking more broadly at some of those elements of carbon sequestration through forestry, land management or whatever, if we leave them out of climate planning and the inventory they will inevitably get valued downward somewhat.  I am not looking for the Minister of State to come back and have a long debate on that but just to consider it before Report Stage when he comes back to this.</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Bruton, I am certainly not dismissing requests out of hand at all.  I am certainly willing to consider it on the next Stage and consider where the scope should lie.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Whitmore, climate change and biodiversity are deeply entwined and obviously very closely linked.  If emissions are increased, biodiversity can be damaged and if biodiversity is disimproved, say by cutting down a forest, emissions can disimprove; the two things are very closely linked.  In the same way, transport is very closely linked with emissions and so are home heating, agriculture and electricity generation, so we have these very close linkages all across the economy and they are not simple to disentangle.  As I said to Deputy Bruton, we will see to what extent we should include biodiversity aims in this particular Bill and to what extent it should be put into separate biodiversity legislation.</p> <p>  On Deputy Naughten's point about carbon leakage, as far as I know there is a definition of it in section 6 of the Bill.  Carbon leakage, as the Deputy says, is a really complex area; it is different for different sectors.  Sometimes, if a state stops doing something, if emissions are reduced in one sector in a country, it could automatically be replaced with increases in another sector.  In other areas there is simply no carbon leakage all.  It is, by definition, something to be solved by international cooperation.  The point of EU cooperation, the Paris Agreement, the next Conference of the Parties, COP, and so on is to work out those details on carbon leakage.  Carbon leakage should never be used as an excuse for inaction and for us to say that if we do not do this in our country, somebody is going to do it in another.  Clearly, there are some areas where there is zero carbon leakage.  For example, if one takes the bus instead of driving to work it is not like that is going cause something else in another country.  It is certainly something to be regarded and examined carefully.  Carbon leakage is complex but is not to be used as an excuse.</p></speech>

The thing is that carbon leakage is far more complex than that and one would need a book to get a proper handle on what carbon leakage is, when it happens and how to address it.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his response but I am concerned he is putting biodiversity on a comparable level to transport.  Biodiversity is part of our environment.  It is absolutely entwined with climate.  The things we do to improve our biodiversity crisis will help with our climate crisis and vice versa.  The D&aacute;il did not declare a transport crisis but it did declare a biodiversity crisis.  I am not being flippant but if the Government is now looking at biodiversity in the same way as transport we are in serious trouble and the environment is in serious trouble.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister and his advisors because we cannot silo these issues, we cannot separate them.  These issues must be recognised as intertwined, dependent on each other and not akin to an issue such as transport.  I ask the Minister of State to go back and have a discussion with the advisors just to ensure we are all on the same page.  My assumption was that the Minister was on the same page when it came to importance of including measures within this and addressing biodiversity in parallel and as part of climate action, so I ask that the Government do that.</p></speech>

I am grateful to you for your forbearance in allowing me to speak to the amendment.  My colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, received correspondence from you on 2 June where you expressed regret at the fact that amendment No. 97 is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill, could impose a charge on the revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Orders 187(1) and 212(3).  We put forward this amendment on the basis that we wished to support the Government's attempts to ensure there is a meaningful piece of legislation on climate action and low carbon development.  I merely wish, from a procedural point of view, to understand the logic of disallowing the amendment, which seeks a sectoral adaptation plan in respect of afforestation and targets therein, and similarly in respect of the remediation of bogs without impinging whatsoever on individuals' turbary rights, in the first instance.  I would hope that the Chairman or perhaps the Minister of State could help my understanding of the logic behind the decision to disallow the amendment in the first place.  That is merely what I wish to ascertain.</p> <p>  Second, and depending on the answer to that, I do not see how a sectoral adaptation plan in relation to afforestation which I would consider to be germane to the issue of climate action could be injurious to a Bill of this nature unless, of course, it is a matter of interpreting the Minister of State's position thus far, which is that "not ... everything ... needs to be stuffed into this Bill".  I would have thought that afforestation targets are absolutely germane to this legislation.  While we acknowledge the role of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in relation to her current afforestation travails, notwithstanding the challenges in relation to licensing, the Labour Party strongly feels there is an issue here that is absolutely germane to the issue of climate action.  I wish to seek a justification for ruling that amendment out of order.  Thank you, Chair, for allowing me to intercede.  I appreciate it.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 97 proposes a joint sectoral adaptation plan that includes annual targets to be achieved in the remediation of bogs that have been cleared, in whole or in part, of turf.  Achievement of these targets would require State expenditure.  The amendment is also outside the provisions of the Bill, which does not address specific sectoral targets.  The amendment must, therefore, be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 187.  The amendment also has the potential to impose a charge upon the revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 212(3).  I note the Deputy's points.  We will move on.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with the Deputy on what I think is an effort at a constructive contribution to the Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill, by its nature, in terms of what it seeks to do, could be argued to impose a charge on the revenue if you take some of those amendments that have been accepted.  I refer to the interpretation here.  I would love to have seen the advice of the Oireachtas officials in respect of this one.  I wish merely to argue that every action in here and within this legislation where amendments are accepted could arguably impose a charge on the revenue.  We find the decoupling of afforestation targets from this legislation to be extremely incongruous to the spirit of the legislation.  If the Minister of State could give me some response or some words of comfort regarding the effect of afforestation targets - this is a major issue now - I would gladly accept those comments.  Indeed, I would gladly accept any offer that the Minister of State might make for further engagement on the issue.  Chair, I thank you again for your patience.</p></speech>

There is a broader issue.  Deputy Sherlock is correct in relation to that.  I am not going to get involved on your ruling.  One of the sentences that you read out was that the Bill does not have a role in setting the sectoral targets.  Did I hear correctly?  Is that what you said?  This is the only time that the Oireachtas will be involved in terms of the sectoral targets.  We set out in legislation here the facilitation of the sectoral targets.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has no function in approving or ratifying sectoral targets after the enactment of this legislation.  I would be grateful if you would read out that sentence again because it seems to undermine what is here before us.  Once this legislation is enacted, the Oireachtas will have no role in adjudicating on those sectoral targets.</p></speech>

These should be 51% less than the annual emissions recorded for the end of the year 2018 and, therefore, will measure the total annual reduction at the end of 2030 relative to emissions recorded at the end of 2018.</p></speech>

It comes back to the issue of biogenic methane we discussed last week.  Again, I am not looking for agriculture to be given a free pass in this legislation but I am looking for a separate and distinct target for biogenic methane.  As I said last week, I am not referring to the issue of nitrous oxide but specifically to biogenic methane.  Substantial progress can be made in agriculture, particularly in terms of land use, which Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock spoke about earlier.  The reality is the first deadline for emissions reductions is now 233 weeks away.  The only way we can achieve significant reductions across the agricultural sector that will have a real impact in that period of time is through herd reduction.  At the weekend, we saw the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine point out that there will be a freeze on herd numbers in the dairy sector, which implicitly means there will be a reduction in the beef sector.  That would be of huge concern, particularly on marginal land where no other farming practice can manage that land and provide for the variation of biodiversity we spoke about this morning.</p> <p>  The issue of biogenic methane is clearly reflected in EU policy and in the contributions of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his predecessor Deputy Richard Bruton, last week.  It is enshrined in legislation in New Zealand, a country with a very similar climate profile to Ireland.  Insufficient recognition is being given to the issue of biogenic methane.  Perhaps the Minister of State can return to the issue of definitions in his response.  While reference is made to biogenic methane in the Bill, no specific definition is outlined.  As the Minister of State knows, the Climate Change Advisory Council explicitly stated there should be a very clear definition for biogenic methane and it should be accounted for separately in our emissions target.  The Climate Change Advisory Council goes on to state we should argue at EU level, and there is a valid argument, for a separate target for biogenic methane.</p> <p>  It is very hard to have an EU-wide target for biogenic methane when we are not prepared to differentiate it within our legislation.  People are not publicly admitting this but the reality is, whether we like it or not, and the Climate Change Advisory Council have stated this as well, at present no means are available at scale to reduce enteric methane emissions without reducing livestock numbers.  We need to be clear about that.  Otherwise, we need to ensure there is a separate individual target for biogenic methane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#G01700"><p>I thank Deputy Naughten for his amendment.  I will first address the definition question and how we will define the impact of biogenic methane in particular.  Previously, the Deputy referred to carbon leakage and, as I said, addressing such an issue requires international co-operation.  International co-operation is needed on definitions, metrics and measurements even before starting to reduce emissions.  That is why a common measurement is needed for all these things.  An agreed common measurement is needed on the impact of every greenhouse gas, including methane.  We will use the agreed definitions from the UN, EU and other relevant international bodies so we can work, co-operate and collaborate with other countries, which we have to do because we are sharing an atmosphere.</p> <p>  The question of whether biogenic methane will be treated differently, and have a separate budget and so on, will be examined.  It is the responsibility of the climate change advisory committee to consider the effect of each greenhouse gas.  The Bill provides for the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, when it proposes carbon budgets, to take account of the best scientific advice, including the special characteristics of biogenic methane, the most recent greenhouse gas inventory and projection reports, international best practice and the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals, so far as practicable.  The Bill also includes the need to maximise employment, the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long-term competitiveness of the economy having regard to the principle of climate justice.  That is the guidance to the CCAC.</p><p>In general, the agricultural sector is distinctly different from other sectors in that it has the possibility of negative emissions, carbon sinks, approaches that involve biodiversity or bog rewetting, or other activities.  It has the possibility of reducing, storing and sequestering emissions that other sectors do not have.  The answer in short is that I oppose the amendment on the basis that it is not required.  The CCAC will examine the special characteristics of biogenic methane and other greenhouse gases and what their separate impacts are.</p></speech>

There are targets set out in the Bill.  It will have a statutory target of 51% coming from the programme for Government.  There are also EU targets under which we have obligations.  They are split into two factors.  One is an emissions trading system, ETS, and the other is the effort sharing element.  Emissions trading is predominantly heavy industry and electricity and the rest involve the other sectors such as agriculture, transport and so on.  What I am trying to understand is how the 51% target, however it is decided by the climate council and approved by the Government, will gel with ongoing negotiations as to what our EU responsibility should be under the Fit for 55 target.  The EU will develop targets in a different way from the methodology we use to develop them.  Do we expect the EU's Fit for 55 package to be reconciled before the climate council sits down to do its work?  Will the climate council effectively decide our position for Europe and has that been accepted?  I want to understand that process because, as I understand it, there is a lot of toing and froing and there are moving parts.  It includes the topic which Deputy Naughten raised.  How do we get credit for the sequestration which is possible in the agriculture sector, but not currently counted in the inventory?  There are many moving parts, the reconciliation of which will make it either more difficult or easier for us to develop policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#H00500"><p>They are good questions.  This pattern is always a challenge: wanting to do something in one's own country while the EU is doing something on a general level.  How does one reconcile the two?  One option is to sit back and wait for the EU to do something and then try to row in with it.  We are quite far behind.  A previous Taoiseach described us as a climate laggard.  We do not have the luxury of sitting back and saying let us wait and see what comes out of Fit for 55 when it is due.  We have our own ambition which is a 51% reduction by 2030 and we must get on with it.  We are already at the back of the race and we need to catch up.  How will those things reconcile?  Deputy Ryan, who is not here because he has gone to Luxembourg to discuss this with the other environment ministers, will work out those details.</p> <p>  The ETS targets are likely to be tightened, Deputy Bruton is correct, in order to meet the Fit for 55 targets.  Many other environmental pieces of legislation are likely to come into force in all sectors, in addition to legislation that affects biodiversity and everything else.  There are likely to be targets to do with recycling and the circular economy.  This is likely to happen in the coming years and we cannot predict when the legislative changes will be made at EU level.  It is clear what is the strategic direction of travel.  It is to reduce emissions by a large amount and to protect the environment.  That is the direction this Bill goes in.  We may have to reconcile it with EU rules.  What we have here is very ambitious legislation.  If we implement it, we will be in a much stronger position to comply with any European high-ambition legislation that comes down the tracks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#H00600"><p>To pick up from where Deputy Bruton left off, I agree 100% with what he said.  I have a fundamental issue with this Bill.  I agree with the principle of the Bill but my fundamental difficultly is that we do not know how this will be measured, even though we are going to enact the legislation.  We set the target for 2030 but we do not know how that will be measured over that period.  Deputy Bruton is correct in terms of carbon sequestrations.  It is left out of the European inventory, which is greatly frustrating.  The Minister of State is correct, negotiations are ongoing at the moment which will decide how this will be reconciled.  We must be more ambitious, but we are setting targets in stone without knowing how we will measure them.  The CCAC has specifically highlighted this challenge.  Under the UN climate mechanism and the EU reporting structures, agricultural emissions are calculated separately from the removal of sequestration associated with land use.  The Minister of State put the point across well when he responded to me initially that the opportunity is there within agriculture to sequester carbon.  However, the difficulty is that none of us knows how that will be measured in an Irish context, in a European context, because it is not measured now, or in an international context.</p> <p>  On the one hand we are setting overall targets, but we do know what the rules will be to achieve those targets.  What I am trying to do with my amendments is to separate out that target for agriculture.  We must have a plus and minus.  The Minister of State is correct that agriculture is unique in that there is the plus and minus capacity within it.  There is no doubt, and all of us agree, that land use and land use change are fundamentally important in terms of where we will be in agriculture in 2030.  The progress made in transport and heating, or lack thereof, will have a direct impact on what we can and cannot do and how things will be counted in agriculture.  That is a fundamental weakness in this Bill.</p></speech>

Our Bill is about net emissions so credit will be given for sequestering carbon.  The legislation we make will have to, at some point, align with European legislation and achieve the same goals and we will be working to do that.  We will not wait for Europe to legislate first.  We will move ahead as quickly as we can, even if it takes all night.  We will keep going until we get this Bill passed and get our first carbon budget done this year so we can get working on this issue.  Agriculture has a unique position in Ireland.  I am glad to hear Deputy Naughten say there is opportunity here as well as danger and that this is not just a time for people to feel frightened.  It is time for agriculture to pivot and to become stronger and to see its role in protecting the environment and saving emissions as well.</p></speech>

Take, for instance, the farmers involved in forestry.</p><p>There is no such thing as a system of carbon credits for those farmers.  Take farmers who have existing hedgerows, groves or wooded areas that have traditionally been on their farms and which they are maintaining.  There is no carbon credit system whatsoever for those farmers.  The forestry industry is in a shambles at the moment because of the lack of felling licences, thinning licences and licences to make roads or to plant being issued.  There is such chaos in the industry.  There is a lack of confidence in the industry.  Now, when people do not see the Government coming along and producing a meaningful carbon credit system, surely they feel let down.</p></speech>

Regarding the Minister of State's amendment No. 107, a number of alternative formulas of words were put forward and, I think, ruled out of order.  I am not sure whether this has been considered or whether the Minister of State has a perspective on it.  I think the formula the Minister of State has come up with is a first-year-versus-last-year, 2018-versus-2030 one, with no reference to the 7% year on year referred to in the programme for Government.  Was that considered?</p> <p>  I have an open question about the reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  The discussion on that is welcome and important.  What does it mean in real terms?  Are the tools to be developed?  Is there a commitment on the part of the Government to develop those tools to make assessments separately?  What formulas will be used?  There is, I presume, deliberate reference to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane.  What does that mean in practical terms?  What can the Minister of State say to concerned people looking on today?</p></speech>

He is absolutely right.  This whole thing has to be about protecting farmers' incomes in order that we can bring farmers with us and that they have a role in this.  I was really heartened by the comments of the IFA recently when it said it is committed to making this work.  Yes, farmers have to get credit and we have to develop the mechanisms for them to get the credit over the coming years.  It is the job of the D&aacute;il, the Oireachtas and the Government to do that, so I absolutely agree with Deputy Healy-Rae.</p></speech>

It is fine for the Minister of State to say he agrees with me, but why not do something about it?  Why not make this a valuable, tangible asset such that carbon credits are attributed to farms that are helping our environment?  Rather than being down on our farmers all the time, why not encourage them, say they are doing something good and put a monetary value on what we call their carbon credits?</p></speech>

He asked about the different calculation formulas.  I think he was asking whether we are moving from 2018 to 2030 as the start year.  That is correct.  It is a 51% reduction.  I think the Deputy was asking whether or not that aligns with the 7% reduction every year.  What the programme for Government says is an average of 7%.  What has to be taken into account is that, in practice, emissions reductions are variable from one year to the next.  They can be variable because of factors like weather.  There can be a very cold or a very warm winter.  There can be a pandemic, as we have had in the past year.  There can therefore be asymmetric shocks to the system that lead to great variability in year-on-year emissions.  This Act is about looking towards 2050 and then looking at that period in smaller sections: five-year sections for the carbon budgets and ten-year sections for the 51% target for 2030.  What is important is that we reach the goals we have set for 2030 and the goal we set for 2050, not that 2027 will see a particular percentage reduction compared with 2026.  That is why we have looked at multi-year rather than single-year budgets.</p> <p>  Did Deputy O'Rourke have another point at the end of his contribution that I have missed?</p></speech>

Its obligation and duty is to take into account the best scientific advice it can find on this.  As I said, it does this in such a way that, in co-operation and collaboration with other countries, when we make transboundary agreements to do with things like carbon leakage they are actually workable; we have the same definitions from one country to the other as to what an emission is; we make sure that credit is applied when carbon is sequestered; and we look at net amounts and ensure that if CO2 is being saved in any sector, particularly agriculture, the people doing that get credit for it and not just for the emissions they emit.</p></speech>

The latter, as the committee will know, envisaged 1 million electric vehicles on the road, 500,000 homes being retrofitted, 600,000 electric heaters and so on.  We are now talking about a much more radical ambition and it would be quite unrealistic to think that that enhanced ambition could be delivered in year one.  The programme for Government was very clear that in the first five years we need to initiate a number of measures that will start to bear fruit only in the latter part of the decade and beyond.  I absolutely agree with the formulation the Minister of State has now set out.  We have to hit the 51% target by 2030, but it would be quite unrealistic to think we could deliver 7% each and every year.  Even last year, with all the disruption, 7% was, I think, barely achieved.  We are now embarking on a much more ambitious road but we need new policy measures to achieve this and they will not be delivered overnight.  I have seen letters suggesting that this Bill should enshrine 7% each and every year.  That is simply not practical.  It would not be practical for us as practising politicians.  I am not talking in party political terms.  None of us would not be able to agree that.</p> <p>  The other point I wish to take up is Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's point as to how we will measure emissions.  I know Deputy Healy-Rae would love to say all the existing hedges should see the farmer get a credit, but the reality is that we are in huge deficit on our climate commitments.  Therefore, if we are to give credit, it has to be to farmers who do new things to sequester.  There will not be credit for, if you like, the legacy element of what is going on on the farm.  It is new initiatives that we should seek to reward in order that if a farmer undertakes some initiative on his farm, which could involve dealing with and strengthening hedgerows and so on, that is what has to be rewarded.</p><p>We cannot, as a community, say we are going to pretend we are doing much better than we are and pay ourselves for things when we are already in deficit.</p><p> A point that is more for the Minister of State is that if one was to measure land use overall, Ireland would be in aggregate deficit.  Talking about net emissions will not cure this problem because in that regard we are minus 4 million tonnes on land use.   We need to start rewarding people who make changes in their land use rather than pretending they have to make changes to get that minus 4 million tonnes up to zero and only after that will we be in the business of awarding credits.  That is key to resolving the concerns expressed by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and getting a workable policy.  It is an area the Minister and Minister of State need to explore in terms of how we can find ways of rewarding new sequestration rather than people thinking they should get credit for something their father may have done 100 years ago.</p></speech>

It is not about the emissions that were emitted in the past.  I am not sure whether anybody was really suggesting it is.  It is, of course, about the actions one carries out in each year.  If one plants new trees in a hedgerow, that saves CO2, whereas if one burns a lot of fuel, one has emitted a lot of CO2 that year.  What one did in previous years will not be taken into account.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 125 provides that the second carbon budget would be formally presented to the Oireachtas.  As the legislation is currently drafted, the first carbon budget and the draft third carbon budget will be presented and the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to accept or reject those budgets.  If they are rejected, the Minister can, within 60 days, bring in whatever budget he or she likes.  That broader issue is one we have discussed already and to which we will return.  I am not going to deal with it now.  The issue here is that the second budget is not formally put before the Oireachtas other than in this legislation.  Some may argue that the Oireachtas is deciding on that now because it is deciding on this legislation.  That may well be the case.  I am sure it is the argument the Minister of State will put forward.  The point I am making is that it is not good parliamentary practice to introduce a budget, whether it is financial or otherwise, without having a formal ratification process by the Parliament.  Every year, the Minister for Finance must present his or her budget to the House for approval.  The national development plan must be presented for approval, as must the national planning framework.  However, the 2030 carbon budget will not be formally presented to the Oireachtas for approval.  I believe it should be so presented.  I will not dwell on the issue but it is good parliamentary practice for each budget to formally be presented, laid before the House and debated.</p></speech>

It would be a significant issue if the Houses of the Oireachtas were to reject a budget and that should mean something in what the budget contains.  Those two amendments which form part of this group of our amendments seek to address those issues.</p></speech>

It is setting in place a process by which we can achieve that.  There are checks and balances along the way as we decide how it is done.  We have our CCAC and we have Oireachtas committees where Ministers can be brought in for cross-examination on their actions.  The question raised by these amendments is whether the Houses of the Oireachtas should be allowed to stop the carbon budgets from going through.  The danger, if we allow this to happen, is that we will be entering into a recurring cycle of carbon budgets.  In other words, if a compromise and collective agreement can be reached on a budget by the Houses that is fine, but if these budgets keep being rejected then there is no reason that any carbon budget can then be put through and we are left in a situation where we have nothing to work with.  We have agreed what the emission reduction is going to be.  When the carbon budget is presented to the House, it has the opportunity to reject it and to ask for it to be reconsidered.  We cannot allow that to be an infinite power.</p> <p>  There is an idea underlying these amendments that this is undemocratic and this is simply untrue.  The process provides an opportunity for the Houses to provide input into the carbon budget in the first two-month period on the publication of the CCAC budget but also to vote on the budget as presented.  There is, therefore, plenty of time for debate.  I strongly disagree with the proposal and the Government should be the final approval authority but should then be held accountable by the Oireachtas for its approved budgets.  If we were to delegate approval to the House as a whole that would undercut the role of the Executive to the detriment of accountability.  Who is the Oireachtas going to cross-examine and hold accountable if it has made the decisions itself?  I am calling therefore for the amendment to be withdrawn. </p></speech>

The Minister of State is aware that the term Teachta D&aacute;la means messenger of the people.  The people send their Deputies to the D&aacute;il to do a job of work to represent them and their interests.  I have no problem whatsoever in democracy working to its fullest extent if a majority of Deputies on any day vote one way or another on any issue.  That is 100% okay, is beautiful and is democracy.  What the Minister has just said there is so undemocratic.  He is saying that we are putting this in place to bypass and minimise the amount of input that can be there from Deputies.  He wants to silence backbenchers of any party supporting the Government, to ensure that their hands will be tied so much that they will not know whether they are sitting on them handcuffed or where their hands are but they will certainly not be doing their job which is representing the people.  The Government has come along with this whole proposal, has wrapped it up and packaged it in such a way as to silence the future public representatives, whoever they are and from whatever party they belong.  This is so wrong and when the public realise what it is doing it will certainly not thank the Minister of State or his colleagues for doing it because it is fundamentally wrong and he cannot stand over it.</p></speech>

We have not heard this from anyone else to date.  The Minister of State states that there are checks and balances along the way.  There certainly is a mechanism where there is engagement with the Oireachtas which is already in place in the 2015 legislation which we all accept is inadequate.  The Minister of State is basically regurgitating the engagement with the Oireachtas of the 2015 legislation.  The approval and ratification process, however, is now being taken out of the hands of the national Parliament and put into the hands of the Government.  The Minister of State said in his response that the Government should be the final approval process.  I inform the Minister of State that no, it should not.  It should not be the final approval process as the national Parliament should have that role.  If we were to replicate what the Minister of State has just been arguing in regard to public finances, one would have the Minister for Finance in the first budget after an election cycle presenting all of the taxation measures for the next five years, the taxes that are going to be introduced and how they will apply to every individual across the country, without saying how the Minister is actually going to spend any of that money over the five years.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects that budget as it is presented by the Minister for Finance, then the Minister for Finance can bring in any taxation measure he or she wants within 60 days without any recourse to Parliament.  That is an unbelievable power that we are giving to any Minister or Government.</p> <p>  The sectoral target plans are even worse and there is at least some mechanism and a veil of a type of approval process here with this legislation on the carbon budget.  There are none in respect of the sectoral targets.</p> <p>  On the overall carbon budget, the Oireachtas has the choice.  It either accepts it or leaves that to the Minister of the day to bring in whatever budget he or she so wishes.  That is completely unacceptable in any democracy.  I gave an analogy on the Second Stage of this legislation.  The powers that we are giving here are far in excess of what should be given to any one individual or Government of the day.  Ultimately, we as Deputies are the ones who are accountable to the people.  Anyone who accepts this legislation as it is currently drafted is basically writing him or herself out of any formal or legal input into either the carbon budgets or the sectoral targets from here onwards.  That is fundamentally wrong and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this between now and Report Stage.</p> <p>  The Minister of State will agree that the vast majority of Members of the Oireachtas are in support of moving forward in a very positive way in achieving our overall climate targets, not just to 2030 but beyond that to 2050.  Let us say, however, down the road that we have a Minister and a Government who are not ambitious in this.</p><p>They can put forward very inadequate carbon budgets while taking cognisance of what the CCAC says.  They can listen to what the committee says but, ultimately, they can set very minimal targets.  The Parliament elected by the people has no function.  If it rejects that budget because it believes it is insufficient to meet our global and domestic challenges, the Minister of the day can bring in whatever budget he or she wishes, which is unacceptable.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this amendment.</p></speech>

It is really important that the Minister of State hears the concerns being outlined here.  This legislation does two big things.  It sets ambitious interim targets and 2050 targets and sets out a framework for making a plan to achieve those targets.  For me, the framework is about whose voices are heard, who has a place at the table and the level of transparency and accountability.  The Minister of State's input will not provide assurance to people who are looking on and are concerned about their input into this process through their public representatives and outside of that.  That in itself will raise further concerns in respect of those people who for whatever motivation want to undermine the climate effort.  The Minister of State should look at the piece relating to just transition.  We had that argument yesterday and may have it again but this piece relating to democratic accountability is important because we are talking about a situation that is unlikely to arise in the first instance no more than in the case of the annual budget in October because we have parties and the Whip system.  This is all the more reason to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas a say in this rather than just the Government.  I made the point in terms of coming back with unrevised proposals or, as Deputy Naughten said, proposals that are completely revised to the extent that they look nothing like the first revision in any way.  It is an issue that needs to be heard and addressed here between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

As legislators, we decide the line that is drawn between what is an Executive action and what is an action for the Oireachtas and this is part of what is happening in respect of drawing up this Bill.  What this Bill does is set a very clear target.  As Deputy Naughten said, the 2015 Act was inadequate.  This is trying to address that.  I welcome the fact that we are all trying to achieve the same thing here.  By setting that target, that is the strategy and objective that must be achieved.  What then happens is that the Executive is the operational body that must carry out the actions to achieve that target.  It is not for the Oireachtas at that point to intervene in the Executive actions.  There is a reason why we have an Executive and a reason why we have a Legislature.  They are two different bodies and they each have different functions.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughten referred to a hypothetical future where a Minister arrives who has a very low degree of ambition and either brings along a carbon budget that will not achieve anything or is opposed to the whole idea of climate action.  What would happen in that case?  How could the Oireachtas stop that Minister?  That is what this law does.  That is what this Bill is doing.  It brings in a requirement for the Government to comply with international obligations and meet that 51% target.  It is justiciable.  It is something in respect of which one can go to court if the Government is not meeting the obligations it is required to meet under the Bill.  Those are the two levers.  In fact, we are more strengthened in our position than we would be.  Of course, it is always open to a future D&aacute;il to amend or repeal the legislation because at the end of the day, the Oireachtas is the body that makes those decisions but the Executive must be allowed to perform the actions once the targets have been set and for once, we are setting targets in this legislation.  There is a reduction target of 51%.  Every five years, a carbon budget will be set.  It is a long-term process so it is not like an annual financial budget where we look at how much money will be spent in a few months time.  This is a long-term objective involving a five-year carbon budget, a ten-year target to reach 2030 and the longer-term target to reach 2050.  I feel it has the right balance between the powers of the Executive and the powers of the Oireachtas and it does mean that the Government must perform the actions it is duly bound to perform by this legislation.</p></speech>

I do not dispute that point with the Minister of State at all.  Setting an overall budget on a five-yearly basis in respect of our overall carbon emissions and setting sectoral targets, however, are not operational actions and cannot be considered as such.  Such matters should be ratified and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Under no circumstances should a gun be placed to the heads of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the effect that if they do not ratify these proposals, the power will then be handed over directly to the Minister of day to set whatever targets he or she wishes.  If the initial proposals are rejected by the D&aacute;il, it should still be necessary for any new proposals to come back to and be approved by the House.  This is the democratically elected Parliament of the country and there is no getting away from that fact.</p> <p>  The Minister of State's defence is to say it would be possible to go to court and force the Government to do something.  However, the Judiciary and the Legislature are two very separate and distinct arms of constitutional authority in Ireland.  Therefore, for the Government and the Minister of State to be saying that if people are not happy with this situation they should toddle off to the steps of the Four Courts is not good enough.  The people who are accountable in this regard are the 160 Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la elected in all the constituencies in the country.  The Government should be able to justify and explain why it is taking an approach and that approach should have to be approved by the majority of the elected Members of Parliament.</p> <p>  We have said all along that we can only achieve our targets for 2030 or 2050 by bringing people along with us on the road.  Some people pay lip service to this point, but I firmly believe in it.  To legislate the D&aacute;il out of existence in respect of approving or rejecting the overall budgets and sectoral targets will undermine that principle.  This is one principle I am not prepared to bend on.  I believe that a fundamental aspect of this legislation should be that the D&aacute;il is the body that approves the five-year budget.  During the last D&aacute;il, colleagues of the Minister of State made the argument that the planning framework and national development plan, NDP, should be approved by the D&aacute;il and that these matters should not just be left to the Executive.  The objectives of the planning framework and the NDP must at least come before the D&aacute;il annually and go through the budget process in the form of the vote on the budget itself and then consideration of the Estimates for each Government Department.</p> <p>  These sectoral targets, however, are not going to be ratified by the parliamentary committees and will not be presented to the D&aacute;il for ratification in any form whatsoever.  The only function and role we will have as parliamentarians will be to accept a proposal once every five years or hand the power back to the Minister concerned.  I do not believe that is good enough.  It is wrong, bad for democracy and bad for our overall aim of bringing people along with us on this climate journey.</p></speech>

Before I return to the Minister of State, Deputy Bruton had indicated before we suspended.  Does he wish to contribute now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#Q01100"><p>Yes, please.  I fell off the call there.  I do not know what happened.  I only caught the end of Deputy Naughten's contribution.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from, but throughout the hearings we have had on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 we have been told to listen to the science.  We have also repeatedly heard all parties telling the Government that it needs to have a tighter legal framework which puts more legal obligations on Ministers to ensure they are accountable for delivery in their sectors.  These are solemn international treaties that we have signed up to and we must deliver on our obligations in that regard.</p><p>There has been a desire from most of the Opposition to have legislation that can be litigated.  However, the Oireachtas cannot be brought to court for failures.</p><p> There is something of a dilemma here.  If people want legislation which honours a treaty that the Government has entered into, want us to listen to the science as determined by the CCAC and want a tight framework according to which Ministers must be held to account by the Oireachtas and the wider public for the delivery on this global challenge, there is then a dilemma if we are going say that we want to have the opportunity to decide to reject the climate budget that is determined by the science and want a different approach to be taken.  I can see the argument that Deputy Naughten and others are making.  However, some of the very same people who are making that argument here today were strenuously making the opposite argument that we need to listen to the science and nail down Ministers because Governments are recalcitrant and will always fail, and we need to create a very tight legal framework for them.  If we then say, with one leap, our hero is free, because the Oireachtas can reject it, the whole thing goes up in smoke.</p><p> There is a dilemma for the committee members here.  I have had some doubts myself about creating these legal straitjackets.  We are politicians and must be given a bit of freedom, but most of the contributions we have heard have been in favour of making that straitjacket tighter and the obligations greater.  That has been a theme that has been coming across in contributions made by Opposition members in committee as we have considered this Bill.  It is again reflected here.  There is a scepticism of Government.  It could be argued that the Oireachtas may decide that the science will not apply after all.</p><p> While I can understand the arguments that Deputy Naughten and others are making, there is a line.  The Oireachtas is responsible for making laws.  That is the responsibility of the Oireachtas and we have to decide "Yay" or "Nay" on this.  However, it is not repugnant for us to decide that these treaties are so important that when we enter into them, and when the science pronounces on how we should proceed, that he Government has an obligation to push on with that and it is our job, as Members of the Oireachtas, to hold it to account for its work.</p><p> We need to give serious consideration to what the Minister of State is saying.  Most of the arguments that I have listened to over the last six months have come from a very different perspective.  The arguments are for more tight controls and a tighter straitjacket on Government to show that it will honour the commitments that were made in Paris.  That has been a strong theme.  If we believe that, the Minister of State's arguments deserve to be listened to.</p></speech>

Of course, it is possible to appeal it or amend it.  The Oireachtas always retains that power.  The D&aacute;il can reject the carbon budget if the Members do not like it.  There is going to be public consultation not just on the climate action plan, but also on the carbon budgets.  The legislation also provides not just for a public consultation, but for an ongoing regular engagement and dialogue on the climate actions that are contained in the climate action plan.  The Ministers will be accountable to the committees to ensure that they are doing what they are supposed to do and all of this has been designed and engineered, as Deputy Bruton stated, to be justiciable.</p> <p>  There are many levels and safeguards there.  Overall, the basic proposition is that we are setting an emission reductions target for 2030 and that the Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad have to decide between them whether this a target that we want to achieve, this is our ambition on a large scale and this is our strategy.  If this is a strategy that we want to achieve, the Executive should be permitted to come up with an action plan that allows that objective to be met.  It must be ensured that the action plan is acceptable to the public, that it brings people with it and there is real engagement.  It cannot work without people believing and knowing that it is a fair plan, they are being listened to, the plan makes sense and everyone has been included.</p> <p>  That is our goal.  I do not think that it would help to remove the power of the Executive to implement it or to move that to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas is getting the power now to decide if it wants that 51% reduction and if it wants to reach that 2050 net zero target.</p></speech>

I will bring in Deputies Naughten and O'Rourke, but I ask that perhaps they could be succinct.  I ask that the points they make are new ones and that they avoid repetition.  We will do our best to move on after that.  I call on Deputy Naughten.</p></speech>

This legislation does provide for that.  I am not disputing that.  At the outset, I stated that this is important legislation.  I do not disagree with the principle of it.  However, science is not black and white.  Evidence changes.  If we were take the phrase "Climate Change Advisory Council" out of this debate and replace it with "the National Public Health Emergency Team", it would be different.  There is a very different view around the Houses of the Oireachtas today in respect of the black and white advice that has been given by NPHET over the last 12 months.  Yet, we are now enshrining in law a particular perspective on scientific advice that will be set in stone between now and 2050.  The only option that the Members of Parliament have is to accept what is presented by the Minister.  If they do not accept what is presented by the Minister, the Minister has a blank cheque to bring in whatever targets he or she wishes, which may have no bearing on the contents of the original proposal.</p> <p>  Yes, we do need to listen to the science, but ultimately we are the ones who are accountable to the people.  We have to explain and defend why we are taking an approach, just as every single one of the 160 Deputies who voted in the D&aacute;il last week on the extension of the emergency health provisions, had to.  Every one of us was held accountable to our constituents across the country in respect of why we took a particular approach in relation to that matter.  However, if this legislation is enacted as it is currently drafted, that mechanism is no longer available to the electorate.  I think that is wrong.</p> <p>  It is a fundamental difference in approach from that of the Minister of State and Deputy Bruton.  I know the views of members of the committee and the view that I have.  I think that it is a wrong approach to legislate the D&aacute;il out of existence in relation to this issue.  That is my final word on the matter.</p></speech>

There are already huge provisions in the Bill that acknowledge the range of perspectives and voices that have to be heard.  This is built into it.  What is very important is the process by which we come to agree the budgets and various elements of the plan, whose voices are heard and how we make these decisions.  What we are speaking about here is how we agree the budgets, the strategies and the role of the Oireachtas with regard to it.  After this, it is entirely appropriate that there is leave to use the courts to ensure these roads are being followed and the plans are being implemented.  I do not accept that we should write the Oireachtas out of this piece in terms of its role for oversight, scrutiny and approval.  The Government's approach is completely unnecessary because there will be very limited circumstances and the situation might never arise.  I do not believe it should be there in the first place.</p></speech>

In the same way NPHET is not sovereign, neither does the CCAC have a divine authority.  The Government will have the final say.  It is an advisory group that gives its advice, using the best economic and scientific knowledge it has, to the Government and the Government then takes it on board.  Obviously, the two bodies are not exactly the same, and NPHET is dealing with very new and emerging science.  It looks at papers published last week on a disease that emerged last year.  Climate science is more mature than this so the CCAC is not in quite the same short timeframes.  Covid is an emergency and there is an urgency to it.  It is a valid comparison but we cannot say the CCAC will have some kind of great authority over the Government.  It is the other way around.  It is an advisory group.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 165 is related.  I know it is not grouped with the other amendments.  I will withdraw amendment No. 165.  I will speak to the whole lot together.</p> <p>  This comes back to the argument we had earlier about carbon budgets.  While there may be some justification for the Minister of State's argument on the carbon budgets, I believe it is fundamentally wrong that we have no approval process whatsoever for the sectoral emissions ceilings that are going to be set for each part of government in each Department.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the principle of sectoral emissions ceilings.  I fully understand the reason for it, which comes back to the point of principle that Ministers need to be held accountable.  As someone who was in the role prior to the current Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, I know how frustrating it was when I did not have the leverage available to me that is provided for in this legislation.  I do not disagree with the principle of what is being set out in the legislation; where I disagree fundamentally is that these should be presented just like an Estimates process is presented to the sectoral committee for approval.  It comes back to the fundamental point I made at the outset, that it is going to be a significant challenge to reach a 51% reduction in heating and transport.  In fairness, the members of this committee have made that admission already.  The committee introduced a very worthwhile document last week on transport emissions, but only set out to reduce them by 51%.  If we set out a 51% reduction in transport, and a similar reduction in heating, which would be monumental achievements if we could achieve them by 2030, then that would put a massive challenge on to agriculture where it is much harder to make change and where the technology in that regard does not yet exist.  We must be honest: realistically, the only way that can be achieved is through substantial reductions in herd numbers.</p> <p>  Regardless of where the end result is, those sectoral targets should be presented to the D&aacute;il for approval via the sectoral committees.  The Minister for Transport should come before the transport committee and say what the target is, whether it is 51% or 70% up to 2030, and outline how he or she intends to get to that.  Naturally enough, that will have to chop and change as technology develops and as the returns come back in terms of the emissions profile.  That can be reviewed on an ongoing basis, but the overall target should be approved by the sectoral transport committee.  The same should happen for heating targets with the energy committee or the climate committee and for agriculture targets with the agriculture committee.  The Minister of the day should come in and explain the logic and reasoning for the targets and how he or she expects to achieve them.  This cannot be done without recourse to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  The amendments I have tabled are very simple.  They ensure there would have to be an approval process whereby D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann must approve the sectoral emissions ceilings across the board, just like the current Estimates process for finances.  Our emissions ceilings will have a far greater impact than even the Estimates process, yet there is no ratification process envisaged for them.  There will be consultation and discussions with the sectoral committees, advice will be sought from the CCAC and there will be engagement with the public on this, but ultimately it should be down to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to agree the objectives.</p> <p>  It is not just to tie the Minister of the day into that process, but it is also important to tie in subsequent Ministers.  Deputy Bruton knows that I argued very strongly in the committee for the establishment of Sl&aacute;intecare because the difficulty was that when a new Minister sat down on his or her rear end in the Department of Health, he or she could have a new policy approach to deliver across the health service with no buy-in across the political spectrum for it.  Thankfully, we now have Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need the same type of political buy-in regardless of who the Minister of the day is, but that can only happen with a ratification process that incorporates D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this series of amendments.</p></speech>

I appreciate and acknowledge his experience as a Minister and also his interest in this sector.  I remember his efforts to tackle issues like air pollution and so on in the past.</p> <p>  The sectoral targets will be decided by the Government, but that will not happen in a vacuum.  It will have to comply with section 4 of the legislation, which sets out a long list of criteria that have to be complied with.  The process is highly technical.  It will be a complex undertaking to make a legal sectoral division because of the need to satisfy the many criteria listed, including the overarching one of international agreements, but also climate justice, biodiversity and best scientific knowledge, among others.  It will be more expensive to get emissions reductions in some sectors than others.  There will be requirements to reduce at a certain rate in some sectors based on European directives and on international agreements.  It is not the case that we could just decide to move some emissions from one sector to another.  I am not suggesting anybody would do so.  It is not an opportunity to play politics and to decide it would be nicer to have some of these emissions moving to transport or agriculture.  It is a highly technical exercise and it must comply with all the criteria.  What the legislation is doing is setting out the way that the sectoral budget is made.  It is setting out what all the rules are to make a sectoral budget and it is up to the Oireachtas now to decide what those rules are going to be and what it wants to put in or to take out.  If we moved towards the Oireachtas agreeing sectoral budgets, we would have a bureaucratic overhead.  It would slow the process and, worst of all, we would be in danger of coming up with an answer that was either illegal or not in line with our international agreements, or that did not fulfil the many objectives we are trying to include in section 4, which many Deputies have referred to in previous amendments.</p><p>I know the Deputy has good intentions in this regard and I can see where he is coming from but I believe that this amendment should be refused.</p></speech>

I accept the point the Minister of State has made about section 4 but those measures are not legally binding.  The same thing is in place for rural-proofing and it is very much a box-ticking exercise.  I know how this process works and I accept the principle of what the Minister of State is talking about.  The reality is that this will be little more than a box-ticking exercise.  He is right that the cost of taking measures in some areas is going to be significant and there is no doubt about that.  There are considerable financial implications to those decisions.  My fundamental problem is that the cheapest way to reduce emissions in Ireland is to reduce the size of the herd.  That is by far the cheapest way to do it and there is no doubt about that.  It is hugely challenging because of the types of targets this committee has set out, including a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030.  The same applies to heating.  There will be significant costs for the public and the Exchequer in implementing those targets.  That is the reason it is important that a fair and transparent set of sectoral targets is put in place and that it is not only about the bottom line and the ultimate price.  The fundamental problem with our approach up to now, sadly, is that it has been all about being penny wise and pound poor.  That is what has led us into the situation we are in now.  We should take strategic decisions which make perfect economic sense in the long term from a societal and budgetary point of view but cost a significant amount in the short term.  I ask the Minister of State before Report Stage to look again at these particular mechanisms and the lack of any ratification process for the sectoral emissions ceilings.  It is wrong that the D&aacute;il is legislated out of this process and that is the fundamental flaw with this Bill.</p></speech>

I am thinking carefully about everything he has said.  The sectoral division is not going to be on the basis of cost alone.  That is what section 4 is about.  There are many factors aside from cost in politics, as the Deputy knows.  We must accord with people's values and there are other things that are harder to price.  It is certainly not going to be decided on the basis of cost alone.  That is why we consider all those other factors.  The Deputy has said that he feels it will be a box-ticking exercise and I do not agree with that at all.  It is only box-ticking if one has no interest in things such as complying with international rules, biodiversity protection and so on.  If the Government and the Oireachtas believe in those things and hold them as important values, it is not box-ticking.  Those are important criteria and cost will not be the sole deciding factor.</p></speech>

The very same approach was taken to rural-proofing and it became a box-ticking exercise.  Only after the policy was developed and before the memo was presented to the Cabinet it was rural-proofed, rather than at the concept stage.  I have had plenty of experience of dealing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I was involved in the specific negotiations about which we are talking with regard to the sectoral challenges that exist.  I know the thinking and the logic that is put on the area.  A cost and a price tag are put on absolutely everything.  That is why it is important that the D&aacute;il would legislate in a manner that brings about a fair and just transition across our society and not have one sector carrying the burden in the short term for other sectors.  We should not be left in a position whereby down the road we realise that we made a fundamental mistake.  I will not dwell on those issues any longer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#U00500"><p>This is an important debate, on one level, although we are not going to resolve it here.  Deputy Naughten is pointing up a serious issue that is going to arise.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in its Ag Climatise policy, is envisaging a mitigation of 15% in the agricultural sector.  If agriculture accounts for 15% of an overall 51% reduction, that means a 70% reduction is required in transport and building.  That is probably beyond our reach.</p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said that if one was looking only at cost, one would say that herd reduction is the cheapest way to achieve reductions.  We are going to have to find difficult ways to deal with the very high costs.  To offer context, in the 2019 climate plan in which I was involved, we included marginal abatement costs in the transport and building sectors that cost over &euro;250 per tonne in order to go from a 40% or 45% reduction to a 70% reduction.  Those costs would soar.  I can see why Deputy Naughten is thinking that this will not happen and that the requirement to reduce emissions will fall back on the agriculture sector.  </p> <p>  On the other hand, the issue for agriculture is to look at how it can abate carbon.  If in other sectors such as building and transport, we are envisaging paying, say, &euro;500 a tonne for carbon abatement, can agriculture start to be farmers of carbon as well as producers of food?  I do not agree with Deputy Naughten that we can simply say the agricultural committee should decide that because the transport lobbies will then come before the transport committee, the agricultural lobbies will come before the agricultural committee and we will not move forward.  However, we need to find a way in which the potential losers as a result of transport abatements running at &euro;500 or &euro;600 per tonne can compensate people who could manage carbon, either through sequestration, carrying fewer cattle per acre, draining lands, wetting lands or the many things we know are out there.  We need to find ways in which those policy tools can be evolved.  There is a little bit of a vacuum in how those policy tools are going to be evolved.  We are all in favour of dialogue and we will have that dialogue but we need to have an intense discussion about how those policy tools are going to be evolved.  That has not happened to date.  There is no doubt that if the climate council is expected to meet the target of 51% reductions, it will face the dilemma that if agriculture is targeting 15% reductions, transport must target reductions of 70%.  The council will have to consider whether that can be done.  We will have an intense debate before the autumn, whenever this legislation comes back, and I do not think we have thought through at a political level how this is to be resolved.  </p> <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Naughten that the way to resolve it is to stick agriculture into the agricultural committee, transport into the transport committee and wait to see what comes out the other end.  I do not think that would achieve the obligations on which we all know we have to deliver.  Finding a way of working our way towards policy tools is the challenge for us, as politicians.  Deputy Naughten has enormous experience and we need to listen to people like him because they can help us to evolve these policy responses.  This is a genuine issue and we must find a common language to discuss it.</p><p>The risk, signs of which can be seen already, is that sectors will talk their own language and mount their own defences around the ramparts of their sectors.  For example, the transport sector is saying  we cannot ban combustion engines from 2030 and that it would be heresy but if we are to extend the ambition beyond what is in the existing plan, that seems like a no brainer to me.  It must happen along with other things outlined by the committee in its report this week.  I do not think Deputy Naughten's proposal to put it into sectoral committees will achieve the cross-silo debate we need.  </p></speech>

The point I am trying to make and the point of my amendments, and I do not make specific reference to sectoral committees, is that the Oireachtas must deal with and decide on this.  I am not hung up on it.  It could be the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action or some other committee that would deal with it and engage directly with the Minister.  My point is that the Oireachtas must have a role in deciding those sectoral ceilings.  I am quite open-minded regarding the vehicle for doing it.  I am arguing for the principle.  I thank the Deputy for his support in respect of that.</p></speech>

If it is not 100% correct in terms of technicalities, I ask him and the Department to look to reflect its intent in the Bill somewhere.  Essentially, the amendment puts a net zero target on the electricity sector for 2030.  When we are talking about a finite or polluting resource, the first principle is not to use it.  When we are talking about transport, we have the avoid principle and when we are talking about waste, we have the reduce principle.  However, when it comes to energy, there does not seem to be a similar principle on which we focus with this Bill or even from a policy perspective across Government.  There is no significant focus on demand management or trying to keep our energy usage emissions down.  In fact, we are seeing the opposite.  We are seeing two arms of the Government pulling against each other when it comes to this.  I am talking about data centres and electric vehicles.  Both are seen to be one of the highest users of electricity and the key drivers of increases in electricity usage over the next ten years.  I do not know whether the Minister of State noticed an article by Caroline O'Doherty in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today stating that EirGrid has said there are so many new applications from data centres looking for electricity connections that to power them would be the equivalent of 70% of our national usage.  This is an incredible statistic at a time when we are here debating how we are going to get our emissions down.  The projected electricity consumption by 2030 based on the current connection agreements is 33%, so 33% of our electricity usage will be from data centre usage.  It would be remiss of us to not look at this exponential growth in electricity usage from data centres.  </p><p>I know the Government has a target of 70% renewables for electricity by 2030 but I am putting in 100% because we need to cap it.  We need to say we are going to drive down our electricity usage until we are in a position to ensure that 100% of that can come from renewable resources.  We are not there yet.  I am staggered by the statistics in the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today.  A total of 70% of electricity usage could come from data centres.  I heard yesterday that one third of global data will be housed in Irish data centres so this is a runaway horse over which we have no control.  It does not seem as though we are taking it into consideration in the climate Bill.  I do not know whether there is real active and continued analysis by Government of the implications of having these data centres.  When I raised it at a meeting of the committee a couple of weeks ago, the comments were that there are economic benefits from it and data centres have storage capacity and may be able to play a role in storage of energy and slow release or off-peak release of it.  That is all well and good but it is not set in stone at the moment and until we have finalised our attitude to and policy on data centres, we need to say that 100% of our electricity needs to come from renewable sources.  I believe it is a target we can meet.  </p><p>We talk about all these other areas such as transport, which will be difficult.  The committee heard that having one million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is a very difficult target to meet.  It will be difficult to get that cultural shift into our agriculture and land usage to address carbon usage.  When it comes to electricity, it is an easy target we could meet as long as we start controlling some of the usages of electricity such as data centres and start introducing demand management measures to deal with that.  We are going to tell people we expect them to buy electric vehicles and that, from 2030, we are going to ban anything other than electric vehicles so they will have to go and buy them.  It is a big investment for people.  They are going to buy those vehicles and the energy they use with them could still create emissions so, again, there is very little policy alignment coming from the Government on this issue.  </p><p>We had a lot of discussion about just transition and I made the point repeatedly that we cannot have a very narrow focus when we are talking about just transition; we need a broad focus.  This is what I am talking about.  As a nation, are we going to put the onus on individuals and individual households, who may not have the finance or capacity to own electric vehicles?  Are we going to tell them that those are the things we expect them to do and, at the same time, tell big corporations and data centres they can create and use up as much energy as they want and we will not control what they are doing?This would be unfair and would go against the principles of just transition, which is why I wanted that definition in the Bill.  It is important that it is in the Bill because we are already seeing how the Government is prioritising big players.</p><p>A business-as-usual approach will be taken with the big corporations while the barriers and onus are put on individuals.  That is a-----</p></speech>

If the policy is built on that, we would be sending the Minister on a task I doubt he could deliver.  Also, there is something of a misconception here.  Our commitment under the Paris Agreement is as a member of the European Union.  The European Union introduced an emissions trading system whose purpose is to try to locate certain larger activities in the most climate efficient locations.  Data centres may be more climate efficient if managed in Ireland rather than in other countries.  If the EU needs data centres, the best approach for the EU to take is to run them in the most climate efficient way.  That is what the emissions trading system seeks to do.  In addition, they do pay carbon tax.  This is not some free ride for the business sector trampling on other people.  They pay.  Indeed, the carbon price within the emissions trading system is substantially higher than the carbon price we pay elsewhere.</p> <p>  Neither do I accept the suggestion that envisaging electric vehicles on our roads is, in some way, the Government having a misaligned policy.  The reality is that people need certain transport services.  Not all of them can be switched to public transport.  It is far better for the substantial number of journeys that cannot be substituted by public transport or by active travel that they be done with electric vehicles.  Of course, if some of that power is generated from non-renewable sources, that will have emissions, but they will be dramatically lower than if we are fuelling vehicles with petrol or diesel.  As we succeed in switching to renewable sources of power, we will be able to deliver transport services to everyone in a way that avoids an impact on the climate.</p> <p>  Many of the assumptions behind this amendment do not stand up to close scrutiny.  There is no choice between companies and not touching our lifestyle.  If we want to engage in travel and in all sorts of things, we must find ways of avoiding damaging emissions from them.  That is what all this endeavour is about.  In the long term, if we can get the electricity sector to be wholly renewable or supplemented by interconnection that is also from either nuclear or non-emitting sources, we can still deliver those transport services without impact on the environment.  Many of the assumptions that have been put forward by Deputy Whitmore are not beyond challenge.  We all have to change our lifestyles, not just big companies.  I have heard others articulate this, that 70% of emissions come from big corporates and everything would be resolved if we did not do that.  That is like saying an oil company that puts fuel into every car we drive is responsible for all those emissions.  That is not the reality.  They only exist because they are delivering a service that people want to have.  People want to be able to move around.</p> <p>  There are many assumptions in the amendment that do not stand up to scrutiny.  I do not believe net zero by 2030 is an achievable target to ask the Minister to report on.  The objective at present is minus 43%, and we will be required to make big changes to reach 70% renewables on the system.  I do not believe we should table amendments that are beyond the capacity of the Minister to deliver.</p></speech>

He is right in that regard, but the difficulty is that in agriculture we are quite happy to have the emissions levied on the farmer who produces the beef or milk, not where it is actually consumed.  This is the argument I have been making all along.  The system is perverse and has built in structures that benefit big industry rather than the type of economy we have in Ireland.  That is why Ireland must take a very different approach from that being taken in continental Europe, but we are not doing that.</p><p>Returning to the point raised by Deputy Whitmore, a fundamental point here is the number of data centres coming to this country.  There are two types of data centres.  I am not against data centres<i>per se</i>.  If they are strategically located in particular locations across the country, they can be of great benefit.  However, we should be discussing data centres that are directly connected with employment in this country, not speculative data centres.  Quite a number of the data centres in the planning process are speculative data centres.  We should not be facilitating those.  Second, we should not facilitate any data centres in the Dublin region, despite the determination of the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, to do that, because our electricity grid just cannot take them.  The cost of facilitating more data centres in the Dublin region will be astronomical in terms of the investment that will have to be made in the electricity grid, and communities across the country will have to cater for the additional pylons that will have to be brought into the Dublin region.</p><p>We are going to try to achieve 70% renewable electricity on the network by 2030, which is a very difficult challenge at this point in time.  However, it is one I believe we potentially can achieve, but continuing to load more data centres onto the system makes it an unachievable target.  What is morally wrong here is not only that aspect but also the fact that we are asking families across the country, through their electricity bill, to fund and subsidise the cost of that.  It is wrong that we should ask families, through the public service obligation, PSO, levy and the transmission charges, to subsidise the cost of electricity going into data centres.  The Government took a decision in June 2018 not to apply those charges to domestic customers and other business customers, but that has not been implemented.  Deputy Whitmore is right.  There must be a far broader debate and we must be far more selective with regard to the type of data centres we want to come into this country.  The impression is given that it is climate efficient to bring them into Ireland because of our climate.</p><p>However, the reality is we are an isolated electricity grid in Ireland.  Sadly, we will need to have a fossil fuel backup for the foreseeable future, which undermines our overall climate objectives.</p></speech>

However, it subsequently appears to be a cross-sectoral measure so it is not sub-sectoral.  It applies to everything because everything that has electricity would be affected.  The amendment also says that if a sector switches towards electricity to save on emissions, that should not count towards its emissions savings.  I am confused by that.  Moving towards electricity in, for example transport and heating - it need not be electric vehicles, it might be electric trains, bikes or whatever - is an important tool.  It will be one element of trying to cut emissions.  I do not think it should count for nothing.  The EU, as some Deputies have mentioned, has agreed with us on a 70% use of renewable energy in electricity by 2030.  We have a target and I think the Deputy is proposing to change that to 100% net - whatever we interpret "net" to mean.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about demand.  I think she was making a comparison with recycling, avoidance and reuse and proposing we should look at the same thing in electricity, which is absolutely true.  The suppression of demand is an important factor, as well as switching people from one power source to another.  If one can avoid the task being carried out or suppress the demand for it in some way, that is also a measure.  We see that in the smart meter roll-out, which is an attempt to price electricity differently at different times of the days and set demand in that way.  With this Bill, the Deputy is open to taking actions like this through the climate action plan.  That mechanism will have public consultation and ongoing citizen engagement whereby a feature like this can be introduced.</p> <p>  The EU has energy efficiency targets for 2030 that we have signed up to in order to achieve a 32.5% reduction in energy use compared to what it would be without those measures.  That comes back to demand management.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about data centres.  It is a big debate.  We have many of them and are planning to have more.  We also plan to have large quantities of renewable energy.  It is not in the amendment but I think it is in later amendments today.  It might be better to talk about it at that stage or have a separate debate about it.  It is a large area and I would be happy to talk about it at another session but I oppose the amendment.</p></speech>

He said my arguments do not stand up to scrutiny.  The Government target is 70% renewable energy for the electricity sector by 2030.  Over 30% of the electricity we will be using in 2030 is for data centres.  It is feasible to set a 100% target for renewable energy.  When setting a target, one should set a target that one has to stretch to and is ambitious, rather than something one can roll over and do easily.  We need to look to achieve such a target.  We are all aware that the roll-out of renewable energy, in terms of wind farms, options, guidelines and terms of reference for those corporations is taking place slowly and, if this target was there, it would bring more of a focus and impetus to get this done.  It is a feasible target and one we should look to achieve.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton said there is a cross-EU policy on it and data centres are delivered in Ireland in a more climate-efficient way because we have a better climate for them.  Data centres do not just have an impact from a climate perspective.  They also have a visual and environmental impact.  I am a Deputy for Wicklow.  If all the wind farms proposed to deliver energy for these data centres are in existence in ten years time, we will be looking out at three large-scale wind farms off our coastline.  That will have an impact on communities in Wicklow.  I understand wind farms are an absolute necessity but I would rather we had those we need rather than providing them to enable data centres to undergo exponential growth to facilitate corporations across Europe.  We need to have that debate.  </p> <p>  Deputy Bruton referenced corporation tax, which is a completely separate issue.  I will be interested to know how our data centres are set regarding corporation tax.  I am not saying data centres get a free ride when it comes to things like carbon tax; I am saying there has not been the requisite level of Government scrutiny and forward planning when it comes to provision of data centres.  Here we are trying to set legislation to restrict our emissions while another part of government is saying that data centres can have a free ride from an energy usage perspective and it will facilitate as many centres as corporations see fit to invest in here in this country.</p> <p>  When I mentioned misaligned policy, I was not talking about the need for electric vehicles.  I understand they will play a large part in how we meet our transport targets.  I was saying that we expect people to put &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 into an electric vehicles to reduce their emissions and environmental impact.  However, if they use energy that does not come from renewable resources because we do not have the capacity to produce it as a result of the provision of increased electricity to data centres, that will undermine those individual efforts to do the right thing.  Most people in this country will want to play their part in meeting emission targets.  I think my arguments stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p>  The Minister of State questioned the technicalities of the amendment.  I agree.  I asked the Minister of State at the outset to take the intent.  The intent is there.  I ask the Minister of State to bring it back, scrutinise it and get the Bills Office or his legal advisers to look at it.  There needs to be a sub-sectoral cap on emissions from electricity.  We need a target of 100%.  Whatever the Government feels is the best mechanism to meet it, I ask that it review that.</p> <p>  The Minister of State said I did not specifically mention data centres.  I did not do that because we are looking at a framework document which should not look at one sector or energy user.  If I had mentioned data centres, it would have been ruled out of order.  I have no problem with data centres as long as the energy is renewable.  The Minister of State said there has been a big debate on data centres.  The problem is there has not been such a debate.  We need a big debate on it.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to bring that back and have a look at it.  I will raise it at Report Stage as well.  It is an important issue and, considering recent reports in the paper, it will become more prominent.  I hope this discussion does become more prominent in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

It provides for the alteration of carbon budgets.  One of those ways is carryover.  Obviously we are going to have a situation where either we exactly meet the carbon budget or our outturn is that we have over or underachieved, and the mechanism is there that the Minister must seek the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council before making a proposal to carry forward and expand a future budget.  Thus, if there has been underachievement, in other words, if the carbon budget has been exceeded and there have been more emissions than expected, then excess emissions will be automatically brought forward to the next budget, so the next carbon budget will be reduced accordingly.  We have framed this Bill to provide a suitable balance of flexibility and long-term stability to support necessary investment and implementation over time.  Three consecutive five-year carbon budgets budgets are set out every five years, with the third and later carbon budget of the series being set as a provisional budget.  This means it can be reviewed and revised as part of finalising the next group of three carbon budgets.  Therefore, while the Bill provides certainty on our long-term climate goal, a level of flexibility within these statutory structures is important and will allow, where necessary, a degree of adjustment and reorientation of carbon budgets, plans and strategies over time and within different sectors.  This reflects, as acknowledged in the programme for Government, that not all measures realise our climate ambition in Ireland or other countries.  This is also relevant when considering flexibility on how to address any over or underachievement towards our carbon budget ceilings and if we do not achieve our targets then emissions must be carried.  Incentivising and encouraging early action, when we know early action is more cost-effective, should be allowed and encouraged.</p> <p>  If one looks at section 6D and the different possibilities or different situations where a carbon budget can be revised, one can see it includes situations like where we have had an agreement with the European Union to change to a new emissions obligation or we have entered into some kind of international agreement with other countries.  It also allows for eventualities like where there has been a significant development in scientific knowledge on climate change.  Those are all foreseeable situations but what is not foreseeable is what could happen in those situations, so the idea is to provide a level of flexibility.  That is our position.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#AA02500"><p>Again, if Deputy Naughten looks at section 6D he will see the Minister or the Government are not empowered to just go and change the targets as they see fit.  It is really only within very specific circumstances that it can happen.  The situation we are in now is that Deputies are examining this legislation and asking are those reasonable situations where they would want the target to be changed or where they would want to allow the Government or the Minister to change the target.  If there are any sections in section 6D that Deputies think are unreasonable, or they think there are more which should be added, or if it should be more or less limited, then this is their chance to say it.  What we are not going to do is transfer the responsibility away from the Minister onto the Houses and say that now the Houses are accountable to themselves for what the carbon budgets are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#AA02600"><p>With all due respect to the Minister of State, I can say whatever I like; the reality is that no amendment has been accepted to date by Government.  The Minister made it clear at the outset he would not be accepting amendments.  It is therefore disingenuous to suggest I would put forward an amendment when it has been made crystal clear the Government is not prepared to accept any amendments from the Opposition.  The point I am making here is very simple: if the D&aacute;il approves a carbon budget, then the alterations to that carbon budget should also have to come before the D&aacute;il for approval.  It is a very basic principle.  It reinforces the point I made earlier that effectively the D&aacute;il is only being used as a rubber stamp.</p><p>If the D&aacute;il rejects the carbon budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he likes.  Even if the D&aacute;il accepts the carbon budget, the Minister can make amendments without reverting to the House.  Again, one of the key provisions in last week's health legislation, and the reason the Government was forced to come back before the D&aacute;il, was my insistence that a sunset clause be put into it.  However, with this Bill, once the first carbon budget is ratified by the D&aacute;il, it does not have a role in approving the second.  Subsequent to the enactment of this legislation, the Minister does not have to consult the D&aacute;il, legally, regarding any alterations to both budgets.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

That is worthy of mention in the context of the discussion that has gone on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#BB00300"><p>Everyone on the committee knows there was quite a lot of discussion about whether those amendments were accepted fully or in part.  We should not go back down that road and say it was a wholesale acceptance by the Government when in reality it was not.  In many instances the amendments were only partially accepted.  I wanted to make that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#BB00400"><p>On that last point, section 6D was comprehensively revised following pre-legislative scrutiny.  That pre-legislative scrutiny stage was very useful.  It certainly was not, as Deputy Naughten would say, a box-ticking exercise.  It actually strengthened the legislation a lot.  I am grateful to all the Deputies for their contributions in that regard.</p> <p>  I would like to come back to Deputy Naughten's suggestion that when the carbon budget is adopted by the D&aacute;il, that will be it and Deputies will never get to speak again.  In fact, three carbon budgets will be adopted.  Five years later, there will be another chance to look at the carbon budgets and decide where they go from there.  Deputy Naughten also stated that if the carbon budget is rejected by the D&aacute;il the Minister can then just go off and make up any carbon budget he or she wants.  Ministers are specifically not empowered to do that.  The law states they can only make a carbon budget that complies with all the international obligations, the 51% target and all the other categories of requirements in the Bill.  The Minister is absolutely not allowed to go off and make a carbon budget that has a terrible level of ambition or is unfair.  That is my response and it is why we will not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister of State has had sight of it.  From our perspective, it is trying to fill out, and make more complete and comprehensive, the process for appointments.  The framing and wording are adapted from that used for appointments to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We believe it would be an enhancement on the process that already applies.  </p><p>I also raise a query with the Minister of State.  I am conscious that concerns have been raised by the CCAC about some aspects of the Bill.  The Department briefed the CCAC.  The CCAC has looked for legal advice in recent days.  It would be helpful for us to know what that advice related to.  Was it related to the appointments process or the tools for measuring emissions?  I would like to hear from the Minister of State about that. </p></speech>

It proposes that the members of the CCAC be appointed by the President and that there be a process involving the Public Appointments Service and so on.  My objection to this is that it would take too long.  We have a Climate Change Advisory Council, we decided at the pre-legislative stage to revise the way in which that advisory council is composed and what its membership should be and we need to get that in place in order that we will be able to do our carbon budget this year.  We do not have enough time to go through a very lengthy process to do that.  What is proposed is not simply that the Minister just appoints the people to the advisory council; the legislation includes all the kinds of criteria that have to be matched in order to be on the advisory council, lists who the <i>ex officio</i>members shall be and details the gender balance.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications of the day, whoever he or she might be, will not just write down a list of names he or she thinks should be on the advisory council; the list has to match the legislation.  The Minister does not have the Executive power to appoint the members directly.  He or she has to bring that list to the Government and have it approved by the Cabinet, which is unusual because, typically, when a Minister appoints people to a board, it is by direct executive order.  We have a level of checks and legislative limits as to how the council is appointed.  We have had a discussion about who should be on it and how to reconstitute it.  The Climate Change Advisory Council will be significantly different from its predecessor.  I think that going down the route of the Public Appointments Service would just take us too long.  One thing on which we can all agree is that there is a great urgency here.  I think the balance in the legislation is right and that is why I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

I am not entirely clear on the criteria by which amendments have been excluded.  I know that the committee will follow up in that regard and I have done the same myself.  This amendment seeks a financial, social, economic and rural impact assessment.  We have looked for one elsewhere and those types of amendments have been ruled out for a range of reasons.  This is an important opportunity to carry out such assessments to consider the potential impact of this for a range of reasons.  We have had this discussion already.  We seek adequate involvement and engagement from communities such that there is transparency surrounding decision-making.  Nobody for a second is suggesting that anyone will be afforded the opportunity to avoid responsibility, but it is fair to say there are those who would point to what they see as contradictions within decisions that have been made about our response to climate change, whether in one sector or another.</p><p>I mention as an example the importation of peat from the Balkans or Germany at a time when restrictions are in place here.  We must be sure there is an adequate economic, social, financial and rural impact assessment of these decisions.</p></speech>

Citizen engagement and citizens' assemblies are things which we have done well in Ireland in recent years.  I expect that will continue in the same way.  Also, everybody involved in the process recognises that we must bring people with us to make this a success.  Citizen engagement is critical in getting this done and is required by European law and the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>  If one looks at the Bill, sections 11(2) and 11(3) provide that the CCAC is open to gathering information and meeting persons, as it considers appropriate, and is independent in the performance of its functions.  Given that those provisions are there, I do not think it is appropriate to further prescribe the functions of the CCAC.  If there are relevant proposals by public bodies, they must undergo a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment.  These can provide consideration of the impacts of a proposed plan or programme.   It is not proposed to extend the requirement to the CCAC in providing its advisory role.  It is open to the CCAC to seek additional research or reviews, as it considers necessary, to inform its own advice and recommendations.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair for his indulgence.  I was at his other committee representing him well, I hope.  The agriculture committee met at the same time, so my apologies for being here at short notice.</p> <p>  This amendment is fundamental to the many concerns of some people in our farming community with regard to the outworking of the climate action plan and the Bill.  When this Bill is enacted, there will be a need to provide assurances that it is not about tokenism and certainly not about hypocrisy.  One way we can provide those assurances is by ensuring we do not expect actions to be taken at a domestic level, the net result of which is damaging to the environment.  To put this in a framework that people will understand, there would not be much point in us suggesting that we reduce the production of a certain type of food in Ireland, if the net outworking of that was the importation to the EU of food that was less sustainably produced.  People will be aware that there has been much discussion about the Mercosur trade deal, for example.  Notwithstanding the Mercosur trade deal, it is a matter of fact that substantial quantities of Brazilian beef already enter the European market.  We know there are other types of foods that are produced more sustainably either here in Ireland or in other EU member states.  Therefore, the outworking of amendment No. 194 ensures that whatever we do, it does not result in a net increase of global emissions as a result of increased importation to the EU.</p> <p>  In paragraph (g), the amendment proposes a specific reference to the beef sector.  There are some concerns in this regard because a substantial amount of the beef produced in Ireland from the suckler herd is among the most sustainably produced beef in the world.  It is the prime product for which Ireland is famous.  It is important to say that not all beef produced in Ireland meets that high-quality standard.  In fact, an increasing amount of the beef which is sold on the basis of the image of our suckler herd is produced within factory-owned feedlots in most instances.  This amendment sets forward a mechanism to allow us to ensure that a sustainable product, which is among the most sustainable in the world in relation to beef, is protected, encouraged and facilitated to ensure we do not do something I would regard as utter stupidity.  For example, if were to ask for a reduction in our suckler herd in Ireland, the net outworking of that would be an increased level of beef imported from countries like Brazil and other places where the production of that beef warrants the destruction of rainforests.  I hope the Minister of State will support this amendment.  I ask for the support of this committee.</p> <p>  I would like to make a point in relation to a number of amendments which have been disallowed.  They relate to our proposition that the measures in this climate Bill would be assessed to determine their impact on local communities.  We need to know the impact on rural, marginalised or peripheral communities as a result of actions taken.  Those amendments have been ruled out of order as a result of the budgetary impact they would apparently have.  Will the Minister of State consider inserting those amendments into the Bill to ensure, as we have all said, including the Minister of State, that this is not about penalising ordinary workers, families and communities?  A full social, economic and rural impact assessment should be carried out on any measures being proposed so that the Government of the day will have the full facts before measures are enacted.</p></speech>

He is right when he suggests that the job of cutting emissions and deciding where the emission cuts go is not just a matter of finding where the cheapest areas are or what is easiest or handiest.  It must take into account all the wider impacts and that is why the Bill provides for that.  If we look into that, we will see that section 9, which contains the carbon budgets and sets out how they are created, specifically states that the CCAC must take account of the different factors, including the effect on employment and the competitiveness of the economy.</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy made a point about on carbon leakage.  I am not sure if he used that phrase.  I refer to the idea that if we stop producing beef here, it will be produced somewhere else where it causes more harm.  This is a genuine concern and it must be addressed.  Deputy Carthy is right when he contends that there is no point in cutting emissions in one place if that leads to worse emissions elsewhere.  That is why, in this Bill, when the Government makes its climate action plan, it must take carbon leakage effects into account.  The same applies when it does the sectoral emissions ceilings.  When it decides what the maximum emissions in a particular sector are, it must consider carbon leakage.  It will be required to do that by the Act.  It is not the case that those things can be ignored and a simple view can be taken.  It is a complex area which requires much consultation with the public and expert input.  It requires cross-party co-operation because it is such a difficult problem facing us all.  I want to put the Deputy's mind at rest.  The Bill does not ignore carbon leakage and it does not ignore things like employment factors.</p> <p>  Specifically, this amendment, which I am opposing, ties the hands of the CCAC and introduces restrictions on what it can and cannot recommend.</p><p>It could limit its independence and effectiveness.  Also, I do not think it is needed, because the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council has to be considered by Government.  It is a matter for the Government to determine and set climate policy.  The Climate Change Advisory Council does not set the policy.  It comes back to the comparison with NPHET.  The council is an advisory body, not a decision-making body.</p><p> On the question of sustainable farming and so on, we are not choosing between climate action and sustainable farming.  They are very much one and the same thing.  It is not an either-or approach.  The two things support each other.  As we move towards sustainable farming, we will reduce emissions.  We do not do that by pushing them off into another country.  For those reasons, I am requesting that the amendment be withdrawn.</p></speech>

On the one hand, he is saying this is not needed, and on the other hand he is saying it would have such an impact that it could disrupt the work of the advisory council.  This is a fundamental weapon, for want of a better term, that we have at our disposal to show that this House is serious about the concerns that have been raised within rural communities and the agriculture sector, in particular.  It sets out that no recommendation will be made whereby the domestic reduction or the cessation of a food production activity, for which there is no other more sustainable domestic alternative, will result in a net increase in global emissions as a result of increased importation to the EU.  This allays the very concerns that we have been hearing from people who believe this Bill is about tokenism or that there is a hypocritical element at the core of the measures that have been introduced.  It puts to rest all of those concerns.  It would be a fundamental part of the work we need to do and of addressing the core aspect to ensure our farming community is not seen as the enemy, but rather as a partner that can play an important role in addressing climate action.</p> <p>  I must say it is a crucial area for me, as agricultural spokesperson for my party, and for my party colleagues in the sense that we want to show that we can be serious about climate action without reverting to tokenistic or meaningless actions.  The way to do that has been set out in amendment No.194.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position.</p></speech>

There is a consistency through the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  There is a very clear theme not just in our own amendments, but in the various amendments that have been submitted by the full range of opposition parties and groups, in fairness to everybody who went to the bother of scrutinising the Bill and looking at where they felt there was room for improvement in relation to it.  Key to those themes are the level of accountability, the democratic nature of the way decisions are made, who has a voice at the table and whose voice is heard and not heard.  The amendments also seek to ensure and to make explicit in the Bill the values that will be upheld as we embark upon this journey towards net zero, including fairness in respect of burden sharing and equality.</p> <p>  I have argued - this amendment also speaks to the point - that there is an ethical, moral and environmental rationale for making such things explicit.  I also believe there is a political rationale, because it speaks to the very real concerns communities right across the country have, based on experience to date and many of the arguments that have been made in the past number of days and will be made in the next few hours in relation to the prospect of what we are setting ourselves up for here and the real risk that by the nature of the potential for emission reductions in certain sectors compared to others, there will be unfair burden sharing.</p> <p>  I echo Deputy Carthy's point.  I put it to the Minister of State that given everything he has heard on this amendment and throughout the meeting today, along with the Minister, when he was present, it is clear this Bill is not the finished article.  It needs to come back improved on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I share those objectives.  I disagree that this amendment is the way to get there.  What we need to do is contained in the Bill already, both in terms of making sure that the emission reductions do not have a negative effect on the environment, employment and food production, and they do not lead to displaced environmental damage.  I absolutely agree with all of those things.  I also think we have provided for all of those things in the Bill and that the amendment would do more harm than good.</p></speech>

It also limits its range of options in respect of how it can act.  It is important that the Climate Change Advisory Council is fully independent and that it has a full range of options on what it can recommend.  It is also important that the process of deciding these emission targets and carbon budgets is not overly bureaucratic.  We need to take climate action, but we also need to do it quickly so that we are not stuck in debates about things that are difficult to define.  It is important that legislation looks good because it uses good, emotive words, but if it cannot be translated into clear justiciable actions, it can become legislation that is not actually practical.  That is my fear in respect of this amendment.</p></speech>

I also which to state that the entire Bill is about setting the framework within which the advisory council will be operating.  This amendment, in very clear, practical language that is easily understood, and in an impactful way, will address the concerns of those within the farming community in particular who have anxieties that this Bill will be used to force them to do things that cannot be done.  In other words, it will drive them away from their agricultural activity with no environmental benefit to show for it.  In my view, the Minister, the Government and all members of this committee have an opportunity to set out in very clear terms that this is not the objective and that will not be the outcome of the Bill, by supporting this amendment.  Therefore, I wish to press the amendment.</p></speech>

This amendment is fairly self-explanatory and is in respect of the broader issue of consultation with the Oireachtas.  Section 15 of the Bill,<i>inter alia</i>, states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister may issue guidelines, consistent with furthering the achievement of the national climate objective, to local authorities in respect of the content and preparation of a local authority climate action plan and a local authority shall comply with any such guidelines. </blockquote> <p>While the word guideline is used, this is actually a directive because the local authority must comply with whatever direction is provided by the Minister.  I am putting forward here a very simple amendment which is that those directions be approved by the Oireachtas.  As I said, this is fairly self-explanatory and we have such approval with regard to planning regulations.  Where a direction is being issued to local authorities and there is an alteration in the planning regulations, these must come before the Oireachtas for approval before being issued to local authorities.  I am making the same argument here as to the direction that the Minister would make here.  It makes logical sense and is consistent with what happens across local government and our planning laws and it is important that we have that same level of consistency across the board.  I hope that the Minister of State can accept this logical amendment.</p></speech>

The suggestion is that the Houses would need oversight and approval of a supportive tool of guidelines which is to help local authorities in the development of the climate plans.  This is an administrative matter and it would not be appropriate for the D&aacute;il to be approving this as it is a matter for Executive action by the the Government.  I request that the proposal is withdrawn.</p></speech>

The reality is that a Minister of the day could issue a directive to local authorities that they can no longer have one-off rural homes because of the impact that they have on our climate and emissions profile in respect of transport, in particular.  Each local authority would have to comply with that.  If the Minister made such a directive under planning regulations, that would then have to be presented to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister could, however, make the exact same regulation into a directive in the application of this legislation but because it is under the word "climate" then such a regulation does not have to be presented to the D&aacute;il.  It is not right that the Minister has such broad, sweeping powers that he or she can issue a directive to a local authority or authorities.  They have to comply with it without any oversight of such a directive by the parliamentary system.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his view on this particular amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#LL01200"><p>First of all, if one takes this whole issue, and I am aware that the Minister of State will be looking at this in a fair and balanced way, there are enough obstacles and hindrances in the way of people who wish to develop, to get on to building family homes, not to be putting a further quagmire and layer of a way to hold people up.  This will not be welcomed by the public at this time.  There is enough oversight and busybodies trying to stop people and keep the rural countryside as a sort of national park and reserve for people to go and visit every so often, to look out the window of the car to say that this is beautiful, that we have no people here, and we want to keep it that way.  That is not a right way to proceed, will not give us a living, vibrant countryside, and is not about keeping our post offices, our small shops and pubs, and our small communities open.  Putting another way of stopping people, another layer of bureaucracy on them and another excuse to say "No" is not a welcome thing.  I would like to think that the Minister of State will see this.  It is surely the case that the Government does not want the message to go out that it does not want people to live in the countryside.  I want to protect all of the species in the countryside, including the human species.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060900002#LL01300"><p>I think that this is a very unfair presentation of what the section is about, which is in respect of the Minister issuing guidelines to local authorities so that they can prepare a local authority climate action plan.  The idea of this is that local authorities will be to the forefront of driving climate action to ensure that by moving early, there will not be the sort of consequences that people might fear.  If one fails to adapt one's local authority or community to the challenges of climate action, one is going to see the prosperity of that community adversely impacted.  We cannot avoid the progressive nature of the global challenge of climate and we will see a progressively higher carbon price to be paid by those who fail to plan ahead.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is seeking here to provide national expertise to support local authorities to be ahead of the curve in this respect.  To present this as some sort of negative conspiracy against local communities is unfair to the climate challenge.  In my time I have had occasion to meet with the Association of Irish Local Government and most of the local authorities are up for it.  They recognise that if they move ahead of this they will create opportunities within their community.  The Minister's guidelines are there to put them in a position to be leaders in climate responses to ensure that their community is ahead of the curve.</p><p>For people to perceive climate planning guidelines in the wholly negative way in which it seems it is being presented here is unfair to local authorities and communities right across the country.  They see what is coming and recognise that future generations will depend on the changes we make in our community today.  I put this counter argument to what we have heard.  Climate action is the correct thing for us to do if we want to secure more prosperous, competitive and sustainable communities.  We must bear that in mind when we are debating the sort of guidelines that the Minister might issue.</p></speech>

It paints them as not understanding the science and what is happening in our communities.  Those people see and know exactly what is happening first-hand.  Anyone over 40 or 50 years old in a rural community will remember when the ecosystem was in much better balance and, for example, bird species such as lapwing and curlew were much more common.  Those people will be very familiar with fruits and berries having been much more plentiful in hedgerows in years past and they will know exactly what changes have occurred and the pressures that have been put on the land in recent years.</p> <p>  It is unfair to place the issue in this very divisive framing and also not to provide leadership in this area.  As politicians, we should be providing leadership in this regard.  We should be working with our communities to ensure they are better placed to address these pressures, because they are coming and, indeed, are already here with us.  Each of us has a responsibility to provide the requisite leadership and undertake that role.  This is not a choice; it is something we must do.  We must ensure that people in rural and urban settings are prepared to deal with these issues.</p></speech>

What is the big fear in that regard?  Why is such a provision not in the legislation?  There is such a provision for planning guidelines and those directions to the local authorities must come before the Oireachtas.  Why is that not the case for these directives?  All I am asking is that they be presented to the D&aacute;il.  That would let the Minister outline exactly why the guidelines are needed and necessary.  What is the big fear, if there is nothing to be concerned about?  I hope the Minister of State will reconsider this amendment between now and Report Stage.  On that basis, I withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

From the number of amendments withdrawn during the course of this debate, it will be a long Report Stage in the House.  I am sure the Minister of State and the Minister will be put through their paces whether the debate will be in a forum of the scale of the convention centre or back home here in Leinster House.  I presume the debate will be in the convention centre.  I wish the Ministers well in that work.  Thank you, Chair, for your patience and good humour throughout the entire proceedings.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for their engagement.  I thank all my colleagues, not only the members of this committee but everybody who contributed to Committee Stage.

When the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was in a couple of days ago when we were talking about accepting our amendments he did mention the nature-based solution amendment he accepted in the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Act.  I acknowledge that he did take on board those amendments.  They were really important amendments and it is great that the Bill will reflect them.  I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, would bring back to the Minister the fact that we are all trying to work together.  We have all worked very well together on this Bill.  Our objectives are similar although our paths there may be different.  We all want to see a much more sustainable future for the country.  I urge the Minister of State to look at those issues concerning the main items that were addressed, reflect on them and see if there is perhaps anything he can do prior to Report Stage on the just transition, the electricity sector and climate justice, as that would be very welcome.</p></speech>

Thank you Chair for your stewardship.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their engagement.  The level of engagement and the large number of amendments submitted by the Opposition is a reflection of how serious we all take this issue.  That was true of the committee on pre-legislative scrutiny stage also.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the number of days of engagement and the debate and discussion we have had.  All of us can count to nine or ten on a given day and we know the numbers in terms of the Government and the Opposition, but the amendments coming from the Opposition are being tabled for a reason, which is that there is room for improvement and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that before the Report Stage debate on the Bill on which we will also fully engage.</p></speech>

Believe it or not, I found watching the pre-legislative scrutiny process moving.  All of the members have been constructive whatever their position.  It is valuable to have people from a rural Ireland perspective, former Ministers and people from different backgrounds.  This has been a constructive session.  There has been a lack of theatrics or insincerity.  The committee has done fantastic work.  We are getting there and are delivering something that will be meaningful and significant for the people of Ireland.  I thank the committee for its work.  My door is always open.</p></speech>

This is such an engaged committee.  It has brought a level of nuance and detail to our work that we would not have expected at the outset.  We have proven our worth as a committee.</p> <p>  I thank the non-members of the committee who are present and those who joined us over the past few days and on other occasions.  Non-members are always welcome to join us and debate.  We relish that debate.  It is important that the differing views across the Oireachtas are expressed in committee to us.  We value those contributions.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for filling in today at short notice, as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, had to go to Luxembourg.  I thank the Minister for the work he has done so far.</p> <p>  I thank the committee secretariat.  I also thank those Oireachtas Members who have contributed to our work, especially in recent days, as we tried to hold extra sessions.  We attended during the recess week, which posed difficulties for Members and many staff across the Oireachtas, who have been patient with us and worked as hard as we have on this legislation.</p></speech>

As the Chair mentioned, two strategies have just been approved by the Government in the past month.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas report's fundamental principles underpin the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and action plan.  Healthy Ireland is the key prevention pillar of Sl&aacute;intecare reform and hence we have brought our colleagues from Healthy Ireland, with whom we work hand in glove.  We have made steady progress since the office was opened just over two years ago, as is outlined in the strategy.  We have had targeted support for integration and innovation programmes.  A decision was made this year to fund Sl&aacute;intecare to the levels in the health capacity review, which is welcome.  A substantial Sl&aacute;intecare communications and citizen engagement programme has occurred.  There has been a significant move to the community, which was a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare, with additional staffing coming into place this year as a result of all the funding.  I will also highlight the key foundational decisions of the establishment of the HSE board and the approval of the geographies for the six new regional areas.</p> <p>  There has also been steady policy progress which underpins everything we do.  That progress has included the Healthy Ireland outcomes framework, the national healthy positive indicators for ageing, an independent patient advocacy service and other key policies that have underpinned everything we do and everything that is being rolled out in the new strategy.</p> <p>  We have focused on two priority programmes for implementation over the next three years.  The first programme is about improving safe, timely access to care and promoting health and well-being.  The second programme is around addressing health inequalities.  My colleagues and I will take the committee members through the 11 projects which form these two programmes.  We will then be very happy to take comments etc., and elaborate on anything that is in the plan.</p> <p>  The first programme is about improving safe, timely access to care, promoting health and well-being.  It is underpinned and enabled by staff engagement, public engagement and, critically, funding.  The overall objective is to achieve the waiting time targets of 12 weeks for inpatients, ten weeks for outpatients and ten days for diagnostics for public patients across the system.  It is a complicated set of projects.  There are seven in total and they are interrelated and interlinking.  They involve implementation by the Department of Health policy sections, HSE operations and many other stakeholders across the system.  We are not starting from scratch.  Many of these have begun and have made progress in the past two years, but by the end of the next three years they will see substantial implementation.</p></speech>

There are seven projects to improve safe and timely access to care and promote health and well-being.  The first project is to implement the health service capacity review 2018.  The three key work streams in this project relate to healthy living, enhanced community care and hospital productivity.  It is about keeping people well in their homes and shifting care from acute hospitals into the community.</p> <p>  The second project is about scaling and mainstreaming innovative projects.  The third project is about streamlining care pathways from prevention to discharge.  The fourth project will develop elective centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p><p>The fifth project is implementing a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan, project six is implementing the e-health programme and the seventh project relates to the removal of private care from public hospitals.  That is implementing the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.</p><p> The first project in programme one relates to the implementation of the recommendations of the health service capacity review 2018.  This review projected to 2031 the staffing and physical infrastructure that would be required to meet the growing demands in the healthcare service.  It factored in unmet needs, demographic and non-demographic pressures and reducing waiting lists over a four-year period.  Three key reforms scenarios underpin the health capacity review.  These are healthy living, enhanced community care and hospital productivity improvements.  Implementation of these reforms reduces the need for an additional 7,000 acute beds to 2,600 acute beds.  The increased acute bed capacity that is being funded in budget 2021 tracks the reform scenario outlined in the health capacity review.</p><p> Implementation of these three reform pillars involves the complex mix of interrelated projects that, when aligned, will collectively move towards providing safer and more timely access to care and promoting health and well-being.  Can Ms Magahy read the slides?</p></speech>

On the next slide, the model illustrates the provision of integrated end-to-end care in the community, ranging from keeping people well at home to primary care provision, community care services and acute care.  The healthy living workstream focuses on prevention and decreasing the prevalence of unhealthy behaviours.  It empowers people in their own health, and it facilitates people to live well at home and within their communities.  A key aspect of the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 was the shift of care out of acute hospitals, into the community, and closer to a person's home, where safely possible.  The community healthcare networks will focus on the healthcare needs of a population of 50,000.  Some 96 of those will be rolled out.  They will provide the foundation and organisational structure that will enable integrated care between the primary and acute care providers.  Specialist ambulatory hubs will incorporate integrated care for older persons and chronic disease management.  They will also link to acute hospitals to facilitate early supported discharge.  I will now hand over to Mr. James, who will talk about the work undertaken by Healthy Ireland.</p></speech>

As mentioned, Healthy Ireland is the key prevention arm of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It focuses on decreasing unhealthy behaviours that contribute to chronic disease.  Our aim is to ensure maximum impact for citizens in terms of avoiding hospital admissions, reducing the need for primary care services, and helping people to lead healthier lives and to stay well for as long as possible.  A number of key policies and initiatives form part of Healthy Ireland.  Policies include the national obesity policy and action plan, national physical activity plan and national sexual health strategy.  We have a big focus on evaluation, for example, through the Healthy Ireland outcomes framework, the Healthy Ireland survey, and the Health Behaviours in School-Aged Children, HBSC.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Dr. Mansergh, who will talk about some of the current priorities.</p></speech>

It is implemented in collaboration with a range of other Departments, agencies and the academic sector and, in particular, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, who are the co-leads, and Sport Ireland.  The national sexual health strategy focuses on promotion, education and prevention, and includes sexual health services, such as the STI clinics.  Recent initiatives have included, for example, HIV Ireland's Fast-Track Cities, pre-exposure for prophylaxis or PrEP, and the expansion of the national condom distribution service.<br/><br/>Healthy Ireland has been running a series of information campaigns since 2018.  Latterly, these have been adapted to take account of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, aiming to support everybody&rsquo;s resilience through this difficult period.  The latest campaign, Keep Well, is now wrapping up.  It provided supports for keeping active and being outdoors during the winter, supports for individual activity, staying connected with people safely, addressing isolation, supporting volunteerism and initiatives that support person-to-person connection.  A community call helpline was available to those most in need.Switching off and Being Creative, in partnership with Creative Ireland, helped to learn something new, to get back to nature, relaxation and to take up a new hobby.  Eating Well is supported by the HSE,<i>safe</i>food and others.  I should mention our support of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s <i>Operation Transformation </i>this year, which reached out to approximately 400,000 to 500,000 people with advice on exercise and healthy eating.  Finally, the Managing Your Mood campaign supported positive mental health and gave people supports on where to go if they were in distress.  It linked to relevant information points, for example, the HSE&rsquo;s mental health service, Your Mental Health, Jigsaw and SpunOut.  I will now hand over to Ms Harlin to talk about scaling and mainstreaming integration innovation.</p></speech>

The next slide contains a map, which outlines the large number of projects funded in round 1 of the Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  The goal of these projects is to promote the engagement and empowerment of citizens in the care of their own health, share best practices on processes for chronic disease management and care of older persons, and encourage innovation in shift-of-care to community, or provide hospital avoidance measures.  The goal of round 2 will be to enable safer integrated care between settings through audit-informed, research-driven, or process improvement projects.  Integrated patient pathway improvement projects and integrated wider determinant stakeholder partnerships will focus on improving outcomes for communities of particular needs.  We have funded projects such as SMILE in Carlow, COPD projects, diabetes, heart failure, and a community oncology project in north Dublin, which are on the next slide  These projects support the delivery of integrated care.  They shift care into the community and help reduce and prevent hospital visits.  They support the ultimate goal of reducing waiting lists and waiting times.  We have great examples of projects doing wonderful work out in the community that have been funded through Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.633" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#C00700"><p>Project 3 is about streamlining care pathways from prevention to discharge.  Many of these examples have been demonstrated well over the past two years through some of the samples on which Ms Harlin spoke.  Developing integrated care pathways that are based on delivering the best outcomes for patients can help drive streamlined integration between the care settings.  Pathways will be agreed between GPs, primary community care providers, community specialist teams, and hospital-based specialists.  They will provide better links across these care settings, ensuring resources are used to provide care for people in a timely way.  This has been recently proven in New Zealand in an innovative way.  It will be enabled by a decision support tool and other e-health projects, and backed up by a services directory.  There is great demand for this, particularly in areas where there are problems of referral, for example, in mental health.  We will work with colleagues to implement that over the next three years.</p> <p>  Our next project in reform programme 1 is on developing the elective centres.  As members will know from our previous meeting, the development of elective hospital facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway is in line with the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and health service capacity review and it was recommitted to in the programme for Government.  The goal of the project is to develop elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need.  This facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.  It will provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected elective patients.  It will create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce or eliminate outlier orders, that is, people waiting on trolleys.  It will help drive down waiting lists, reduce cancellations and reduce acute hospital footfall.  The project continues to work at the moment under the previous implementation strategy.  The elective hospitals oversight group, which is under the joint governance of the HSE, the Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, is guiding the development of the elective hospital sites.  We followed the process outlined in the public spending code.  We have completed a strategic assessment report.  As of last Friday, we had invited sites for selection.  They will be considered by the oversight group in the next phase of the implementation of the elective hospitals.  The goal is, in accordance with the public spending code, to bring for a Government decision before the summer the selection of sites for the elective hospitals.</p><p>We have been working closely with colleagues in Cork and Galway in particular to make sure their requirements can be met within this programme.  The next slide is on implementing a multi-annual waiting lists plan.</p></speech>

For anybody watching at home, we will put them on our website.</p> <p>  This is an important programme around waiting lists.  Waiting lists have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 experience.  We report on waiting lists monthly and they have been getting worse as a result of cancellation of operations due to Covid-19.  Together with our colleagues in the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, we are developing a multi-annual waiting list plan to get rid of waiting lists over a four to five-year period.  It will not just be about hospital waiting lists.  There are waiting lists in the community as well.  It will be about acute, community, social care, disabilities, mental health, palliative care, rehabilitation and any other waiting lists that exist.  We are at an advanced stage and will present our project to the Minister for Health to see if the Government will commit to a multi-annual plan to get rid of waiting lists once and for all.  Traditionally, waiting lists have been dealt with on an annual basis only.  We need a longer-term view in order to drive these down.  It is what people care about most.  It will be the barometer for the success of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  Over the last four months, we have put a lot of work into developing this plan.  It is complex and there are a lot of moving parts.  It will require joined-up thinking.  Some of the projects to which we alluded form part of this plan.  I am happy to come back to the committee to discuss the details of the plan, once it has been approved by the Government.  </p> <p>  On the next slide, the e-health programme is a critical part of reforming the health service.  Through the pandemic we saw the impact of some positive initiatives in e-health, for example, remote consultations and, to a limited but successful degree, electronic prescribing.  The benefits of e-health have been demonstrated, as have the risks through the recent cyberattack.  It is necessary to invest into the basics of our e-health programme, as well as into the more advanced pieces.</p> <p>  The projects listed on this slide are an example of some of the key health solutions and electronic health record, EHR, component parts, which will be needed to deliver an electronic health record for every patient in Ireland.  In the middle, there is the citizen portal, the individual health identifier interoperability, the shared care record, and the integrated referral and wait lists hub.  These will be facilitated on one side by e-prescribing, immunisation, home support and community programmes.  On the other side, it will be supported by our hospital-based programmes.  </p> <p>  We have some very good examples of EHR in the maternity newborn programme.  We also have advanced level EHR in hospitals such as St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The National Forensic Mental Health Service Hospital and Children's Hospital Ireland will have one in due course.  This slide underpins everything we do in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Some key advances have been made in recent months.  In particular, everybody who has had a vaccination has now been allocated an individual health identifier.  This is an essential part of the shared care record.  They will soon form part of general practice and the hospital patient administration system, which is necessitated to deliver a summary and shared care record. </p> <p>  On the next slide, the project on removing private care from public hospitals is a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare and the original Oireachtas committee report.  The new Sl&aacute;intecare contract with an increased salary over existing new entry levels will support the expansion of the public health service in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is a key step in the move towards the long-term goal of universal single-tier healthcare, with public hospitals exclusively used for the treatment of public patients.  That has been a long-standing aim.  It is the first step on the road to separate private and public health care.  The OECD, in its analysis for the de Buitl&eacute;ar group, whose report gave rise to this, concluded that removing private practice from public hospitals would eliminate the unequal treatment of public and private patients in public hospitals.  We are at the stage of entering discussions with the representative bodies and we look forward to concluding those in the coming months. </p> <p>  We have just described reform programme 1.  Everything within reform programme 1 has been designed to reduce waiting lists and improve access for public patients.  On the next slide, reform programme 2 takes a slightly different slant, which is about addressing health inequalities.  We need investment in the public system, but there are also pockets of places where people have unequal access.  Therefore, the four projects that are listed here are designed to ensure that resources are more equally distributed and are targeted to address and reduce health inequalities.  This is like the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, school idea.  There are four projects here.  The first is developing a citizen care master plan.  The second is rolling out healthy communities, which is a very exciting initiative.  The third is developing regional health areas.  It was parked last year during Covid-19 but it is on the cards again.  The fourth project is about implementing the obesity policy and action plan.  I invite Ms Treleaven to outline the citizen care master plan project.  </p></speech>

This will take the form of a citizen care master plan.  By using a population-based approach for service planning and funding, we hope we can address some of the health inequalities that exist around the country.  First, we will profile our population to assess their health needs in a formal way.  That evidence will then be used to develop a population-based resource allocation model, and a review of eligibility entitlements specifically.  We will also look at frameworks for capital planning and workforce.  Many of these work streams will be done concurrently.  Mr. Straton will now address the area of healthy communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Greg Straton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#D00800"><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare healthy communities programme aims to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social determinants of health in the most deprived communities in the State.  Some 22.5% of our population is exposed to some form of disadvantage.  In these communities, the prevalence of chronic illness such as stroke, coronary heart disease and diabetes is higher than the population average and significantly higher than in affluent communities.  As an example, in self-reported health rates for men in the 65 to 74 age cohort, 57% report good health in deprived areas, as opposed to 91% in affluent areas.  The Sl&aacute;intecare healthy communities programme will be designed to bring together key policies, strategies and fields aligned to the social determinants of health.  It will involve 12 Government Departments working in close partnership with local authorities.  The first phase of the programme will be delivered in 18 areas, aligned with the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, areas and will cover all 51 SICAP areas by phase 3.</p><p>In these areas the HSE will deliver evidence-based programmes that will provide targeted supports in the identified communities, such as parenting programmes, stop-smoking advisers, the We Can Quit programme, social prescribing link workers, nutrition supports and Making Every Contact Count training programme.  I will hand back to my colleague, Ms Treleaven.</p></speech>

As people may recall, the geography of the six regional health areas was approved by the Government in July 2019.  The Government decision directed us to develop a business case and a change management programme.  We are doing that at present in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's public spending code.  The key objectives of the implementation of regional health areas are: to further define clinical governance pathways, in particular where they cross between community lines; to reinforce our corporate governance and accountability structures; to enable a population-based approach to service planning and funding; and to promote the integration of services between community and acute sectors.  I will now hand over to Ms O'Dwyer to talk about the obesity programme.</p></speech>

As all members know, obesity is a major public health problem.  Two out of three adults and one in five children are overweight or obese.  Since 2016 we know that the levels have been stabilising, but they remain significantly higher in socially disadvantaged communities.  One figure to illustrate that is the incidence in a first-year class is a DEIS school is 24.6% versus 15% in a non-DEIS school in the general population.  We know that is a problem.</p> <p>  The ten steps in the action plan show the Government's commitment to reversing the obesity trends and they set out the actions required across a range of Departments and sectors.  They aim to reduce the overall burden for individuals, their families and the health system.  A wide range of steps are being actioned and a mid-term review by the school of public health at University College Cork, UCC, is currently under way.  Step 9 is a key step.  The model of care is shown on the other side.  It was launched in March 2021 and provides for an integrated delivery of early intervention, weight management and obesity treatment across the lifespan.  There are five levels of care.  It sets out how healthcare for children, young adults and people living with overweight and obesity in Ireland should be organised and resourced both now and in the future.  I will hand over to Ms Magahy.</p></speech>

We will report on them on a regular basis.  We have just completed our quarter 1 report and everything is broadly on track, which is really great.  We will be providing an evaluation programme, as discussed earlier, and making sure that everything is aligned and reported on properly.  We are working in tandem with the HSE and other colleagues right across the system to implement this very complicated programme and making sure that everything is running in the right direction.</p> <p>  We are very pleased that everything the members have seen in the report is funded, other than the areas that are highlighted, for example, with the elective hospitals, where it has to come back to the Government for specific approval.  All the elements such as beds, community staffing, diagnostic care, social care expansion, etc., that were outlined in the budget, which we went through with the committee at our last meeting, have been funded.  We are very pleased with that.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for bearing with the technical issues.  Sl&aacute;intecare is about working together across the system.  We are acutely aware that it has had the support of all of the parties, for which we are very grateful.  We value the input of all the public representatives, as well as our colleagues across the public, private and voluntary sectors in the health system.  We look forward to discussing the report with the committee and to coming back and updating it later in the year on how we are getting on.</p></speech>

I again apologise for the technical hitches that interfered with the meeting today.

I wish to focus on two areas.  The first is elective hospitals.  My understanding is that the South/South West Hospital Group was a bit surprised with the presentation made to it on 4 March because it set out that it would be an elective hospital, which would be open six days per week, 50 weeks of the year.  There was a clear indication that there would not be inpatient beds there.  It might be helpful if there was some clarification on that.  My understanding also is that the head of the South/South West Hospital Group has written to Sl&aacute;intecare since the meeting.  What level of engagement has occurred since the meeting of 4 March with the hospital group?</p></speech>

The elective hospitals were designated as elective ambulatory hospitals in the national development plan.  We have devised a national model for ambulatory elective hospitals.  We understand that it is not everything that is required either by Cork or Galway, or other areas around the country.  We have had substantial engagement with the South/South West Hospital Group as recently as last Friday.  We are coming together to get an understanding of how we can make sure that its requirements and those of the elective hospitals can be done in tandem.  When we went out looking for sites we made sure that we were looking for a site that was big enough to accommodate both the elective hospital's ambulatory requirements and the inpatient and overnight stays, which I know is the wider ambition of the South/South West Hospital Group.  I am in weekly contact with the group.  Its consultants, KPMG, and our consultants, PA Consulting, are talking together about how to make sure that the two requirements dovetail and overlap.</p></speech>

What is being said to me is that if one takes hip or knee operations, people with diabetes or other underlying health conditions would not be suitable candidates for a day hospital.  Is Ms Magahy saying there are going to be inpatient beds?</p></speech>

The elective ambulatory project, which is the one that we have been pursuing looks at very simple day surgery where a person goes in and out and will not be delayed or cancelled due to other issues impacting on them.</p></speech>

We issued a public invitation for submissions for sites in the last few weeks.  The closing date was on Friday.  The invitation for submissions includes HSE sites, Land Development Agency sites and indeed, private sites.  There will be an evaluation process that will assess which are the best sites and the best value sites.  It will also ensure that the sites are big enough for future development.  Our HSE colleagues helped us to design the invitation that was issued, so they have been part of that whole process.  We have been in discussion with our HSE colleagues in Cork.</p></speech>

Taking the two voluntary hospitals in County Cork, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital has been there since 1756.  The Mercy Hospital was established in 1857.  Therefore, the two hospitals are facing many challenges in trying to meet updated requirements.  Particularly after the pandemic, there are even more requirements on them in respect of the new challenges that they face.</p> <p>  Together with the Cork University Hospital, CUH, how are they going to cope with the demand for inpatient care if there are not going to be any inpatients in the new facility?  That seems to be what Ms Magahy is saying.  </p></speech>

There are two issues.  From the findings of the health capacity review, we know that extra capacity is needed and in any event, new beds need to be built to cope with future demand.  We also know that some of the existing stock is not up to scratch.  That was demonstrated particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, when we did not have proper infection control and had Nightingale wards.

I welcome the witnesses.  There are a few issues that I wish to raise.  If I run out of time, written responses will suffice.</p> <p>  A lot is made of care in the community and we hear about it often.  Despite the constant references to how important it is to care for people in their own communities in rural Ireland, district care has been stripped away from localities on a continuous basis.  In my own constituency in Country Tipperary, the district hospital, St. Brigid's, was closed down temporarily during the crisis.  We were told this was for Covid reasons.  Before the decision was made to close it, it had a short-stay unit with palliative, respite and convalescent beds.  In the following months during the crisis, there was increased public concern over whether the hospital would reopen at all and if it was being closed by stealth.  As it turned out, it was.  </p> <p>  It has since been confirmed that the unit will not reopen due to alleged concerns over the suitability of the premises and the standard of care for people.  It had been providing this care for decades.  This means that the people of Carrick-on-Suir, south Kilkenny and north Waterford and the surrounding areas, who had great affection for St. Brigid's, now face the prospect of having to travel further afield for the services that were provided in their community, as stated in the reports.  Despite their best efforts, the Minister has refused to move on the issue.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir have been demonstrating every weekend and they will continue to do so.  I have no doubt about it.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a number of questions about the decision and how it was arrived at.  Despite numerous freedom of information requests being submitted by the community in respect of the engineer's report upon which the decision is said to have been made, we are still waiting for the information to be made available.  We have received some reports that it was made available today.  In 2018, the HIQA report gave a clean bill of health to the hospital.  When was the engineer's report commissioned?  I ask that a precise date is provided, if possible.  Was it commissioned before the assurances were given last summer?  Deputies were given assurances that the hospital would reopen.  If the report was commissioned before that, then we were lied to.  If it was commissioned after that, I wish to know the precise date on which it was commissioned and who commissioned it.  I also request a copy of the report. </p> <p>  How are the hospice beds that were in the hospital going to be replaced?  Where are they going to be based and whey will they be available?  Have contracts been signed with nursing homes in the area?  It seems to us, who have been campaigning on the issue, that it is all about privatising beds and taking from the community.  Every one of the reports mentions community-based care, but the beds are being taken away from the community.  I am interested to hear if the Minister for Health spoke to officials before the decision was made on the closure of St. Brigid's.  A Deputy and a local councillor publicised on social media and the local media in Tipperary that the hospital was going to open, but that decision seems to have been thrown out.  </p> <p>  The mental health services aspect of it is another issue of concern.  I am sure that is it the same all over the country.  However, the provision of mental health services in Tipperary has been affected by the stripping of services away from local communities.  St. Michael's was a huge psychiatric unit, which closed in 2012.  People were told to go to the overcrowded St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny if they were from the south of the country and those in the north of the county were told to go to Ennis Hospital.  I do not know if people realise how large a county Tipperary is to be without any beds.  It has since emerged that the HSE itself is willing to pay &euro;300,000 over the next seven years to transfer patients from Clonmel to St. Luke's.  Around &euro;700,00 has been spent on the facility as part of the Covid-19 response, and still, no beds are available.  With all this money being made available for these purposes, is it not time to invest money in mental health services in a county the size of Tipperary and reopen St. Michael's to some extent so that we have a proper mental health unit in Tipperary?  Some people seek to think that mental health issues stop at 5 p.m. and do not affect the patient until 9 a.m. the following morning.  Something needs to be done.  With that kind of money being spent, something has to change.</p> <p>  Another issue that I wish to raise concerns the Dean Maxwell Nursing Home.  It is another facility that has been closed in County Tipperary.  We are beginning to wonder if the Department has something against the county.  All of these decisions have been made.  Everything is being stripped away .  All the reports are about community-based care.  It is not being delivered.  -----</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The first is how big the electives will be.  The thinking at the moment is that there will be nine theatres in Cork, eight in Galway and 21 in Dublin.  That might change as we are still in the middle of developing the model and the final business case.</p> <p>  The consultants contract has issued to the representative bodies.  We are hoping that there will be a substantial engagement process, which we have asked them to engage in.  There is a great deal to discuss within it.  There are two fundamental issues that Government decided upon.  One is not to have any private practice off-site and the second is the salary levels but there are plenty of other issues that can be discussed and engaged upon in a meaningful way.  We are hopeful that that will be happening over the next very short time.</p> <p>  Finally, on the community healthcare networks, the Deputy asked what kind of population level they will cater for.  These are for populations of approximately 50,000 people each and there will be 96 of these.  These will be substantially implemented and rolled out by the end of this year.  Staff are actively being hired for these at the moment and they will provide primary care.</p></speech>

We could have used twice the time and it was a very pleasant attack on the senses.  I want to express my appreciation to our witnesses for all of the work that is going into these projects.  Each programme probably deserved a separate session in its own right.  I feel a little overloaded after it.   This is nonetheless exciting stuff which I appreciate.</p> <p>  I have just a couple of questions and I do not believe I will use up all of my time.  Something that has often intrigued me is the VHI SwiftCare model of emergency intervention.  Why has that never been considered?  It would significantly alleviate the pressure on emergency departments and hospitals more generally.</p></speech>

There is a parallel in the public system, which are called minor injury units, and there are 11 of these associated with the main public emergency departments all around the country.  In Dublin, there is one in Smithfield and one in Mallow, County Cork.  I will miss the names of the others as I do not have them off the top of my head.  These are brilliant, are open between 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. seven days a week, mostly.  These are minor injury units and do what it says on the tin by providing care for minor falls, small X-rays, are very good and are becoming more and more used to taking pressure off the main emergency departments.  It is interesting that the Deputy should raise these units because I am not sure that they are as widely known about as-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#G01200"><p>Yes, these are just for minor injuries.  VHI SwiftCare has managed to grab the corporate name.  Perhaps a renaming of the public facility might be in order.  That is useful to know.  I was aware that there were minor injury clinics but I did not appreciate that they were fulfilling the same function.</p> <p>  Respite care is an issue that is coming down the tracks.  I was very interested in what Ms Magahy said about returning care to the community and what she might have to say resulting from the nursing home experience.  Public nursing home experience is often pooh-poohed by some people.  For example, I know that one of the big advantages that public nursing homes have over private nursing homes is the presence of GPs on-site pretty much all of the time.  This is something that is open to private nursing homes but is something that could be significantly improved upon.  What does Ms Magahy believe the public mood is around the nursing home experience and what can Sl&aacute;intecare learn from that?</p> <p>  As constituency politicians, respite care is an issue that comes up a great deal.  I want to float, however, a different idea.  Politicians will have charted the increased number of children with autism who have now entered their teenage years with the condition and who are becoming adults with it, depending on where they are on the spectrum.  There will be demands on society for some of those who are on the extreme end in respect of social housing provision and so on.  However, has respite on the home site ever been considered?  I know that there are parents, for example, who would like to access something like a seomra for their house or back garden where, if there is an outburst or where everybody needs a break, there is space on site.  The respite, therefore, does not then have to take care out of or away from the family home in some instances but it is still being taken care of within the community.  This is going to become a greatly increasing demand from within communities.  There are multiple other questions I could ask but I will leave it at that because I would like to receive some responses on these questions, and I thank our guests.</p></speech>

It was one of the things that we are very interested in getting citizens&rsquo; feedback on what they think about it.  </p> <p>  We are slight outliers in that we have more people going into nursing homes than in other countries.  One of our main goals is to increase the number of people who can stay well and be enabled to stay well in their own homes.  The Deputy may have seen some of the programmes referring to healthy communities as outlined by Mr. Straton earlier.  Another one that we did not have a chance to talk about is Age Friendly Ireland's healthy homes programmes.  We have funded 11 age friendly co-ordinators in each of the local authorities on a pilot basis to have a conversation with people who are deemed to be vulnerable to identify what supports they may need to stay in their own homes.  This may involve rightsizing, a warmer home, occupational therapy requirements for the home and how can people be enabled to stay longer in their own homes.  It has just started and the co-ordinators are in place.  We have set ambitious targets to see can we reduce these needs by putting the requirements in upfront in a co-ordinated way so the people can stay well in their own homes for longer.  This is an inter-agency approach, which involves the housing Department, local authorities, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and, obviously, the HSE from a clinical perspective.  We are very interested in this project because we are outliers in respect of institutional care as opposed to trying to keep people well in their own homes.</p> <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s proposition on respite on the home site is very interesting and is one I will take away and talk to colleagues in the Department about to see what the thinking is or could be on that.  If there are examples of other places in which this has worked, we will be very interested in hearing about that.  He is correct in that people want to stay well in or near to their own homes and, indeed, that people who require care are also looked after near to the family residence.  We would be very interested in hearing more about that if he has any suggestions around that idea.</p></speech>

A grant seems to be what is stopping it at the moment.  There are some families who cannot afford this but would like to do this on site.  All that is stopping this then is a grant but I will follow this up with some more detail.  That concludes my questions.  I thank the Chairman and the witnesses again.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate the complexity and breadth of the work involved, however I am concerned as it is hard to establish from the presentation whether the work is almost complete or still at a theoretical level.  If there were funding allocations attached to each project and a timescale, it would be more helpful.  Much of this seems like name-checking from the original report.  It may be that or there may be work well under way but we do not have a sense of that from the presentation.</p> <p>  I have six very quick questions.  Who will do the Sl&aacute;intecare contract negotiations?  I thought the citizen care master plan population profiling was almost done the last time the witnesses were in contact.  When do they expect that will be completed and published?  I was very disappointed to hear the elective hospitals will be day hospitals.  That is not what was envisaged at all.  The witnesses say that is how they went into the national development plan.  Can that be changed in the review of the NDP, because it is clear that we will need a lot more than just day hospitals?  On the regional health areas, I note the name has been changed.  Has the objective changed in any way in terms of a single management structure for all health services in each of the RHAs, as they are being called now?  Can we have a note on the detail of the healthy communities and what exactly Sl&aacute;intecare is doing and how it is going to bring 12 Departments together?  I am interested in hearing about that.  Finally, where is the work on entitlement versus eligibility?</p></speech>

We could not go through it now, sorry.  Everything that has been named has a budget.  Many of the things that are in place are at an advanced stage.  By the end of the three years we will have the multi-annual plan substantially implemented to reduce the waiting lists, so we will be well on the way to having the waiting lists down, we will have begun construction of the new elective hospitals, we will have rolled-out the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract, we will have hired 7,000 new community-based staff, delivered 31 new primary care centres, invested in 32 community specialist hubs, and provided the next stage of the healthy communities.  I will return to that.  There will be 57 healthy communities in due course covering 250,000 people, with 18 happening this year.  We will have mainstreamed access for patients to direct diagnostics, created the six new regional health areas, and established the new community healthcare networks.  All this work has been enabled by the budget.  Since last October's budget, we are in the position of being able to hire the right staff to put in place the infrastructure and properly get everything in place.  It is substantially advanced.  We will publish the quarter 1 report in the next couple of weeks.  I want to assure the Deputy about that.</p> <p>  The intention on the RHA has not changed.  It will be single budget.  I will ask Ms Treleaven to come in on the regions.</p></speech>

We are scoping potential options and engaging with our stakeholders to ensure that we are incorporating lessons learned from previous exercises such as this.  We are looking to create structures that will allow a single population-based resource allocation per region that will bring together community and acute sectors at a much lower level of management than at present, bringing decisions closer to the ground and bringing integration closer to the front line.</p></speech>

It is very exciting.  In the last five months, we have got agreement from the local authorities to roll this out at a really local level through the local community development committees, LCDC, structure.  We will appoint a healthy communities co-ordinator for each LCDC structure that are aligned with the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, areas.  At national level, we have the agreement of each of the Departments that they will meet and ensure that their respective resources, whether in housing, education, social care, and children, and work together, somewhat like the DEIS model, to focus on healthy outcomes for the people in those communities and ensure that all the resources are being targeted.  It is really exciting.  It is a good example of what population resource allocation can do.  We have the funding for it and the staff are being hired now.  We have the agreements of the Departments, local authorities and all the pieces are ready to roll-out.  They will start on the ground, in real life, in September.</p></speech>

That is part of the work that is being done this year that Ms Treleaven is rolling out.  It will be budget dependent and decisions on the budget will not be made until October but we will make proposals into the budget for consideration by the Government then.</p></speech>

Finally, on the elective hospitals, how did it come about that they became day hospitals and can that be changed in the review of the NDP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#H01400"><p>I do not know how it came about as it was written before I joined but it was there that they were day surgery and that was the urgent requirement for the very simple in-and-out procedures that were required.  The next stage can be considered in the NDP review happening at the moment.  As referenced earlier by Deputy Burke, there are wider requirements around the country for more inpatient beds and for better quality inpatient beds with more privacy and better infection control, which also needs investment through the NDP.  It can be considered in that context.  The sites are big enough, even as a first phase, if we get the day surgery going which will really help the waiting lists.  Then we can bolt on or have additional in-patient elective work at the same time.</p></speech>

What are their expectations for the future?  To what degree has Sl&aacute;intecare been able to interact with GPs, consultants and nurses, that is, the front-line workers over the difficult last 12 months or more?</p> <p>  There are two major trauma care centres, one in Dublin and one in Cork.  I understand the need for both but is it sufficient to cover the country?</p><p>I got a hint somewhere recently of a comparison with the population of the greater Manchester area, which is correct.  However, there is a vast difference between the delivery of services to an area the size of greater Manchester and an area the size of this country as the logistics in terms of geographic cover are vastly different.  I would like clarification on that point.</p><p> With regard to residential mental healthcare for child and adolescent patients, residential places are non-existent at present and there is a huge crisis in that area, in particular for severely affected patients and those with emergency needs.  Extraordinary things are happening and have been brought to the attention of my office.  While I do not want to delay the meeting, there is an urgent and pressing need to deal with that situation to ensure the patients in question have a place to go in terms of residential care, and we must recognise that the problems become even more complex as patients get older.</p><p> That is enough for the moment.  If I can ask more questions later, I will try to do so.</p></speech>

There is a lot in that.  We are very pleased with the availability of funding this year but there will need to be substantially more investment, particularly if we are to get the waiting lists down.  As I referenced, it is a multi-annual plan.  What we are doing now is putting in place the capacity to deal with the increase in population even since the Oireachtas report was written.  That has brought us up to a level playing field and the staff are being hired for that as we speak, as I referenced earlier.  However, there is a backlog and it has to be invested in, so that will have to be considered by the Government to see if the appetite is there to do that.  That will be a separate application.</p> <p>  In terms of liaising with the front-line people, and not just during the pandemic, it has been incredibly difficult, although we have had substantial engagement with general practice through the pandemic in establishing a general practice research hub.</p></speech>

I just meant we were not going out into the hospitals or meeting them in communities during the pandemic.</p> <p>  There are to be two major trauma centres and we know the Government recently decided on that.  This will require substantial investment and that is in line with the policy outlined by the trauma review.  That is the policy that is being followed and invested in, which is good news.</p> <p>  We require more residential care but, again, there has been investment through the national development plan for residential placements.  We can come back with the detail of where that is happening or being proposed.</p></speech>

Does she see them as part of the plan?  A project was undertaken and a report produced by UCD.  Has it has been progressed?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the two major trauma centres.  The point was made by previous speakers in regard to elective care.  I think there is a problem, from my experience as a public representative.  Obviously, the ambulance services will have to be involved, and they will be.  However, invariably and inevitably, there will be situations where two or three urgent cases require attention at the same time and it is not going to be possible to deal with all of them.  I ask that this be looked at again because I foresee the need for another major trauma centre.  It is a long way to the south west or the north west, and we have the Northern Ireland situation as well.  I ask that this be done.</p></speech>

Senior Saolta officials have commented to me that the plans Sl&aacute;intecare has presented were not what they envisaged or what is required for Galway or the region.  Have they expanded on that?

There is an acknowledgement that day surgery is required, so there is no denying that we need more day surgery happening all around the country and that that will help waiting lists.  The issue is that the larger capacity requirements that Galway and, indeed, Cork have are outside the day surgery proposal.  Therefore, they need to be considered as part of the national development plan.  It is not that one model is wrong and one model is right.  There is a recognition that what is being proposed in elective day surgery is additional to what is there at the moment, and that it will create capacity and free up capacity in existing hospital theatres, for example, and free up existing day surgery beds.  However, it is not everything and we are not saying this is everything that is required.  We recognise there is a need for additional investment in both Cork and Galway.</p><p>As I said, the first action was to ensure the site chosen is big enough.  We are trying to ensure the proposal being offered by Cork and Galway, which is a different idea, can progress in tandem if the funding is there with the elective surgery proposal.  They should not be seen in competition but rather as complementary.  We have reached that level of understanding, I suppose, with both Galway and Cork and the discussions are proceeding in a good way.</p><p> Over the next number of weeks we are trying to prepare the plan for the consideration of everybody, including the funders, Oireachtas Members, the Government, etc.</p></speech>

The diagram indicates that selective day surgery plus minor see and treat, which is the chosen model for Galway, Cork and Dublin is one place above a minor injuries unit and three places below a full service elective hospital.  There is a bit of confusion in terms of what that means or what will or will not take place.</p></speech>

These are not simply minor injury units.  They are elective centres where anaesthesia is required but not an overnight stay.  They would include cataract procedures, for example.  There are approximately 400 different procedures proposed to be undertaken here.  I can send on those details.  To be very clear, these are fully operational theatres with the full specification.  This is not about minor injury clinics or units.</p></speech>

It is not three places down anywhere.  These will be fully functional elective hospital centres but there would be no overnight stays in their current form.  As I say, there is no problem if we can come up with an additional project dovetailing with our project, subject to funding, Government agreement, etc.</p></speech>

What other technology or plans are in the pipeline related to Sl&aacute;intecare?  Has there been any change in plans or strategy as a result of learning from the Covid-19 pandemic?  The conversation has sped along when it comes to telemedicine.  Have the witnesses any further thoughts on that?</p> <p>  I will follow up Deputy Shortall's question around user fees as I know the witness was tight on time.  She might want to elaborate on that.  There has been quite a lively outcry online relating to consultant Sl&aacute;intecare contracts, so what is the plan to deal with that?  I have certainly been contacted by a number of people who have expressed concerns around them.  What will happen in that area?</p> <p>  A question has arisen a couple of times when speaking about Sl&aacute;intecare, which is supposed to be a public health service model for all, but there will still be private health insurance.  How do the witnesses envisage these living together?  I am struggling somewhat to see how we will have a Sl&aacute;intecare model working to the effectiveness we want it to if there is a private health insurance sector also pushing and shoving in that space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#K00800"><p>The first question concerned telemedicine and the eHealth Ireland programme.  The Senator is correct that during the Covid-19 pandemic these have been fast-tracked and demonstrated to have worked extremely well.  There will be no going back from that.  The original plan holds firm as we need a shared care record and systems in place in hospitals and the community to contribute to the shared care record so that no matter where somebody goes, he or she can have a record.  People should not be asked the same question over and over.  That original plan still holds true and, as I said, some of it was fast-tracked as a result of Covid-19 requirements for remote consultations and not meeting people in public, etc.</p> <p>  We have details of our eHealth programme if the Senator is interested in following up.  I apologise as we expected our eHealth person, Mr. Niall Sinnott, to join us but he is speaking about the vaccination certificate as we speak.  We need to excuse him for not joining us.  If any follow-up is required, I am very happy to take that.</p> <p>  The second question concerned the consultant contract.  We have issued the contract to the representative bodies and we are really hoping for dialogue, as I indicated earlier.  There is room for movement on the non-Government policy decision areas and for substantial discussion or engagement.  We really hope people will see the benefit of that.  We have had feedback from many consultants who are positively disposed to the contract that this will give more security and it is a comparative rate internationally.  They have indicated there are good supports with the basic salary.  We really need the support of the consultant body and would really welcome further engagement with It.</p> <p>  On the question of the separation of public and private services, there has never been an argument with Sl&aacute;intecare that there should no private care.  Deputy Shortall is more versed in this than I but the framework was that there should be clear separation of private and public so there is no conflict.  That is the question behind the consultant contract and that there should be no real conflict between treating somebody in the public hospital in six weeks or treating the same person in a private hospital tomorrow.  That is the real issue at stake.  The goal of Sl&aacute;intecare is to separate public and private and not to eliminate private care.  It is about ensuring there is no conflict and that public patients can be prioritised in public hospitals.</p></speech>

There is an aspiration to reduce fees over time and it will have to be a submission in this round.</p></speech>

The presentation was really interesting and I, like others, would love to have had more time to listen and get a bit more detail.  The witnesses are doing phenomenal work so I thank them for that.  I am particularly interested in the treatment of alcohol harm.  I worked closely with others on the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 and alcohol has had major public health implications in Ireland.  The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions.  These include diseases like liver cirrhosis, heart disease and cancers.  Three people per day die from alcohol-related issues, amounting to 88 deaths per month or 1,000 per year.  There are 900 people in Ireland diagnosed with alcohol-related cancers each year, which is quite shocking, and 500 people die from these diseases each year.  One in eight breast cancers is alcohol-related.  That may only be the tip of the iceberg.  One in every two pedestrians killed on the road dies as a result of an incident involving drink-driving.</p> <p>  There is a major cost to health arising from alcohol.  Alcohol-related discharges from hospitals cost the Exchequer &euro;1.5 billion in 2012, which is quite shocking.</p><p> I have another question after my next one and it, too, will be on alcohol.  From Sl&aacute;intecare's point of view, what will be put in place?  There is a lot of focus on obesity, which is fantastic.  The question of eating disorders also needs to be examined.  What can be put in place to deal with the major impact of alcohol harm on public health?  I am concerned that alcohol harm done to family members of alcohol abusers is not often visible.  It can have very serious consequences for the safety and well-being of family members.  Children in particular are very vulnerable.  Alcohol is a significant contributor to child neglect, for example.  Parental drinking has been identified as a key child welfare issue.  It contributes to many assaults, including sexual assaults, and rape, domestic violence and manslaughter.  It can go on and on.  One thousand five hundred beds are taken up every day because of alcohol-related harm.  I did not hear anything about this.  Does it fall under mental health services?  Where does it fit in?</p></speech>

It crosses several areas.  One of the biggest opportunities is within the healthy communities context.  We are working at local level with community groups and across agencies.  For example, we are working with Tusla and social welfare colleagues, especially in respect of children and vulnerable families.  Within the healthy communities context, we have an opportunity because we will have co-ordinators at local level who will link with the relevant agencies to focus on prevention.  It has to be done really carefully, however, working with communities and families and through agencies and local bodies.  That is where the opportunity lies.  We can certainly consider specific initiatives in that regard.</p></speech>

The key is working with the alcohol and drugs task forces locally but also creating multi-agency responses.  We are aware that alcohol contributes to adverse childhood experiences that can have a significant health impact across the life course.  It is definitely about finding the preventive focus before alcohol becomes an issue in the family and home.</p></speech>

It is a matter of keeping that in mind.  One thousand five hundred hospital beds are taken up every day because of alcohol harm, not addiction.  That is a very high number.  It is shocking.</p> <p>  The main aim of Sl&aacute;intecare is to provide universal access to timely, quality integrated care for everyone in Ireland.  The lack of investment in and funding for our Sharing the Vision policy has been heavily criticised.  How do the delegates believe we should strategise for the increased need for timely and early interventional mental health services after Covid?  We are aware of the mental health impact of Covid and the restrictions.  We are heading for a tsunami in the future.  What has been put in place in this regard?</p></speech>

Ms Pigott might refer to the oversight work.  Investment is one aspect.  I will not be popular for saying the siloed nature of funding in some of the mental health services is also contributing to some of the issues.  We fund mental health services in primary care.  We fund through prevention and secondary care.  I am told by those in general practice that the path between general practice and where a patient is directed is not always clear.  Therefore, we have some work to do on pathways of care for people with mental health issues, from the early talk therapies right through to psychological interventions in the community and psychiatry, etc.  A body of work has to be done on the pathways so it will not simply be about investment, although investment is needed also.</p> <p>  Sharing the Vision is committed to.  It is in the programme for Government.  Ms Pigott, who is on my team, is on the oversight group.  Does she want to add anything to that?</p></speech>

The oversight group was set up at the end of 2020.  Of the recommendations in Sharing the Vision, 83 are HSE-led.  The HSE is drafting an implementation plan for the period 2021 to 2023 and wants to hold workshops in June.  The focus of the implementation committee is on monitoring and making sure we see the impacts of the investment made in implementing the recommendations in Sharing the Vision.  The other recommendations in Sharing the Vision are linked to either Healthy Ireland or other areas and voluntary sectors.  They are all being progressed.  That work is going well.  We meet monthly to consider progress and to steer in respect of what else needs to be set up, including specialist subgroups, to progress various actions.</p></speech>

How does she see it all playing out?  Community-based mental health services will be vital.  What is Ms Magahy's view on this in light of the current crisis?</p></speech>

Through the enhanced community care fund, allied funds and the community care networks, there is funding for community services.  There has been a bit of a lack of focus on the earlier stages, such as the talk therapies, which we would like to see scaled up.  We invested in the likes of Jigsaw and other talk therapies, especially for young people, LGBTQ people, etc.  I would like to see them scaled up.  We are determining how they might be mainstreamed through the next phase.  They showed very good results.  Young people absolutely appreciate and need an instant response rather than being told to wait for a week or whatever for a more in-depth service.  These approaches have been shown to work.  We have embarked on scaling them up right across the country.</p></speech>

It does not get any Government support whatsoever.  It has six to eight therapists but it also has a waiting list.  There is something not right about that picture at this time.  This needs to be addressed.  The organisation does phenomenal work.  It is more of an intervention organisation.  It stops the intergenerational trauma caused by addiction.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I realise that there were IT issues but the update was comprehensive.  We appreciate that.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  The first is on the mid-west region, where I am from.  As our guests will know, there has been an ongoing difficulty with the accident and emergency unit at University Hospital Limerick.  A 60-bed modular unit was built there in the past 12 months or so.  It has helped somewhat.  A new 90-bed accident and emergency facility has been committed to for Limerick.  Could we have an update on this project?  When can the people of Clare, Limerick and the rest of the mid-west region expect the facility to be up and running to deal once and for all with waiting lists at the accident and emergency unit at Limerick hospital?</p> <p>  My second question is on waiting lists and prevention.</p><p>I would like to focus on the issue of sight loss in this regard.  The statistics tell us that for 80% of people who lose their sight in this country, it can be prevented.  For four out of every five people who go blind or suffer serious vision impairment in this country, it can be prevented with early intervention.  Has Sl&aacute;intecare done any work on ensuring that there is early diagnosis and early intervention?  I refer to both education and early intervention because it is known that people do not get their sight checked often enough and sometimes, conditions like diabetic retinopathy and so on are diagnosed when it is too late and interventions will have only a limited, if any, effect.</p></speech>

I am pleased to say that the chronic disease management programme has been substantially funded.  When we talk about the enhanced community care programme, two major parts of it are the integrated care programme for older people and the chronic disease programme, of which diabetes control and, therefore, the retinopathy programme is a key part.  We referenced earlier 96 community healthcare networks.  What is being put in place as a key part of that are 32 specialist hubs for the integrated care programme for older people and chronic disease management, specifically, between the hospital and the community, in order that they work between the different settings on those different pieces.</p> <p>  It is interesting.  There has been a lot of proof through the integration funds projects about the necessity for early intervention and, as I say, putting that in place.  The Senator referenced retinopathy.  Another downstream effect of diabetes is, for example, investment in podiatry and the diabetic foot.  There is a whole load of individual initiatives happening around diabetes control and chronic disease management that is funded and that one will see in place by the end of this year.</p></speech>

In terms of waiting lists in general, obviously, we are getting information through our offices that there will be a chronic problem with waiting lists and that they are increasing dramatically because of the pandemic and the lack of movement for significant periods over the past 12 to 18 months.  Has Sl&aacute;intecare specific targeted measures to try to deal with the waiting lists?  Is there anything happening through Sl&aacute;intecare, based on the experience of the pandemic, to deal with waiting lists in general?</p></speech>

Maybe the slides were not great at the beginning.  We were saying that there is a waiting lists programme in place that is targeting hospital waiting lists, community and all kinds of waiting lists to make sure that they are driven down over the next four years.  We have, literally in the past two months, done a call-out to every community healthcare organisation asking it to show us your waiting lists, asking what are the plans, whether permanent capacity is required, what is it and whether a temporary injection is needed to drive them down.  I stated earlier that we would be bringing up a multi-annual waiting list programme to Government for consideration.</p></speech>

They are looking to roll that out to hospitals around the country.  Has Ms Magahy any information on where we are with that because I understand the HSE has committed to funding these ECLO officers, basically, officers who give advice to people on step-down supports and services after they have been diagnosed with sight loss?</p></speech>

To follow-on on the waiting lists, I am told that there are almost 900,000 people on the waiting lists at present.  That is down to Covid, certainly.  It has tested our healthcare system and pushed it to the brink.  We have also seen embargoes on staff recruitment, pay issues, a specialist retention crisis and a lack of investment in physical capacity all contribute to a weakened health service.  We need to invest in capacity, in beds, theatres, equipment and staffing levels and some of the things we have covered here today.</p> <p>  The stated objective of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan for the next two years is to have no outpatient waiting for more than ten weeks for a procedure.  How likely is it that we will reach that target?  While Ms Magahy stated earlier on that it is over four years, that target was two years.</p> <p>  It was mentioned by a number of the members today that under a Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation, the Government set a target for overall mental health funding of 10% by 2025.  That is four years away.  Mental health receives less than 2% of Sl&aacute;intecare funding and the budgetary allocation of &euro;50 million for mental health care is only 1% of the overall health budget for 2021.  Many would say that it is a failed opportunity to significantly increase the funding for mental health services.  What practical evidence has Ms Magahy that the Government will come close to the 10% target?  Is Ms Magahy aware of or has she seen any plans on how we would reach this 10%?  We as a committee have set up a sub-committee on mental health because of the overall challenges that we face as a committee in that regard, not only from Covid but, as other members have said, from other challenges in society as well.  Covid has put everything related to services under pressure with staffing being allocated to different areas etc.  Is there a particular plan for that?</p> <p>  Lastly, Ms Magahy made the point about Mr. Niall Sinnott not being able to attend today as he is doing something on the vaccination certificate.  One of challenges we have faced as a committee is a result of the malware situation.  We were hoping to have the HSE in.  We had been hoping to have the Department of Health in, possibly tomorrow.  It will not happen.  Is there a briefing available?  If Ms Magahy could forward that on to us, it would be helpful.</p> <p>  As public representatives, but also as a committee, we are being asked constantly.  People want to travel.  As regards the travel certificate, what will be put in place?  There is a complete lack of information available and anything that we could put through our own system would be helpful.</p> <p>  If Ms Magahy could answer those two questions, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060900002#M01300"><p>We can certainly get the committee as much information as we have on the Covid certificate.  I will ask Mr. Sinnott to forward that on, if that is okay.</p> <p>  On the 10% of the overall funding, what we would need to do is double-check that we are comparing the right percentages.  At the back of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, it shows what the additional funding for Sl&aacute;intecare was but we did not include what is in the base for mental health.  To make sure that we are comparing like with like, I would like to run the figures and come back to the committee on that to see what mental health spending is as an overall percentage of the total budget for health, as opposed to only the additional piece that was invested in.  It is fair to say that there was a focus on community staffing in this year's budget because it had been so chronically underfunded.  That is not to say that mental health should not get additional funding as well.  Let me come back to the committee on the percentage issue, if that is okay.</p> <p>  On the waiting list numbers, there are approximately 600,000 waiting for an outpatient appointment and 90,000 people waiting for inpatient or day-case procedures, and scopes make up the balance.</p><p>There has been a deterioration in the waiting list numbers as a result of Covid-19 and the fact many of the operations were cancelled.  Before Covid-19 hit, substantial inroads had been made in reducing the inpatient waiting list - significant progress had been made - by the tens of thousands.  Obviously, that was paused due to Covid-19.  The Chair is right in that many of the staff were diverted, especially from regular community interventions, so those have been exacerbated as well.</p><p> Going back to the beginning of the meeting, that is why we have put such an emphasis on the access and multi-annual waiting list programme, which is about increasing supply of staff and facilities and reducing demand by putting a focus on prevention and trying to get people the care at an earlier time, rather than it hitting the crisis point.  It is an ambitious plan which is just reaching finalisation.</p><p> The final point is the waiting lists, bad and all as they were as a result of Covid-19, have again been exacerbated by the cyberattack, because many of the outpatient appointments were cancelled.  It has compounded the issue and is even more reason to put a focus on it, which we have done and are doing.  When we come to Government looking for multi-annual support, we would greatly appreciate the committee's support on that.</p></speech>

The question we all ask is whether they are being built.  There was little talk on the role of local authorities.  It is the basic things that people in hospitals need, such as a ramp, a door widened, a shower, a possible extension and so on.  This is where the joined-up thinking comes in, so people do not have to wait three months for a ramp and even longer for a shower or an extension.  One could be waiting years for a lift to get someone up and down the stairs.</p> <p>  We have been dealing with elected representatives and in many cases, people are only getting these when they are at end of life.  They are not getting the opportunity.  We need champions on that.  That is all part of Ms Magahy's work, but I do not believe we are building these age-friendly homes and what has been thrown up throughout this city and many parts of Ireland is not age-friendly and we are not building for the future, we are building for speculators and others, certainly not long-term investment in our population.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right in that it is a key part of every part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We have funded the age-friendly piece, in particular, through the local authorities.  Its position is sponsored by Meath County Council.  We have put in place 11 - Mr. Straton can correct me - age-friendly housing co-ordinators.  Their job is to go out to see if the existing houses fit for purpose, for older people in particular and to put in place the infrastructure needed, in advance of somebody falling, ending up in hospital and waiting to come home and if he or she cannot come home, having to go into a nursing home.</p> <p>  This is exactly why we have put this in place.  It will have a proper impact on ordinary people's lives.  We had a report this morning from the man who is managing the programme to say it had already received 600 references from within the local authorities, for people who want the services.  The services can be retrofit from the perspective of energy or the suitability of the house, or a link to the integrated care programme for older people to give people clinical services, if they are needed.</p> <p>  The local authorities are a key part of what we are doing and the work Mr. Straton, my colleague, is about in the Healthy Ireland team.  We have Healthy Ireland co-ordinators in every local authority and the healthy communities will be housed by representatives through the local authorities structure, because we can see health is only a tiny part of the impact of how well somebody is.  It is the wider determinants, such as housing, education and all of that stuff we talked about, which has an even bigger impact on how well somebody can live in their own community, so we are linked-in with the local authority structure.  I would like to assure the Chair on that.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome to the meeting Mr. David McRedmond, CEO of An Post, and Ms Debbie Byrne, managing director of An Post retail.  You are both very welcome and I thank you for coming along today.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make the person or the entity identifiable, or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name to the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as if they were physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of how their domestic law might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of their constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member, regrettably, to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, any member who is participating by Teams would confirm that he or she is on the grounds of Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anybody watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I as the Chair and the necessary staff essential to running the meeting are physically present in the room, and these are the two committee clerks.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. McRedmond to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee members, Deputies and Senators.  I am very pleased to be with the committee this morning.  I will give a brief overview of where An Post is right now and what we see as our challenges.  Ms Byrne will then take the committee through where the post office network is, and its challenges.</p> <p>  As an overview of 2021 our annual report says that through the pandemic An Post in many ways discovered its soul, the soul of a public service.  We showed social solidarity, we were imaginative in responding to citizens&rsquo; needs, and we were empathetic in every community.  We were resourceful in self-sufficiency and we were industrious to scale the seismic logistical challenges we faced.</p> <p>  The transformation of An Post from 2017 to 2020 was the key for us in the pandemic.  It meant that we built up our balance sheet to be strong enough to be able to invest the &euro;50 million it cost us to get through Covid.  This meant that unlike almost any other postal service in Europe, we managed to keep our post office network and our delivery networks open all the time.</p><p>We calculate that was the case for 99% of routes and 99% of post offices.  That is a considerable of achievement by the people in the company I am lucky to lead.</p><p> Our infrastructure was invested in just in time to be able to deliver.  Of course, none of us could have anticipated the surge in parcels as we kept Ireland trading.  The only way to get anything other than groceries during the lockdowns was to have it delivered and most of that was delivered by An Post.  We opened our parcel hub in October 2019.  There are two major machines and the second only opened in October 2020.  I am delighted that we managed to achieve that just in time to allow us to deliver over Christmas.</p><p> We showed solidarity with citizens.  We stood up, in particular, for older and vulnerable customers in both of our networks.  We supported SMEs with grants and discounts on parcels, postage and stamps, and with direct mail and expert advice.  We also ensured the health and well-being of our employees.</p><p> Our transformation has accelerated all the time.  The switch from an old letters business to a modern e-commerce and logistics business massively accelerated.  The volume of parcels we had in 2020 was not anticipated until 2024 or 2025.  The post office network had to show dexterity to get through this period.  Sustainability was at our core and it will be something both Ms Byrne and I will emphasise in terms of how we build for the future.  Sustainability is at the core of Government strategy.</p><p> Finally on this point, we were commercially successfully and self-sufficient.  We had no access to, or call on, State subsidies, nor had we call on furlough payments or the pandemic unemployment, PUP, for any of our staff.  We are proud that we managed to get through that.</p><p> There has been transformation in recent years and our revenue has increased by &euro;90 million over the past five years.  The reality is that there has been a decline in letter volumes of 30% and &euro;120 million in real terms.  With that in mind, we have added revenue of &euro;210 million in five years, adding approximately 25% to our base.  That is a massive turnaround for a company, particularly one as old as An Post.</p><p> We delivered a profit of &euro;916 million before depreciation, which for us is the key metric as it is the closest proxy to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA, in 2020.  There was a loss after depreciation of &euro;10 million but that will turn around this year, as we will see.  We have cash on our balance sheet.  Our pension scheme is fully funded.  In fact, it is over-funded at 102%.  As I said, 99% of post office routes were open.  Our financial performance was strong and would have been stronger if we had not decided to set aside &euro;50 million as a response to Covid-19.  That money included &euro;10 million for personal protective equipment, PPE, and &euro;8 million for staff cover because we had complicated arrangements with social distancing.  We forfeited a price increase, and only introduced it in the past two weeks, because we did not want citizens to be hit with price increases when they were in lockdown.  The impact of Covid on post offices, which Ms Byrne will cover, was quite severe because of a change in social welfare scheduling and the general effects of the pandemic, including, in particular, no foreign exchange, which is a big business line for us.</p><p> The good news is we have started 2021 very well.  Trading has been very strong and our revenues are up 11% compared with the same period in 2020 on a like-for-like basis.  Our operating profit is &euro;4 million ahead.  We are performing strongly in profit and growth.  As the business normalises and price increases are reinstated, we expect this year to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability.  The strategy has been accelerated, with the switch to e-commerce, more banking services through post offices and the rapid development of digital infrastructure.</p><p> The second part of our submission related to our strategy, going forward.  We outlined six big moves.  We will increase profitability through a remodelled logistics network.  We will provide an advanced digital platform.  Digital is, in many ways, the key to the future of both of our networks because it provides a seamless way to have physical transactions with customers and conduct business online.  The growth of An Post commerce, which is our delivery business for Irish businesses and consumers, and its expansion into international supply chains, will be important.  Small businesses, in particular, now realise what an essential infrastructure An Post is.  Ms Byrne will take the committee through the transformed and sustainable post office network and the expanded range of services under the better banking with An Post initiative.  We will also have an expert, lean corporate centre for a post-Covid world.</p><p> The delivery service of the business will provide more choice and value for customers with future-proofed services.  We will have the best delivery manager.  If someone is getting a parcel delivered, and the same will soon apply to letters, he or she will be able to know when it is being delivered, when a delivery has been collected and will be able to choose a delivery time, etc.  Some of that can be done now but we aim to have the best system available anywhere in the market.</p><p> We are going to rebuild our network for e-commerce.  All committee members have delivery units in their constituencies, most of those which are sub-scale or in the wrong place for a parcel service because they were built out for letters.  There will be a massive change in property.  We will have to exit a number of properties, enter new ones and create a network that is future proof.</p><p> We will help businesses to thrive with integrated products.  An Post commerce will launch in the next few weeks to deliver those.  Our business bundle will allow us to clean small businesses's data, print and deliver letters, etc.  We will then connect Irish businesses with the world, helping them scale up and connect with trade around the globe.</p><p> I will stop there and ask Ms Byrne to take the committee briefly through the post office network.  I will then conclude with a few remarks before handing over to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Debbie Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#B00200"><p>As Mr. McRedmond said, we recognise that the post office is a vital national infrastructure.  We are committed to maintaining a strong network of co-located post offices.  That is the strategy in every community of more than 500 people.  We will also ensure there is at least one post office within 15 km of every such community in rural areas and within 3 km in an urban area.  There will be areas such as the islands and other remote areas that will not have a population of 500 but will have a post office because those two parameters are working together.<br/><br/>Since 2018, we have been working on a transformation of the post office which involves significant investment and much work on new products and services, as well as assisting postmasters moving to co-location.  We do not see the future of the network as small, stand-alone post offices because that is not a viable business.  Some 63% of the network is now co-located.  The pandemic got in the way of that expansion because we would have expected that figure to reach 70% last year.  We are working to catch up.  When we most recently analysed co-location, co-located offices were performing 11% better than their stand-alone counterparts.  That shows co-location is working.<br/><br/>What is the post office of the future?  It is a co-located post office with a new range of services.  It will be focused around social welfare, which remains the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre </i>for post offices.  We want to be that backbone.  There have been many changes in social welfare, the bulk of which have been outside our control.  Consumers have opted to have payments, whether the old age pension or children's allowance, paid into their bank accounts.  That is a trend we cannot change.  The PUP that was introduced during the pandemic has adversely affected footfall into post offices because the payment goes into people's bank accounts.</p><p>That has adversely affected footfall in post offices because the payment goes into people's bank accounts.  There will come a time when there is a return to jobseeker's benefit, whatever the amount is.  That will be scaled back from August.  We need those recipients back in post offices.  That is good for the State because it safeguards against fraud as recipients have to present and check that they are not working or residing abroad.  It is a key change we need to reintroduce in order to increase footfall in post offices.</p><p> As Mr. McRedmond said, Covid has interrupted our transformation.  One of the three things that have sadly been hit during Covid was social welfare.  Last year double payments were introduced for a good reason in terms of the safety of citizens.  We managed to get that reverted to single payments in November, but we now need to work with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the PUP and get that footfall back into post offices. </p><p> Another key business line that has been hit is BillPay.  That is very much the social welfare customer who comes into a post office and pays &euro;10 off a utility bill.  There have been two business lines affected by Covid, but there is a fix for that.  The other major hit has been foreign exchange which, as we all know, has been pretty much decimated.  We are the largest provider of foreign exchange cash in the country and would have seen that as a key business line that would grow with the banks getting out of cash services.  It can take time for that to return. </p><p> We are working closely with the Government at the moment to put in place a Covid pandemic fund for postmasters.  That would benefit all offices.  We put the proposal to Government.  It should be approved any day now.  It will be based on the individual mix of an individual post office, such as a post office with a high level of social welfare, foreign exchange, etc.  It will be worked out based on the individual product mix of a business. </p><p> When the current transformation payments run out at the end of June, which has been the subject of a bit of press coverage, the idea would be that the pandemic fund would kick in for 18 months, allow businesses to normalise and, more importantly, allow postmasters to avail of the considerable supports that we have put in place over the past 18 months to two years.  We have invested very heavily in the infrastructure of post offices around co-location with the capital investment fund.  We need to accelerate that again. </p><p> We have also invested significantly in commercial training for postmasters.  That has not been ideal.  We have done it in a virtual world, but it is not the same thing.  We need to equip postmasters with the commercial skills and tools and marketing supports so that they can promote their businesses.  Post offices are businesses, no more than running a caf&eacute; or Spar shop.  We need to equip postmasters with the right tools.  </p><p> We also have a responsibility to introduce new products and services, which we have done with An Post Money.  Our credit card and loan products have gone from success to success.  Our current account figures increased by 40% last year, with those accounts largely being opened in post offices.  We launched a new current account app last week with a &euro;17 million investment.  That will encourage new customers into our current account product, in particular given the consolidation due to Ulster Bank and KBC leaving the market.  We are very actively targeting that customer base. </p><p> We are also looking at new products and services in the areas of mortgages and SME lending, a process which is continuing.  Community banking is a major issue.  There has been a lot of press coverage around the Bank of Ireland deal we have done.  That will launch in August and all of that IT integration and investment is ongoing at the moment.  We will also work with AIB and Ulster Bank to expand the business that we do with them.  </p><p> An important point to note is that as pillar banks consolidate, we have done some mapping which shows that there are 500 post offices which do not have a bank within a 5 km radius.  An Post can be the backbone of community banking in Ireland, whether that involves offering services for pillar banks or our own An Post Money brand, and let us not forget State savings.  Covid has helped with that for postmasters.  The fund now stands at &euro;23 billion.  While Covid has definitely adversely hit us in terms of social welfare payments and foreign exchange, we have seen a big influx of savings into the post office.  That is a new customer base, along with strong growth in mail and parcels during Covid. </p><p> Postmasters have told us younger cohorts are coming into post offices to buy stamps, send parcels and pick up online shopping.  That is good news in terms of a broader demographic of customers outside of a social welfare customer now coming into post offices.  We need to cross-sell such customers Postmobile, a lottery ticket, One4All gift vouchers and all of the other products and services that we offer. </p><p> I will wrap up by returning to Mr. McRedmond's point on sustainability.  We have big ambitions for e-commerce in terms of the post office network being the backbone of online shopping.  We will all return to work and we want the post office to be the place where people pick up online shopping or return a parcel.  Co-located post offices will allow customers to do that through the opening hours of a shop. </p><p> The green hub launched last year puts the post office network and postmasters at the heart of the Government strategy on the green economy.  Our partnership with SSE Airtricity in the area of home upgrades and the best green loan rate in the market, at 4.9%, equips postmasters to go out into communities and sell that product.  I know they were very enthusiastic about that until Covid hit.  Our new children's account, Money Mate, launched last year.</p></speech>

Transformation has created the platform.  In 2020 we lived up to our promise.  Our strategy is accelerating and as our business normalises post-pandemic we expect a return to profitability.  The green light strategy, which is what we call our strategy for the next five years, will see a &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million investment in physical networks and digital infrastructure, a revenue target in excess of &euro;1 billion and a net margin of 7% to 10%.  That programme will secure a sustainable future for our networks and a world-class sustainable infrastructure for Ireland.  I thank the Chairman and am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Witnesses and members have six minutes each.  I ask people be conscious of that because we want to get answers on a range of issues regarding An Post, postmasters and all other queries from the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.779" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#C00700"><p>I thank Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne.  I thank members of An Post, including the Irish Postmasters Union and staff, for the work they have done during the pandemic.  Ms Byrne mentioned scale payments in her contribution.  There is a significant concern that postmasters will lose income.  She might explain to me how they will not lose income because I have been told that they could face a cut of between 20% and 25% in their income from the end of this month.</p> <p>  In the context of the sustainability of the model into the future, Ms Byrne mentioned, in terms of co-location, rural post offices within a 15 km radius.  That is a significant amount of distance for a post office and I believe it is far too much.  I hope that is reconsidered.</p> <p>  As the witnesses will know, the Irish Postmasters Union came before the committee.  We have had a lot of engagement with it.  Does Mr. McRedmond share the view that our post office network is on the brink and at the edge of the cliff, in that 200 post offices could be closed?  I refer to the Grant Thornton report.  What has the board done in the context of Government around engaging in new services?  I will come back in again after the replies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.780" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#C00800"><p>I thank the Senator.  On the post office network, I have been in An Post for four and a half years.</p><p>I have not seen a brighter future for the network than I see now, in two areas in particular.  One is the banking services, which Ms Byrne outlined.  The other is the out-of-home e-commerce.  In Finland, for example, 90% of its e-commerce parcels are delivered out of home, that is, not to people's houses.  It has been easy to deliver parcels during the pandemic because everybody is at home, but that will change.  People's patterns of life will change.  We cannot predict exactly what that will be.  However, I believe they are two big growth areas.  They are in the future.  Emerging from the pandemic is difficult.  We feel for postmasters and the difficult time they have had during the Covid-19 pandemic.  That is why, as Ms Byrne outlined, we have been working with the Government on a post-Covid payment to help during this period.  We cannot go into the details of that yet because it is still under discussion, but we are working hard and actively on that.</p><p> As regards whether there is a future for the post office network, there is.  Will 200 post offices close?  Inevitably, some will close because there are approximately 200 outside of those communities of 500 people or more and some of them are just not viable.  The truth is that if there are three post offices in an area and the three are not viable, but if one closes and that means the other two become viable, that is about us having a really strong network for the future.  Co-location has been a key part of this strategy.  An Post has shown a real commitment to the network, to the brand and to ensuring those products and services are available.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Byrne.</p></speech>

On the point about the scale payments and the income falling at the end of June, we have covered that through the 18-month pandemic fund that will be in place.</p> <p>  As regards the 15 km, that is a minimum.  When there are post office consolidations, there tends to be three post offices within a 10 km radius.  The 15 km is really the outer limit.  Looking at some of the closures over the last two years, the vast majority are 10 km and quite a few are under 5 km and 6 km, so it is the outer limit.  Very few fall into that category.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.783" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#D00300"><p>I have two final questions in the context of the presentations.  The post office cannot cross-sell lottery products as was mentioned.  As regards An Post, consolidation means closure in many cases.  From talking to postmasters at local level and An Post staff, many do not share Mr. McRedmond's optimism about the future.  They are concerned about the change.  I hope that his vision is different from what I am hearing.  I am hearing from people who have spent 30 to 40 years working in An Post, who have been postmasters for 20 to 25 years and people who have worked as postmen and postwomen.  They are concerned.  For example, there is the issue of district sorting offices, DSOs.  Why has there been a concentration of the larger DSOs, with the withdrawal of postmen and postwomen from what are now termed small local post offices to large regional operations, thus further reducing the income of the local post offices and making them unviable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#D00400"><p>One of the interesting things is that when I came to An Post four and a half years ago I was told it was a dying company, like many postal companies.  This is not a criticism of previous management, which did a very fine job of ensuring we had the highest quality service.  However, all postal services were in decline because letter volumes were switching to email and electronic.  That was the decline of An Post.  Likewise, post offices were seen to be in decline, both with regard to whether rural Ireland was in decline or whether certain services were in decline.  In fact, we have seen a reversal.  We have worked very hard to do that.</p> <p>  It is my fault if those people do not see a future.  It is my fault if they are not realising there are long-term prospects.  I have to sell that, and the Senator is quite right to raise it.  I and Ms Byrne have to sell that, and we must be clear that there is a really good future.  However, it is hard work.  It is hard work for every business.  It is hard work if someone is the manager of the Spar or is a butcher.  We have great postmasters who have seen an increase in incomes and are growing their businesses.  We must now support and strengthen that.  We will support it in every way we can.  I look to this committee for positivity about that future, which is important, while I respect the views the committee is getting from postmasters.  We have to sell that.</p> <p>  There is a difficult period.  Undoubtedly, the next year or 18 months are going to be a difficult period.  However, as the services we have worked hard to bring in proceed, we will see a change.  If the committee looks at our delivery network, it will see that the change to parcels has been quite dramatic.  We have grown our revenues every year for the past four years, so there is a future.</p></speech>

I also thank the witnesses for the number of initiatives they took, some of which were captured in their presentation.  The postcards reflected very well on the organisation.</p> <p>  I want to raise the concerns about the viability of the network.  We heard from the postmasters' union about their legitimate concerns.  They said there is a risk of up to 200 post offices closing across the country.  They said the bigger, busier post offices might be the most vulnerable.  Has Mr. McRedmond heard that concern?  Does he share it?  Does he envisage a spate of post office closures across the country, and to what extent?</p> <p>  I have a question about the triennial reviews.  We have been focused on the transition payment, but I was contacted by a local post office in my constituency of Meath East about its triennial review.  Counter remuneration being reduced had the impact of reducing its income by &euro;30,000 per year.  It is a busy post office in an urban setting.  Is that similar to experiences elsewhere throughout the country?  To what degree has counter remuneration reduced across the post office network as part of the triennial reviews?  What funding has been taken out of the post office network relating to counter transactions and counter remuneration?  That is a significant point relating to the viability of the network.</p></speech>

I reiterate the comments I have made on the future viability of the network, which I see as being strong.  I will hand over to Ms Byrne who will answer more fully.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.794" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Debbie Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#E00200"><p>Several questions have been asked.  One was on postmaster remuneration and another on the size of the network.  I will deal with the size of the network first.  For want of a better phrase, we have a two-tier network.  We have approximately 300 postmasters on the old contract, which is where they have this triennial review.  The rest of the offices are on the new contract, which came into effect in 2018 and was voted for by a 70:30 majority of Irish Postmasters Union members.  The old contract reviews postmasters' income every three years.  These postmasters have not been affected by the pandemic because their incomes are cushioned for three years.  The plan with the pandemic recovery fund is that if somebody was up for review this year they would avail of the pandemic fund so that the hit to social welfare transactions would not reduce their income.</p> <p>  We then come to the new commercial contract, whereby postmasters are paid per transaction for the business they do every week and every month.  No postmaster on this has seen his or her income reduced because the three-year deal had a top-up mechanism that guaranteed people's income to 2019 levels.  It is true to say the top-up has reduced to 50%.  During Covid, postmasters saw a bit of a drop off.  The 50% top-up would have been fine because of the new services but the decrease in social welfare and foreign exchange transactions meant there was a Covid hit.</p> <p>  The idea is that from the end of June the pandemic fund will cushion postmasters for another 18 months.  I would love to see the detail of this but we cannot get into individual post offices.  There is no way an urban post office has seen a decline of &euro;30,000 because they have been cushioned by the top-up mechanism, unless it was a very busy social welfare office that was badly hit last year because of the move to double payments.  The idea with the pandemic fund is to normalise it for 18 months.</p> <p>  When postmasters in urban areas tender their resignations, for whatever reason, the posts are advertised and we tend to have two to three applications.  In a minority of cases we may not get a suitable applicant because there is no Spar or Centra with the space.  We work very hard to fill these vacancies.  Having two, three or four applications for a post office shows people see a viable future in them.  There are 110 postmasters on the new contract who were not in receipt of transformation payments because they came on after the agreement.  They have been making a viable living.</p> <p>  Post offices vary from town to town based on the demographics of the area and the skill of the postmasters.  It is our job to work with postmasters.  Some are more commercial and are taking on and managing three or four post offices because they see it as a viable business but others are not and perhaps need more help.  We help them to work on selling skills and on how to manage and run a business.  We are there to give this support and local marketing tools.  For example, with our new money mate accounts for children we give the post offices tools and flyers to use in their local communities to promote their business.  We have also supplied them with direct mail so they can market to small businesses when they return to their offices.  We enable them to sell labels at a discount to those with an advantage card and mail media with publicity posts.  Postmasters can now offer a local clothes shop tools to promote the business and the post office gets a commission.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne for joining us.  I join others in saying we have truly seen the very best of our postmen and postwomen over the past 15 months as they have crisscrossed the country.  Many of their calls more than delivered something through the letterbox as there were very strong social and caring aspects to them.</p> <p>  I have some quick questions for Ms Byrne and I would then like to follow up with substantive issues.  How many post offices closed without reopening during the past 15 months?</p></speech>

Some of the positions are still in the advertising process to be filled and the rest were filled.  Of the ten that closed, we had no suitable applicants for six and four were in the rural consolidation areas and the business has transferred to a nearby post office.  Those nearby post offices are very happy to get the business and it will ensure they survive.</p></speech>

The committee has asked this question repeatedly, and I want to ask it directly today.  There has been a 15 month period of unprecedented challenge and difficulty for the entire country.  Is the organisation prepared to look at these four post offices, in particular Broadford post office in my constituency, which closed after 190 years.  Is An Post willing to re-examine these four post offices?  They need to be looked at in a different light.  During the Covid pandemic we have seen many businesses close their doors but An Post needs to see these in a different light.  Are the witnesses willing to look at these four specific cases and the post office in Broadford with regard to reopening them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#E01000"><p>The short answer is "No".  This sounds very harsh but there is a reason for it.  Four years ago, we did a deal with the Irish Postmasters Union.  We agreed a protocol.  It took three months to negotiate.  It was mediated by a senior counsel.  It was a protocol for the future of the post office network.  It set down criteria for this, and these are the criteria that Ms Byrne took the committee through, including the distances between post offices and that they serve communities of 500 or more.  The reason we have to be so strict about this is because there are 931 post offices and 931 communities and we have to be fair.  We have to break this dynamic.  Members appreciate the pressure they themselves are under and what they want to do for their communities.  As soon as we reopen one post office we will have to go through all of the cases.</p><p>We will have to go through, not just the ten that Ms Byrne talked about but the 192 that have closed since July 2018.  We would have to go through each of them and answer for each of them so we have to stick by that criteria.  That was a solemn agreement with postmasters which was registered through mediation.  That is why we have to do it, to make sure we have a functioning network.</p></speech>

Ireland is like a jigsaw and if one takes one piece out, it has an effect on the adjoining piece.  That is what happened in Clare.  One can talk about business viability and all of that but the reality in the Broadford case was that An Post had a contract and was willing to stay with it and keep it operational.  However, a person became unwell and decided to retire from the position and An Post seized on the opportunity to close the branch permanently.  There is something wrong in that.  If one looks at the 15 km rule, if that misfortune had befallen another family in the neighbouring village, An Post would have closed that post office and then Broadford would have survived.  There is a bit of cherry picking going on here because 15 km works in a radius format - close one and it saves the other or <i>vice versa</i>.  That is totally unviable.  I do not think anyone would enter the profession of postmaster or postmistress knowing that the network is subject to constant review and that if one closes, the other survives.  It is a survival of the fittest model and is not a business model in the true sense.  It is the survival of the fittest and if a postmaster or postmistress experiences personal misfortune or if, owing to age, he or she needs to retire, the opportunity is seized upon, that jigsaw piece is taken out and the neighbouring office survives.</p><p>Did An Post fund in part, or in full, the Grant Thornton report on the future viability of the post office network?</p></speech>

It was up to individual postmasters to decide whether to sign the contract.  In the letter we sent to them, we urged them to seek separate legal advice themselves and many did so.  A small cohort of approximately 70 postmasters who were offered the new contract did not sign it.  They are independent contractors and we would have been very clear that it was up to them to seek their own advice.  We did, through the IPU, provide some tax advice.  We helped the IPU with regard to tax matters and that advice was supplied to all postmasters but each one made his or her own decision in signing the contract.</p></speech>

If one takes Broadford again and one considers that PostPoint is worth around &euro;1,500 per annum, then that is unviable.  Having three-year review cycles is unviable.  Having a pandemic fund being introduced when we are coming out of the pandemic and other pandemic funds are dropping off is also unviable.  I am concerned about this.  An Post has a great business and a great network of post offices across the country but-----</p></speech>

In particular, An Post needs to go back and look at the four offices that have closed during the pandemic and see them in light of what has happened during that pandemic.  They need to be given a new chance.  I thank Ms Byrne and Mr. McRedmond.</p></speech>

The big issue at the moment is that postmasters all over the country are facing a cliff edge on 1 July.  Ms Byrne made reference to the busier post offices.  I have had interaction with them and many had non-core activities that were giving them additional income which disappeared completely during the pandemic.  Many of them have struggled.  The payment model is an arrears model.  An Post has made a submission to the Government.  Is Mr. McRedmond at liberty to give an indication of the contents of that submission?  What has been the interaction with Government on that?  Reference was made to a pandemic payment.  What exactly is that?</p> <p>  There is concern about 1 July among postmasters in both rural and urban areas.  I am a Deputy living in an urban area in the city of Limerick but I represent a sizeable rural area as well so I see this from every perspective.  On 1 July, what is the payment model going to be for post offices?  People can go to their local post office to post their letters, collect their pensions or other social welfare payments and so on.  I appreciate what Ms Byrne is saying about the PUP.  The witnesses also spoke about co-location but that is more expensive because many postmasters would be renting units within shopping centres.  It is different model.  </p> <p>  In summary, has An Post made a submission to Government?  What is in that submission?  What is An Post asking for?  Is the &euro;17 million referenced in the Grant Thornton report wide of the mark?  What will be in place on 1 July for postmasters all over the country?  How will it differ from what is there at the moment or will it be the same?  Will An Post defer any decisions on a new payment model pending the outcome of the review currently being carried out by the Government?</p></speech>

First, we have engaged extensively with the Government and with senior officials in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  We have also engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who is responsible for An Post.  We have been working on this for some time now.  We have been invited to appear before this committee previously and it is always difficult to come before a committee when one is in the middle of deliberative discussions.  I think committee members will understand that we cannot get into answers while we are in deliberative discussions.  It is particularly important that we get the opportunity to discuss this first with the postmasters and the IPU, which we hope to do very shortly.  We will be doing that almost imminently.  There is no relevance or relation-----</p></speech>

We think An Post will be looking at its own funds, at what we can afford to do and what we consider to be reasonable.  We have to do this in a way that is fair within the context of the structure we had before in terms of contracts and top-up payments.</p></speech>

The balance are on the new commercial contract of being paid per transaction.  The postmasters have received transformation top-up payments over the past three years and that runs out at the end of June, which is the cliff edge that has been painted at 1 July.  The idea is that the pandemic fund will kick in on 1 July.</p></speech>

Basically, there will be a tailored payment for each post office to reflect the forecasted business loss, which refers to the products that have been affected during Covid.  For example, there has been a decline in foreign exchange transactions.  There is also a payment related to the loss of social welfare.  Finally, there is an incentive linked payment of 10% on all services that excludes social welfare, which is to incentivise commercial efforts.  There is a structured deal and a proposal that we have discussed, in outline, with the IPU executive, and that is ultimately covered.</p></speech>

Subsequently, many of those rail lines were taken up and we are now looking to restore them to their original places.  We cannot allow An Post to do the same thing to the post office network and for links to be broken.  That is why it is important that we have an incremental business model.  I feel that the future of An Post is very bright because of that business model and because an ever increasing number of people work remotely from home, particularly in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Finally, where is An Post at with AIB and Bank of Ireland in terms of enhancing  products?</p></speech>

We are looking to enhance the range of services with its withdrawal from the marketplace and there is an active renegotiation of the contract.  It is important for Ulster Bank that there is an enhanced range of services through post offices for a good period.  Similarly, we are having discussions with AIB.  We offer both personal customers and expect more business with them.</p></speech>

Obviously we are talking about closures because the IPU has told us that 200 post offices are in danger of closing.  The Cathaoirleach, like many others, has dealt with the fact that the transformation will end and talked about the pandemic fund.</p> <p>  Let us deal with the revenue that post offices no longer receive from handling welfare and foreign exchange transactions, which have not occurred for more than a year.  Will the fund give postmasters in each individual post office operation the same moneys that they would have received from the transformation payment?</p></speech>

To a degree, postmasters would claim that they have not secured great deals down the years and now their workload has increased.  On a regular straightforward transaction when people pay their bill, postmasters get 10 cent.  On the likes of an insurance referral, postmasters get the cost of a cup of tea.  Like everybody, postmasters have increased costs.  We can all talk about co-location but individual operators must ensure that they can cover their rates, pay, insurance and other costs.  How can postmasters deal with that?  A major part of this will be the fact that services will be online.</p><p>The individual postmasters are not going to get the detail on negotiations with the banks but those services are to be welcomed.  Has An Post spoken to the Government about any other extra services?  What is the likely pay-off for postmasters?  I am just talking about ensuring sustainability because we have already talked about the closures that have happened.  Mr. McRedmond said there have been 192 since July 2018.  How many post offices does he foresee closing into the future?  People are going to retire and so on.  The witnesses are aware of the criteria and I assume they have been taken into account in the game plan.  I am just afraid of what the outworkings are going to be.</p></speech>

I have been before this committee several times talking about the importance of emphasising the use of the post office and that people should use their own post office network.  It is a national network.  There is a harp above the door and it is there for a reason.  I am grateful to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising the issue of Government services because it is a very important pillar of the post office network.  Sometimes the post office network is seen as something that is just used for so-called offline services or physical services.  We prefer to use the term "omnichannel", which reflects how people lead their lives nowadays.  They might order something online and pick it up from somewhere.  There is a mixture of the physical and the digital.  In An Post, we have invested massively in our digital infrastructure.  We have a first-class digital team and one of the best digital officers.  I ask any members who are involved with any Department, if there is a need for digital and physical infrastructure, An Post is there and we are ready to provide that.  We have been in discussions with the Government around a framework.  I ask Ms Byrne to take us through that.</p></speech>

We have talked about banking services and e-commerce.  The missing part of the strategy is the delivery of Government services.  A new departmental working group or committee was recently set up, which is chaired by Barry Lowry, the chief information officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and includes the new assistant secretary in the Department.  That group brought in a number of experts over the last number of months.  We have not had the opportunity to meet with the group ourselves but we wold love to do so and are working on that.  It is due to deliberate in July.  That is important.  Everybody talks about new services in the post offices but there have not been any.  An Post has delivered lot of new products and services but we need to be an arm of the Government, deliver more services and provide a better service to citizens.  If I wanted to get a new driving licence, there are 60-odd offices across the country where I could do that.  Would it not be better if people could go to one of 300 post offices?  Granted, we are not going to put photo capture kit into 930 offices but there are many other services they could provide, like dealing with planning applications.  With the hybrid working model we have now, there will be a lot of Government and local offices across the country where full services will not be available because their staff will be working from home for whatever the designated period of time is.  There is an opportunity there for post offices to offer a wider range of services.  The technical infrastructure is there and it is robust because of our interactions with social welfare and the major banks.  This is a real opportunity to better serve communities.  We welcome the Deputy's support on this matter.</p></speech>

It needs to happen.  Whatever services can be provided should be, as well as the stuff that is happening with the one-stop shops and green hubs and so on.  An issue that has been put to me is that there needs to be an element of audit, whether by the Labour Court or otherwise, on the rates of pay in post offices.  We are talking about sustainability.  Some transactions are being conducted multiple times but the postmasters get very little money for them.  Can that be looked at and renegotiated from a point of view of delivering a sustainable service?  Does Mr. McRedmond have a number as regards the closures we could be looking at in the long term, on the basis of how things are and the criteria as set out?</p></speech>

We have worked very closely with the unions in An Post, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, in relation to the staff in the 60 post offices that are our own and the 9,700 staff across An Post.  We have worked hard to have good relations there and I appreciate the work of the unions in that regard.</p></speech>

Those rates are based on the length of time a transaction takes.  If somebody comes in to pay a bill that is one rate because it is a quick handover at the counter but if that person is opening a State savings account or doing a Brexit completion form, that rate will be higher because it is calculated, as best we can, based on the length of time it takes to do that.  We have an arbitration clause within the commercial contract so if postmasters are unhappy with the rate for agency banking, for example, the provision is there to trigger arbitration and we will make the contracts available to an arbitrator to arbitrate on that.  We are very happy to do that.</p></speech>

That is all I am talking about.  What kind of figure might we be looking at as regards closures, given the criteria as set out, the fact that a number of post offices do not believe they are viable into the future and that people will be retiring?  Does An Post have a game plan for that?</p></speech>

I join with others in expressing my thanks to the staff across the country, both at the head office and working in post offices and on the ground, who did a sterling job during the pandemic.  I also recognise the role of Mr. McRedmond and his staff in stabilising the company over the last number of years.  I recall when the company had reached a point where its future viability was very uncertain.  Well done on that.  That is not to say I do not have some criticisms.  Maybe that was the pat on the back before the kick in the ass but I have always had concerns about the network and I have expressed them to both the witnesses at different stages.  While the profitability of the company is important as regards the proper structures and business model being in place, I have always seen the network as being on the hind tit of the organisation.</p><p>That is unfortunate.  Reference was made to the pandemic payment for another 16 or 18 months.  We have had that previously.  It is an interim measure and it does not show confidence in the size, scale or breadth of the network.  It would not give confidence to me if I was a postmaster.  I would like to get an understanding from the witnesses about what size of a network they are aiming towards.  This might take some of the mystery out of all this.</p><p> Mr. McRedmond identified, rightly, how An Post found its soul with regard to public service and its solidarity with the older and more vulnerable in our communities.  I have no doubt that this is Mr. McRedmond's vision for the company, but if you overlay that vision on the post office network and on the village of Broadford, which was mentioned already, I must wonder where is the public service and the solidarity with the older and vulnerable people in and around Broadford.  These people, who are known to me for a generation, now must travel much farther and seek the assistance of others to gain access to the service.  I would like Mr. McRedmond to reflect on that.  Broadford would fit the bill for co-location.  There is a shop there that would readily accept the post office service.  I fail to understand why, in An Post's necessity to consolidate operations and which we recognise, the consolidation should be on the ground in each of the villages.  It should be about getting an appropriate co-location in each of the villages where An Post believes there is not a viable operation.  When they are co-located with another business, a financial support mechanism could be put in place under a public service obligation.</p><p> An Post cannot have it all.  It cannot have a public service model that is built around solidarity with older and vulnerable people and have a highly profit-driven company on the other end.  An Post must find a means to marry the two.  For sure, there are locations around the country that will readily have a post office service that will be profitable with enough of a population.  There are, however, many villages like Broadford.  There will be many more such Broadfords as the payment structure changes that close the post offices.  It is not necessarily Government money that is required, although it requires Government support.  An Post must find a way to reinvest the profits through a public service obligation model that sees some of the profit reinvested to support smaller more rural villages that are seeing a potential future due to what the pandemic has delivered for them.  People can work from home and people will use services.  While I recognise the effort that has been made with the Irish Postmasters Union, I appeal to Mr. McRedmond to look again at the network, at Broadford, and at the possibility of retaining the network in its current strength in a more imaginative way than would have been done prior to the pandemic.</p></speech>

The Senator has always been a very vocal and engaged supporter of An Post.  We welcome this from the Senator and from everyone else on the committee.</p> <p>  When I talk about  An Post and about us being profitable, the word "profit" can come across wrong.  It really means us being sustainable.  We have a low capital cost because the State owns us.  All we aim to do is to make sure we are making enough money to be sustainable for the long term and to be sustainable without recourse to Government funding.  When I came into the company, we had to get a Government loan because of risks to the company's funding.  We do not want to be in that position again.  We have committed to the Government to maintain a level of return so we can be sustainable.  When the Covid pandemic came, it really played well for us that we had some cash on our balance sheet, but we are not making super profits.  The post office network especially is not making super profits.  All we are trying to do is maintain enough money so we can invest in new infrastructure and invest in capital budgets.  We are looking at investing &euro;80 million in the post office network over the next five years in a number of areas, including in new products and services, in the digital and physical network, and in sustainability.  We must make that money to be able to make this investment.</p> <p>  I absolutely hear what the Senator is saying about us being a public service.  We are a public service, but we are not a service that has access to subsidies.  With regard to the post office network and to the Senator's constituents, this means we make sure we deliver the best possible service we can within some of those constraints.  The worst thing would be not to have a post office network or a good delivery network in five years or ten years from now.  I believe that the future is strong and is bright, but there are difficult issues.</p> <p>  On the issue of looking at individual post offices, that was a very difficult agreement, negotiated by Ms Debbie Byrne and which we agreed.  We have to stick by that agreement to be able to make sure the network is viable for the long term.</p></speech>

Consider a village such as Broadford.  We are working very hard to get a sewerage scheme into the village and builders are again seeing opportunities to build homes for people in and around the village.  It is on the cusp of a rebirth.  It would be a shame to see a service like the post office go.  Mr. McRedmond referred to the harp over the post office door.  This has a very important meaning, which has the potential to encourage others to have faith in a village.  Rather than see a village falling to complete rack and ruin and effectively becoming dilapidated with nobody wanting to be there, as we have seen in many locations, Broadford is not that village and it need not be.  It needs the post office.</p> <p>  Maybe it needs another look at the kind of structure or office that is put in place in a co-located area.  At one time there was the sub-office business model.  I have spoken about this previously.  I believe now is the time to look again at that kind of model of service.  It might be greater than the Post Point and may not be the full bells and whistles of a full post office, but it could give enough to maintain that presence in a co-located fashion, to give the local community an acceptance that the service is there for them, especially the older and vulnerable.  Would An Post look again at the sub-office model?</p></speech>

I will ask Debbie Byrne to describe what we are doing in that area as we are developing our technology, our Post Points and something that would get close to that.  I absolutely hear what the Senator is saying.  We review constantly where we are and what we can do.  Ms Byrne will add to that.</p></speech>

Currently they cannot sell national or international stamps, but they will now have a weighing scales to be able to send parcels, they will be able to top up foreign exchange cards, and do other transactions.  We are expanding the scope of Post Point.  While I hear back when communities use the post office and when that service is gone from an individual community, we come back to the viability and sustainability of the network.  We now have very good data that show that of the post offices that closed in 2019 and 2020 as a result of the agreement, which was about 152 post offices, the business transferred to 128 neighbouring post offices.  The average increase in business for all of those offices was 9.8%, but a lot of those businesses were up 20% and 30%.</p><p>That created viability for that next tier of post offices.  There are some exceptions but in most cases the nearest post office was 5 km or 6 km away.  We must look at the size of the population.  We are trying to generate new products and services all the time but if we divide the cake too small, it does not create a viable opportunity.</p></speech>

I am concentrating on Broadford because it is right next door to me and I know it well.  If the people getting their social welfare in Broadford go to any of the other locations, they take with them their bit of business as well.  It can have an impact on shops so it is not just about the postmaster but the businesses around that post office.  It is also about the older and more vulnerable people who would find this a bigger task.  In Broadford people might drive a mile or two into the village.  They might not want to drive to Tulla or Kilkishen because there would be more cars and it might be considered more daunting.  Although I use the term in a jocular way, An Post is robbing from these people the opportunity to live an active and self-fulfilling life and affecting the viability of the local shop.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses look again at the sub-post office model and the potential to enhance the service with PostPoint, as has been mentioned?  Will An Post find a way to include the payment of pensions and social welfare?  In a place like Broadford that may not be a huge chunk of money; quite frankly, it was not and if it had been, the post office would have been more sustainable and viable.  It is not beyond the realms of a local shop to manage those transactions.  An Post has very good financial models and methods of ensuring that all of this is appropriately audited.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to look again at locations below the model of populations of 500 and the idea of an enhanced PostPoint service or maybe a post office with reduced bells and whistles.  This could deliver social welfare payments.  Some of that may come from some of the profits we all hope the company can continue to make in the years ahead.  That would bring sustainability and support for less than viable businesses.  It would really enhance An Post's reputation and provide future viability and sustainability for many villages that we are all working so hard trying to protect and maintain.</p></speech>

I am relatively new to the committee so I thank An Post.  I came through a Seanad by-election conducted through registered post and I spent much time on the An Post website tracking and tracing envelopes to ensure they got to Leinster House in time for the deadline.  It was a very efficient process and the result worked out okay.  I thank all those postmasters around the country who took the envelopes and provided receipts.  I appreciate that work.</p> <p>  I was never sure of the balance between company-owned post offices, if one likes, versus those operated by postmasters.  If I have it correct, there are approximately 60 company-owned post offices and approximately 880 post offices operated by postmasters, with approximately 300 on the old contract and approximately 580 on the new contract.  Could Ms Byrne confirm that figures just so I can get my head around them?</p></speech>

There are 45 company offices and 888 postmaster offices.  Of those 888 offices, there are approximately 300 on the old contract, with the balance on the new contract.  We have approximately 931 post offices.</p></speech>

They would be seen largely in county towns.  In the old days, there would have been post offices and the sub-post offices would have been those run by postmasters.  The post office in Carrick-on-Shannon, for example, would have managed the sub-offices in the county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.884" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#K00800"><p>Grand.  I am looking at the presentation sent to us in advance and the figures therein.  There is a good gloss on them, which is great.  I was in the Seanad in 2016 - perhaps in the Chair - when a different Deputy Naughten was the Minister responsible for An Post delivering news of a price increase from 70 cent to a euro, which was an enormous increase per letter at the time.  It was delivered on the basis of it being the only way of keeping the post office working.  It has certainly saved it from many of the problems that might have been there otherwise.</p> <p>  The 2019 profit before net finance and income costs was a positive &euro;66 million and last year that figure was a negative &euro;32 million.  In the first quarter of this year, the company still lost nearly &euro;10 million after depreciation.  It is not as bad as it might be but it is not necessarily where we want it to be.  I presume the witnesses would prefer a bottom line figure adding to the reserves rather than reducing them.</p> <p>  There are some questions that were not asked.  Social welfare is great but I presume much of the pension and children's allowance payments are now going to bank accounts.  There was a point about the pandemic unemployment payment being transitioned to a jobseeker's payment so people having to appear in order to sign on would be good.  It makes sense and gives additional transaction volumes to the post office while providing security to the State that people claiming are genuinely entitled to do so.  I am sure the vast bulk of them are.</p> <p>  Are there any figures on the age profile of An Post's customers.  I have occasionally brought an older person in my neighbourhood to collect a pension and that person would usually spend it all on the other side of the shop.  Such people buy most of their groceries in the same place from where they got their pension.  It tends to be older people in those queues.  There is new technology and I am not terribly familiar with it, such as Revolut, and An Post seems to have a model based on social welfare, where many of those payments may go directly to accounts.  There is a bill payment service and many companies are trying to get people to pay bills more directly such as by direct debit and so on.  People going abroad do not need foreign exchange services as much either, especially with the euro.  We may not have as much travel in future and even when we do, people will use credit cards and tap technology.  Cash is becoming less important.  There is an opportunity with State savings and people are still very happy to see this as the safest place to put their money.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have data on the age profile of customers and how An Post might try to attract younger people to use post offices?  They are not using them in the same way older people are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.885" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#K00900"><p>I will ask Ms Byrne to comment on that in a moment.  The Senator mentioned the financial performance of An Post and it has been strong.  Over the past four years, we have moved from losses to increased profit each year, and this level of profitability will maintain the long-term viability of the network.  It is not super-profit.</p> <p>  We consciously and deliberately took a hit last year.  We calculated that Covid-19 would cost us &euro;50 million and we have outlined in some detail what that is.  We said that would happen.  It is why in 2020 we made a loss after depreciation.  We made a profit before depreciation and if An Post was a private sector company, it would have earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA.  It is analogous.</p> <p>  Like many companies we make most of our money in the final quarter of the year because of Christmas trading.  We are forecasting a profit this year before and after depreciation.  We will still have the pandemic for half this year, which means we will not be quite back to the levels of profitability that we had beforehand but we fully expect to be there in 2022.  We are robust in our performance and delivering those numbers.  I will argue that strongly.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned our products and how An Post is doing.  There is no doubt that every company must find a new revenue stream.  The key for us is whether the company is growing or declining.  The truth is we are growing.  The post office did not grow last year for many reasons outlined that relate to Covid-19.  Even still, as a company we managed to grow our revenues by 3%.</p><p>As the committee saw, in the first quarter of this year we grew them by 11%.  That growth is all the sign of the future viability, strength and success of An Post.  I am clear that An Post is moving in a strong, positive direction.  As I said in my opening comments, I am also confident that the post office network is, but it will take longer to get there.</p><p> Ms Byrne might be able to answer also on the demographics around the post office network.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.887" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Debbie Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#L00200"><p>When I took over this job three years ago, I said recruiting new people in that their job is to make the post office more relevant.  The post office, as we know it, for exactly all the reasons outlined here, is changing.  That social welfare business will continue to decline.  No more than in the letters business that is declining, the bucket needs to be topped back up with parcels.  We have got to find a way of topping up that footfall.</p> <p>  I will pick a few issues.  Stamps, obviously, are the lifeblood of the post office.  It has been a declining business.  During Covid, we are one of the few posts in Europe that successfully stimulated stamp sales.  I am talking about consumers now.  Obviously, some of the businessmen would have been down with businesses not being in the office.</p> <p>  When I joined, we launched what I called the "sexy stamp" programme.  We introduced stamps such as Father Ted, U2 and, a number of years ago, the Rugby World Cup.  All of that is in a bid to make sending mail more relevant.  We have the big schools programme at the moment where we are working with schools sending postcards, writing to people in nursing homes and re-engendering that whole activity of sending mail.  That is important.  We will be a case study for Europe in terms of stimulating that consumer spending on mail.</p> <p>  Financial services are really important.  On our current account, the latest analysis that we have done shows we have successfully brought in a younger customer demographic.  It is the same on our credit card.  We have the best balance transfer on our credit in the marketplace.  If you have a balance on your credit card, you can transfer to An Post credit card and there is 15 months 0% interest.  We are bringing out a new credit card later in the year that will appeal to people who do not have a balance on theirs.  With loans, it is the same.  We have the best rates in the market on a number of key lines.</p> <p>  The Green Hub that we launched last year is all about targeting homeowners who want to renovate their home and bring in a new customer demographic.</p> <p>  We have just launched our new children's account, Money Mate.  This is a big opportunity for postmasters who know families, have that link with schools and will give it to the children to go out into their community and talk.  Unfortunately, there are no communions this year.  We were launching that in time for the communions.  There is the big opportunity there.</p> <p>  It is all about trying to broaden the base beyond that social welfare base which is really important to the post office for example, to stamps and parcels.  As Mr. McRedmond said earlier in terms of e-commerce, we want people who bought their free dresses on Boohoo and then go and return too.  They will come in and return that parcel in the post office.  That is a new demographic, and then we have the financial services.</p></speech>

I was not so aware of some of it, such as the children's account and maybe the amount of current account business.  It is good we have these kind of meetings.  We can also let people know about them.</p><p>The brand is incredibly positive.  People are so happy to put money into the post office knowing that it is the safest place in Ireland as far as they are concerned.  Throughout the banking crisis and everything else, the people were putting their money in the post office knowing that it was safer than safe.  The  witnesses might touch on the negative interest rates that the banks are talking about applying and whether An Post has any proposals to do that or otherwise.</p><p>I would also make the point - this is something that I have been aware of for years as a councillor and maybe more recently - that with the leaflet-dropping service that every councillor and every local authority candidate in the country would want to have, particularly during local elections but even between elections, there never seemed to be a way to get An Post to have its delivery areas coincide with the electoral areas in the local authorities, with the electoral districts within those areas and even by D&aacute;il constituencies.  The post office was not necessarily aware of the boundaries.  They would deliver but you would have leaflets from D&uacute;n Laoghaire arriving in Rathdown and <i>vice versa</i>.  Might An Post manage to have a system that it could offer to candidates, councillors, TDs, aspiring TDs, etc., stating that it has the exact boundaries of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and it would deliver to every house because so many houses are &quot;No junk mail&quot; now?  I certainly do not regard political literature as junk mail.  People sometimes say they do not hear from you and when they get the stuff, they think it is junk mail.</p></speech>

There is a market there for An Post.  There is a potentially large number of people who say that they would love to be able to give it to An Post and know that it has the guarantee of being dropped to every house in their constituency, electoral area or part thereof.  There is business there for An Post if it was willing to look for it.</p></speech>

We have a really advanced model now to select by demographic and by different groups in terms of direct mail, which is not junk mail.  The Senator is correct.  Once it has got an address on it, it is not junk mail.  We can certainly do that.</p> <p>  I am a little aware of the constituency boundaries issue.  We should see if we can get that resolved.</p></speech>

If An Post knew the size and shape of Stillorgan, it could deliver without an address to every house in that area as the postman is doing his deliveries anyway.  That would give many people comfort and they would be willing to pay.  They would be happy to pay for a good service, particularly as it would most likely form part of their expenses.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne.  I suppose I should point out at the beginning that I am a sub-postmaster and I am also a member of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.</p> <p>  I, too, go along with what colleagues have said.  I recognise the work that was done throughout the network via mail, counters and clerks, all through the pandemic.  The service was kept going.  Every office was kept open.  In my local area, even on a Saturday, I saw post people using their private cars to bring shopping to elderly people who lived alone.  Compliments went above and beyond.  I compliment both witnesses on the work done by the company.</p> <p>  The brand name of An Post is up there at the top with the work.  The schemes that were brought in through the pandemic, be it the postcard scheme for people in nursing homes or the free posting of packets to people, were excellent initiatives.  I want to put that on the record and compliment them both.</p> <p>  I will not ask too many questions.  I do not think I should.  I have just a few comments.</p> <p>  Deputy Cathal Crowe mentioned something earlier on and I just want to go back to the negotiations in 2018 with regard to the transformation payment.  I was one of those postmasters who was at those public meetings.  Everything was put on the table to us to make a decision in a democratic fashion and that is what everyone did.  The vast majority voted.  I think over 80% were in favour.  I would like to clarify that issue.  I thought it was implied that we were not being given information at the time with regard to that decision.  That is not correct; from my point of view as one of those postmasters, I want to put that on record.  I have every confidence in the IPU to represent me and to work on our behalf with An Post.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that a pandemic payment scheme is being put in place.  Personally, I would like to see it for longer than 18 months but I can understand why it is there.  The Grant Thornton report is with New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA.  We need to be looking at a retained earnings model to support the network for a longer period of possibly three to five years.  Mr. McRedmond mentioned earlier that this is about 931 communities as well as the jobs that are affected throughout that area.  It is about communities and the knock-on effect of those offices in those communities with footfall, etc., and the ancillary business that it drives in all of those communities.  There was a figure in the Grant Thornton report with regard to the social value of the network to the Irish economy and the average figure was &euro;550 million.</p><p>That is what the network gives to the Irish economy and that is why it must be supported.  There is an ideal opportunity to do that now.  We have a large number of banks closing and there will be many towns left without a main financial institution so it is important the network is supported to be able to provide that service.  One only needs to go back to 2010 when we had Postbank which had around 200,000 customers and no debt.  It was actually the only bank in the country which was not supported at that time.  It had to close and repay moneys while the State supported all the other banking institutions.  There is now an opportunity for the Government to support the An Post network to keep it surviving, to be honest.  That also fits in with our whole initiative for town centres.  If we are to get people to move back into towns to live, we must have services available to people in those towns.</p><p> I welcome the interdepartmental group and I am aware it is due to report in early July.  I am hoping it will look at areas such as motor tax and requiring all local authorities to allow council rent to be paid in post offices.  At the minute, not all do and that is an issue.</p><p> Driving licences were mentioned by Ms Byrne.  When that contract went out a number of years ago it was framed in such a way that we could not properly tender for it.  That is a point that must be made.  Sixty new offices for driving licence applications were set up around the country, some of them upstairs in shopping centres, etc., and all the while we had a network with the capability to deliver the service.  We were not given the opportunity to do so, however.  When that contract comes up again we should be given the opportunity to tender for it on a fair playing field.</p><p> I agree also with the comments made about the PUP.  In the short term, when switching back to jobseeker's allowance, it should be put through the post offices.</p><p> The age profile of postmasters was mentioned.  I am probably one of the younger ones.  Has further consideration been given to offering another retirement package at some stage in the near future?</p><p> As I said, there are huge opportunities for the company.  An Post has a very strong brand name.  The Money Mate account offers an opportunity to get kids to turn the Cyril the Squirrel stamps, which are very popular with schools, into bank accounts.  An Post could then build a suite of financial products that would keep those customers throughout their lives.</p><p> Once again I compliment the company on the work done over the past 15 months.  As I said, we have a very strong brand name.  I saw a report recently which was done last year, I think by Red C.  It showed almost 90% support for financial supports or services being put through the An Post Network.</p></speech>

I deeply appreciate them.  I thank him also for his own work as a postmaster.  Being in a leadership position in An Post is quite humbling because it is our fantastic front-line workers, our postmen and postwomen in every community, and our post offices in every community that make the brand.  We do our professional work.  Ms Byrne has done great work and she and I are part of a team of eight who do a fantastic job as well.  We have fantastic teams working with us and they all do good work.  Fundamentally, I am so struck by the affection for An Post that is there at the front line and it is because of our front-line workers.  I have not a shred of doubt that that is what does it and we are lucky to be able to be in a position to try to steer things in a certain way.  We are very grateful to the Senator and all his colleagues.</p></speech>

I want to return to one or two points.  The level of cash An Post has at the moment as an institution is about &euro;80 million.  Am I correct?  I had a look at the accounts and at the end of 2020 they showed about &euro;80 million.  The company has eaten into its cash reserve due to the &euro;50 million cost of Covid.  Can An Post operate a self-funding model?  It received Government support on the transformation at the time of that.  Am I correct that &euro;20 million was made available?  Can An Post exist without State support?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  As committee members have said, we deal with the staff and postmasters of post offices on a daily basis.  In addition to Mr. McRedmond's staff who work in the An Post office, in Limerick we have the general post office on Cecil Street and a centre on the Dock Road.  All the staff do phenomenal work and we acknowledge that.  However, in terms of a viable model, can the company operate without State supports?  What State services, in addition to those it currently provides and which are currently provided by other service providers, could the company provide?  Lastly, if we are looking at the post office network, 18 months is not long enough.  It is an interim measure as the company probably needs five years of a forward plan.  What does Mr. McRedmond see if he looks at the post office network in five years' time.  What is the model he will be looking at?</p></speech>

As regards our balance sheet, our net assets at the end of 2020 were &euro;278 million.  Within that is the &euro;80 million we referred to which is cash that is available to us.  That is about the level we have set for ourselves as being the threshold we need to be at.  That is obviously after we had that &euro;50 million impact from the pandemic.  That was not all cash; some was cash and some was not.</p></speech>

It absolutely is.  Without question An Post is viable.  It is a strong company with a growing revenue line and it is up to us therefore to manage it to ensure we are making the level of profitability that ensures the long-term sustainable future.  That is why I put some emphasis on that in my introductory remarks.  The Chairman is correct the State put in &euro;30 million as a loan.  That was in 2017.</p></speech>

It was before the price increase because we were at a point where cash was very low.  That price increase was referred to by one of the members earlier.  While it was a large increase, we said that if this increase was put in place, we would do the work to develop a long-term strategy and introduce new products and services.  We did that, particularly around parcels and e-commerce, and that is what made us viable.</p></speech>

Can An Post, providing a public service the length and breadth of the country, survive and be viable without annual State supports?  The Grant Thornton report states there is a gap of around &euro;17 million per annum.  Mr. McRedmond has come back to the committee and it looks like the pandemic payment An Post is bringing will be funded from internal resources.</p><p>It is a hard question but it is the question that has to be asked.  We are here as a committee to support and enhance the post office network.  Senator Carrigy made reference to An Post having a bank.  In my view, the company should be in the banking sector.  It should be in that space as well.</p><p> I am asking Mr. McRedmond a difficult question.  Can it function?  It was allocated &euro;30 million, but &euro;15 million of that was to do with the network.</p></speech>

This is a stand-alone commercial semi-State company and we operate it, including the post office network, as a stand-alone commercial semi-State.  There is an intractability between the post office network and our delivery network, for example, around stamps and parcels and how they integrate and work with each other.  While we are talking today about the post office network, we see it as one company, which it is.  We are clear that we can do that.</p> <p>  The question of a PSO, which was raised earlier by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and the Chairman, is not an issue for An Post.  We do not designate PSOs.  Governments designate PSOs.</p> <p>  We are clear about the commitment that we make.  Ms Byrne was taking the committee through that commitment in respect of the distances between post offices, the spread of post offices and being in every community with a population in excess of 500.  We make that commitment knowing that we can fund and support that and that we believe that that is fine.</p></speech>

If those parameters are changed, its operating model is not as viable.  Its current model is based on those parameters.  If those parameters change, things change.  I accept that.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has a minute because we have to be out of here.</p></speech>

It needs to be part of the conversation.</p> <p>  We also probably need to have a conversation post the review, and when the details of the banking contracts are in play.  Then we will have a better general conversation on that.</p> <p>  Given the opportunity, I thank Ms Byrne and Mr. McRedmond and I thank the post office network.  Like many other elected representatives, I sometimes have to deal with individual issues.  One I had to deal with was particularly tragic and, in fairness, the communication and the answers back from An Post were excellent and I was able to deal with some of the specifics of those issues.  I thank them for that service.</p> <p>  There are significant questions to be answers regarding viability but, in fairness to Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne, some of that one will only be able to do at a later stage.  We are probably talking about September or so, when we see the outworkings of both the review and the contracts with the banking institutions and we see if there are any more State services on offer.</p></speech>

Mr. McRedmond made reference to An Post's parcel delivery business.  It would be fair of anyone who has teenage daughters to say that the first person one normally meets when one is going out the door in the morning is the delivery man from An Post bringing in that parcel.  I commend An Post on that effort.  I have got to know them very well because they are frequent callers to my home.  That has been a great success during Covid for An Post.</p> <p>  It is a matter we will come back to.  We look forward to having Mr. McRedmond and Ms Byrne back before the committee in the not-too-distant future.  We are all working in the same direction to have a viable and strong An Post.  There is a public element remit and we appreciate that.  That brings its own difficulties for a commercial operation such as An Post.  Our role is to support An Post.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Niamh Power, V1 Medical; and Mr. Barry O'Brien, Mr. Simon Osman and Mr. Chris O&rsquo;Grady, Duelchem Limited.  We will also be joined by Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology, Harvard University.</p> <p>  All witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the place the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any committee member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For the information of anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely, with committee members being in the precincts of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  Only I, as Chairman, and the staff essential to the running to the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances of Covid-19 and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I call on Dr. Niamh Power to make her opening statement.</p><p>I call on Dr. Power to make her opening statement. She has approximately five minutes.</p></speech>

We provide rapid antigen testing at our clinics in Dublin and Cork.  Two colleagues and I established V1 Medical in November 2020, as no other facility was offering rapid antigen testing convenient to Dublin Airport, despite many EU countries already accepting antigen testing for travel.</p> <p>  In fact, when the Dutch Government updated its rules on 15 January requiring an antigen test within four hours of departure for every passenger to the Netherlands, including transit passengers, we were still the only company offering rapid antigen testing and were contacted by Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, KLM and Aer Lingus to provide and facilitate their passengers on their flights that day.</p> <p>  We offer a fast and convenient service and a vital service to air and shipping crews and engineering professionals, in particular, who need to travel for essential reasons.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, they may need to reschedule or cancel their travel plans at short notice.  We have contracts for services with ASL Airlines, Aer Lingus, CityJet, Doyle Shipping Group in Dublin and Cork, Candina Group, as well as several engineering companies.  We provide testing with results and certification within 30 minutes using the Roche/SD Biosensor test which is validated by the HSE and on the EU Commission's list of mutually recognised tests.</p> <p>  We have developed robust and efficient procedures to ensure every customer makes his or her flight on time.  We provide full flexibility, including refunds up to two hours before appointment time.  We accommodate urgent cases, whether it be crews with schedule changes or people who need to travel at short notice due to family illness or bereavement.  With more than 60 years of experience in aviation between us, we understand flexibility around travel is key.  This is simply not achievable with PCR testing, even without taking into account the much higher cost of PCR.</p> <p>  Ireland is an outlier in the EU and among our most important trading partners with regard to antigen testing.  The USA, the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Croatia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Czechia, Lithuania, Finland, Luxembourg, Austria and Spain are some of the countries accepting antigen testing for travel.  Ireland is the most disconnected country and Dublin the most</p> <p>disconnected city in Europe, according to Eurocontrol.</p> <p>  As countries across the EU connect with the EU digital Covid certificate and with less than six weeks before Ireland is due to go live on 19 July, we have been unable to obtain any information or guidance on what is required for us to be involved.  We want to be prepared, so when the Government is ready to launch this important initiative, we too are ready.  Ireland and our aviation, travel and tourism industry cannot afford any further delays.  The US and overseas tourist spend is significantly higher than domestic tourist spend, so encouraging staycations will not be enough to save many businesses which depend on foreign tourism.</p> <p>  Our airports, especially Shannon Airport and Cork Airport, are in danger of further losing connectivity.  Our slots at Heathrow Airport are not ours - they belong to the International Airlines Group, IAG, which can easily repurpose them for more profitable routes.  Dublin Airport, which has been successfully serving as a transatlantic hub for flights from Europe, is already losing these customers to UK bases.  Our connectivity with the UK, once among the busiest routes in the world, is suffering because of restrictions within the common travel area, CTA, all on this side of the Irish Sea.</p> <p>  We need to plan urgently for the implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate, including allowing antigen testing for both inbound and outbound travel.  There needs to be immediate engagement with private providers who have the experience to deliver the digital Covid-19 certificate to the travelling public.</p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r againn &eacute;.  T&aacute;imid anseo chun r&eacute;iteach teicneola&iacute;ochta agus t&aacute;st&aacute;la a mholadh don choiste.  I thank the Chairman for the privilege and opportunity to address him and his fellow committee members here today.  I wish to convey ten points.</p> <p>  In conjunction with the vaccination programmes and other precautions, we want to help the Irish Government and the Irish people to eradicate the Covid-19 contagion as quickly as possible.  This can be achieved through an integrated technology and testing solution based on a combination of practical experience and technological expertise.  This system involves a digital platform and a multilayered testing programme which we combine.  It has been proven to work in pilot events and can be customised to suit any event, flight or form of travel.  All flights, ferry sailings and train journeys should be treated as mini-events and the same basic principles apply to all those activities.  This can all be achieved at an economical price in terms of time, effort and money.  It can also help to reboot the Irish economy and save the State a significant amount of money both now and in the future.  We would like the Irish Government and agencies of the State to avail of this great technological opportunity and to engage with us immediately.  Early and full engagement will yield the best results and the most savings.</p> <p>  The findings of ongoing mass testing and reporting are key to controlling the spread of this virus.  All such data will be retained in a secure Irish GDPR-compliant cloud platform, but it can be shared with the Irish public health authorities, as appropriate and agreed.  This technology affords operational connectivity and compatibility with the EU digital Covid certificate and other international platforms which are deemed appropriate.  This solution is absolutely no substitute for social responsibility.  Rapid test results and their results are not a licence for personal misbehaviour.  Rapid tests are additional tools for informing the further containment and curtailment of infection.  This tech and test solution is already activated and ready to go.  The software is already fully developed and ready to help schools, businesses, sport and society to get moving again as quickly and safely as possible.  Our strategy, processes and technology are all laid out in the submission which has been circulated to members and a brief explanatory video has also been circulated, which helps to explain the process in six simple steps.  It is my privilege to head up a team of dedicated professionals.  I am delighted to be joined by two members of that team, our pharmaceutical expert, Chris O'Grady and our technology expert, Simon Osman.  I ask Mr. O'Grady to say a word also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#BB00500"><p>I am a registered pharmacist and a director of Duelchem Limited.  I apologise because my Gaeilge is not as polished as Mr. O'Brien's.  Duelchem is an Irish pharmaceutical retail and wholesale company based in County Kilkenny, which was set up in 2008.  We have been supplying the Irish healthcare sector with pharmaceutical products for more than a decade.  We have a strong working relationship with the HSE, collaborating on multiple projects, with a view to expanding this relationship.<br/><br/>As a pharmaceutical wholesaler, we hold a wholesale distribution authorisation licence which is regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  This HPRA regulation obligates us to verify the integrity of our suppliers and the products we distribute and to register with the Irish Medicines Verification Organisation, IMVO.  Our regulatory affairs team ensures we are prepared for and comply with legislative changes such as the falsified medicines directive, the recent medicinal devices regulation and the forthcoming May 2022 <i>in vitro </i>diagnostic medical devices regulation.<br/><br/>In response to the pandemic, Duelchem set up <i>reassurance.ie</i>, which operates a number of testing centres to help to identify and ultimately reduce the number of Covid-19 cases.  We offer both antigen and PCR tests and publish results, if required, on reporting applications such as <i>healthpassportworldwide.com.</i><br/><br/>Symptoms have been, to date, the main trigger for self-isolation and Covid-19 testing.</p><p>The success of the vaccine programme - the rate of vaccination is estimated to be approximately 50% - does, however, increase the chances of people getting Covid-19 asymptomatically.  The absence of symptoms increases the likelihood of Covid-19 spreading within the community because the triggers that we know for self-isolation and testing, such as temperature, loss of taste, flu-like symptoms, etc., are not as prevalent.</p><p> Currently, when an individual develops symptoms, he or she self-isolates and contacts his or her GP or the HSE to arrange a PCR test, but 51% to 70% of transmission of Covid-19 happens when no symptoms are present, either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.  The symptoms usually come from the body's immune response and, therefore, by the time people develop symptoms, they are at their peak viral load or possibly even already past it.  By the time they receive the PCR test result in 48 hours to 72 hours, assuming they were symptomatic when they got the test done, they are possibly no longer even transmitting the virus and are no longer infectious or contagious.  While the PCR captures the definitive result and initiates contact tracing, antigen tests have a significant role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.  The solution we propose today is the use of an antigen self-test in triplicate, with the digital platform to underpin the testing programme.  Mr. Osman, our technology expert, will now briefly illustrate the integrated solution.</p></speech>

My background is building technology companies, specifically in the software space, and building applications and infrastructure businesses.  More than 12 months ago now, we formed <i>tested.me</i>.  The purpose of the company was built on the desire to help companies and individuals work through and recover from the challenges of the pandemic and beyond.  We realise that the need for an individual to be able to present a trusted health status using a mobile phone application would be hugely important, alongside a reporting solution and a health information platform.  Due to the nature of the information needed, we felt that the mobile application needed to include ID verification in order to create trust, so you go through this process when you download our app.  We also give individuals a sense of choice and ownership, so in our app you can see share history, you can choose the level of detail that you want to share, and you can also delete information.<br/><br/>Importantly, the third principle was to make sure that our system was interoperable.  As we have gone through the last year, we have found that this aspect is extremely important in terms of building a compliant digital platform.  This means that we understand that it is necessary to be able to connect with health platforms, labs, other patient applications, e-commerce systems and booking systems to create that end-to-end solution.<br/><br/>Version 1 of our solution went live in August of last year, with a focus on helping workplaces specifically.  Over time, we have developed the product to meet other needs such as travel and the events space.  We have had approximately 300,000 active connections on our platform and thousands of test results uploaded daily.  The active users are across many countries and we are very proud of the work we have done in schools, workplaces and hospitality.  We are now in discussions regarding supporting the travel area specifically, working with the island of Santorini in Greece and also reopening some major events this summer.  We also achieved a successful pilot within a main airport in the UK.<br/><br/>Our journey has been an extremely interesting one.  I am sure everyone on this call today has experienced an interesting 12 months with the challenges that we faced.  As a company we have been called in by the UK Government into many steering committees in terms of the Covid response.  We are part of the Digital Healthcare Council in the UK.  I have also presented to the Conservative Science &amp;amp; Technology Forum regarding digital identification and digital health passes.  We have been working with the NHS in terms of the app and integration.  We are HIQA compliant as a company.  We are working towards our ISO 27001 certification.  We are Cyber Essentials Plus certified, and we also have our own information security management system.<br/><br/>At a global level, we also work within the global health pass and we also sit on the Vaccination Credential Initiative group, which is important in terms of understanding the global standards and the protocols that need to be in place to create this borderless environment again in terms of travel and get society moving.  It has been an absolute pleasure to introduce myself.  I would like to hand back to the Chairman now for the question and answer session.</p></speech>

I will get straight into the questions.  In terms of scalability, how quickly could Duelchem scale up to service the Irish aviation sector and airports?  Is it the technology piece that they do, or do they also do the testing piece?  Do they work with partners regarding that?</p> <p>  Dr. Power has a very interesting perspective on the issue, given her background.  I am very interested in hearing about her experience.  I have a similar question to her in terms of scalability.  She outlined the operation she has.  If the Government was to say that we are moving to antigen testing in the near future, prior to departure and post arrival, would her firm be in a position to get involved or what sort of scale needs to happen in the meantime?</p> <p>  This question is for Dr. Power as well.  There seems to be significant resistance to antigen testing.  I want to hear Dr. Power&rsquo;s perspective on and experience of that.  Where does she think it is coming from?  Could she speak to the point of affordability and convenience and also the aspect which has arisen in terms of public health?  Is there a risk associated with antigen testing, particularly serial antigen testing?  Professor Mark Ferguson raised this as a prospect and real opportunity with us on 5 May and the committee raised it with the Government.  Could Dr. Power speak to the strength of antigen testing in terms of how it compares with PCR testing?</p></speech>

Our supplier has a lead time of landing product in Ireland for distribution that ranges between seven and 14 days.  Our supplier can turn 8 million units in our direction which, hypothetically, is enough to supply each member of the population with two tests a week so scalability is not a concern.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Osman to speak about the application.  We are on the technology side.</p></speech>

In terms of distribution, our front end application &ndash; our mobile application, is available in the App Store and in Google Play, so for android and Apple users it is available right now globally.  In the context of scale, it is easy to distribute to the public.</p> <p>  I try not to use too much technological jargon, but the back end of the system, the compute, is managed in the AWS data centre within the Dublin region, so we are already situated within Ireland in terms of data and our systems are all very scaleable platforms.</p><p>We work with the likes of Salesforce etc, which is one of the big global players.  In terms of scalability and the technology, it is extremely scalable from that perspective.  We have done various performance tests up to the millions.</p></speech>

Looking back at levels of travel from 2019, which would have been the last normal year, approximately 25 million passengers went through Dublin Airport alone.  All hands on deck are needed for this.</p> <p>  I understand the idea of self-testing would of course make things much more scalable and convenient.  As far as I am aware, however, the European Commission has stated self-testing will not be allowed for the EU digital green certificate.  That needs to be worked on.  From my own experience of self-testing, our company supervised a self-testing event of 300 airline pilots who are generally clever and well able to follow instructions.  There are definitely some issues there with practice.  In UK schools, for example, the kids self-test at school three times and then they are allowed to do so at home.  There is definitely a learning curve regarding swabbing and the actual processing of the tests.  While it is a learning curve, it can be overcome.  The European Commission would have to get on board with that.</p> <p>  Regarding resistance to antigen testing, as a medical doctor and having been involved in providing antigen testing for travel, I do not understand why there is such resistance.  I do not see any evidence for it.  I would like to see the evidence if it exists.  Several arguments have been made, one of which is antigen testing will encourage poor behaviour.  In fact, the Covid-SMART project in Liverpool in the UK did not support that argument.  It is back to the argument of seat belts and condoms that we have had, namely, applying a public health tool will not necessarily encourage poor behaviour.</p> <p>  From the aviation context, the poor behaviour argument is moot.  We have very well controlled environment both at airports and in aircraft.  Poor behaviour and non-compliance with regulations will not be tolerated.  Those passengers will just not be carried.  From the behavioural aspect, I do not think that is an issue for travel.</p> <p>  On the sensitivity argument and the public health risk, sensitivity can be improved by proper sampling techniques and use of the testing.  For the moment, this will mean that it should be monitored testing as per the EU guidelines.  There is a definite role for self-testing for screening purposes for schools, colleges, other forms of transport, workplaces, residential care homes etc.  Thousands of leaving certificate students will start their exams today.  Many of them will be told, unfortunately, that they cannot sit their exams because they have been designated a close contact.  Had we been organised to facilitate those students, they could have taken a rapid antigen test just before going into the exam and then be able to do it.  There are many opportunities that we have missed to roll out antigen testing for the good of society.</p> <p>  On sensitivity regarding travel, it has been shown in studies that an antigen test 24 hours before a flight is as good as a PCR test only two hours before.  That is a very simple fix.  One just requests an antigen test 24 hours before.  Professor Mina will have more statistics on this.  His studies will show that the real issue with sensitivity is the period of time before a person becomes positive on an antigen test when they are already positive on a PCR test.  That is just an eight-hour to 24-hour window.  Even a 48-hour antigen test would be as good as a 72-hour PCR test.  These can all be overcome and should not be a reason why we should discount antigen testing for travel.</p></speech>

Everything the witnesses have provided us with is helpful.  My big question concerned capacity and scale but that has already been addressed.

We also worked on the flow of the individual turning up to the flight and getting on it.  There was a lateral flow test taken on the morning of the journey to make that happen.  Lateral flow testing was part of the process.  At the point of go-live for this project on the route to Amsterdam, due to another lockdown, it was cancelled from moving into a full productive environment.  The process had been approved at that point.  We will be talking with them again in the next few days in terms of where we are with the status of that.  There was a moment where there was an agreement that the lateral flow test option was a good one.</p> <p>  The challenge we have with airline travel is the moving target around the guidelines and each country's different regulations.  The UK is running a traffic light system, which does not necessarily twin with the system at the other end.  It is that common set of guidelines that are now working their way through measures like the good health pass initiative.  The ability to interoperate with other platforms will become important.</p> <p>  In the UK, lateral flow has got wide adoption in a number of sectors.  We are seeing it in schools.  Individuals are now testing twice, maybe three times, a week depending on what setting they are going into.  We are seeing it used across the whole sector.  We have been working with UEFA and other large organisations around lateral flow testing as part of the solution.  As we see the vaccination percentage get to a good number, we will see lateral flow tests filling the space and becoming the day-to-day mitigation and management solution of transmissibility.</p> <p>  We have seen lateral flow testing in most of our proof of concepts that we have been running.  It is part of the process.  It is important to recognise it is different kind of solution or different products for different use cases.  To force things against each other into the same place is where there are clashes.  There is a use case for both products.</p> <p>  In terms of the public health solution, we believe the correct model is to look at lateral flow testing on a public health level.  In terms of science and accuracy, then one can move to PCR, for example, on a positive test.  I am a technologist - I want to make that clear - but that is my experience of what we are seeing in terms of data, the best way to mitigate risk and get things moving again in a safe and secure way.</p></speech>

As Mr. Osman said, there is a massive difficulty in terms of moving targets, with some countries, such as the Netherlands, changing position overnight.  The big advantage antigen testing gives is that we can quickly adapt to those moving targets.  For instance, when the Netherlands introduced the requirement for a test four hours before a flight into the country, we were able to accommodate that.  People who had turned up at the airport without a test, the wrong test or an out-of-date test were able to come to us, have their antigen test and be back at check-in 20 minutes later with their certificates.  That simply cannot happen with PCR testing, whereas the scalability and flexibility are definitely there with antigen testing.</p> <p>  The difficulty I would worry about is that even though antigen testing is very rapid and adaptable, how will it be integrated in terms of uploading the digital green certificate?  The concern is that there will be a delay.  Will somebody else have to validate the test or will centres be able to validate and upload directly?  The beauty of antigen testing is its speed and adaptability.  If a centre is deemed eligible by the HSE or the Department of Health to be part of the digital green certificate system, then we should be able to upload directly.  If we have to go through a validation process after the tests, it really takes from the beauty, speed and flexibility of antigen testing.</p></speech>

The tests can be purchased for somewhere between &euro;50 and &euro;60.  Some providers are more expensive than others.  At the moment, travel is very low-volume.  Our centre is open from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. and we facilitate our regular customers coming in or going out late.  In order to be able to cover all those hours, there is a staffing cost.  When we get to a stage of high numbers travelling, that cost will possibly come down because we will not have to staff centres that are not being used.  At the moment, to be able to deliver the flexibility we want to deliver, we have to be open for those hours.</p></speech>

I emphasise their experience and expertise because I have raised the issue of the use of antigen tests on several occasions in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Having raised it with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and several Ministers, I came to the conclusion that the political establishment is in favour of the use of antigen testing.  In the most recent exchange I had with the T&aacute;naiste, he referred to differing opinions between scientists and public health doctors regarding its use.  He also referred to the report by Professor Mark Ferguson, the Government's chief scientific adviser, and indicated that the Government has now formally endorsed his report.  In that report, Professor Ferguson sees a very prominent position for antigen testing in our battle against Covid.</p> <p>  I want to raise an issue that has been brought to my attention by members of the public.  I firmly believe in the use of antigen testing.  It is my understanding that many of the large sporting organisations in this country, including the GAA, IRFU and the soccer authorities, had moved to the stage where they were prepared to go with antigen testing.  It is a misnomer to say that the Government is opening up sporting, cultural and entertainment events.  That is simply not factual.  The numbers allowed into venues under the new protocols are so low as to be meaningless.  It really is nonsensical.  The administrators of the national organisations had no option other than to go along with the proposals.  However, I am very much aware that they are privately very critical of the arrangements.  Compliance with these new regulations is massively time-consuming and cumbersome and there is a huge workload involved for very little gain.  For the number of people allowed into the venues, the workload is extremely high.  We have a situation now where voluntary organisations are giving out a sparse allocation of tickets and that will become a nightmare for officials.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to understand the resistance to antigen testing by the CMO and the National Public Health Emergency Team.  It is very baffling and defies all logic.  I must say, and I am doing so publicly, that the stubborn obstruction to its use must be questioned.  We need to invite the CMO and his team to come before this Oireachtas committee.  They must be given the opportunity, in public, to explain their rationale in this matter, justify their decision to disagree with the scientific evidence and explain the reasons they are not accepting Government advice and ignoring the advice of the European Commission.  As an island nation, we depend on aviation for connectivity.  We have to ask why antigen testing is being deliberately excluded as part of our weaponry in the battle to detect and control the spread of Covid.  As far as I am concerned, we, as a committee, have an obligation to demand an answer to that question.  I request that the CMO and his officials be brought before us at a very early stage.</p></speech>

Have Mr O'Brien and his team had a similar experience here?  Has the HSE or any Irish agency reached out to his company for a presentation or information?</p> <p>  Will one of the witnesses address the comparative costs of PCR and antigen testing?  We are all very aware that Ireland depends on people being able to travel in and out of the country.  The aviation sector depends on that capability.  We know there are families who will want to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are lifted, but they will have to look at the costs of testing.  For a family of four, comprising two adults and two children over seven years of age, the cost of PCR testing is absolutely enormous.  Antigen testing is much more favourably costed.  I ask one of the witnesses to address the cost factor.</p></speech>

It is important to put the facts out there, which is all we want to do.</p> <p>  I will go to Mr. O'Brien first to respond to Deputy Lowry's points.</p></speech>

Obviously, this is an issue that is very commercially sensitive and subject to negotiations.  I can tell the committee that the cost of the construction of the technology has been largely funded outside Ireland.  We have a unique opportunity now to bring that technology here.  As I said, a lot of the cost of its construction has been incurred elsewhere.</p><p>However, there is a cost in maintaining it, maintaining the infrastructure and support that is necessary and customising the application to suit the individual event or flight - the aviation, train or ferry journey, or whatever it is.  That can all be done through consultation but Ireland has avoided the heavy investment in the technology because it has been done by others elsewhere.</p><p> Second, the critical issue with cost is the volume of the order.  The bigger the order and the number that is required, the lower the price will be.  There is the issue of available stocks of the approved products, and all of that can be ascertained.  As was indicated by Mr. O'Grady, we can access up to 8 million of these tests per week, if needs be, and the cost of that would be greatly reduced by a substantial order.  There is then the issue of the timeframe which has to be met and supply chains.</p><p> There is also the distribution issue.  For example, does the customer want an entity in the private sector, such as Dr. Power&rsquo;s company or Mr. O'Grady&rsquo;s company, to distribute it or does the customer want to use a commercial entity that will actually be required to distribute it, or perhaps use the organisation that is involved?  I give the example of the GAA in particular.  My goodness, there is no better organisation given it is organised on a county and parish basis and can have a prearranged system for distribution of these tests.  We can add to that the fact most people nowadays have a smartphone, and the linkage that can be done between the technology and the test is fantastic and can be scaled up immediately.</p><p> We try to minimise the manpower that will be required with the technology, and Dr. Power and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady indicated that trying to keep a clinic open on a day-to-day basis will result in manpower costs, but there are-----</p></speech>

It is adaptable and customisable but there is time and effort involved.  As someone who develops software, time is always our biggest battle.  It is not a matter of throwing teams and teams of developers at it because it gets inefficient at a certain scale.  Regarding the ability to build platforms and technology, there is an element of that, and the more developers there are, the more that can be done.  Equally, however, with a solution that needs to be pulled together and that is compliant between the science, the medical and the technology to develop it, there are lots of points where there are what I would call interfaces, which need to be thought through.  From our perspective, that is our advantage.  We started developing 13 or 14 months ago, when we saw where this was heading.</p> <p>  In terms of the experience with the NHS, from our perspective, we are interoperating with the NHS as a private company.  We are not building the app and, frankly, we have some views about how that application is being put together at the moment.  I can only really talk about the cost and, again, I concur with Mr. O'Brien that it depends on frequency and the number of users.  That tells people what scale their platform needs to look at from a computing point of view, and then there are all the data sensitivity aspects, storage and making sure that it runs.  Then, there is the verification piece.  To create digital ID, there is a cross between the individual and the-----</p></speech>

The recent measures brought out by the Government create a huge problem for the administrators in voluntary organisations.  The question arises as to who gets admitted and who is left outside.  Are we saying that people who are fully vaccinated are not entitled to go to a GAA match?  Because we are not using antigen, the current system is farcical in my view and it is going to cause friction, rancour, dissension and division within voluntary organisations.  It will put officers and officials in an invidious position.  The current limitation on attendance means the numbers are paltry and it is especially galling when we know there is an alternative in rapid antigen testing, as outlined to us today.</p> <p>  On a question to Mr. O'Grady, has his company the capability to deal with, for example, 2,000 to 3,000 people attending a local GAA match?  How would that process work?</p></speech>

I will talk him through how it would work.  If people were to engage with this version of a solution that I will outline, I do not see any reason we could not approach upcoming events like all-Ireland hurling and football finals in August with the expectation of having full stadia.  I will give a brief outline of what I am proposing and how it will cater for different organisations, which will have different preferences on the exact details.  I will just give a flavour of how it would work.</p> <p>  Individuals would buy a ticket online.  They would be instructed to download the relevant app in order to retrieve their purchase ticket.  As part of the app download, they would be required to populate in their details.  The individual would then be furnished with a self-test pack containing three packs.  The app would display a demonstration video which would illustrate technique.  The app would also instruct on how to interpret the results and how to upload a verification photo of the result window.  As the application is web-based, whatever event co-ordinator is controlling it, be it the GAA, IRFU, FAI or otherwise, would have immediate access to the results and the verification photos in real time.  The app would notify or remind the individual three days before the event to perform the first test of the three-pack, to interpret and declare the result in the app and to upload the verification photo.  Then, assuming that first test was negative, on the day of the event, the app would notify and remind that individual to perform the second test of the triple-pack, to interpret and declare the result and to upload the verification photo.  Assuming that second test is negative, the app would assign a green tick health status.  The green tick health status in the app would grant the individual access to the event.  The app would then notify or remind the individual five days after the event to perform the third and final test, interpret and declare the result and upload the verification folder.</p> <p>  Obviously, if there is a positive result at any of these stages, that has to be dealt with.  For example, if there was a positive result at the first test, which is three days beforehand, this would allow the individual sufficient time to go and get a PCR test, which could confirm or overturn that positive antigen result.  If the positive result is confirmed, the individual would be refunded the cost of the ticket in the same way it was purchased.  If the positive result is overturned by the PCR test, the results can be uploaded into the app to supersede the antigen test result and grant access to the event.  The positive result for the second test, which is on the day of the event, would mean an automatic refund for the individual because there would not be time to go and get a confirmatory test.  This is the benefit of having it in triplicate.</p> <p>  If this, or a form of it, was embraced, the number of people in the stadium is irrelevant.  If the system is implemented, it works for 500, 5,000 or 100,000.  It is the same process.  It is just about filtering out contagious people at earlier stages in order to not bring them into the main group.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Lowry's question, apart from getting an acknowledgement of receipt, there has been no approach to us by any Department or agency.  Having also discussed this with the sporting organisations, it appears to us that, while they are all very favourably disposed, they do not want to engage in the testing as such.  Somebody else has to do the testing but they are favourably disposed to the technology.  They also want to deal with the issue of cost.  There appears to be a fear in the public sector that the Department of Health's policy is against antigen testing.  Consequently, nobody is pursuing these discussions with us or with others.  That seems to be the fear.</p> <p>  On the cost, if one is talking about the volumes I have mentioned and getting Croke Park filled as quickly as possible, the cost of these tests drops dramatically to a fraction of what was indicated earlier by Dr. Power and others.</p></speech>

I will now call on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who has four minutes.  Once Dr. Mina joins us, I will allow him to speak and we will then roll on with the questioners.</p></speech>

Professor Mark Ferguson came before the committee and gave us his report.  We saw this as a possible solution, in combination with the digital green certificate.  I accept what is being said with regard to event systems.  Dr. Power talked about dealing with the sensitivity difficulties with PCR testing and about testing twice over a 48-hour period.  She was obviously talking about something carried out by professionals rather than self-testing.  How does she see that working?</p> <p>  Another fear I have relates to the digital green certificate.  I believe I already know the answer but have any testing companies been contacted by the State, which has responsibility for putting together a paper version of this certificate or an app?  I have a secondary question, which is probably appropriate for Mr. Osman.  What he operates could probably form a template for a digital green certificate app, as it is not a vastly different idea.  My fear is that, as often happens with Government, there will be a long drawn out procurement process and that the app will not be ready for delivery when it is needed.  Perhaps Dr. Power will answer first.</p></speech>

That would solve that issue.</p> <p>  There certainly has not been any contact with private companies.  V1 Medical has not been contacted.  I spoke to the founder and owner of one of the longest-standing travel medicine clinics in Ireland and this clinic had not been contacted.  I have also spoken to someone involved with a company which, although a newer entrant to the market, is one of the larger testing companies providing testing at the airports and this company has also not been contacted. </p> <p>  To quickly go back to Deputy Lowry's last question, V1 Medical was in consultation with one of the major Irish sporting bodies about a test event it was hoping to run in May.  This body contacted ourselves and some other test providers.  We went through the logistics and set up a digital platform.  This was presented to Government but permission was denied.  The next event in that sporting series is now to go ahead with no testing and very limited numbers, as Deputy Lowry mentioned.</p> <p>  On the issue of cost, to put it simply, regardless of overheads, manpower and so on, in the last week I was quoted between &euro;95 and &euro;180 for the processing of a PCR test while I can buy a rapid antigen test for less than &euro;5.  That is the cost issue we are facing if we really want to push PCR testing as opposed to antigen testing.</p></speech>

I assume Mr. Osman has a general indication of the information this will provide and so on.

On the wider issue, my fear is that procurement processes and so on could hold up this measure and that the State will not produce what is needed to be ready to go on 19 July.</p></speech>

I do not see that holding things up.  We built the technology in a customisable way.  The rules engine around how it is built is very flexible.  It is built for multiple jurisdictions and regions.  We could meet some fairly short timelines.  From a commercial and legal perspective, it is a private organisation so matters will not be held up by a difficult third-party shareholder.</p></speech>

I am relatively new to the committee so I did not have the benefit of meeting Professor Mark Ferguson and others who have spoken to the committee at an earlier stage.  I thank Mr. O'Grady in particular for explaining the three-phase testing process and so on.  One of my questions relating to that is what is there to compel people to do a third test?  One obviously needs to do the first and second tests because, if one does not, one will not get a ticket to the event.  Having gone to the event and enjoyed it, how can people be compelled to take a third test and to upload the results?  People may find out from the last test that they are positive but decide not to tell anybody.  Is there anything in the system to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.975" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#GG02200"><p>The value of the third test, which may not accrue from the others, is that one has the benefit of being able to analyse data post event.  This is not something we get from tests carried out prior to an event.  The way to obligate people to take this test is, if they buy tickets on the website of the FAI, the GAA or the IRFU, the third test would be the final step of the transaction and would fulfil the requirements of the application.  An unfulfilled transaction would disqualify people from purchasing further tickets.</p><p>It would be made known to people at the time that the obligation involves a three-step phase.  With regard to the value got from the third test, where there is a case relating to an event an asymptomatic attendee would be referred for a PCR test but that would result in earlier isolation, earlier contact tracing and reduced community transmission.  It would also reassure the attendee.  People are socially responsible and want to know they have not contributed to the problem.  They want to know they are clear before they engage with colleagues or family members.  They get reassurance some days after the event that they are fine.  The event co-ordinator verifies that the event it has run has had no Covid impact.  If somebody says there was an outbreak in a certain geographical area, there will be data after the event to show the outbreak was not related to it and could be coincidental.  If there are positive results after an event, there is the application to notify anybody who may be affected.  The event co-ordinator can notify, through the application, and make people aware that there was a case and that they could be close contacts and should get a HSE confirmatory test.  It is just another safety net to catch a case after the event.</p></speech>

Is there a way to check?  Will tests be numbered 1, 2 and 3 or have a code that will identify the individual tested?  I am trying to work this out.  Self-testing is much easier administratively than other forms of testing in that people are not being asked to turn up at a venue and book a time slot.  How foolproof is self-testing?  I am not Dr. Tony Holohan but I am trying to pre-empt the reasons we are getting such a negative kickback against antigen testing.  Can we make it foolproof?  Can there be photographic identification? How can it be confirmed that an individual has not got someone else to do his or her test?</p></speech>

I believe the pushback against the antigen tests is related to the spin about their accuracy by comparison with PCR tests.  Regarding the spin about antigen tests being only 60% as accurate as PCR tests, which I have read along with every member of the committee, the detail, while it might be available, is misinterpreted.  It is being found that an antigen test and a PCR test cannot be compared.  They are two different technologies looking for two different things.  The antigen test is looking for protein of the virus whereas the PCR test is looking for the RNA of the virus.  The analogy, which ironically is Professor Mina's, is that the PCR test looking for the RNA of the virus is like a detective looking for DNA at a crime scene.  More often than not, the crime is over.  A PCR test will continue to detect RNA of the virus after people have been infectious and contagious whereas the antigen test will be positive only when the viral load is high and, therefore, when somebody is transmitting the virus.  While research shows 71 out of 1,000 people tested positive using PCR whereas only 43 in the same group tested positive using an antigen test &ndash; I apologise because the figures are not dead on &ndash; that is not to say the antigen test is 40% less accurate; it is to say that the antigen test is testing for contagiousness and for whether the individual's viral load is high enough to mean he or she is transmitting the disease and infecting people.  The PCR test, while it has no problem detecting, is actually detecting pre-infectiousness and post-infectiousness.  It is not that the antigen test is less accurate but that it is looking for something different.  What I have described is the origin of the inaccurate spin.</p></speech>

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make the person or the entity identifiable, or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name to the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as if they were physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of how their domestic law might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Mina for his forbearance.  We look forward to his overview.</p></speech>

At the beginning of the pandemic, people had not asked how to use testing to really limit spread.  That has led to a lot of confusion.  I have seen it.  There is a lot of confusion in Ireland but it is not just in Ireland; it is also in the United States and every other country.  I have been advising governments across the world on this issue.<br/><br/>The biggest issue that I can see people are continuing to have regarding antigen tests concerns the questions of whether they are accurate and how to understand the likes of the Cochrane review, which showed a sensitivity rate in the order of 50%.  That needs to be placed in the context of the goal of testing.  This is where the biggest questions have arisen.  Testing is almost always used in the context of medical practice.  That is how we have devised all the metrics we use to evaluate a test but, in the middle of a pandemic, the question of how to use a test is much more about how well the test is limiting the spread and detecting people who are actually infectious.  If that is our question, the sensitivity metrics of the rapid antigen tests change dramatically.  We have published on this in <i>Science</i>, <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>and many more of the world's top medical journals.  All of the conclusions are essentially the same in that where there is an attempt to limit spread, the speed at which a result comes back is much more critical than getting every ounce of sensitivity to detect the RNA of the virus.</p><p>That is because the PCR can detect down to 100 or 1,000 copies, but people do not spread when they are at 100 or 1,000 copies of this virus.  People spread when they are at a million, billion or even a trillion copies of this virus.  If the question is whether we can detect a billion copies of the virus, these tests do it very well, down to about 100,000.  That is sufficient to detect anyone likely to be infectious.</p><p> The other downfall, if we compare these tests to PCR, is speed.  What we have to do when evaluating the sensitivity of a comparator test, like a PCR test, and which is not currently done because we do not even have the metrics to do it, is to question the effective sensitivity of the PCR.  A test taken two days before flying, for example, is a much poorer performing test than a rapid antigen test taken an hour before flying.  People are often worried about missing the first day after somebody is exposed, for example, and whether the antigen test would pick it up, but testing two days before flying means giving an inferior test for that flight versus a rapid antigen test one hour before the flight.  That is because if the real concern is transmission on the flight, or thereafter, we want to be able to test as close to the event as possible.  That will always be the better solution.</p><p> We have shown this innumerable times now, mathematically, and it is really not a question anymore of the mathematics or science.  It is now a question of how to create new language.  That is really what the world is confronting with testing in this pandemic.  We have never had the language before even to describe a test whose primary mode or purpose of use is the obstruction of transmission.  It is a very different set of metrics and uses compared with what we normally see.</p><p> False positives have also been a major concern for many people.  However, with many of the newer rapid tests and some of the older ones, such as Nova and Abbott, both of which we evaluated, for example, we are seeing about one in 10,000 false positives.  It is very small number of false positives.  If a test is positive, the nice thing is a second rapid test, or even a second rapid molecular RNA test, can confirm right then.  The rapid tests can be used for their greatest ability, which is that they are fast, so it does not mean a ten-day purgatory from a false positive.  It means a 20-minute purgatory and then the test is confirmed.  Again, those instances are rare if the right tests are chosen and selected.</p><p> I could go into as much detail as anyone wants, but I really want the take-home message to be that these tests are very accurate if you are concerned about limiting transmission.  If you are trying to diagnose somebody who has symptoms because of Covid, use a PCR test.  However, if the goal is trying to use a test as a way to limit spread, then use a rapid test, whether it is an antigen or rapid molecular test, both of which will be available in future.  Speed is much more important if your goal is to limit spread, especially on something like an aeroplane or at an event etc.  I will stop there but am very happy to take questions.</p></speech>

This has been a really useful meeting so far in getting the difference between PCR and antigen testing properly explained.  As we talked about during the early stages of the pandemic, the perfect is the enemy of the good and speed is very important in the diagnosis of people who are infectious.  Certainly, I have a much better impression of what antigen testing can do now versus PCR.  It is incumbent on us as a committee to bring in the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, as soon as we can, to have a conversation with him about what we have heard today.</p> <p>  My last question, for whoever is most qualified to answer it, is, in the context of the vaccine roll-out, and it is fantastic it is being rolled out as quickly as it can be, the EU digital green certificate, the vaccine bonus and so many of the population being fully vaccinated, do we still need antigen or PCR testing for people once we know they have been vaccinated?  More than half the adult population is now vaccinated with at least one dose.  In three or four weeks that will be two doses.  I am not trying to take away anybody's commercial opportunity, but it is hoped in the fullness of time we will not need to do antigen testing at all.  Are any of the witnesses, possibly Dr. Power who is a medical doctor, able to tell us whether we need to do antigen testing at all once we have all been vaccinated?  Will we still need to do it?</p></speech>

Will he address that point?  When the population is fully vaccinated, will there be a requirement for antigen and PCR testing in terms of travel?</p></speech>

Again, I am pretty confident at this time, with the variants circulating today, that the vaccines will prevent disease, especially severe disease.  However, we have also seen a lot of data that show distributions of the viral loads are actually not that different between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.  We know vaccinated people are likely to be transmitting less because we are starting to see herd effects, meaning when adults are vaccinated we see fewer cases in children.  That is a major win.</p> <p>  We need to be very cognisant that we continue monitoring the situation.  In my family, for example, which is not an example I usually give but shows how I am thinking, my wife is pregnant and currently has a single dose of vaccine.  I will not go into the details of why that is.  Even when people who are vaccinated come to our house, we ask them to take a rapid antigen test.  That is because we know that people can carry the virus asymptomatically when they are vaccinated, especially things like the Delta variant and the inevitable next variants that will come around.</p> <p>  We just have to very cautious and keep watching the data as they flow in but, at the moment, for travel on an enclosed plane, having pretty tight restrictions is still a good thing.  Whether these restrictions are testing everyone before they got on even if they are vaccinated or continuing to use masks, the question of whether they should be used is not a bad question to be asking right now.</p></speech>

I will not delay the meeting.  Dr. Mina has given a very impressive presentation, as have our other witnesses.  The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, has consistently warned of the drawbacks of antigen testing.  He has referred to the test as being 50% accurate.  Does Dr. Mina agree with that sentiment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.999" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Mina" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#JJ00700"><p>Not at all.  It is just an inaccurate assessment.  If the goal, again, is to limit and block transmission and track transmissible people, the mathematics is very simple.  I will give an example that everyone can understand.  A person is positive on a PCR for about 30 days.  We know the isolation window proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is only ten days.  The WHO has seen that a ten-day isolation window is appropriate.  That means ten days is the maximum infectious period, but with a PCR positive test it is 30.  Doing the simple division of ten days of transmissibility divided by 30 days of being PCR positive, means that only around 30% to 40% sensitivity should be expected of a transmission-indicating test when comparing it against PCR.  A 50% accuracy rate is actually a good value when comparing a test with PCR.  If that test is only supposed to detect infectiousness, the accuracy rate should only be somewhere between 20% and 50%, taking variants into account.  It should not be more than 50% sensitive.  The other 50% that is being missed are almost always people who are post-infectious in those 20 days after the isolation period.</p></speech>

Dr. Mina is based in the city of Boston.  On 29 May the Governor of Massachusetts ended all restrictions and the Red Sox are back playing in Fenway Park.  Would Dr. Mina be confident antigen testing can play a significant role in people attending sporting events?</p></speech>

We have plenty of data showing that antigen testing will detect it.  If everyone walking into a sporting event uses an antigen test in the hour or two before that event, it will cut down on the absolute risk of transmission after the event by 90% to 95%.  If we are already starting at a rather low risk, it really cuts down the overall risk.  Importantly, it would then be possible to have very quick access to be able to then trace the outbreaks if antigen test programmes are set up.  The benefits compound on each other.</p></speech>

I would caution not to regard the United States as the gold standard here.  We have done a pretty terrible job in this country.  However, we can look at airlines.  United Airlines and Abbott are now collaborating on a rapid testing programme.  For example, testing to fly back into the country is now being used as a tool.  It is a very powerful tool.</p> <p>  Let us take a step back.  Covid is an information problem.  We would not have transmission if we knew who was infectious when they were infectious.  These tests give us eyes.  They give us the ability to see infectious virus.  It is not some other big scary type of test.  It is just an information game, evaluating somebody using rapid test.  </p></speech>

The questions I had have already been asked and answered very effectively.  I am at a loss as to why the committee is still making this argument.  Such an effective job was done to diminish the efficacy of antigen testing early on in this pandemic.  Many people have done good work to push back on that.  I believe that our session with Professor Mark Ferguson once and for all ended any residual arguments about the efficacy of antigen testing.  Today has been very useful because it shows how sector-ready the industry is to provide this.  There are no barriers to implementing this effectively in aviation, at sporting events or at events in general, bar this blockage.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work the Chairman is doing to ensure this stays on the agenda, but the arguments are increasingly stronger.  We certainly need the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, to appear before the committee to answer what has been proposed.  For me, it is unanswerable at this stage.  This committee continues to present quality witnesses supporting why antigen testing is useful and there is nothing more I can add beyond that.  I thank the witnesses and reiterate that we need to get the CMO to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I ask him here publicly to engage with our committee and put his arguments on antigen testing.  The purpose of the committee is to get to the facts.  The missing piece of the jigsaw at this stage is that we need the CMO to appear before the committee to give his views on antigen testing.  I ask for that to happen very shortly.</p> <p>  I wish Dr. Mina well with his soon-to-be-born child.  Would it be fair to say that he believes that speed trumps perfection?  One of our fellow Irishmen, Dr. Ryan in the WHO, has always made that point.  Dr. Holohan's point that antigen testing is only 50% accurate has gone into the lexicon.  Dr. Mina has dealt with that very well today.</p> <p>  In layman's terms, my understanding is that Covid has a 14-day cycle.  For the first couple of days someone is not that infectious.  There is a peak period in between when the person is highly infectious and in the following days towards the latter end, they are not as infectious.  PCR testing will probably detect the Covid infection throughout that period.  Antigen testing will pick it up when it is at its most infectious.  Therefore, Dr. Mina's thesis is that with antigen testing if it is 50% accurate that means it is picking up the cohort who are most infectious and it is much faster.  His basic point is that an antigen test taken pre-departure is far more effective than a PCR test taken 72 hours prior to arrival.  </p> <p>  Dr. Mina had a very interesting exchange with Professor Phillip Nolan who spoke about snake oil regarding antigen testing.  Obviously, we saw the discourse they had on social media.  I ask Dr. Mina to dispel that notion about it being snake oil.  Does he regard antigen testing as complementary to PCR testing?  Does he see it as standing alone?  Does he believe it is more effective than PCR testing?  What role can it play as we move into a world increasingly vaccinated against Covid?  What practical things can we do in Ireland to get PCR testing to play a vital role in the fight against Covid?  If we do not have antigen testing, are we putting the population at greater risk of catching the infection than by having antigen testing?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-09a.1007" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Mina" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021060900002#KK00800"><p>One very important point is rarely brought up.  This gets to the question of why speed is so crucial.  For example, PCR tests are used three days before a flight.  When the virus grows in somebody's body everyone will be undetectable for the first couple of days after exposure.  Once they become detectable on either test, usually the PCR is first, the virus will grow from barely anything to 1 million or 1 billion copies within a day.  It grows very fast and that is the nature of exponential growth which is the only way viruses grow inside the body.</p> <p>  I bring that up because if somebody uses a PCR test two or three days before a flight and they get a negative result, by the time they walk onto that flight they could literally be at their peak of infection.  They could actually have 1 billion or 1 trillion viral particles in their nose, completely undetected, because they got a test before they were detectable.  The point is that the virus grows extremely quickly in the body.  This is why we get super-spreaders.  Someone at the peak of infectivity could actually be showing their negative PCR test from a swab taken two or three days earlier and walk onto a plane or into an event as a super spreader.  An antigen test right there would detect those people without any problem.  Those are the most important people to detect and have them rapidly removed from circulation.  That is essential.  </p> <p>  We then need to ask what is happening with vaccines.  We saw what happened with the New York Yankees players and staff recently, and now we see the CDC back-pedalling.  For about a year, I have tried to warn the CDC about this.  If we start to relax our safeguards because the population is getting vaccinated, PCR testing is so sensitive that if somebody gets exposed, we are very likely to start picking up really low fragments of RNA.</p><p>When the viral load is that low, especially in a vaccinated person, it is often the case that the person will not be transmitting.  Some people who have been vaccinated can transmit, and they will be protected on both tests.  We do not want to quarantine people who are no longer transmissible; that is a net negative for public health, and PCR would cause that.</p><p> Antigen tests, because of their speed, which I explained, are safer and better when our goal is simply to limit transmission, especially in an acute event such as a flight, and also because they are much more accessible.  They can be used on a more ongoing basis, if needed, over a longer period.  It is much easier to do that than it is with PCR.  Unfortunately, PCR, out the gate with this pandemic, was deemed to be the gold standard.  As a public health test, however, it has few, if any, of the qualities we want in such a test.  Rapid antigen testing, on the other hand, features speed, frequency of testing and many other qualities we would seek in a test that has a purpose of limiting transmission.</p></speech>

Dr. Mina has published academic papers on this area.  Has he carried out empirical work to show what it would do to reduce the rate of transmission among the general population in Ireland?  This feeds in to public health.</p></speech>

An epidemiological term that most people will have heard by this point is the R nought, or reproductive, number of the virus.  If that can be kept below 1, outbreaks will not take off.  Some people have thought that in order for a test programme to be effective, it needs to stop 100% of transmission, but that is a poor way to examine a population effect.  All we have to do to prevent outbreaks from occurring in a population at large is to ensure that for every ten people who are infected, nine others will go on to be infected from those people, instead of 13.  If the ratio can be kept below 1, outbreaks cannot take off.  That is the basic principle of controlling outbreaks in epidemiology-----</p></speech>

There are all kinds of logistical issues with allowing people to be tested in time for their flights, so there probably has to be some compromise in that regard.  Perhaps 24 hours would be good.</p> <p>  Regarding the point-of-care tests, neither rapid antigen tests nor rapid PCR tests are allowed by Ireland.  It has to be a lab-based test.  The beauty of these rapid tests is that they do not require a lab, so they can be conducted on site as the person is going onto his or her flight or just beforehand.</p> <p>  As for forgoing quarantine, Professor Mark Ferguson gave a great presentation to this committee a few weeks ago and spoke about some studies that had been carried out in the UK, which are also outlined in the report in his name.  The studies found that serial daily antigen testing could replace quarantine and allow people to continue in their everyday life rather than quarantine, whether because they have arrived from another country or because they have been nominated as a close contact.  We missed a trick with the leaving certificate, which is beginning today, where thousands of students who are stressed beyond their means might not be allowed to take their exams if they have been named as close contacts.</p></speech>

If we quarantine people all the time, it is very difficult.  These tests can be used as an alternative.  If we were to test whether someone has had exposure or if he or she is just arriving into another country, these tests can be used every day, instead of quarantine.  A test used every day will probably be more effective than quarantine, particularly when we start to consider the fact that people in quarantine tend to become non-compliant after a few days.  That has to be taken into account, and a test used every day will be a very effective substitute for a quarantine of somebody who is not known to have been infected.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Grady dealt with some of this earlier and Dr. Mina has outlined how antigen testing is a supreme tool for stopping transmission.  I had intended to ask a question about optimal times.  Dr. Power stated that we will have to be able to facilitate the green digital certificate if we are to go at this.  Professor Ferguson spoke about serial testing as a means of bridging the gap between antigen and PCR, and I accept the argument that this could be used to avoid people having to quarantine.  I also accept the arguments made about antigen almost being better from the point of view of transmission.  Is there a need for any element of serial testing, pre or post arrival, to bridge that gap?  Do we need to operate pilot projects as soon as possible in order that we will have our own information as opposed to that freely available from tests carried out in Britain and throughout Europe?</p></speech>

How quickly could a pilot antigen testing scheme be set up, for example, on a moderately busy route from Ireland to the UK?</p></speech>

The Department of Health, the HSE or whoever else might wish to tell us that, but as regards the logistics of carrying out tests for a flight, I could do that this afternoon if needs be.</p><p>It is that quick.  We really can scale it up that quickly.</p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point about post-arrival screening, that probably depends on the risk in the country the arrivals are coming from.  For a country that has to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine at the moment, such as India, because of variants of concern, then, rather than the Department of Health or whoever deciding we need quarantine, we can replace that with serial testing.  For EU countries without a particular risk, I do not see why we should quarantine.  The ethos of the digital Covid certificate is that countries of an equal or lesser risk to us should not be subject to quarantine.</p></speech>

An antigen test will only detect the infectious case so it is superior in that regard.</p></speech>

There is overwhelming scientific evidence to show the effectiveness of antigen testing and I suggest we follow up today&rsquo;s meeting with an invitation to the CMO and his team.  This is a serious public interest matter which can no longer be dealt with behind closed doors.  We need answers in public.  Our public health officers must justify and give the reasons for their opposition to antigen.  I want to see our venues and events reopening.  That can be done safely with antigen and we can allow people to get back to enjoy their lives.  This is one of the tools to do that.</p> <p>  A previous question was asked of Dr. Power and I would ask the same question of Dualchem and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady.  They have had no contact.  They have written to all these agencies of the State.  We as a committee should write to these agencies to remind them they have a presentation from Dualchem and others and they should start negotiations with them on what they have to offer.</p></speech>

We reiterate our invitation to the CMO, Dr. Holohan, and his colleagues to come before us.  We will follow up with them.  This matter requires public discussion on a factual basis to justify why antigen testing is not being used.  From what we have heard today, it would make an enormous difference.</p></speech>

I will go back to Mr. O&rsquo;Grady from Dualchem.  We face into the GAA championship, a huge social and cultural event for all things Irish.  My question relates to putting in place what Mr. O&rsquo;Grady spoke about.  If it was done on the basis that the antigen test had to be monitored, rather than self-administered, could it still work or is it too cumbersome or costly a system for that to happen?  How long would it take Mr. O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s company to get such a system up and running for, say, GAA championship matches?  Dr. Mina might then comment on self-administered antigen tests versus professional monitoring of same.</p></speech>

Logistically, I do not see how healthcare professional antigen tests will facilitate an event because it realistically cannot be performed on-site on the day of an event at the anticipated volumes.  I am going on the assumption we are talking full houses.</p></speech>

One is bringing them all to, in GAA terms, Drumcondra to tell them who cannot go.  If we utilise an independent testing centre such as we operate and Dr. Power operates, directing people to such a centre for an event could unnecessarily mix an event attendee with a possibly symptomatic individual who is not attending the event.</p></speech>

If there was a logistical solution to testing 80,000 people on the day of an All-Ireland final, it is the exact same process.</p> <p>  The only reason I would benefit from the self-test relates to the question I was asked earlier about how we ensure people are compliant with the post-event test.  It will be a big ask from a compliance point of view for people to get a healthcare professional antigen test a number of days after an event and communicate that result to the event co-ordinator.  When they have it in their house, it is already in their possession and they have paid for it.  It is just asking them to do the swab, interpret the result and upload the photo.  I expect compliance to be significantly better for a post-event self-test than one done through a healthcare professional.</p></speech>

His model was to have people who have travelled from abroad isolate at home with rapid antigen tests being done every second day.  Self-administered antigen tests would cut down on tests considerably compared with monitored tests.  How does that feed into public health concerns?  What do the Department of Health and HSE need to do to properly regulate antigen testing so that it works as an additional aid to public health in Ireland?</p></speech>

The short answer is "Yes".  Most of the initial studies that looked at self-administered antigen testing found that the efficacy was a bit lower but that was on the first attempt.  The first time people try to tie their shoes, they do not do it well, but they do it just fine the second time.  It is not different with an antigen test.  It is important to recognise and has been shown here, in Liverpool, and elsewhere, that those early reports that people could not do the test as well was because it was the first time and they were fumbling around trying to figure out what the plastic was.  These are so simple that the second time they used the test, the efficacy shot up.  We can use that knowledge as a test to say that if people need to use a test, maybe they can use it earlier, perhaps two weeks before a flight or event, or they can have a more sophisticated version.</p> <p>  There is a middle ground between healthcare-observed testing and completely independent at-home testing.  We have seen that utilised in the United States.  I want to be clear that I have no financial ties to any of the companies that we are talking about.  eMed is doing observed testing on computers using call centre workers rather than healthcare workers.  It allows it to scale to substantial numbers of observed tests.  If people are doing the test for the first time, maybe they can get help through a service such as eMed.  It is simple.  There are solutions to these issues.</p></speech>

What structures for the regulation of antigen testing could we have here?  That would bring much certainty and confidence to this among the public.

Instead if in a quarantine period, people can have a test daily or every other day.  That would be an effective way to stop outbreaks from spreading.  If an outbreak is ongoing in a community, antigen testing can be used across a large swathe of that community.  Our evaluations have shown that that would prevent an outbreak.  Even if cases start to emerge, it would prevent them from causing an outbreak that needs to be addressed.  The ongoing use of testing is an effective tool to limit spread.</p> <p>  Regarding regulation, it is important that we evaluate the different tests.  If a Government is going to have a contract with a company, it is important to regulate those tests and understand how they are performing.  Some of the tests that we saw in Taiwan and Korea were not performing well.  Others have performed exceedingly well.  It is important to create a panel with an independent group that is able to evaluate the different tests.  It could be done in one day.  A test could be taken from a company, with a box of 50 of the tests, and an answer could be provided by the end of the day.  It is simple and I am happy to advise on how that could work after the meeting.</p></speech>

Much work is going on in the artificial intelligence sector to enable more accuracy and better validation of that test against the individual at home.  This is continuing in that direction.  Echoing Mr. O'Brien, I thank the committee for allowing us to speak today.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  We are not against PCR testing but we see a major role for antigen testing.  We have had Professor Mark Ferguson, a Government adviser, attend.  We have had the current expert witnesses and Dr. Mina from Harvard, who is a world authority on antigen testing.  We now need a public meeting with Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Cillian de Gascun, and whoever else is required to discuss antigen testing.  If the CMO has issues with antigen testing, let us justify them.  We have heard here today that antigen and PCR tests are different but that antigen tests have a significant role to play in containing the spread of the virus.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Power from V1 Medical, Mr. O'Brien, Mr. O'Grady and Mr. Osman from Duelchem, and Dr. Michael Mina from Harvard University who has encapsulated in a medically-underpinned but easy to understand way the difference between antigen and PCR testing.  It is the first time it has been explained in a way that I think the ordinary person can understand.  Antigen testing has a vital role to play.</p><p>We need to get back to operating in a normal world.  Antigen testing has a key role to play in that.  We look forward to our meeting with the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan.  We have an open invite, in writing, to Dr. Holohan.  I am aware that things have been very busy, but the nettle must be grasped in this area now.  We need to look at antigen testing.  It has a vital role to play.</p><p> This meeting is now adjourned.  The next meeting of the joint committee will be a private meeting at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 June 2021.  I thank everyone for attending.  Mr. O'Brien might send on those correspondence documents to us.</p></speech>
