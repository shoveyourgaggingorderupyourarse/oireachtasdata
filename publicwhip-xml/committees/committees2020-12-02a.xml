    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.4" nospeaker="true" time="16:30:00" ><p>Mr. Seamus McCarthy(An tArd Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00200"><p>I welcome everybody to the meeting.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the Committee.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Neasa Hourigan.</p> <p>  Before we move on to the other items of business I want to make a statement.  I want to address the issue surrounding the tweet that I published over the weekend marking the 100th anniversary of the Kilmichael ambush in County Cork.  I am very conscious, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that the controversy has placed all the members in a difficult and totally unnecessary situation, particularly when this committee has such important work to carry out.  What I was attempting to do was to highlight that following the disastrous decision to partition the country almost 100 years ago, in the wake of events such as Kilmichael we still had conflict that went on for a long time during which a lot of suffering took place.  I deleted the tweet and apologised for posting it.</p> <p>  As we work to advance reconciliation on our island, we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that is honest to all of us and our beliefs but that does not deepen division or cause hurt.  As an Irish republican and someone who is in a position of political leadership, I have to be more aware of my responsibility to ensure that I do not do anything that is disrespectful to others.  Since the mid-1980s, when A Scenario for Peace was published, right through the Hume-Adams dialogue, and, finally, to the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, I have actively supported initiatives to bring about peace on the island.  On Sunday, I apologised for any offence that I caused due to the insensitive nature of the tweet and I want to repeat that apology to the members today.  I also want to apologise to all my colleagues for the position in which I put them.  My tweet fell below not just the standard we expect of each other but the standard I expect of myself as a Member of the D&aacute;il and for that I am genuinely sorry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for making that statement.  I welcome the decision by the Ceann Comhairle to respond to the letter from Arlene Foster.  It was a very strong statement to the effect that nothing we do in here should in any way contribute to undermining the democratic process.  I believe the tweet was offensive at a time when, more than ever, we all need to work together with the UK leaving the European Union.  We all have a harder task in respect of working together with the Six Counties, which will be outside the EU, and we must make sure that nothing is done to undermine that process whereby the entire issue is now changed.</p> <p>  This committee is one of the most important committees in this House.  We are here to hold Departments and State authorities to account.  Likewise, it is here to hold every one of us to account, including Deputy Stanley, as Chairman.  It is disappointing that this tweet was sent out.  The Chairman's party leader said his was a one-off tweet but a number of tweets have been sent over the past number of months which were subsequently withdrawn.  There is a lot of speculation that some of these tweets are being deliberately and carefully drafted.  That is not the way to deal with issues and create division, and I certainly believe the tweet has created division.  </p> <p>  It is extremely important now that the Chairman makes a full statement on this matter in the D&aacute;il to re-establish his credibility as Chairman and the credibility of this committee.  Many people died over the 30 years of conflict.  The day the Chairman mentioned, the Narrow Water attack, was the same day two people aged 14 and 15 died in another tragedy at a different location.  It is extremely important that we do not bring back the divisions that existed at that time or add to them in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00400"><p>Does anybody else want to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00500"><p>I acknowledge that the Chairman took down the tweet, apologised and has made a statement here.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and a Member of the D&aacute;il, the tweet got much more attention beyond Twitter in the broadcast and the mainstream media.  That is not terribly surprising but it does have an external impact also beyond this jurisdiction.  I sat on the decade of centenaries committee which dealt with the pre-1916 period and there were members of the Chairman's party on it who played a very constructive role.  The one thing we all understood was how difficult any kind of marking of the War of Independence and the Civil War would be and the need to be very respectful in any of that.  I would want an assurance that this is a one-off mistake.  I would like to hear that from the Chairman.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not have a role in respect of this issue.  Any role in respect of it is within his party in terms of how media and social media are handled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00600"><p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Last week, John Finucane, MP, came in to seek our support for his family's quest for an inquiry into the horrific murder of his father.</p><p>In the course of that meeting and of the debate on the Seanad motion which preceded it, the Houses of the Oireachtas recognised and recounted the terrible details of the violence visited upon the Finucane family.  The Chairman of joint committee, Deputy O'Dowd, offered his full support and noted that Mr. Finucane's family was not the only one to suffer and that all the victims of violence need to be respected.  The party of our Chairman has stated repeatedly that there is not a hierarchy of victims.  We have to acknowledge that his tweet was about a very violent incident within recent memory, involving the death of very young men and in a very strategic and deliberate way.  We heard at another committee last week about the human impact of violence.  There is a human impact to this violence also that is very significant and has been well recounted.  The Chairman's tweet hurts the survivors who are alive today and whose family members - teenage boys and young men, some of them fathers - are still missing this Christmas.</p><p> What I want to know is what was behind the sentiment the Chairman expressed and what it says about what we are trying to do in terms of reconciliation for the future and about mutual respect.  The tweet seems to have no regard for the personal impact on the people who are left behind, in the way his party quite rightly called for in recognition of the Finucane family last week.  It is what is behind that sentiment that concerns me.  I am also interested in what prompted the Chairman to remove it and what was his thought process in that regard?  It is hard to see because a person must have that sentiment within himself or herself in the first place in order to express it.  Did somebody call the Chairman and tell him to delete it?  Did he receive an instruction?</p><p> I do not think that anything Sinn F&eacute;in does is by accident.  It is a highly strategic operation that has been well controlled, well managed and well planned in all its steps, before 1998 and since.  This is the first time Sinn F&eacute;in has held such a senior position in this Parliament.  Deputy Stanley is Chair of this committee, which, historically, is the most important of all the parliamentary committees and which is always chaired by an established parliamentarian of significance and of significant experience.  It is because of the significance of his office, that the reaction we have seen has been forthcoming.  My view is that he needs to go further than making an apology to this committee.  What he has said represents an attempt to alleviate the discord within the committee, but the real offence is to the Irish people and to their representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I think the Chairman should go to the D&aacute;il and apologise or make a personal statement there.  His party needs to make a statement of a similar nature that genuinely separates this repeating of violence and the glory of violence every couple of weeks.  The sequence is that it happens every couple of weeks and then there is an apology and we move on.  Meanwhile, it becomes more normalised just as we move towards a period of commemorations.</p><p> As parliamentarians, we must ensure that we take steps to protect the moderate nature of our politics.  Every party here has done things in stepping towards the centre in defence of the State that might have been politically uncomfortable for it.  I do not want to lose that centre ground to a polarised sort of politics like we have on other parts of this island.  I urge the Chairman and his party to take those steps towards moderation and to talk about separation from violence and to reject that.  I think he can play a hugely significant role in that regard.  His office is of such significance that it is hard to let the matter pass without noting it in this way.  I really urge him to give the matter further reflection before we get on with our business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for making that statement.  I know it is never easy for a public representative, especially somebody who holds the Chair of an important committee such as this, to sit in front of his or her colleagues and tell them that he or she made a mistake and to outline that he or she is genuinely sorry for that mistake.  I believe the Chairman.  I think anybody who knows him, regardless of their political affiliations, will believe him.  Anybody who knows him will know that the tweet was a clumsy attempt at something.  I think he has accepted that and that it was not the place to have, as other members of the committee have alluded to, an important debate in which we all need to participate.</p> <p>  Anybody who knows Brian Stanley will acknowledge that, first and foremost, he is a good man.  He is a fair man.  He is certainly a very fair and effective Chair of this committee.  In the short number of months since the committee has been in existence, anybody looking on, recognising the challenges that it has faced trying to deal with two-hour sessions and what are in some instances very elaborate and detailed issues and sets of accounts, knows that the Chairman has conducted himself in a very fair and effective manner that has allowed this committee to deliver, insofar as it can, under those restrictive measures.</p> <p>  These are going to be a very important number of years, not only in the context of the ongoing decade of centenaries, but also as we move to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That means we all need to be part of mature reflection, but also mature discussion and debate and a recognition that there is not a shared narrative in terms of the causes of conflict in the first instance but also the outworking of those conflicts.  The only thing we all agree on is that in whatever roles we have, we must all do everything within our power to ensure that never again does this island experience the conflicts that have been a hallmark of Irish history.  We are moving to a point in terms of the Good Friday generation where some Members of this House have no recollection of the conflict itself.  This means that those of us who have some recollection and those who have a very clear recollection of the conflict have a very important responsibility to ensure that there is no glory in conflict.  Unfortunately, many people suffered.  As has already been mentioned, lots of people tragically lost their lives.  The role that we all now need to play is to ensure that the suffering and loss of life in those circumstances never happens again.</p> <p>  As for this committee, we have important work to do.  I, for one, accept the Chairman's apology.  I believe that it is heartfelt.  I hope that in our own individual ways we can play a role to ensure that we can all give commitments that we will be incredibly careful in terms of our public utterances on these issues in the first instance, but that we can play constructive roles in the ongoing job of building peace in our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00300"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00400"><p>I accept the Chairman's apology and his statement.  I have known Brian outside of my short time in the D&aacute;il as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and I have always found him to be a pure gentleman.  Unfortunately, given social media as it is today, things happen in this regard.  I do not condone the content.  I spoke to the Chairman personally about that.  I do, however, accept his apology.  I did not agree with the motion that was brought by Sinn F&eacute;in in respect of the previous Taoiseach, who is now T&aacute;naiste.  As a result, I do not agree with anybody calling for his head.  I think we have far too much important work to get on with.  I do not think anybody has taken the level of offence that is being purported.  I think we are all aware of our history and we should just get down to work and get on with what we have to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.  I accept his apology to the committee and I thank him for it.  There is no doubt, however, that the tweet was hurtful and that it was a glorification of what happened at Narrow Water.  The Chairman's words from when we started our work ring true, namely, that we need to leave party politics at the door.  We are here on behalf of the Oireachtas to scrutinise public bodies and other bodies.  That said, I accept his apology.  I do not think this is the place to scrutinise the tweet.  That is for the D&aacute;il Chamber and it is for the Chairman and his party to reflect on whether they want to deal with the matter in that forum.</p> <p>  I would not classify the tweet as clumsy.  I do not say the Chairman did so.  I hope that when he says he apologises for the tweet, it will not happen again.  That is an important element because, as he rightly points out, this is a very prestigious committee within the Houses and there is an extra onus on him, as Chair.  I know he accepts that and I know he understands it now.</p><p>I hope, however, that we will not have this situation in respect of the Chairman again because it puts the committee into disrepute and it is something we do not want to see again.  I thank the Chairman for his statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00200"><p>I accept the Chairman is making an apology to the committee.  Apart from distracting from the work of this committee, my view is that the apology should be made to those impacted by the tweet, rather to us.  I was not going to comment on the issue but in the Chairman's explanation and in Deputy Carthy's contribution, whether it was a clumsy tweet or a strategic approach, as another member mentioned, a definite attempt was made to try to conflate actions which the army of the Republic of Ireland took in 1920 and the actions that an organisation of the same name took at Narrow Water.  That is not new.  It is a political difference the Chairman's party has with many others in the D&aacute;il.  It is also an attempt to suggest that for someone to be in favour of a united Ireland, it is enough to be anti-British.  We know we need to do far more than that to create a shared island.</p> <p>  While I and many other members of the committee were quite reasonable when we were getting media requests yesterday, the irony is not lost on me that if any of us had been in the Chairman's position, we would probably be the subject of a pile-on.  I do not draw my political tactics from that style of politics when I am in the wrong and I do not believe I should do it when other people are in the wrong.  I object to the Twitter pile-on today in respect of the Ceann Comhairle.  It was an attempt to open up a second line of defence and it was deplorable, especially when so many members of this committee have been so reasonable on this issue.  Deputy Devlin put it well when he said that this is a political difference between the Chairman's party and others here.  The Chairman has as much of a mandate as any other Deputy in this House.  The matter is one between Sinn F&eacute;in and the Irish people, not the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his apology, which I accept.  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I do not condone the content of the tweet, which was insensitive and inappropriate.  It caused hurt to victims and descendants of victims and people who have a particular perspective.  I respect and fully understand that.  The Committee of Public Accounts is not the place for what some people are seeking, however.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement should by all means invite the Chairman before it to explore this matter.  If the Ceann Comhairle wants to pursue this issue, that is what the Committee on Procedure is for; it is not our role.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I believe that, as a nation, we have become a colosseum where we are far too anxious to set up a guillotine every time there is a misdemeanour.  I have previously stated outside this room that an appropriate body, such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, should develop a book of quantum of sorts, with a list of appropriate sanctions for appropriate levels of misdemeanour, from lesser offences right up to more serious ones.  The outcome of the approach we are taking now is the same every time there is an indiscretion or a misdemeanour, however serious or minor.  It is to seek someone's head.  We saw that recently with the T&aacute;naiste's leak.  Some approached that issue in an appropriate way, but others in a different way.  </p> <p>  I am not for one second condoning the content of the tweet.  It was insensitive.  It is a matter, however, for the committee on the Good Friday Agreement, and certainly not for us.  A great deal of dirty laundry will need to be washed out publicly in the years ahead, as the healing and reconciliation process continues.  That of course includes the Finucane family and a public inquiry in that regard, where we have done our end of the bargain with the Smithwick tribunal, as agreed at Weston Park.  That has not been matched by the British, who have, unfortunately, brought their judicial system into disrepute by their actions.  </p> <p>  I am old enough to remember the Troubles being a nightly blight on the news, in respect of the loss of life on both sides.  We all regret that.  Given the years we are in, I wonder, when we look back, why we manage to romanticise and glorify atrocities of 100 years ago and then look at others in a different light.  I abhor all violence.  I mourn the victims of all violence, no matter on what side or in what era.</p> <p>  I would prefer if this committee stuck to its business.  We have a huge body of work to get through.  I accept the Chairman's apology.  If the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement wishes to pursue a particular line, it can do that.  If the D&aacute;il wants to pursue a particular line, the Business Committee and the Committee on Procedure are there for that purpose.  We do not have the competence, and I certainly do not have the will, to pursue this matter any further here.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.  There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that every word spoken was genuine and sincere.  That reflects the type of person the Chairman is.  The Chairman, like me, is a lifelong and proud Republican.  He is a person who walks the walk.  People talk about bringing peace to the island and the Good Friday Agreement.  The Chairman was actively involved in promoting and working for that peace and seeing it come to fruition.  We have had a permanent peace now for more than two decades.  I know the Chairman's words are genuine because he has walked the walk.</p> <p>  Regarding the chairmanship of this committee, I think the two matters are totally separate.  In the short time he has been in this role, the Chairman has been exemplary.  He has been impartial and fair on all occasions.  Again, that reflects the type of individual he is.  That is the end of the matter for me.  The Chairman has genuinely apologised and, as others have said, this committee has much work to do and we need to get on with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Chairman's statement.  The Committee of Public Accounts is one of the most important and effective of the parliamentary committees.  The Chairman's actions have impacted on the work of the committee, especially given his privileged position as the Chair.  The public see accountability as a moral construct which is only achieved when public officials serve with the commitment to do the right thing.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, an important step will be for the Chairman to clarify his position in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  Time and again, we have seen Sinn F&eacute;in members not taking responsibility for their actions.  We had Deputy John Brady a fortnight ago and the Chairman last weekend.  This is not a singular or once-off event.  The Chairman's party leader also needs to make a statement on this matter.  It is seen by the Irish public as a strategic ploy to inflate tensions.  We all have a responsibility in the decade of commemorations to commemorate the past in a respectful manner.  That is an important step.  Political representatives, irrespective of their political and ideological differences, must lead responsibly.  It is apparent that we need a statement on this matter and we must also continue the important work of this committee in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

There is obviously a range of views among members who are coming to this matter in a thoughtful way.  I clarify that my actions are my own.  I take full responsibility for them.  I was wrong.  I have apologised, and I am saying that sincerely.  Nobody else needs to take any responsibility.  I am solely responsible for my actions and I have to take responsibility for them.</p> <p>  I am conscious of what the members have said on this matter.  My commitment in the time ahead, through my words and actions, is to have the confidence of members, as Chairman, as we deal with the important work ahead.</p> <p>  A number of members mentioned the decade of commemorations.  We are in that decade now and there are a few difficult years to go through because there are difficult issues.  The lesson for me and all of us is that during that period we need to be very careful and continue to build reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  That is my commitment. </p></speech>

Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  There were 13 sets of financial statements and accounts laid before the D&aacute;il between 16 November and 27 November.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in all cases.  In the accounts for the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board - that is, Caranua - the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to two matters.  The first is the inadequate control over grant repayment.  Second, there is the review of the effectiveness of internal controls.  We will meet Caranua, as agreed at our last meeting, on 17 December.  I propose we request Caranua to provide further information as part of the briefing it will provide for that meeting.  Are members happy to agree to that?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I have sought to find out what the problem was.  Members can see the accounts were certified on 6 December 2019.  I looked at the appropriation account of the Department of Education and at that stage, the end of March, it noted it had received the accounts but the laying of the accounts was pending.  For some reason, that did not happen between March and November.  There were three other sets of accounts pending at that stage so I have asked to check that each of those sets has since been laid.</p></speech>

Are members minded to do that?  We will request that be done.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items is category B, correspondence from the Accounting Officer and Ministers and their follow-up to previous Public Accounts Committee meetings.  The first one is No. 202B from Mr. S&eacute;an &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education, dated 13 November 2020, providing further information requested by the committee arising from the meeting of 21 October.  A number of Deputies have requested to address this today.  I think Deputy Catherine Murphy was one of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#G02300"><p>Yes.  There were a number of things that stood out.  I will refer to one.  The prefabs in the longest standing rental agreement have stood since 2000.  There is a building going up now but one would have to ask about value for money in terms of the length of time that took and it is important that we note that.  There may well be others that are not as long but that could be nearly as long.</p><p>It would be quite useful to get a few more examples, perhaps five, six or even ten examples of the length of time.  There is the cost of renting and the issue of substandard accommodation as well.  I ask that this be done.</p><p> With regard to the payroll system, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; states on page 3 that there are approximately 9,000 casual employees and that there is a new standard of governance and approval process for the sourcing of goods and services.  An interim payroll upgrade is under way and it is due to be completed in the latter part of 2021.  He said the implementation of a new payroll system could take up to three or four years, which is a surprisingly long lead-in time for something like this.  It is stated there is a very complex system with four different streams on the payroll, with primary, post-primary, non-teaching staff and retired people but there are 9,000 casual employees.  I received information in reply to a parliamentary question that under the home tuition scheme, home tutors have always been engaged by parents or guardians of a child who receives home tuition.  Tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department.  Are they among the 9,000?  What is the proportion of these 9,000 casual employees?  I acknowledge that some of them are probably substitute teachers.  A little more examination needs to happen so we can get an understanding of it.</p><p> The average compensation payment does not always compute in the one year.  It is not entirely satisfactory that we are unable to see it all and it may well be that we have to look back historically.  Where there are compensation payments, we have to learn whether there are things that can be avoided in the future.  It is very important that we see the cost of something and the value of doing some work.  That is the reason I am particularly picking up on this.</p><p> There is an important paragraph on page 6 on the school transport system and the fact that some moneys were paid back to the Exchequer.  It is an important paragraph with regard to some issues we have previously looked at.  It would be quite useful to ask about the final sentence on page 7 and whether it is intended to pursue a Garda investigation.  Perhaps we can ask for an update in a few months just to keep an eye on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#H00200"><p>The first issue I want to raise arising from the correspondence also relates to temporary accommodation prefabs.  I am always wary when temporary solutions are in place for a long period because we end up creating vested interests and people who have an interest in a bad practice continuing for longer.  The three largest suppliers of rental accommodation in 2019 were three companies that provide Portakabins and prefabs.  Can we ask the Department to clarify the number of students being educated in such structures?</p> <p>  The school Deputy Murphy spoke about has made use of temporary accommodation for 20 years.  We know from the work of previous Committees of Public Accounts that this is not a cheap option.  Over time, the funds expended on temporary accommodation in a single school would buy a small house in Dalkey, just to give Deputy Devlin's constituency a mention.  We are speaking about substantial money.  It would be useful if the committee could ask of the Department, in tabular format, all of the schools using temporary structures, the duration they have been used and the cost associated with them to date.  That is important.</p> <p>  I fully endorse Deputy Murphy's point on legal claims.  It requires much more scrutiny.  It is not just the Department of Education but it is a good place to start.  As she said, it is very opaque to find out exactly how much in any given year was spent on settling legal claims.  It is very hard to find information, particularly where claims were settled or if there was a non-disclosure element to the deal.  The State could have been forfeiting substantial sums due to negligence, for example.  We hear anecdotes public servants making complaints about another public servant and the Department settles.  The public servant at the heart of it could be promoted in an external competition and nobody realises that person is the reason the State is out substantial funds.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General in a position to give us an analysis on the legal costs associated with the Department over a period of time as opposed to just one year?  As the correspondence correctly states, a claim might be made in 2020 but it might not be settled until 2023.  Usually, when a Department comes before us in a given year, its representative states a claim that was settled last year relates to something from five years ago and that the problems have been addressed.  If we had an overarching analysis, it would be useful for the committee.</p></speech>

All of the appropriation accounts have this note and the structure of the note is set out in the template, which is directed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not a great note from an information point of view.  It is opaque and there are many difficulties with it.  There should be better information available and it should be available on a Department-by-Department basis.  The State Claims Agency handles all of these on behalf of Departments.  There should be better information available from it as to the amount of compensation paid out on a claim and the associated legal costs, whenever they were paid.  That might be the first place to go to look for what information is already available from the State Claims Agency on these.</p></speech>

It is very clear from the breakdown given that the overall figure of &euro;13.8 million for post and telecommunications is largely, as we suspected, with regard to the postage of payslips, which amounts to more than &euro;10 million.  In the course of the Secretary General's contribution, he mentioned there may be the possibility of using an existing or planned upgrade to allow a system to be implemented.  My question as a new member of the committee is how we track this.  It was a formal issue raised with the Secretary General.  He has written to us to outline the figures but has not given us a commitment or responded in any way as to how he would address the costs, which I call "wasteful".  While we might give him the time between now and when he next comes before us, I would hate for him to give us the same answer then.</p></speech>

Perhaps we should recommend that there is an improvement so it is more transparent.</p><p>I presume that we would write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request it to ask all of the Departments to apply a different format so that people can follow this a lot more easily.</p><p> In terms of the Department of Education, a good few years ago I remember asking parliamentary questions and being absolutely gobsmacked by the reply regarding the amount of money that was spent by the Department to fight parents who sought appropriate education for their children.  Some of those cases were initiated but never concluded but then the children ended up being facilitated.  The expenditure would have provided a large amount of very good quality education instead of paying legal fees.  To ensure there is appropriate expenditure of public moneys we must take a good look at this matter because there can be things that are bad practice.  This committee must try to interrogate such matters. </p></speech>

It would be useful if we could get more detailed information on the percentage of them that have been rented for more than five, ten and 15 years, respectively.  We accept that prefabs must be used as a short-term measure but I think their use needs to be phased out.  Apparently, the school population will decrease according to the trend in demographics.  We will look for further information on the other items raised and on how the wage is administered through the post.  We can make the recommendation in terms of the report.</p></speech>

We know that the schools bundle 5 is not on time due to the liquidation of the Carillion group and have been consistently told that this is not a cost on the State by virtue of the way that the matter was handled.  In Maynooth, there is a schools bundle 5 project to build two 1,000 pupil schools right beside each other.  These schools were due to be occupied last September but they still have not been completed so there is a cost in the interim.  It may not be the cost of building the schools but there are costs for additional accommodation.  There are costs that are not counted as costs by virtue of the fact that the project has not been completed.  Therefore, it is not quite accurate to say that the entire cost is borne.  There are financial consequences when projects are not completed on time.</p></speech>

When the policy was initially introduced we were finding some cases where there were, let us say, board membership fees being paid to people who were in public sector employment but we would have brought those to attention, I think probably around 2011, 2012, 2013, and most of them would be washed out of the system at this stage.  It does not appear to be a problem any longer and would not have been for the past four or five years.  Now DPER may have codified some of that but they also may not have the information readily available.</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry pursued an issue regarding the Committee of Selection and the absence of one.  I note the increase from &euro;304 million to &euro;313 million.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State and the key issue for some of us is how such inadequate oversight has been overlooked.  We need further information on the liquidation and the length of time that it will take, which was unclear when the delegation was here.  I want to know the timeline and whether there are risk assessments on delays and further costs.  I ask that we request the Department to provide all of that information.</p></speech>

I am not quite clear in my own mind about the differentiation between State agencies and companies.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General audit both?  I can see in the documentation that some companies paid a dividend in 2019.  Possibly, that situation will be changed considerably in 2020 because of under-performance caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>  Some State agencies or enterprises are technically supposed to be commercially run but there is no obligation on them to pay a dividend to the State and for some of them that would not be appropriate.</p><p>I picked out in particular the Irish Greyhound Board.  For example, Abargrove seems to be a company within a company.  It is the catering section in Limerick Stadium and it is a separate company to the stadium itself.  Is that audited separately? </p></speech>

There are two other subsidiaries.  One is Shelbourne Park and while I cannot remember the name of the other, it is the other eight stadia.  Together with Bord na gCon, they form a group, so the group audit pulls it all together, if one likes.  There may be the appearance that things are losing money, but they are actually being cross-subsidised by other parts of the organisation.</p></speech>

They would be what are called commercial State bodies and I do not generally audit commercial State bodies.  What I would be auditing is generally what are called the State agencies or non-commercial State bodies.  Some of them are legally organised as companies but, effectively, they are heavily dependent on Exchequer funding, and that is why they fall to my remit.</p></speech>

The public purse, the taxpayer and the public service benefit from this.  For example, the ESB has paid more than &euro;258 million in one year and Bord na M&oacute;na, despite having gone through a very difficult time, is paying &euro;10 million.  While this has reduced in recent years, hopefully, that will go back up again.  It shows we have a number of very successful semi-State companies that have served the State, the taxpayer and the industrial development of the country very well.  It is proposed to publish that correspondence on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 215B from Ms Rachel Downes, CEO of Caranua, dated 24 November 2020, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the arrangements for winding down Caranua.  We considered this at our meeting on 25 November and agreed to postpone our engagement with Caranua to 17 December.  We have also written to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and the Secretary General of the Department of Education to raise our concerns around the wind-down.  A number of us are concerned about the wind-down and the fact there are still outstanding applications for compensation under that fund.</p></speech>

It would be appropriate if, in advance of that, we wrote to Caranua and advised them that some members of the committee are particularly interested in the provision of supports for survivors following its wind-up.  It would be useful if they were in a position to provide a detailed briefing note on their engagements to date with the Government agencies and the Department in regard to funding for future services and the arrangements that will be in place.  Obviously, it is a matter of concern.  They might indicate what agreements have been in place.  We know that, in previous correspondence, Caranua contradicted correspondence that had been sent to the committee with regard to the level of supports that were available and, in another instance, they said they were not aware of a specific case.  It would be good practice if, in advance of their attendance, the committee asked them to familiarise themselves with the few outstanding issues, and I understand it is only a few outstanding issues, with regard to the processing of concerns about the services that are in place.  We are clearly going to be asking questions and it would be useful if we let them know that.</p></speech>

I note in the correspondence reference to the passage of the residential institutions statutory fund (distribution) Bill.  I am not sure at what stage that is at or when to expect it in the House.  However, I note they say it will not impact on the operational process of Caranua.  Ultimately, our question to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the previous meeting was about the remaining funds for distribution and what happens there.  It is going to form a part of our discussion with them when they are before us.  If they can, through the clerk, furnish as much information as possible in advance of that, it would assist in our process of questioning.</p></speech>

We can write to them if that is the specific issue we want to address, and also in regard to our concerns on dealing satisfactorily with any valid applications for funding and supports that are required.  It is important that survivors be looked after.  Is it agreed to publish that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  First is No. 211C from an individual, dated 21 November 2020, raising further questions about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  At our meeting on 30 September, we agreed to request the correspondent&rsquo;s consent to forward a number of items to SBCI to respond to the matters raised.  I propose to request the correspondent&rsquo;s consent to send this additional information to SBCI so that it can also be addressed.  We need to point out to SBCI that we have not received a reply to our previous correspondence, which would have gone out very shortly after that meeting on 30 September.  We will seek an immediate reply.  Deputy MacSharry had an interest in this issue.</p></speech>

I have an issue with the corporation.  This was established for SMEs.  In this instance, it certainly highlights a failing in the rules because I do not think it captures the spirit of where we were coming from with the SBCI, in that a company that has a substantial foreign holding is given &euro;20 million to pay off a loan from a foreign bank.</p><p>In pursuing this matter previously, I raised it before this committee and I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has also looked into the matter. I know that in responses to parliamentary questions, the view taken, and these are my words paraphrasing it, was that an Irish company had its lunch eaten by another company, but the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, operated within the rules.  It may well have operated within the rules, but it did not capture the spirit of the intentions under which it was established.  A sum of &euro;20 million to a company that was operating abroad, which I am sure is a very reputable company, and good luck to it, certainly was not where we were coming from.  It is something that we should look into, if only to identify the fact that the terms of reference or the regulations and guidelines that underpin the establishment of the SBCI were flawed to the extent that the money did not go to where we intended it to go, which was to the SMEs.</p></speech>

My memory of it is that 50% of it is publicly funded and 50% is funded by the private sector.  The Deputy is correct to state that the funding was intended for SMEs, and Irish SMEs, but this correspondence appears to indicate that a substantial part of it did not end up there.</p></speech>

Essentially, it states that a huge amount of money that we were told was going to be directed to SMEs, which form a very important part of our economy, was actually used to bolster the balance sheet, repay a loan, pay dividends to shareholders and provide significant liquidity to a foreign-based parent company.  According to the correspondence, only 7% of what was loaned to BIFSL, essentially by the Irish taxpayer, was deployed into the Irish SME market.  That is very substantial and I agree with the proposal that has been made.  However, I think it would also be prudent for the committee to ask the Department of Finance for its response in respect of all of this.  At the end of the day we are dealing with Irish taxpayers' money, so it would be appropriate to ask the Department of Finance for comment on this matter.  I would also like to put on the record that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is potentially a very important body, has not responded to this committee on the issue as yet, and that is not acceptable practice.  I agree that we should write to the corporation again.</p></speech>

The whole idea with this fund, was that where commercial banks were not an option for some SMEs, this would ensure that we had a strong indigenous base in that small to medium sector, which is incredibly important and one of the bigger employers, if it is looked at collectively.  This is an extremely important fund and it is not exclusively made up of public money, but there is a large portion of it that is made up of public money.  The correspondent has certainly convinced me of his own bona fides in terms of the research that he has done, and this is exactly the kind of thing that is very useful when it is brought to our attention.  In addition, is there a particular Department to which the SBCI responds, and if so, we should write to that Department also.  I would also like to hear from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the interaction that his office has with the SBCI on this matter, and specifically whether the interaction is through the Department or is direct with the corporation.</p></speech>

It is under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  One of the significant developments in the past year is that the corporation has carried out a strategic review of its operations and it has published the results of that review, which are available.  This year, 2020, is the first year going forward from that review, so the corporation is making some changes in its mode of operation and there has been some paying down of the borrowing, which I believe was borrowing from Germany, so some of that has been repaid.  It is involved not just in the first line of activity, which is lending to SMEs who were having difficulty in accessing the market, but also in providing funding in the context of Brexit.  That is being funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There has been quite a shift in the organisation and it is perhaps timely for the committee to invite it to attend a meeting.  We have certainly dealt with this correspondent previously and we have followed up on matters that he has brought to our attention in the course of each audit.</p></speech>

We can include it on the list when we are moving the next item on the agenda, which is the work programme.</p> <p>  That concludes the correspondence, and we now move on to the work programme for the months ahead.  Some of our upcoming engagements are displayed on the screens.  Tomorrow we will be launching our report on NAMA's 2019 financial statement and also the Report No. 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which concerns Project Nantes.</p> <p>  On 9 and 10 December, we will have further engagement over two days with the Department of Justice and the Prison Service.  This doubles the time that we have to examine the accounts, and we have already agreed going forward that we will try and use that approach rather than trying to cram all the work into the one day.  We then have one public engagement left before the end of the year, which takes place on 17 December, when Caranua, which has been discussed today, will appear before the committee.</p> <p>  There are a number of engagements provisionally scheduled for January 2021, which the members can see listed before them.  We will ask that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is included in that.  On 14 January, it is proposed that we examine the Office of Government Procurement 2019 appropriation account, and on 20 and 21 January, it is proposed that we examine the HSE's 2019 financial statement, with a focus on the awarding of Government grants to agencies, which are referred to as section 38 and 39 agencies, which Deputy Burke, who is now absent, has raised a number of times, and about which a number of members are concerned.  We will also look at agency costs and value for money.  On the second day, we will focus on the integrated financial management and procurement system and capital expenditure.  On Thursday, 28 January, it is proposed that we examine the 2019 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  </p> <p>  There are also a number of other engagements suggested for February 2021.  On 3 and 4 February, it is proposed that we examine the 2019 appropriation account for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and focus on chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the remediation of landfill sites and the expenditure related to the national broadband plan.  On 11 February, it is proposed that we examine the National Shared Services Office, in particular, chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the implementation of financial management of shared services.</p> <p>  Are members happy with the work programme as it stands?  Yes.  There are have also been a few additions to the programme.  I think RT&Eacute; has been added to the list of organisations engaging with the committee as part of the draft work programme.  If it has not been added to the list, I propose that we add it to the programme.</p> <p>  For the benefit of Deputy Carthy who was temporarily absent, we are discussing the draft work programme, and he will find a list of proposed engagements on the screen in front of him.  One of the Departments we are considering engaging with is the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and the Media, and I have suggested that we add RT&Eacute; to the list of engagements for the new year.</p></speech>

An important body that could be useful also, and there is not necessarily an urgency about it, is Bord Bia.  In a post-Brexit world, Bord Bia could be very important.

It was running from 1971 until the middle of the 1990s.  Effectively, it was guaranteeing credit.  There were claims paid out under the guarantee and then there was a process of reclaiming those.

I believe the figure is about &euro;22 million that has not been recovered and it is very unlikely at this stage to be recovered so there is no point in maintaining the account but it is still there and therefore we have to audit it every year.</p></speech>

Could he give a brief explainer on the local loans fund and the heritage fund, because depending on his answer it might be of interest to us to put them on the work programme.  Others are the sundry moneys deposit account and the State property miscellaneous deposits account.  I was unsure about the basis of NSCDA Operations Limited.  A final one is the hepatitis C accounts.  I can see that a number of those are still in operation.  Are they still operational accounts?</p></speech>

All of them are operational accounts, some bigger and some smaller than others.  I think I did a note a couple of years ago for the previous committee on some of these accounts.  It was brief explainers of what they are.  Of the ones the Deputy has mentioned, the sundry moneys is probably the biggest one.  That is just a holding account.  When moneys are collected it is likely that they will go to the Exchequer but once they go into the Exchequer they cannot be taken out unless there is power in law to take them out.  There is a question mark over whether some moneys are properly receivable into the Exchequer so they are held in sundry moneys.</p></speech>

It was for the provision of loans to local authorities and for the recovery of those.  The heritage fund is under whatever it is called now - the Department responsible for heritage.  Again, that is a small fund.  I would have to refresh my memory on the scale of operation of it but it is a grant giver.  </p> <p>  NSCDA is a subsidiary of Sport Ireland.  It operates some of the facilities in Abbotstown.  Aspects of it are run on a commercial or quasi-commercial basis.  If the committee wanted to examine those, it could bring in Sport Ireland and NSCDA and they could be examined together.</p> <p>  On the hepatitis C accounts, I did a chapter a couple of years ago in respect of that.  I can get the Deputy a copy of it.  It explains the structure.  They are very complicated accounts in the way they operate.  What I tried to do with the chapter was to give an overview of it but there are persons affected by the hepatitis C scandal who are still in receipt of funds in certain ways.  Obviously, it is not operating on anything like the scale it did a number of years back.  One of the things that was significant when I was doing the chapter was a scheme to actually cure hepatitis C and there does seem to have been a lot of success with that.</p></speech>

It very rarely happens but sometimes it does and that becomes State property.  That is an account to receive that, pending any reclaim of it.  Moneys are held there for a period but if, say, somebody is entitled to the proceeds of an estate or something, he or she can reclaim it from that account and after a period, if a tranche of money has not been reclaimed, it is then forfeited to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

My colleague Deputy Doherty mentioned issues concerning beneficial ownership to former Minister of State Michael D'Arcy.  I welcome the fact that there have been amendments since then.  I have a question on the submission of the annual return.  Could the Minister of State clarify whether that information will be publicly available?</p> <p>  On beneficial ownership, where someone has a 25% shareholding but decides to split it in two, using a shell company and another mechanism, would we know the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner rather than the intermediaries posing as beneficial owners?  Would that information also be publicly available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020120200002#A00900"><p>As the Deputy rightly pointed out, this legislation, bearing in mind its original intention, has improved significantly in respect of identifying the identities of investors.  If they are Irish, they will have to produce their PPS number, or the equivalent across the EU.  Apart from that, a person will have to produce a passport.  The Deputy has indicated that a company may sometimes have an investment in the investment limited partnership or in a fund under that partnership.  Her question was on establishing the identity of the shareholders behind the company.  There are two tests.  If one owns over 25%, one is identified as a person involved, but if one owns less than 25% but has a controlling interest in the company, perhaps through other people, one is also deemed a person whose identity must be disclosed.  The legislative phrasing is in line with the anti-money laundering legislation that is already in place.</p> <p>  If a person has a 25% shareholding, the owners of the remaining 75% control the company.  A person with only 15% or 20% does not usually have a controlling interest but someone with a shareholding of less than 25% might have a controlling interest if he or she is working in league with other shareholders who also have shareholdings of less than 25%.  However, only one person &ndash; we are talking about a person, not a company &ndash; can be the beneficial owner.</p> <p>  The important point is that it is up to the general partner in the investment limited partnership to satisfy himself or herself that he or she has all the documentation to get Central Bank approval.  If that person does not do his or her job properly, he will lose the benefit of limited partnership and all the limited liability.  He or she would then be open personally and have no protection under the legislation.  The onus is really on the general partner to satisfy himself or herself regarding everybody who invests in the fund.  If the general partner does not do his or her job, he or she will be liable to direct action by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Part 5 of the Bill amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to include the register of beneficial ownership of investment limited partnerships.  There is an amendment in this legislation regarding social welfare which will ensure that PPS numbers can be allocated and that persons can be identified by name.  This will enable the public to ascertain certain information about who the beneficial owners are, but not their detailed financial information.</p></speech>

It will not be in the annual return.  To get approval for a fund, the general partner has to lodge this information, and any amendment thereto thereafter, with the Central Bank.  There is a register of beneficial ownership, which is separate from the annual return.  That is where the names of all beneficial owners of the fund is made known.  This can be accessed through the Central Bank.  It is like a planning register.  One can find out the name of those involved.  That is a publicly available document.</p></speech>

Could two or more entities separate their visible contacts while still maintaining a beneficial interest in the operation and control of the overall policy thereof?  In other words, could two or three venture capital companies be involved under separate headings so that, to the casual observer, each could be seen as an individual although they were all brought together by the same controlling company?  This would give them undue influence.  Rather than being separate entities, they would represent a single entity disguised as a multitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020120200002#B01000"><p>If an individual invests, it is clear who he or she is.  If a company invests, one will know who the shareholders are.  The beneficial ownership threshold is clearly 25% so if there are three investors in a company which holds more than 25% of shares in a fund, the three beneficial owners have to be made known.  It is not the case that a company must only declare one beneficial owner.  Once any investment company owns more than 25% of shares or has a controlling interest in the fund, each and every one of its shareholders must be declared.  What is also important about this legislation is that the beneficial owners - and there may be multiple beneficial owners - have to produce their PPS numbers.  If they do not have one, they must produce their passport.  No shell company can be an investor without the ultimate beneficial owner's identity being listed on the Central Bank's register of beneficial owners.  If a person is a shareholder, his or her passport must be produced before the company and the fund can get the approval of the Central Bank.  We will have the details of these individuals regardless of where they are in the world.  They may be in America, Canada, Malaysia or anywhere else but, if they do not have an Irish PPS number, we will get a copy of their passports.  There will be multiple beneficial owners.  That is the point.</p></speech>

Is he satisfied that the necessary alarms are in place should there be a need to invoke other powers such as the Central Bank?  In the past, we have sometimes had occasion to comment unfavourably on the lack of alacrity with which some of the supervisory agencies were activated.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that sufficient provision has now been made to ensure that the State and the consumers, both nationally and internationally, are protected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020120200002#B01400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On that issue, the Central Bank is the regulator of these funds.  It is seen internationally as a very strong regulator.  The Deputy points to the history in this area.  There has been a strong response to that history with regard to improvements in how the Central Bank deals with this area and the level of supervision it provides.</p><p>The usual complaint I get is that it is overly bureaucratic, whether in respect of banks or credit unions or funds such as those addressed by the Bill.  I do not accept that complaint because it is an asset for Ireland that we can state internationally that we have good, strong regulation.  If a business comes to Ireland, it will have the benefit of one of the best regulators in Europe.  We are particularly strong in terms of regulation.</p><p> On the issue of investors, this is a is very important point.  The essence of the Bill relates to investment limited partnerships.  As is the case when investing in any shares, if a company or a person invests &euro;100,000, they can lose their money if the product does not work or the company does not succeed but, no matter what happens, their losses are always limited to what they invest.  When investing in a financial product, one takes one's chances.  However, there is absolute regulation  The person who manages the fund has no limited liability and, as such, is fully on the hook personally if they do not do their job properly.  If a company or a fund happens to run into a problem, the individual investor cannot be called on to contribute any more than he or she contributed on day one because his or her liability is limited to his or her original investment.  All one can lose is the money one puts in, in the same way that in every walk of life and in every investment one makes there is no possibility of having to contribute further.  Even if there is a loss, the investor's liability is completely limited to the original investment.  There cannot be any greater loss.  As I stated, we have strong regulation.</p><p> I thank members for their contributions.  It is good that there is broad support for this essential Bill which will help to modernise investment limited partnerships offering in Ireland and will make changes to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle Act 2015.  The amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will help to ensure that the Central Bank can operate as the beneficial owner register which we already discussed.  I believe the changes will help to further support Ireland's offering as a top-tier global location choice for financial services.  As I mentioned at the outset, the legislation is consistent with the Ireland for finance strategy and is timed well to take advantage of the capital markets union agenda and to promote the establishment of private equity and venture capital vehicle funds in Ireland.  Every new product like this on the market will lead to additional jobs in Ireland.  People will work in this sector that was not available for Ireland before this legislation.  Not only will it create additional investment, it will also create additional employment and additional taxation for the State.  I thank members for their assistance.</p></speech>

On the remarks of the Minister of State, I did not intend to raise this matter but he mentioned it.  The Central Bank over-regulates credit unions.  It should not be the regulator of credit unions.  It should not be the agency to operate protections for consumers.  That really has to be considered and judged.</p> <p>  As far as regulation is concerned, I think the vulture funds have got away with murder.  They have got away with far too much and have not been regulated as they ought to have been.  It is as if they are able to bob and weave around the regulations and legislation we put in place.  They get away with it and they literally torture people.  I wish to put on record that, as Deputy Durkan has often mentioned, people, including public representatives, cannot contact the vulture funds.  They do not return one's phone calls.  Even when one is making an offer to sort something out on behalf of a constituent, their response is extremely poor.  They are arrogant beyond belief and the language they use in confronting people about the issues of the loans and so on is just horrific.</p> <p>  The last thing I will say about the Central Bank, with which we are arranging a meeting, is that if it had regulated properly at the time that Jonathan Sugarman made his complaint regarding a bank, we might not have ended up in the deep trouble we were in during the ensuing financial collapse. </p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and his officials.</p></speech>

I apologise to colleagues for not being available earlier today, as the committee had requested.  I was attending a meeting of EU health Ministers, an annual meeting.  It was quite long, but it included matters such as a briefing on Covie-19 vaccines so, regrettably, I could not make it to a meeting this morning.  I thank the committee for accommodating this time today.</p><p>The additional funding I am seeking for 2020 is &euro;514.5 million.  In June, the Oireachtas approved an additional &euro;2 billion to meet the costs of the health service&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, bringing the new adjusted total for the health Vote to &euro;19.9 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates request for Vote 38 relates primarily to the costs associated with Government decisions on Covid made subsequent to the Revised Estimates in June.  This includes additional funding for measures, including personal protective equipment, PPE, testing and tracing, &euro;200 million for this part of the winter plan, escalation of no-deal Brexit measures, one-off funding to support disability services, one-off funding to support palliative care providers and the costs associated with the Covid-19 vaccination programme.</p><p>In June, I said that the additional approved funding of &euro;2 billion would not represent the totality of the cost of Covid-19 for this year and that further funding would be required.  This is that request.  The health Vote has required Supplementary Estimates each year for the past number of years, and the HSE worked very hard last year to bring down the additional funding requirements.  I am committed to working with the HSE and the Department to continue to strengthen the financial management.</p><p>On a side note, I draw members&rsquo; attention to the recently published Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report, &ldquo;How does Irish Healthcare Expenditure compare internationally?&rdquo;.  I am sure colleagues have seen it.  It compares healthcare expenditure in Ireland to that of other OECD countries.  It is the first report of its type that does this accurately.  It is something I have sought previously, as have health committees in the past.  There has been an ongoing perception that Ireland spends more than other countries on healthcare.  The ESRI report shows that when measured <i>per capita</i>and on a like-for-like basis Ireland&rsquo;s total expenditure on healthcare ranks ninth among the EU 15 and it drops to tenth when one considers just the public aspects of healthcare expenditure.  It is a topic I would like to engage on with the committee on another day, if the committee is interested.  Between us, we could re-frame the conversation about healthcare expenditure in Ireland with a view from me and many of my colleagues that if we are not as high up the tables, there is room for us to continue pushing.</p><p>The health service has responded in an unprecedented fashion to Covid-19 and has incurred substantial additional costs in doing so.  The single most significant medium-term cost is PPE.  Included in June&rsquo;s Revised Estimates for the Covid-19 allocation of &euro;1.997 billion was &euro;253 million for PPE.  The HSE has forecast PPE expenditure of &euro;920 million to the end of this year, which includes planned stock levels at year end of approximately 12-years supply in line with clinical management guidelines.  This leaves a supplementary request of &euro;667 million compared to the original allocation.</p><p>The June Revised Estimates approved &euro;208 million for testing and contact tracing.  This initial allocation was to fund testing and contact tracing until 31 August.  Included in the Supplementary Estimates today is a request for &euro;68 million, which is required to fund testing and contact tracing to the end of the year.  Up to the end of November, almost 2 million tests had been carried out.</p><p>A significant element of the request relates to the HSE winter plan.  The Government committed &euro;600 million in total to deal with winter pressures and the additional pressures presented by the pandemic.  This includes &euro;600 million for 2020, which is in today&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimates, and &euro;400 million for 2021, which essentially is January, February, March and April.  The winter plan is increasing the capacity of the health service and ensuring continuity of service by providing additional commute and community resources, staff and beds, as well as funding initiatives including the flu vaccination programme and many other items.  Budget 2021 funds the permanent retention of many of these measures, which is very exciting.</p><p>Taken with the June Revised Estimates, the Supplementary Estimates today bring the total net cost of Covid-19 supports provided to the health service to over &euro;2.5 billion and total health expenditure in 2020 to just over &euro;20.4 billion.  While the financial impact is very significant, the value of this investment in protecting our citizens in the face of the global pandemic is unquantifiable and, I would argue, priceless.  I seek the select committee&rsquo;s approval of the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;514.5 million for Vote 38.</p></speech>

Page 5 of the briefing document refers to 15.6 million doses of vaccines that we could potentially procure.  That is across a range of different pharmaceutical companies and types of vaccines.  It states that the estimated cost would be &euro;117.6 million.  Is that &euro;117.6 million for 15.6 million doses?  We may not draw down 15.6 million doses because we may not need that many.

We have 2.2 million doses from Janssen, 3.3 million from Sanofi and 2.3 million doses from Pfizer.  From Moderna we have 875,000 doses.  The sixth vaccine is from CureVac.  For the first five companies, we are signed up to the advance purchase agreement and those are the initial doses Ireland will get from them.  CureVac is the sixth and we are not required to enter into the details of that just yet.</p></speech>

It is unlikely that we will have to purchase all of them.  Will we have to pay for them anyway because they are advance purchases?

That is fine.  We obviously do not know which vaccine will come first.  We see what is happening in Britain and all the different vaccines that are coming on board are very encouraging.  Aside from the procurement costs, I imagine that there will be storage, distribution and administration costs as well.  Are those factored in?  Have we an estimation of what those costs will be?</p></speech>

The Deputy will remember from the budget debate that there is a pot of several hundred million euro as a provision against Covid measures and such things would be pulled from there.  The distribution should be, relatively, cheaper than the vaccines themselves.  The task force is currently working with the various State agencies on exactly how it would work.  The different vaccines will have different distribution mechanisms.  For example, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at -70&deg;C most of the time, although the temperature can be higher for two or three days before it is used.  The doses must be taken 14 days apart and that has to be quite tightly matched, whereas somebody-----</p></speech>

Different types of vaccines will have different storage requirements and could involve different costs but we have to plan for that.  The expert group will be looking at all of those things.  That figure of &euro;117 million, and whatever storage, distribution or administration costs there will be, is still quite small in the context of the overall cost of Covid.  Covid has cost us tens of billions of euro economically and that is leaving aside the social costs, including the people who have lost their lives, and so on.  Is it the Minister's plan, regardless of which Covid vaccine comes first, that it would be rolled out for free?</p></speech>

I was talking to the public health experts about this today in the context of the statement from the UK yesterday.  It is not necessarily the case that whichever vaccine comes on market first will simply be the one that everybody gets.  My understanding is that different vaccines may be more suitable for different people or age groups.  When we get the validation data from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, which will provisionally sit on 29 December to make a decision on the Pfizer vaccine, at that point or before then the EMA-----</p></speech>

Is there a need for additional supports beyond GPs and pharmacies?  Would we have pop-up centres to support GPs, for example?  GPs have a very difficult job and there is a shortage of GPs in some parts of the country.  Are we looking at additional supports to support and add value to the work GPs and pharmacies will do to make sure a vaccine is administered as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

I will be at the top of the queue after all those who are at risk and who should be prioritised.  I certainly will be taking it myself.  There is a need for a public education programme but it must be rolled out by experts, scientists, doctors and nurses because that is who people will listen to.  They may listen to politicians but they will listen to public health experts and those who will know about vaccines.  A number of people, including Professor Karina Butler and many others, have done a first-class job of explaining the importance of vaccines, their history and their safety.  That will be hugely important and I hope that will be part of the plan.</p></speech>

To reiterate, while the EMA is moving faster than normal in making its decisions on the Covid vaccines, it is applying exactly the same quality control.  The only reason it is able to move faster is because it has set up special teams, for obvious reasons, because this is so important.</p></speech>

I raise these questions in the context of subhead J2 and the &euro;200 million that was allocated to fund the winter plan.  I had this conversation with the head of the HSE recently.  Outpatient wait times are now out of control, if we are to be honest.  At the end of October 2015, there 396,000 people waiting to see a consultant.  At the end of October this year, that figure was 612,000.  More worryingly, the number of patients waiting 18 months or longer has gone from 13,353 to 153,000.  Much of this predates Covid.  Obviously, Covid has complicated the problem and added to it but the vast majority of those increases occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.  I will not go through all the increases but they have been incremental every year.  In the context of the additional money the Minister says has been spent on nurses, doctors and beds, does the HSE have a plan?  Does it have a target to reduce outpatient and inpatient wait times?  For example, would it hope that by the end of 2021, outpatient wait times will be reduced by 5%, 10% or 20%?</p></speech>

The situation is probably understated in the figures because referrals have also dropped during Covid.  The numbers relating to unmet or undiagnosed demand are probably higher in reality.  What we are doing at the moment with the HSE is going through exactly that.  We have supplied a very large amount of money for the permanent capacity in the healthcare system, at a community level and at an acute level.</p><p>In addition, we have a large access-to-care fund of about &euro;350 million.</p></speech>

I know all that.  That was well dealt with by the head of the HSE and by the Minister in his budget speech.  I asked if we have a target.</p></speech>

However, despite that, the wait times are going in the wrong direction.

I want to reach the point the Deputy is talking about.  There is much talk about waiting lists and the number of people waiting.  The Deputy's question is a much more important question: what are the waiting times?  If 1 million people are waiting no more than a week, that is fine.  The problem is that people are waiting too long.  As a first step, we will look at the number of people waiting.  I then want to move on quickly to answering the Deputy's question on the amount of time people are waiting which ultimately is much more important.</p></speech>

When we talk about waiting times, it is hundreds of thousands of people.  These are real people with real lived experiences.  One is Elin who has Down's syndrome and suffers from arthritis.  She is non-verbal and her parents have told me she is in constant pain.  She has been waiting for two years for an MRI scan.  She had an appointment in November; it was cancelled.  She was told that the next appointment date is July 2024.  I cannot figure that out.  She is on drugs to dull her pain.  Her GP has advised that has severe consequences for her immune system.</p> <p>  A second example is Sophie Redmond who was outside Leinster House this week.  She is an 11-year old child who was diagnosed with scoliosis in 2017.  Her spine is twisting into her lungs.  She has been waiting nine months for surgery.  The waiting times and the number of children who have been waiting more than 12 months for scoliosis are truly shocking, despite a commitment by the previous Minister for Health.</p> <p>  If we do not hire the specialists, consultants and all the support staff, we will not reduce those waiting times.  Earlier this year, the Minister and I attended the conference of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  I imagine he also engages with the IMO.  They have told me that unless he deals with the two-tier pay issue, we will be unable to hire the consultants we need.  Elin, Sophie and all the other children and adults who are waiting for treatment will need to continue to wait for treatment.  I ask the Minister to speak to the long waiting times.  How can we reduce those waiting times if the HSE cannot recruit the staff that are needed?  If the staff needed are not recruited, we will not get there.</p> <p>  I have raised Be on Call for Ireland with the Minister several times.  I got the most recent figures from the HSE today.  A total of 1,470 people who came home or who applied through Be on Call for Ireland are still job ready.  Half of them are in a pool and still need to go through the final interview process.  The other half have completed all of that and are ready to be hired and have not been hired.  Why is that the case?  I cannot explain how 1,470 people who want to work in our health service despite all the promises and commitments the Minister has made.  In the budget the Government promised to hire 15,000 or 16,000 additional staff and yet these people are ready to be hired.  What is the problem?  I ask the Minister to explain that.  I ask him to deal with the issue of the consultant contracts.</p></speech>

When I was appointed one of the first places I went was to Crumlin where I met the scoliosis team.  This covers the situation for both Sophie and Elin.  The hospital at Crumlin needs another MRI machine and the staff to operate it.  The waiting list at Crumlin for urgent MRI scans under general anaesthetic for children is four years.  For non-urgent scans I believe it is seven years.  That basically means we have no such service.  I am working to put in place as quickly as I can temporary measures to ensure we can carry out paediatric MRI scans under general anaesthetic, which is a rather specialised thing.  I have spoken to the team in Crumlin about exactly what is needed because nobody could stand over the present situation.  It is just not fair.  We are failing these children and failing their parents.  It is just wrong.</p> <p>  Children with scoliosis are waiting for far too long.  Progress has been made and another consultant has been hired.  I will meet representatives of the scoliosis network soon.  I have been in contact with some of the advocates there.  I assure the Deputy that it is a priority for me as it is for us all and was in the last health committee.  What is going on is indefensible and we need to move on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if part of hiring those consultants is sorting out new entrant pay inequality for the post-2012 consultants.  Yes, it is.  I spoke very strongly in support of it in opposition.  I feel just as strongly or even more strongly about it now in my current role.  I have every intention to ask Government to solve that as quickly as possible.  It is urgent and important for the very reasons the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I raised this and pushed it as soon as I was appointed to the office.  Along with Deputy Cullinane I addressed the conference and recommitted publicly to them.  It is essential.  It needs to be done very quickly.  It is an all-of-Government decision because other groups are looking at this in the context of upcoming public sector pay talks.  My intention is to move it as quickly as possible and seek Government approval to reverse it.</p></speech>

I know how the health system works.  Every year we all strive to achieve particular targets and invariably fall slightly short.  Given that other negotiations are taking place which may or may not have knock-on effects - some in the health service say they will not have a knock-on effect - can he give us even an educated guess as to what "as quickly as possible" might mean?</p></speech>

I cannot speak for an all-of-Government decision.  If it were solely up to me, I would have unilaterally reversed it in full in July.  That is when I would have done it.  That is the priority I think it has.</p></speech>

I would have done it in the first week I was appointed.  I looked into it immediately.  It is an all-of-Government decision.  Because there are wider pay considerations with upcoming pay talks, it was not possible at the time to do it.  However, I consider it to be a very high priority.  We are looking to do several good things as soon as possible.</p><p>By as soon as possible, I do not mean in a year or two, I mean as imminently as possible.  The first is to move the public health doctors onto consultant contracts.  They would be to the existing A contracts.  The second is to create the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  The detail of that must be done with the representative body, as it has to be done by agreement, but there is provision in next year&rsquo;s budget for full-year Sl&aacute;intecare contracts.  The third, not necessarily in that sequence, is the new entry pay and equality issue.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to different vaccines for different people.  I realise that the Government has had to indemnify the producers in the usual way.  I accept all that.  Is the Minister aware of any system whereby people may be tested before vaccination for a potential reaction or side effects?</p></speech>

It would be part of the technical information that would be coming from the EMA post its decision, whichever way it goes, on the various vaccines.</p></speech>

There should not be glitches appearing mid-stream giving rise to questions being asked about why this happened.  I trust that is all being provided for.</p> <p>  Does the Minister believe that the provisions in respect of the winter plan remain sufficient, given the challenges that exist and all the other issues referred to by Deputy Cullinane?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#D00500"><p>I will speak about both the winter plan and next year's budget.  The winter plan is a big plan worth &euro;600 million, which makes it approximately 20 times bigger than previous winter plans.  The budget for next year is the biggest funding package, but it is also the biggest set of targets in terms of new beds, new hires, community home care, etc.  What we have done with the money is worked with the HSE to put a package together that we believe is right at the edge of what is achievable.  The question was less around what we could do with this much money, it was more how far we think we could go for the winter and through next year.  For example, the question on critical care beds was not how many of them we could have for this much money, it was what is the total number of additional beds we think we can get into the system next year and we will fund that.  The flip side of that is because we are pushing on every single lever, or certainly many of them, in terms of beds, acute beds, community beds, eHealth, new drugs and hiring, inevitably, they are all stretch targets and there may be some of them that will be hard to hit.  Even if we had more money, the view is that it would not really be possible to deliver more because there are only so many people one can hire at any one time.  There are only so many beds one can build at any one time.  We feel we have pushed to the edge of what is possible.</p></speech>

Has any thought been given to non-binding temporary appointments that could be carried forward to the future and approved or not, as the case may be?  Can that be done in order to alleviate the pressure at this time?</p></speech>

The Irish Hospital Consultants Association came out in the past day or two and said there were 728 unfilled consultant posts.  That is correct, in that there are not permanent full-time positions in those posts.</p></speech>

There are fixed-term contracts.  For example, of the 3,446 posts that are currently filled, 2,680 are permanent, 520 are fixed-term contracts and 246 are specified-purpose contracts.  There are actual vacant posts and then there are posts which are filled by temporary contracts or agency staff.  What I want, and what I think we all want, is full-time people in those posts.</p></speech>

The Deputy can be sure that on an ongoing basis there are other posts that could have temporary people in them.</p></speech>

For example, agency nursing staff are being used right across the system.  I would like a HSE where we never need agency staff or perhaps if there is a surge somewhere that one could bring in agency staff.  What I want is safe staffing levels for nursing and midwifery so that the reliance on agency staff is reduced.</p></speech>

I will move on.  Could I ask the Minister the extent to which Sl&aacute;intecare has bedded into the system, albeit in the face of considerable other challenges?  Has adequate, sufficient or anticipated progress been made in incorporating into the health service the terms of the Sl&aacute;intecare report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#D01900"><p>No.  I do not think so.  If we go back to when the report was published and when the implementation plan was published &ndash; I do not have the latter in front of me &ndash; if we were to pull that out and look at the Gantt charts and what was meant to happen by when, I imagine we would find that Sl&aacute;intecare is behind in an awful lot of areas.  If there is any silver lining within the health service from Covid, it is that a lot of Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives and thinking, in particular around innovation, community-based care and one of the most important areas to me, which is linking up the care pathway for patients and designing it all around the patient, is happening at a level it has not happened before.  For example, I was in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital the other day, with the emergency medicine team, and by following through on the Sl&aacute;intecare principles and by providing the funding in the winter plan, there was nobody on a trolley.  The people who were in the emergency department were in their own rooms.  The emergency medicine consultants said to me that they had not seen that in many years.  One of them said he had just given up on there ever being a solution.  What is interesting is that people are still coming to the emergency department.  Admissions are still at 90% of last year, and people are still being admitted to hospital.  Admissions are still at approximately 90% of the figure for last year, but the number of people waiting on trolleys is at approximately 30% of the figure for last year, and it is because of the Sl&aacute;intecare philosophy on patient flow.  One of the things we have done is put funding in the winter plan into home care, which means the delayed transfers of care happen.  Deputy Durkan was a member of the relevant committee.  The flow is beginning to happen.  We are seeing it.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about elective procedures, which are stockpiled at this stage to a considerable extent.  Was consideration given to referring them under the treatment purchase scheme to the private hospital sector, which has been available?  Some criticism has been made of the fact that it has been underutilised.  To what extent, if at all, has it been utilised?  To what extent can it be utilised in dealing with what will become an interminable backlog?  While some of these issues may not be emergency issues today, they will become emergency issues.  If we wait for everything to become an emergency issue, the whole thing will descend into chaos.</p><p>We should be able to deal with these issues as they arise.  I know the Minister will agree.  What action has been taken to do that and use the treatment purchase facilities, if and when they are available?</p></speech>

The NTPF puts out bids asking, say, who wants to perform 20 hip replacements or 100 cataract operations.  Public and private hospitals can bid if they feel they have spare capacity or they want to ramp things up.  Given the length of the waiting lists, I would like us to be more strategic and ambitious next year, so I am putting together an access to care task force.  There is a pot of &euro;340 million.  I want as much of that as possible to go into the public hospitals, but the private hospitals can be used too, and start to go through the list of more than 700,000 to establish the priority groups.  Rather than putting out bids as we do now, that we might say we have so many thousands waiting on orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat procedures, cataracts, etc. and see if we can get that down.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.</p> <p>  Scoliosis was raised earlier.  For parents with a child awaiting scoliosis procedures, a month is a long time and a year is an awful long time.  In some cases, the wait has gone on far longer, which is interminable and unacceptable.  I ask that the Minister put in place some emergency measures, whether outsourcing to the private sector or something else, to get ahead of that.  </p> <p>  In the area of mental health services, drug detox services are appalling.  I do not blame the Minister for that but I spent recent days trying to access services for people in an emergency situation.  The parents are distraught and unable to get residential services for their teenager or child.  There is no ready access.  To be fair to some of the service providers, they are doing their best but they are totally short of resources, space, and expertise.  Will the Minister urgently call together those involved to help them out and spearhead the attack on the deficiencies that exist, because they are appalling?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan and I are working very closely on this.  We have allocated sizable additional funds next year for exactly what the Deputy has outlined to help the providers and the residential care facilities.  The waiting lists are too long.  Again, during the Covid pandemic, many things were done that had never been done.  People were helped and wrap-around services were provided, but we can do much more.  The Minister of State and I will push that hard.</p></speech>

On my way to the D&aacute;il this morning, I heard several radio station carrying sound bites of the Minister's counterpart in Britain, Matt Hancock, announcing how they had the refrigeration facilities and the capacity to roll out a Pfizer vaccination beginning next week.  A comprehensive plan is being developed here but, on foot of the bold plans in Britain, have plans in Ireland progressed further?  Can the Minister give the committee a timeline or some detail on how the roll-out will happen?  There is a debate whether distribution should be at GP level, where they know their vulnerable patients or whether other State mechanisms should be used, perhaps the Army, or whatever is needed undertake an emergency mass vaccination of the population?</p></speech>

The EMA will authorise the vaccines.  The exact timeline is as follows: on 1 October the EMA started rolling reviews of three of the vaccines, from AstraZenica, Pfizer and Moderna; yesterday, Pfizer and Moderna submitted their marketing authorisation applications to the EMA; and yesterday, the agency announced it was starting a rolling review of the Janssen vaccine.  The EMA has been working hard in the background, has set up special task forces to examine this and the first two companies made their submissions yesterday.  Yesterday, Emer Cooke told us that if the applications are sufficiently robust and complete, and hopefully they are, an EMA opinion for their marketing authorisation within the EU and, therefore, Ireland could be issued within weeks.</p> <p>  Specifically on the Pfizer vaccine, she said the committee for medicinal products for human use planned to conclude its assessment during an extraordinary meeting scheduled for 29 December, at latest.  The same committee plans to conclude its assessment of the Moderna vaccine during an extraordinary general meeting scheduled tentatively for 12 January.  Once we get EMA approval, if we get such approval, as with the UK, we can distribute it in a matter of days.</p> <p>  Special refrigeration is required for the Pfizer vaccine.  That arrived in Ireland last week.  The supply chains and logistics are being put in place now.  This morning, I spoke with Professor Brian MacCraith who is leading the task force.  He is confident that the distribution networks will be in place if and when the EMA authorises the various vaccines.</p></speech>

The Minister&rsquo;s opening statement referred to the cost to the State of PPE.  There were many teething problems early on with ill-fitting gowns and gloves, and masks that were sub-specification or did not work properly.  Has this supply chain changed?  Have we adequate supplies at a quality that meets the needs of our front-line health staff?</p></speech>

The Supplementary Estimates for which I seek the committee&rsquo;s approval today include a substantial amount for PPE for this year.</p> <p>  To give a sense of scale, the HSE normally spends &euro;15 million on PPE annually; this year it will be close to &euro;1 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates contains almost &euro;700 million just for PPE.  They put in place very comprehensive systems.  I get a weekly report on PPE.  The reports I have received to date are that the various supply chains are working well and the quality control issues have been dealt with.  We are also providing PPE to the nursing homes.</p></speech>

It is not his responsibility but there is optional PCR testing at point of departure at our airports.  For some, it could cost &euro;100 on top of their air ticket to fly.  It is a transport issue but if it gives rise to increased Covid cases it will become the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Should testing at airports be compulsory so that we know that people coming in and out of Ireland are Covid-free and not adding to risk levels here?</p></speech>

I do not think that public money should be used for that; I would prefer to use that to hire doctors and nurses, pay for vaccines and so on.  I think Ireland and Finland are the only orange zone countries in the EU.  For anyone leaving Ireland for another member state, the rule states they must have had a negative PCR test within three days of flying.</p><p>Regardless of what anyone does on the way out, it is the journey back that we are selfishly interested in.  We have a position if one is coming into Ireland from any country in the EU, other than Finland, or from any country within the wider EEA, although Iceland is in the orange zone as well, and most of the world, including the western world, is red.  The unambiguous position on that is that when one comes in, one must restrict one's movements for two weeks.  One can shorten that to five days if on the fifth day one takes a test and that comes back negative.  That is the situation for Ireland and for most of the rest of the EU as well.</p></speech>

Many nurses have been in contact with all of us regarding their annual Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, registration charge.  As a teacher, I had to pay something similar each year to the Teaching Council and one would bemoan it when one would see this letter coming in.  On top of all they do in the workplace, teachers have to pay this charge to be officially recognised.  Nurses feel that the charge this year has come at a time they are giving everything on the front line.  The charge is &euro;100 whereas their counterparts in Scotland have been given a &pound;500 gratuity.  Has the Department been engaging with NMBI to look at that charge for the year it is in terms of potentially waiving it?</p></speech>

It is not something that has been considered.  This issue has largely come up today as part of a good and well-worked campaign.  I was asked about it early this morning for the first time and it is something I am happy to consider.  As it happens, if it is &euro;100 and we have approximately 30,000 nurses, that would be a cost of approximately &euro;3 million.  The Supplementary Estimates we are considering do not include &euro;3 million for that.</p> <p>  Nurses have done an extraordinary job and more so than ever this year.  It has been incredible.  When the rest of us were staying at home, particularly during the first wave, they were going to work every day and keeping people safe.  I would be very well-disposed to doing something to try to recognise that.  I cannot give a commitment because it is additional spending and it requires a Government decision but I will be looking at it closely.</p></speech>

There is a successful scheme operating in the north-west, specifically in Sligo, with backing from the Department.  It is a simple scheme whereby there is a pathway between appointments and follow-up care.  It is shared between hospitals and local private optometrists.  It is proven to be successful and has driven down waiting times, as well as times in transitioning between phases of care.  The previous Government promised and the new programme for Government promises a national roll-out of that.  Has the Minister examined advancing that?  I know there is a huge amount of work on his plate but has he looked at advancing that roll-out to a national scale?</p></speech>

It is another feature of the programme for Government.  There has been a serious beefing up of home care hours in budget 2021.  Just yesterday we had another report released, which again gives us an insight into the major strain nursing homes have been under since March.  Many families with elderly people in the care of nursing homes are saying that if the mechanisms were in place, they would much rather have those loved ones in a home environment where they could be cared for by a care professional.</p> <p>  I have been digging deep into all of this and there is a certain type of person who goes into working in home care in Ireland and the OECD has statistics on this.  Home carers in Ireland are 80% female and they are of a certain demographic.  There is a trend in western European countries but there are also barriers to these people entering this type of work.  Many people who have made representations to me would like to take on this type of work.  One can train quickly and successfully as a care assistant but there are barriers if one is on a low income or in taxation bands that do not make it worthwhile.</p> <p>  In any given community such as the rural community I come from, there could be 14 or 15 people in direct nursing home care and there could be two or three people at community level in receipt of a social welfare payment or in a low-paid job.  If procedures were to be adjusted and if there was a little bit of ingenuity between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance, a lot more people at ground level could be helped to get to the statutory home care phase an awful lot more quickly.  They tell me the barriers mostly relate to taxation bands and finance.  There needs to be an incentive to do it.  Statutory home care is a feature of the programme for Government and I would like to hear if that has been progressed since the Minister took up office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#F01300"><p>This is one of the areas that is exciting and that we can make an awful lot of progress on in the coming years.  When we launched the expert review on nursing homes, one of the leads, who is a consultant geriatrician, was comparing the percentage of people we have in nursing homes in Ireland with the percentage in Finland.  Finland is probably seen as the best example.  I cannot remember the exact figure but it is at a fraction of what we are at.  The goal is to keep people at home.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is taking a lead on this.  We have fully funded the interRAI system for next year.  We are rolling that out straightaway and a number of assessors are being hired.  They will do a full assessment of every person's needs.  Rather than saying one can have five hours or six hours, it will be a bespoke individual assessment.  The programme for Government commitment on increased hours was for 5 million hours over five years.  We have allocated funding in the health budget for next year for all 5 million of those hours next year.  That does not mean we will not do any more in the future.  We are going for this.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is not enough to have the systems and the money.  We have to have the carers and to do that we have to look at caring as a profession and at the kind of supports they need.  The exact matters the Deputy is talking about will be considered by myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the sector.  I am excited about this.  If we get this right, we can revolutionise growing older in this country and have far more people living at home for longer.  Our length of stays in nursing homes and so forth are out of kilter with many other countries.  There is a real opportunity here.</p></speech>

Sometimes one has to let these briefings in one ear and out the other but I was told clearly that there is a significant cohort of people willing to take up employment.  These people might respond to an advertisement online or in the local press that is seeking for care assistants and offering to help them to get trained up but people quickly discover there is a large number of barriers.  Those barriers should be broken down.  For a lot of these people it might have been a choice to be a stay-at-home parent for a number of years.  Perhaps if the rules were changed and if they were allowed to go out during school hours and provide home care within their communities for that four or five hours, be freed up in the evening and not have their income overly taxed, it would be a great incentive to get this growing at grassroots level in an organic way.  I hope those aspects can be considered in parallel with the health aspects because income, taxation and threshold barriers are preventing more people joining.  They cannot recruit people.</p></speech>

The high number of people in nursing homes is a direct result of Government policy, which incentivises it.  At various times, a figure has been put on the number of people who are in nursing homes and who should not be there and who do not need or want to be there.  However, Government policy has made that happen.</p> <p>  There is potential for significant additional employment if we respect older people's desire to stay at home.  However, it is important that it is decent quality work so that people have guaranteed hours.</p><p>It should not just be minimum wage work.  Much of it is currently like that without any kind of job security.  That has to be considered when moving to a new system.  It is essential that the health authorities work with the housing authorities, because there are a small number of examples of supported housing complexes with health services provided.  That is an ideal situation where a person is not able to stay in his or her own three bedroom house, with the upstairs part not being accessible or with the house needing proper maintenance.  There are a few examples of where it has been done really well and we should learn from that.  Housing has to be part of that solution.</p></speech>

A number of us raised the waiving of nurses' registration fees with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il this morning and he categorically ruled it out.  It would be welcome if the Minister tried to change the Taoiseach's mind on that.</p> <p>  There are two concerns about the decision to approve and roll out the vaccine in the UK.  According to Kingston Mills, this has not been tested on children, which is a problem.  It has not been established that the Pfizer vaccine is effective in cutting infectiousness.  It may prevent somebody from getting the virus but it does not mean that the person is not a carrier.  To what extent are those issues being pursued at a European level?  Does the Minister expect that it is likely that approval will be given with caveats about key elements, as has happened in the UK?  I understand that there is a requirement for states to take on liability in the event that anything goes wrong.  That is potentially a blank cheque.  We do not know what is involved.  In normal circumstances, the fact that pharmaceutical companies have to carry the liability for their products is a break that is put on developing new vaccines or medications, which can be good because companies have to be cautious in developing new products to ensure that they do not do harm.  Is the Minister concerned that because of the fact that the significant responsibility of taking on liability by a pharmaceutical company is being waived, there could be issues with a rush to roll out the vaccine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#G00400"><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I had this conversation with the public health team this morning.  They made a few points.  We are going through the European Medicines Agency, EMA, process.  The UK has its own process.  That authorisation comes with advisory notes.  Our public health people are saying that Ireland is signed up to six people.  They are at various stages with the EMA.  It looks like a decision will be made about the Pfizer vaccine first, then the Moderna vaccine.  They are saying that different vaccines may be appropriate for different groups.  Some vaccines may work better for people who are more vulnerable to it and people of different ages.  They are looking to the EMA to provide this advice.  Our experts will look at the UK&rsquo;s advice too, but we will take our lead directly from the EMA.  As the EMA issues that advice, it may well indicate the priority groups and say that it is not looking to vaccinate children in the short term, and so on.  We will take our lead from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the public health teams.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about liability.  The EU has waived liability, so Ireland, as with every other member state, is indemnifying the pharmaceutical companies to get access to the vaccine.  I am not concerned from a safety perspective because the EMA is the regulator and I have been assured that even though the process is quicker because of the nature of Covid, the same standards and bars have been set as for every other medicine that we take.  It will have the same safety standards as everything else that we go into a chemist to buy, whether it is prescribed or not.</p></speech>

There has been some moving around of budgets too.  One relates to capital spending on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We know that there has been an underspend of &euro;166 million.  We had the children&rsquo;s hospital board here to address the delays which have happened for various reasons and the underspend.  I was told that &euro;100 million of that is being ring-fenced and carried over to next year, but another &euro;66 million has been diverted into other expenditure.  Will the Minister tell us where that has gone?</p></speech>

The Estimate before us today does not include any additional spending, so the allocation the Deputy is talking about is for the total budget.  Today&rsquo;s Estimate does not include any capital element.  The Deputy is right.  The site was empty for quite some time because of Covid.  There was underspending.  We have carried as much of it forward as we are allowed to by the accounting rules.  I will get the Deputy a breakdown of where the other money was allocated.</p></speech>

We were talking about Sl&aacute;intecare earlier, and apart from reorienting services, a key element of Sl&aacute;intecare, if not the key element, is removing cost as a barrier to accessing care.  There was an announcement in last year&rsquo;s budget of a number of measures which would improve affordability of care with medical cards, prescription charges and the drugs payment scheme.  Unfortunately, the current Government decided not to implement that in July as had been promised and people expected, and it was delayed until November.  What was the total saving from delaying those measures?</p></speech>

It was delayed because in last year&rsquo;s budget, bringing in those measures was contingent on savings that did not happen because of Covid.  When I came into office, there was no money available to bring those measures in.  Even though it was in last year&rsquo;s budget, I had to go back to Government with a new memo and say that I wanted additional funding to bring those measures in this year.  Not only were there no savings, an additional cost was required for having brought them in.</p></speech>

I will come back to the issue of consultants' contracts.  There are a number of questions around that and I am aware the Minister has spoken about some of them already.  We cannot run the health service unless we have enough consultants.  It is clear there is a major problem.  Whether it is with consultants or nurses, why do we continue with agency staff when it is much cheaper to employ full-time permanent staff?  Why are so many consultants, in particular, doing agency work?  Is it the case that a person is better paid as an agency doctor over and above what he or she would earn on contract?  Are there other advantages compared with being on contract?  </p></speech>

I have stipulated that next year, the hiring will be done along the safe staffing levels that have been agreed.  There is, therefore, now a new system in place, which was brought in for the pilots, where the acuity of the patients in each ward is basically put into a computer and it will tell what the staffing needs are.  That is what we are scaling up to.</p> <p>  The HSE believes, therefore, the levels it has put in for hiring next year are at the edge of what is possible.  If we could, I would replace all agency staff immediately and I believe the HSE would too.  The plan is to get to a point where, certainly for the day to day work, agency staff simply are not needed because one we have the safe staffing levels.</p> <p>  I will get the Deputy a note on the consultants.  Certainly, from all the conversations I have had over the years, the vast majority would prefer to be on permanent contracts.  The agency work suits some, in fairness, but the vast majority want to be on those contracts.  To be honest, they have never really mentioned pay reasons to me.  They have always said they want to be part of a permanent team, whatever their specialty is, and spend the next number of years of their life being part of that team and growing that service.</p> <p>  My understanding is that we need to fix the new entrant pay and equality fast.  We need to put the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts in place fast and hire people into those posts, keep the people we have, offer them permanent contracts and then try to get home some of our good people who are working abroad.</p></speech>

We want to move to public-only work in the public hospitals.  This still all has to be worked out; this is my view.  All new hires should be on the new Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  I imagine as soon as we have it in, everyone on an A contract will move across straight away because it is kind of the same but with more money and supports around it.  Then, there is a good conversation to be had with those on the B contracts to see who wants to move across.  My view and, I believe, that of Deputy Shortall is that we want as many as possible on the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I had not heard that before.</p> <p>  My final question is on that pressing issue on the need to create those public health consultant posts.  It is the only specialty where they are not consultants.  This year, of all years, given everything the public health people have been doing, let us not have a strike.  Is the Minister prepared to upgrade the existing specialists, of whom there are only approximately 60, to give them consultant posts?</p></speech>

Our public health consultants, doctors and public health specialists have been looking for this for decades for all sorts of reasons, for example, for professional recognition, professional standing and the money they earn, which is approximately &euro;111,000 or &euro;113,000 at the moment.  Their consultant colleagues on A contracts are earning tens of thousands more than that and, indeed, the Sl&aacute;intecare contract, when it comes in, will be a significant increase again.  They have worked hard this year.  Never has it been more obvious how important the public health groups are.</p></speech>

Is there going to be a public health consultant contract?  Yes, there is, and the exact mechanism for how that will work must be worked out between the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Department or Government.  That process is under way.  The business case for all of it is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have given a commitment that there will be consultant contracts.

On section 4.3(7), overseas treatment, there was a &euro;74.1 million overseas treatment estimated spend and the current Estimates have a &euro;32 million underspend.  In the section on capital funds, the document states the Department has written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask that funds be carried over to 2021.  Is that also the case for the overseas treatment fund?  It is a bullet point on the overseas treatment surplus of &euro;32 million.  Obviously, there will be a backlog and Brexit presents a number of challenges in that regard.  Is that money now unavailable to us?</p></speech>

Given that there are some shared treatment services across the island, I wonder if there is a separate fund dealing with some of those issues.  I guess the one I am particularly thinking of is the human milk bank in Enniskillen, which is one of the few examples of a shared-island service that really works.  They supply 22 neonatal units across the country.  They organise an amazing band of volunteers.  There is a great deal of volunteer help but it also needs State support.  The service is quite fearful of the impact of Brexit and the need for supports, such as in IT and in distribution.  I wonder if that is something the Department has funding for or has considered.</p></speech>

We have all probably been contacted by constituents who, unfortunately, have been unable to be with their loved ones as they pass away, some due to Covid and some due to whatever conditions they have as normal.  The once-off funding, as outlined, is hugely welcome and is desperately needed.  That is fantastic.  However, I note from the outline given that it is very much geared towards existing specialist palliative care settings.  Is there any funding available, or can that be broadened out, to include additional financial supports to palliative care or end-of-life care in a hospital setting because that is an issue?</p></speech>

The &euro;10 million that we are looking at here was a one-off fund we created for the voluntary sector, &euro;8.5 million of which went to voluntary hospices around the country.  As for the other &euro;1.5 million, there are community palliative care voluntary services in a few of the community healthcare organisations which we funded as well, and then we gave Laura Lynn Foundation, the Irish Hospice Foundation and two others &euro;100,000 each.</p> <p>  We are putting additional money in for next year as well.  For example, probably the nicest thing I have done since I got this job was to go and meet representatives of the Laura Lynn Foundation last week.  I had the extraordinary pleasure of doing a video call with them a while ago and saying that we are allocating &euro;1.5 million to them next year.  Their funding is approximately &euro;4.5 million and they have never got anything from the State.  I had the immense pleasure of being able to say to them that on top of the &euro;1.5 million, they are getting &euro;750,000 of the &euro;10 million we are now talking about.  I had the absolute joy - it is the first time I got a clap since I became Minister for Health - of going to meet them last week and saying that the &euro;1.5 million we are giving them next year is now in the base.  They are getting that from now on.  There is really strong support from the Government for palliative care and for the hospice sector.  That is only one example.</p></speech>

It will have to be rolled out across certain sectors first.  We have heard at previous committee meetings - it might have been at the Committee of Public Accounts - that the HSE has relatively high levels of non-compliance with public procurement processes.  In the past few years, it has fluctuated up and down.  It was 28% in 2018.  It was 49% in 2016.  The Department and the HSE are doing huge amounts of work to try to lower those numbers.  Has the HSE undertaken a procurement review on the PPE procurement process for quarters 2, 3 and 4?</p></speech>

It is a really good question and one I have asked.  I wrote to the HSE quite some time ago to say almost exactly what the Deputy has said.  Given the vast amount of money that is being spent, much of it outside the normal checks and balances that are in place for procurement, I asked whether the HSE could do an audit of it and come back to us.  It has given an undertaking to do that.  We are all quite rightly focused on the appropriate expenditure and the good expenditure of PPE.  When this audit comes back, it is entirely possible that there will be have been purchases outside of the normal procurement process.  In fact, I suspect we will see that.  When that happens, and it probably will be the Committee of Public Accounts which will look at it, and maybe this committee as well, let us remember the pressure that they were under and that we all put them under to do whatever was required.</p></speech>

We all felt the pressure throughout the year.  In general, in these times of stress we can learn a lot about the process.  We have a way to go in Ireland in terms of our procurement process.  I wonder whether the Department will be doing a more general value-for-money review of Covid expenditure during 2020 at some stage.</p></speech>

It is certainly happening on PPE, which would be one of the biggest amounts.  For example, in the amount we are looking at here, &euro;667 million is for PPE alone.  It is a vast amount of money.  Testing and tracing, obviously, involved a huge amount of money as well.</p></speech>

Appendix 3 sets out the initiative funded under the 2020 winter plan, all of which is worthwhile and I am not questioning.  There are measures that we all have wanted to see happen for years, such as an increase in community beds, GP-structured access to diagnostics and community health networks.  I understand that these are in some cases putting down the systems that will make Sl&aacute;intecare possible.  However, they seem like fairly long-term commitments and they will add to the base.  Has the Minister any response to IFAC's position?  Is there a plan for funding it in the long term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#J01900"><p>I agree that they add to the base.  We have done it quite differently this year.  Last year, the winter plan cost &euro;30 million.  This year, it is &euro;600 million.  We are doing things at a completely different scale.  In fairness, what we designed with the HSE was a winter plan.  So far, it is working.  The trolley numbers are at 30% of what they were last year but presentations are still at 90%.  We are entering into the biggest pinch point, now through the end of December, but so far it is working.</p> <p>  We have not entirely designed it as a once-off winter plan.  We have said that there is &euro;600 million for the winter plan.  I am looking for the permission of Deputies for &euro;200 million of this for the current year.  In next year's base, there is &euro;400 million for January, February, March and April of next year.  Essentially, what we are doing with the rest of the budget for next year is saying that this is permanent now.  I refer to the extra beds, critical care beds, ward beds, community beds, community assessment hubs and the extra staff that we are hiring.  We have designed the budget to bring capacity up for the winter really quickly but then lock it in as permanent capacity.  IFAC is correct that many of the commitments for the winter plan are permanent funding commitments.</p></speech>

This is one of the reasons that the budget was so high.  I felt it quite right to point at the Government budgets but as I said at the start, if the Deputy has not already done this I suggest she look at the ESRI report on comparative healthcare spending, led by Professor Maev-Ann Wren led, which is so important.  The narrative in Ireland for years has been that we spend more than anybody else and we do not get the outcomes.  The ESRI&rsquo;s report is really complicated stuff when one compares country to country but it has done it.  It turns out that we are ninth or tenth of the EU 15.  I say as Minister for Health, let us proudly invest more in healthcare.  IFAC may not agree but it has a different job.</p></speech>

I can fully understand if the Minister does not have an update for the committee today but would it be possible for the committee to get an update on whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform comes back to the Minister on that carryover?</p></speech>

We have had a very interesting discussion at this Estimates session.  However, it has been very wide-ranging.  Much of what governs our healthcare system is how we spend our money.  The committee cannot approve or disapprove an Estimate but perhaps if we were to take a position on an Estimate there might be a more targeted or directed questioning of the budgets.</p></speech>

On PPE, as the Minister stated, annually the HSE would pay a fraction of that.  It is an astronomical amount of money.  I am not aware if the Minister has been watching what is happening in Britain in respect of PPE, where it was bought at prices that were completely inflationary compared to what it would normally cost.  Where was most of the new PPE sourced?  Was it outside the EU, inside the EU, or even in Ireland?  Can I have a breakdown of that, please?</p></speech>

Together with the Deputy, I was highly critical of the deal at the time and sought for it to be ended early.  I did not think it was the best way to proceed and am firmly and repeatedly on the record to that end.  Even at the time, however, I was saying that it was easy for me to say that and a review will be done.  Inevitably, it will show that with the benefit of hindsight, were one doing it again, it would be done differently.  Indeed the conversations that we are having with the private hospitals now are not about simply taking over their hospitals and that is because of what was learned the last time.  One would probably do it on a pay-for-use basis and this would seem to me to be the sensible way to do it.  Again we have to be very cognisant of the environment at the time.  We were all looking at the television and seeing car parks in Italian hospitals with patients who were very sick.  The HSE, the Department and the Government at the time did what was required to secure that capacity instantly.</p></speech>

The Covid-19 patients were all brought into the public hospitals and the private hospitals were to try to keep the urgent non-Covid-19 public work going.  I may be slightly wrong here but, for example, my understanding is that the public St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital took over St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital&rsquo;s operating theatres and so forth and many of the urgent cancer work for public patients ended up being done there using their resources.  However, there were other hospitals such as, for example, the Bon Secours Hospital, Limerick, where there was a very small volume of additional care undertaken.  It is a mixed bag.  At the time, I submitted parliamentary questions to get exactly what the numbers were for different types of procedures done and I presume that all that information is available.

At the time, the Government acted because it saw what was happening across mainland Europe.  As the Minister said, however, there are significant question marks as to whether this was cost effective for the taxpayer.  When all of the dust settles on Covid-19, questions will be asked about the amount of money that was given to private hospitals because these are run by some very wealthy people who have done very well out of this deal.  There are significant questions as to what we got back as taxpayers.  As the Minister has said himself, this was wrong deal.</p></speech>

Our doctors and the Army were setting up tents in car parks of public hospitals.  That is where we were at.</p><p>I agree, I do not think it will be done like that in the future and it is certainly not how we are thinking about doing it if it is needed again, and please God it will not be needed.  We cannot judge what happened through a normal, peacetime lens.  It was not a normal time.</p></speech>

Does he have a timeframe for the review of the way in which student nurses are treated and paid prior to their graduation?  A motion was heard in the D&aacute;il today on the retention and reimbursement of student nurses in the health service.  That is very important.  The Minister has said that he will do a review and look at reimbursement and so forth for student nurses.  Does he have a timeframe for that review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#L00300"><p>We do.  I wish to apologise because I know that the Deputy was one of the signatories to that Private Members' motion.  I received it last Friday and worked on a response to it in the Department over the weekend and I talked to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, about exactly what we could put in place.  I put in a lot of work but, unfortunately, I could not attend.  I wanted to be in the Chamber today and partake in the debate but there was an annual EU health ministers meeting that I could not get out of.  I had to be there, for obvious reasons, so I apologise for not attending the debate.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will know from the countermotion, we have secured an exemption to allow student nurses access to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  One of the things that the INMO quite rightly put to me was that there are student nurses who do not qualify for PUP because a job still exists but the nurses cannot take it up.  Students who were working in a shop or bar that had to close are entitled to PUP because that job is not there.  However, some student nurses found themselves in a position whereby their job still existed, the agency was still hiring or the care home was still taking people in, but, for obvious reasons related to Covid-19, those nurses could not possibly be working in a hospital during the week and a nursing home at the weekend.  There were infection prevention reasons that could not happen.  I did not think that was fair at all so we have secured an exemption for these students if they can show any loss of earnings.  Anyone who can say they were earning money and are not any more will get PUP, and this exemption applies only to them.  I have also secured a commitment that any healthcare costs associated with getting sick at work will be covered.</p> <p>  The INMO was keen for an independently verified review to take place which would not just reflect the Department's view of the world.  The INMO wants a meaningful input into that report.  We have agreed with all of that and I think those measures are all in the countermotion.  I want the INMO to input to the review.  I want independent verification of the report and we will then publish it.  It will happen in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

Most of us accept that it was the right road to go down, but many looking in found it frustrating that many of the hospitals were not being fully utilised.  There was a lack of flexibility within the HSE or the Department.  Somebody should have called stop and said that we need to use the private hospitals for something.  That was not going on and was frustrating to many looking in at the system.  We would like to think that we learn from these mistakes in case we are ever in that situation again.  The HSE seems to be such a monolith that no one was able to make that decision.  Would the Minister accept that as a fair analysis of what happened, particularly in the first lockdown?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#L00500"><p>That is all fair.  I do not think the HSE would do the same again if put in the same situation.  It is obviously easy for all of us to talk about it now.  Could or should what the Chairman has just said have happened?  Could people have stepped in and said that we need to get the utilisation rates up?  Along with the Chairman and Deputy Kenny, I was advocating for exactly that.  At the start, there was not a lot of it but the HSE, in fairness, was trying to do something that no one had ever done before.  It took over an entire hospital sector.  There were legal and IR implications and all sorts of different implications.  As quickly as it could, the HSE began to get the volumes up.  I was getting replies to parliamentary questions showing that the volumes of care were going up, although they did not at the start.  Perhaps it could have worked better.  The Chairman will remember the pressure the HSE was under in taking over a whole hospital system and having it ready overnight.  We were all afraid of the worst-case scenario in which our public hospitals filled up and we would end up with thousands of Covid-19 patients quickly filling up the private hospitals as well.  The Army was setting up tents in car parks.  That needed to be looked at, and it has been, to inform our current talks with the private hospitals.  We need to be cognisant of what was going on at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#L00600"><p>I apologise for being late, I was at another meeting.  The Minister was talking about the issue of community paramedicine.  I have raised this matter before and have seen no evidence of a change for the coming year.  We have taken on an additional 21,500 whole-time staff in the HSE.  Including part-time people and everything else, 30,000 extra people are now working in the HSE compared with five years ago.  Of that, only 70 are public health nurses.</p> <p>  I put this question to representatives of Sl&aacute;intecare who were before the committee.  They were shocked that only 70 additional public health nurses have been taken on in recent years.  We have gone from 1,560 public health nurses to 1,630, there or thereabouts, and I have seen no evidence that that will change.  The Minister talks about community paramedicine.  We need nurses in the community.</p> <p>  A similar situation also applies to public health doctors.  I am advised that at the most recent meeting, the Department was prepared to allow only 30 people in under that category.  There was no agreement over all public health doctors.  It seems to be sending out the wrong messages.  On the one hand, we have Sl&aacute;intecare saying one thing and, on the other hand, there is a policy that allowed an increase of 20.9% across all sectors of healthcare in the past five years, including nurses, junior doctors, consultants and administrative staff, while there has been less than a 5% increase of public health nurses.  Are we serious about Sl&aacute;intecare or is it all bluster?  I am becoming more and more convinced that a lot of it is bluster.  I can see no evidence that we are recruiting people to work in the public healthcare sector.  That is one issue.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates to cataract operations.  I raised this at the previous meeting and I raise it again.  The response I got from the HSE was nothing but downright appalling.  All I got back was a memo defending people travelling abroad to Northern Ireland for cataract operations, without any response to the question I had raised, which was about having people examined at an early stage, put on the list for the procedure and then, if the public health sector cannot deal with doing the cataract operation, it comes in under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  There was no reply to that question.  The reply I got was appalling and extremely defensive of the fact that we are sending people out of the country to have a basic operation.  That really needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  There is a third issue on which I wish to touch.  My understanding is that there are 685 applications for GP training this year.  That is the largest number ever.  One in eight of our existing GPs are over 60.  What can we do?</p><p>Can additional training places be provided?  Obviously, that would be done with co-operation.  For a GP to go into training, he or she needs a practice that is prepared to take him or her on and go through the whole programme.  What discussions have been held with the Department about increasing the number of GP trainees in order that we will have enough people in three to five years' time to fill the vacancies that arise?</p><p> I wish to refer to an issue that I raised recently with Revenue.  We gave a special dispensation to meat factories to bring in people to work in particular jobs and earn less than &euro;30,000.  Some of my colleagues have mentioned that we need people in the community to provide home care and everything else.  A huge number of people live in the same home as those to whom they provide 24-7 care five days a week.  As happens in other countries, these carers are provided with food and accommodation.  However, the cost of providing accommodation and food is not taken into account by Revenue when assessing people for tax purposes.  Let us say that a person wants to bring in someone from abroad who is experienced in the provision of home care and care of the elderly.  The same criteria are not in place for people from abroad to come here and provide home care.  Interestingly, in Israel, more than 5,000 people are allowed to enter to provide home care full-time because there are not enough people to do the work and we will face that challenge here as well.  We need to provide a home care package where people call two or three times a day to different individuals.  However, there are those who need permanent home care.  I ask that this issue be examined.</p><p> In terms of the community healthcare issue, I am not convinced that this happens and there is no evidence to support the claim.  Can the Minister indicate where in HSE budget has money been set aside to deal with this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#M00200"><p>I will go through the various questions and the Deputy is free to tell me to stop whenever he wants.  The overall question is linked to the community healthcare question of whether Sl&aacute;intecare is for real.  For me, Sl&aacute;intecare is a roadmap to universal healthcare and having high-quality care when people need it.  I am taking this matter deadly seriously and I hope the Deputy can see that from the &euro;600 million winter plan and the budget for next year, which is the biggest additional healthcare budget in recent times, possibly ever.  It has the single biggest target ever for acute beds, critical care beds, hospital doctors, hospital nurses, community beds, step-down beds, rehabilitation beds and community clinicians, which is daunting because this is a massive task.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will see when he looks at the budget, we have very deliberately broken it up into big chunks one of which relates to community care.  We are looking at a level of investment in community care for next year that is unprecedented for all of the reasons he outlined.  This is in today's Revised Estimate because it included &euro;200 million of the &euro;600 million winter plan.  If one considers the whole approach to the winter plan, it is exactly that.  It is home care hours, GP access to diagnostics, public health nursing and home intervention teams.  Let me give a brilliant example.  There is a pilot scheme, called frailty teams, at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  Teams of an advanced paramedic, advanced nurse practitioners, occupational therapists and, sometimes, consultant doctors are sent to the houses of people who normally would be brought to the emergency department of St. Vincent's Hospital.  The teams stabilise people in their homes.  The cars that accompany the teams contain some advanced diagnostic equipment.  The teams can conduct a teleconference with the emergency departments and specialists at St. Vincent's and in St. Columcille's.  The pilot scheme has led to a 90% reduction in the number of people having to go to hospital.  I am seeking the &euro;200 million in funding to which I refer in order do these amazing things.</p> <p>  The next issue is cataracts.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised the issue before and is absolutely spot on.  My understanding of the issue that he has again raised with me is as follows.  The problem with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is that one can only access it if one has been examined by a consultant.</p></speech>

That is not right and not what we should be doing.  As part of the access to care thinking for next year, which is the pot of &euro;340 million, these are exactly the kinds of issues that I want to examine.  It is a great example.</p></speech>

The response given did not deal with the issue and there was no indication that the HSE would deal with this issue, which is disappointing.</p></speech>

The issue required a policy response and we will work with the HSE on exactly that.</p> <p>  In terms of training for GPs, absolutely.  Really, it is a conversation that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I need to have about providing additional places.  I take the point that Deputy Colm Burke made about the ageing GP population.  It is fantastic to see such interest.</p></speech>

There is a workforce planning team that is doing a flow analysis on all of the different aspects such as how do we get people in, are we training enough people, are we retaining them and so forth.</p> <p>  In terms of foreign carers or home care workers and tax reductions, I do not know.  I guess it would have to be a conversation between the Minister for Finance and me.  If the Deputy thinks there is an opportunity there, then let us take a look.</p></speech>

Clearly, the Estimate is massive and perhaps we need to examine how it is done.  Maybe we should provide supports for committee members.  We do it for overseas aid and it is done in other parliaments.  It is something that we should consider.  I did not got a sense that we have dug into the Estimates and where the money will be spent.</p> <p>  I have a question about the national children's hospital because I am unsure about the funding, particularly the &euro;107 million underspend.  A couple of weeks ago, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was before the joint committee.  Its representatives talked about the difficulties they face with hundreds of claims being before the High Court and the project being behind schedule.  We also heard that the Tallaght urgent care centre is seven months behind and how they were worried about a big claim.  On the one hand, we are saying that there has been an underspend but, on the other, we clearly know that there will be a demand.</p><p>It is clear there will be an overspend, not necessarily this year but certainly next year.  Is that budgeted for?  We are also told that 15% per month to the contractor, BAM, was being withheld.  Does that come under the Minister's Department?  How is that held?  We do not have the time to go into them today but those are some of my concerns about it.  </p><p> To get back to the Tallaght Hospital issue, a 72-bed unit project is with HBS Estates.  We are told it is needed because of the number of elderly people presenting at the accident and emergency department but also because of the young population in the area.  Is there any way of fast-tracking that because it is in an area of high unemployment and also because we need more beds within the system?</p></speech>

All of us have been in hospitals when people were informed that their loved one was going to die.  I was in a hospital one night when someone was dying on a trolley.  A man nearby was being transferred to a bed and there was much effing and blinding, so to speak, while this woman was dying with her family around her.  There is a need for those family palliative care systems within hospitals.</p> <p>  We are bringing in the people involved in the vaccine in two weeks time.  The main concern is the hesitancy on the part of many people with regard to vaccines, particularly across Europe.  In the past decade the numbers have gone down again.  As one of the members said earlier, there is a need for a campaign around the efficacy of the drugs we are getting but also their safety and the speed with which they are being made available.  That conversation needs to be had with this committee at some stage but also with the wider population.  I am aware from talking to people that many want to get the vaccine but many others would prefer to get one from the next batch rather than the first.  We need to convince them in that regard.  Other vaccines were introduced in recent years and there was not the desired take-up of them.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  He might get back to me regarding some of the questions.  On the Estimates, we do need support as a committee because even as late as yesterday we were getting notes from his Department about significant changes in terms of the allocation of specific moneys.  That might be taken on board by the Minister and his officials.  Does the Minister want to make any concluding remarks?  We are over time now.</p></speech>

It is the issue that arises when the D&aacute;il is sitting in the Convention Centre and committees are expected to sit at the same time.
