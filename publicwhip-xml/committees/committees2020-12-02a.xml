    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.4" nospeaker="true" time="16:30:00" ><p>Mr. Seamus McCarthy(An tArd Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00200"><p>I welcome everybody to the meeting.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the Committee.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Neasa Hourigan.</p> <p>  Before we move on to the other items of business I want to make a statement.  I want to address the issue surrounding the tweet that I published over the weekend marking the 100th anniversary of the Kilmichael ambush in County Cork.  I am very conscious, as the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that the controversy has placed all the members in a difficult and totally unnecessary situation, particularly when this committee has such important work to carry out.  What I was attempting to do was to highlight that following the disastrous decision to partition the country almost 100 years ago, in the wake of events such as Kilmichael we still had conflict that went on for a long time during which a lot of suffering took place.  I deleted the tweet and apologised for posting it.</p> <p>  As we work to advance reconciliation on our island, we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that is honest to all of us and our beliefs but that does not deepen division or cause hurt.  As an Irish republican and someone who is in a position of political leadership, I have to be more aware of my responsibility to ensure that I do not do anything that is disrespectful to others.  Since the mid-1980s, when A Scenario for Peace was published, right through the Hume-Adams dialogue, and, finally, to the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, I have actively supported initiatives to bring about peace on the island.  On Sunday, I apologised for any offence that I caused due to the insensitive nature of the tweet and I want to repeat that apology to the members today.  I also want to apologise to all my colleagues for the position in which I put them.  My tweet fell below not just the standard we expect of each other but the standard I expect of myself as a Member of the D&aacute;il and for that I am genuinely sorry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for making that statement.  I welcome the decision by the Ceann Comhairle to respond to the letter from Arlene Foster.  It was a very strong statement to the effect that nothing we do in here should in any way contribute to undermining the democratic process.  I believe the tweet was offensive at a time when, more than ever, we all need to work together with the UK leaving the European Union.  We all have a harder task in respect of working together with the Six Counties, which will be outside the EU, and we must make sure that nothing is done to undermine that process whereby the entire issue is now changed.</p> <p>  This committee is one of the most important committees in this House.  We are here to hold Departments and State authorities to account.  Likewise, it is here to hold every one of us to account, including Deputy Stanley, as Chairman.  It is disappointing that this tweet was sent out.  The Chairman's party leader said his was a one-off tweet but a number of tweets have been sent over the past number of months which were subsequently withdrawn.  There is a lot of speculation that some of these tweets are being deliberately and carefully drafted.  That is not the way to deal with issues and create division, and I certainly believe the tweet has created division.  </p> <p>  It is extremely important now that the Chairman makes a full statement on this matter in the D&aacute;il to re-establish his credibility as Chairman and the credibility of this committee.  Many people died over the 30 years of conflict.  The day the Chairman mentioned, the Narrow Water attack, was the same day two people aged 14 and 15 died in another tragedy at a different location.  It is extremely important that we do not bring back the divisions that existed at that time or add to them in any way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00400"><p>Does anybody else want to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00500"><p>I acknowledge that the Chairman took down the tweet, apologised and has made a statement here.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and a Member of the D&aacute;il, the tweet got much more attention beyond Twitter in the broadcast and the mainstream media.  That is not terribly surprising but it does have an external impact also beyond this jurisdiction.  I sat on the decade of centenaries committee which dealt with the pre-1916 period and there were members of the Chairman's party on it who played a very constructive role.  The one thing we all understood was how difficult any kind of marking of the War of Independence and the Civil War would be and the need to be very respectful in any of that.  I would want an assurance that this is a one-off mistake.  I would like to hear that from the Chairman.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not have a role in respect of this issue.  Any role in respect of it is within his party in terms of how media and social media are handled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#A00600"><p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Last week, John Finucane, MP, came in to seek our support for his family's quest for an inquiry into the horrific murder of his father.</p><p>In the course of that meeting and of the debate on the Seanad motion which preceded it, the Houses of the Oireachtas recognised and recounted the terrible details of the violence visited upon the Finucane family.  The Chairman of joint committee, Deputy O'Dowd, offered his full support and noted that Mr. Finucane's family was not the only one to suffer and that all the victims of violence need to be respected.  The party of our Chairman has stated repeatedly that there is not a hierarchy of victims.  We have to acknowledge that his tweet was about a very violent incident within recent memory, involving the death of very young men and in a very strategic and deliberate way.  We heard at another committee last week about the human impact of violence.  There is a human impact to this violence also that is very significant and has been well recounted.  The Chairman's tweet hurts the survivors who are alive today and whose family members - teenage boys and young men, some of them fathers - are still missing this Christmas.</p><p> What I want to know is what was behind the sentiment the Chairman expressed and what it says about what we are trying to do in terms of reconciliation for the future and about mutual respect.  The tweet seems to have no regard for the personal impact on the people who are left behind, in the way his party quite rightly called for in recognition of the Finucane family last week.  It is what is behind that sentiment that concerns me.  I am also interested in what prompted the Chairman to remove it and what was his thought process in that regard?  It is hard to see because a person must have that sentiment within himself or herself in the first place in order to express it.  Did somebody call the Chairman and tell him to delete it?  Did he receive an instruction?</p><p> I do not think that anything Sinn F&eacute;in does is by accident.  It is a highly strategic operation that has been well controlled, well managed and well planned in all its steps, before 1998 and since.  This is the first time Sinn F&eacute;in has held such a senior position in this Parliament.  Deputy Stanley is Chair of this committee, which, historically, is the most important of all the parliamentary committees and which is always chaired by an established parliamentarian of significance and of significant experience.  It is because of the significance of his office, that the reaction we have seen has been forthcoming.  My view is that he needs to go further than making an apology to this committee.  What he has said represents an attempt to alleviate the discord within the committee, but the real offence is to the Irish people and to their representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I think the Chairman should go to the D&aacute;il and apologise or make a personal statement there.  His party needs to make a statement of a similar nature that genuinely separates this repeating of violence and the glory of violence every couple of weeks.  The sequence is that it happens every couple of weeks and then there is an apology and we move on.  Meanwhile, it becomes more normalised just as we move towards a period of commemorations.</p><p> As parliamentarians, we must ensure that we take steps to protect the moderate nature of our politics.  Every party here has done things in stepping towards the centre in defence of the State that might have been politically uncomfortable for it.  I do not want to lose that centre ground to a polarised sort of politics like we have on other parts of this island.  I urge the Chairman and his party to take those steps towards moderation and to talk about separation from violence and to reject that.  I think he can play a hugely significant role in that regard.  His office is of such significance that it is hard to let the matter pass without noting it in this way.  I really urge him to give the matter further reflection before we get on with our business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for making that statement.  I know it is never easy for a public representative, especially somebody who holds the Chair of an important committee such as this, to sit in front of his or her colleagues and tell them that he or she made a mistake and to outline that he or she is genuinely sorry for that mistake.  I believe the Chairman.  I think anybody who knows him, regardless of their political affiliations, will believe him.  Anybody who knows him will know that the tweet was a clumsy attempt at something.  I think he has accepted that and that it was not the place to have, as other members of the committee have alluded to, an important debate in which we all need to participate.</p> <p>  Anybody who knows Brian Stanley will acknowledge that, first and foremost, he is a good man.  He is a fair man.  He is certainly a very fair and effective Chair of this committee.  In the short number of months since the committee has been in existence, anybody looking on, recognising the challenges that it has faced trying to deal with two-hour sessions and what are in some instances very elaborate and detailed issues and sets of accounts, knows that the Chairman has conducted himself in a very fair and effective manner that has allowed this committee to deliver, insofar as it can, under those restrictive measures.</p> <p>  These are going to be a very important number of years, not only in the context of the ongoing decade of centenaries, but also as we move to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That means we all need to be part of mature reflection, but also mature discussion and debate and a recognition that there is not a shared narrative in terms of the causes of conflict in the first instance but also the outworking of those conflicts.  The only thing we all agree on is that in whatever roles we have, we must all do everything within our power to ensure that never again does this island experience the conflicts that have been a hallmark of Irish history.  We are moving to a point in terms of the Good Friday generation where some Members of this House have no recollection of the conflict itself.  This means that those of us who have some recollection and those who have a very clear recollection of the conflict have a very important responsibility to ensure that there is no glory in conflict.  Unfortunately, many people suffered.  As has already been mentioned, lots of people tragically lost their lives.  The role that we all now need to play is to ensure that the suffering and loss of life in those circumstances never happens again.</p> <p>  As for this committee, we have important work to do.  I, for one, accept the Chairman's apology.  I believe that it is heartfelt.  I hope that in our own individual ways we can play a role to ensure that we can all give commitments that we will be incredibly careful in terms of our public utterances on these issues in the first instance, but that we can play constructive roles in the ongoing job of building peace in our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00300"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00400"><p>I accept the Chairman's apology and his statement.  I have known Brian outside of my short time in the D&aacute;il as president of the Irish Road Haulage Association and I have always found him to be a pure gentleman.  Unfortunately, given social media as it is today, things happen in this regard.  I do not condone the content.  I spoke to the Chairman personally about that.  I do, however, accept his apology.  I did not agree with the motion that was brought by Sinn F&eacute;in in respect of the previous Taoiseach, who is now T&aacute;naiste.  As a result, I do not agree with anybody calling for his head.  I think we have far too much important work to get on with.  I do not think anybody has taken the level of offence that is being purported.  I think we are all aware of our history and we should just get down to work and get on with what we have to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.  I accept his apology to the committee and I thank him for it.  There is no doubt, however, that the tweet was hurtful and that it was a glorification of what happened at Narrow Water.  The Chairman's words from when we started our work ring true, namely, that we need to leave party politics at the door.  We are here on behalf of the Oireachtas to scrutinise public bodies and other bodies.  That said, I accept his apology.  I do not think this is the place to scrutinise the tweet.  That is for the D&aacute;il Chamber and it is for the Chairman and his party to reflect on whether they want to deal with the matter in that forum.</p> <p>  I would not classify the tweet as clumsy.  I do not say the Chairman did so.  I hope that when he says he apologises for the tweet, it will not happen again.  That is an important element because, as he rightly points out, this is a very prestigious committee within the Houses and there is an extra onus on him, as Chair.  I know he accepts that and I know he understands it now.</p><p>I hope, however, that we will not have this situation in respect of the Chairman again because it puts the committee into disrepute and it is something we do not want to see again.  I thank the Chairman for his statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00200"><p>I accept the Chairman is making an apology to the committee.  Apart from distracting from the work of this committee, my view is that the apology should be made to those impacted by the tweet, rather to us.  I was not going to comment on the issue but in the Chairman's explanation and in Deputy Carthy's contribution, whether it was a clumsy tweet or a strategic approach, as another member mentioned, a definite attempt was made to try to conflate actions which the army of the Republic of Ireland took in 1920 and the actions that an organisation of the same name took at Narrow Water.  That is not new.  It is a political difference the Chairman's party has with many others in the D&aacute;il.  It is also an attempt to suggest that for someone to be in favour of a united Ireland, it is enough to be anti-British.  We know we need to do far more than that to create a shared island.</p> <p>  While I and many other members of the committee were quite reasonable when we were getting media requests yesterday, the irony is not lost on me that if any of us had been in the Chairman's position, we would probably be the subject of a pile-on.  I do not draw my political tactics from that style of politics when I am in the wrong and I do not believe I should do it when other people are in the wrong.  I object to the Twitter pile-on today in respect of the Ceann Comhairle.  It was an attempt to open up a second line of defence and it was deplorable, especially when so many members of this committee have been so reasonable on this issue.  Deputy Devlin put it well when he said that this is a political difference between the Chairman's party and others here.  The Chairman has as much of a mandate as any other Deputy in this House.  The matter is one between Sinn F&eacute;in and the Irish people, not the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for his apology, which I accept.  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I do not condone the content of the tweet, which was insensitive and inappropriate.  It caused hurt to victims and descendants of victims and people who have a particular perspective.  I respect and fully understand that.  The Committee of Public Accounts is not the place for what some people are seeking, however.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement should by all means invite the Chairman before it to explore this matter.  If the Ceann Comhairle wants to pursue this issue, that is what the Committee on Procedure is for; it is not our role.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Verona Murphy, I believe that, as a nation, we have become a colosseum where we are far too anxious to set up a guillotine every time there is a misdemeanour.  I have previously stated outside this room that an appropriate body, such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, should develop a book of quantum of sorts, with a list of appropriate sanctions for appropriate levels of misdemeanour, from lesser offences right up to more serious ones.  The outcome of the approach we are taking now is the same every time there is an indiscretion or a misdemeanour, however serious or minor.  It is to seek someone's head.  We saw that recently with the T&aacute;naiste's leak.  Some approached that issue in an appropriate way, but others in a different way.  </p> <p>  I am not for one second condoning the content of the tweet.  It was insensitive.  It is a matter, however, for the committee on the Good Friday Agreement, and certainly not for us.  A great deal of dirty laundry will need to be washed out publicly in the years ahead, as the healing and reconciliation process continues.  That of course includes the Finucane family and a public inquiry in that regard, where we have done our end of the bargain with the Smithwick tribunal, as agreed at Weston Park.  That has not been matched by the British, who have, unfortunately, brought their judicial system into disrepute by their actions.  </p> <p>  I am old enough to remember the Troubles being a nightly blight on the news, in respect of the loss of life on both sides.  We all regret that.  Given the years we are in, I wonder, when we look back, why we manage to romanticise and glorify atrocities of 100 years ago and then look at others in a different light.  I abhor all violence.  I mourn the victims of all violence, no matter on what side or in what era.</p> <p>  I would prefer if this committee stuck to its business.  We have a huge body of work to get through.  I accept the Chairman's apology.  If the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement wishes to pursue a particular line, it can do that.  If the D&aacute;il wants to pursue a particular line, the Business Committee and the Committee on Procedure are there for that purpose.  We do not have the competence, and I certainly do not have the will, to pursue this matter any further here.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.  There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that every word spoken was genuine and sincere.  That reflects the type of person the Chairman is.  The Chairman, like me, is a lifelong and proud Republican.  He is a person who walks the walk.  People talk about bringing peace to the island and the Good Friday Agreement.  The Chairman was actively involved in promoting and working for that peace and seeing it come to fruition.  We have had a permanent peace now for more than two decades.  I know the Chairman's words are genuine because he has walked the walk.</p> <p>  Regarding the chairmanship of this committee, I think the two matters are totally separate.  In the short time he has been in this role, the Chairman has been exemplary.  He has been impartial and fair on all occasions.  Again, that reflects the type of individual he is.  That is the end of the matter for me.  The Chairman has genuinely apologised and, as others have said, this committee has much work to do and we need to get on with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#C00500"><p>I welcome the Chairman's statement.  The Committee of Public Accounts is one of the most important and effective of the parliamentary committees.  The Chairman's actions have impacted on the work of the committee, especially given his privileged position as the Chair.  The public see accountability as a moral construct which is only achieved when public officials serve with the commitment to do the right thing.  As Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said, an important step will be for the Chairman to clarify his position in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  Time and again, we have seen Sinn F&eacute;in members not taking responsibility for their actions.  We had Deputy John Brady a fortnight ago and the Chairman last weekend.  This is not a singular or once-off event.  The Chairman's party leader also needs to make a statement on this matter.  It is seen by the Irish public as a strategic ploy to inflate tensions.  We all have a responsibility in the decade of commemorations to commemorate the past in a respectful manner.  That is an important step.  Political representatives, irrespective of their political and ideological differences, must lead responsibly.  It is apparent that we need a statement on this matter and we must also continue the important work of this committee in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

There is obviously a range of views among members who are coming to this matter in a thoughtful way.  I clarify that my actions are my own.  I take full responsibility for them.  I was wrong.  I have apologised, and I am saying that sincerely.  Nobody else needs to take any responsibility.  I am solely responsible for my actions and I have to take responsibility for them.</p> <p>  I am conscious of what the members have said on this matter.  My commitment in the time ahead, through my words and actions, is to have the confidence of members, as Chairman, as we deal with the important work ahead.</p> <p>  A number of members mentioned the decade of commemorations.  We are in that decade now and there are a few difficult years to go through because there are difficult issues.  The lesson for me and all of us is that during that period we need to be very careful and continue to build reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  That is my commitment. </p></speech>

Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  There were 13 sets of financial statements and accounts laid before the D&aacute;il between 16 November and 27 November.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in all cases.  In the accounts for the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board - that is, Caranua - the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to two matters.  The first is the inadequate control over grant repayment.  Second, there is the review of the effectiveness of internal controls.  We will meet Caranua, as agreed at our last meeting, on 17 December.  I propose we request Caranua to provide further information as part of the briefing it will provide for that meeting.  Are members happy to agree to that?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I have sought to find out what the problem was.  Members can see the accounts were certified on 6 December 2019.  I looked at the appropriation account of the Department of Education and at that stage, the end of March, it noted it had received the accounts but the laying of the accounts was pending.  For some reason, that did not happen between March and November.  There were three other sets of accounts pending at that stage so I have asked to check that each of those sets has since been laid.</p></speech>

Are members minded to do that?  We will request that be done.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items is category B, correspondence from the Accounting Officer and Ministers and their follow-up to previous Public Accounts Committee meetings.  The first one is No. 202B from Mr. S&eacute;an &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education, dated 13 November 2020, providing further information requested by the committee arising from the meeting of 21 October.  A number of Deputies have requested to address this today.  I think Deputy Catherine Murphy was one of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#G02300"><p>Yes.  There were a number of things that stood out.  I will refer to one.  The prefabs in the longest standing rental agreement have stood since 2000.  There is a building going up now but one would have to ask about value for money in terms of the length of time that took and it is important that we note that.  There may well be others that are not as long but that could be nearly as long.</p><p>It would be quite useful to get a few more examples, perhaps five, six or even ten examples of the length of time.  There is the cost of renting and the issue of substandard accommodation as well.  I ask that this be done.</p><p> With regard to the payroll system, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; states on page 3 that there are approximately 9,000 casual employees and that there is a new standard of governance and approval process for the sourcing of goods and services.  An interim payroll upgrade is under way and it is due to be completed in the latter part of 2021.  He said the implementation of a new payroll system could take up to three or four years, which is a surprisingly long lead-in time for something like this.  It is stated there is a very complex system with four different streams on the payroll, with primary, post-primary, non-teaching staff and retired people but there are 9,000 casual employees.  I received information in reply to a parliamentary question that under the home tuition scheme, home tutors have always been engaged by parents or guardians of a child who receives home tuition.  Tutors do not have a contractual relationship with the Department.  Are they among the 9,000?  What is the proportion of these 9,000 casual employees?  I acknowledge that some of them are probably substitute teachers.  A little more examination needs to happen so we can get an understanding of it.</p><p> The average compensation payment does not always compute in the one year.  It is not entirely satisfactory that we are unable to see it all and it may well be that we have to look back historically.  Where there are compensation payments, we have to learn whether there are things that can be avoided in the future.  It is very important that we see the cost of something and the value of doing some work.  That is the reason I am particularly picking up on this.</p><p> There is an important paragraph on page 6 on the school transport system and the fact that some moneys were paid back to the Exchequer.  It is an important paragraph with regard to some issues we have previously looked at.  It would be quite useful to ask about the final sentence on page 7 and whether it is intended to pursue a Garda investigation.  Perhaps we can ask for an update in a few months just to keep an eye on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020120200002#H00200"><p>The first issue I want to raise arising from the correspondence also relates to temporary accommodation prefabs.  I am always wary when temporary solutions are in place for a long period because we end up creating vested interests and people who have an interest in a bad practice continuing for longer.  The three largest suppliers of rental accommodation in 2019 were three companies that provide Portakabins and prefabs.  Can we ask the Department to clarify the number of students being educated in such structures?</p> <p>  The school Deputy Murphy spoke about has made use of temporary accommodation for 20 years.  We know from the work of previous Committees of Public Accounts that this is not a cheap option.  Over time, the funds expended on temporary accommodation in a single school would buy a small house in Dalkey, just to give Deputy Devlin's constituency a mention.  We are speaking about substantial money.  It would be useful if the committee could ask of the Department, in tabular format, all of the schools using temporary structures, the duration they have been used and the cost associated with them to date.  That is important.</p> <p>  I fully endorse Deputy Murphy's point on legal claims.  It requires much more scrutiny.  It is not just the Department of Education but it is a good place to start.  As she said, it is very opaque to find out exactly how much in any given year was spent on settling legal claims.  It is very hard to find information, particularly where claims were settled or if there was a non-disclosure element to the deal.  The State could have been forfeiting substantial sums due to negligence, for example.  We hear anecdotes public servants making complaints about another public servant and the Department settles.  The public servant at the heart of it could be promoted in an external competition and nobody realises that person is the reason the State is out substantial funds.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General in a position to give us an analysis on the legal costs associated with the Department over a period of time as opposed to just one year?  As the correspondence correctly states, a claim might be made in 2020 but it might not be settled until 2023.  Usually, when a Department comes before us in a given year, its representative states a claim that was settled last year relates to something from five years ago and that the problems have been addressed.  If we had an overarching analysis, it would be useful for the committee.</p></speech>

All of the appropriation accounts have this note and the structure of the note is set out in the template, which is directed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not a great note from an information point of view.  It is opaque and there are many difficulties with it.  There should be better information available and it should be available on a Department-by-Department basis.  The State Claims Agency handles all of these on behalf of Departments.  There should be better information available from it as to the amount of compensation paid out on a claim and the associated legal costs, whenever they were paid.  That might be the first place to go to look for what information is already available from the State Claims Agency on these.</p></speech>

It is very clear from the breakdown given that the overall figure of &euro;13.8 million for post and telecommunications is largely, as we suspected, with regard to the postage of payslips, which amounts to more than &euro;10 million.  In the course of the Secretary General's contribution, he mentioned there may be the possibility of using an existing or planned upgrade to allow a system to be implemented.  My question as a new member of the committee is how we track this.  It was a formal issue raised with the Secretary General.  He has written to us to outline the figures but has not given us a commitment or responded in any way as to how he would address the costs, which I call "wasteful".  While we might give him the time between now and when he next comes before us, I would hate for him to give us the same answer then.</p></speech>

Perhaps we should recommend that there is an improvement so it is more transparent.</p><p>I presume that we would write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request it to ask all of the Departments to apply a different format so that people can follow this a lot more easily.</p><p> In terms of the Department of Education, a good few years ago I remember asking parliamentary questions and being absolutely gobsmacked by the reply regarding the amount of money that was spent by the Department to fight parents who sought appropriate education for their children.  Some of those cases were initiated but never concluded but then the children ended up being facilitated.  The expenditure would have provided a large amount of very good quality education instead of paying legal fees.  To ensure there is appropriate expenditure of public moneys we must take a good look at this matter because there can be things that are bad practice.  This committee must try to interrogate such matters. </p></speech>

It would be useful if we could get more detailed information on the percentage of them that have been rented for more than five, ten and 15 years, respectively.  We accept that prefabs must be used as a short-term measure but I think their use needs to be phased out.  Apparently, the school population will decrease according to the trend in demographics.  We will look for further information on the other items raised and on how the wage is administered through the post.  We can make the recommendation in terms of the report.</p></speech>

We know that the schools bundle 5 is not on time due to the liquidation of the Carillion group and have been consistently told that this is not a cost on the State by virtue of the way that the matter was handled.  In Maynooth, there is a schools bundle 5 project to build two 1,000 pupil schools right beside each other.  These schools were due to be occupied last September but they still have not been completed so there is a cost in the interim.  It may not be the cost of building the schools but there are costs for additional accommodation.  There are costs that are not counted as costs by virtue of the fact that the project has not been completed.  Therefore, it is not quite accurate to say that the entire cost is borne.  There are financial consequences when projects are not completed on time.</p></speech>

When the policy was initially introduced we were finding some cases where there were, let us say, board membership fees being paid to people who were in public sector employment but we would have brought those to attention, I think probably around 2011, 2012, 2013, and most of them would be washed out of the system at this stage.  It does not appear to be a problem any longer and would not have been for the past four or five years.  Now DPER may have codified some of that but they also may not have the information readily available.</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry pursued an issue regarding the Committee of Selection and the absence of one.  I note the increase from &euro;304 million to &euro;313 million.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State and the key issue for some of us is how such inadequate oversight has been overlooked.  We need further information on the liquidation and the length of time that it will take, which was unclear when the delegation was here.  I want to know the timeline and whether there are risk assessments on delays and further costs.  I ask that we request the Department to provide all of that information.</p></speech>

I am not quite clear in my own mind about the differentiation between State agencies and companies.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General audit both?  I can see in the documentation that some companies paid a dividend in 2019.  Possibly, that situation will be changed considerably in 2020 because of under-performance caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>  Some State agencies or enterprises are technically supposed to be commercially run but there is no obligation on them to pay a dividend to the State and for some of them that would not be appropriate.</p><p>I picked out in particular the Irish Greyhound Board.  For example, Abargrove seems to be a company within a company.  It is the catering section in Limerick Stadium and it is a separate company to the stadium itself.  Is that audited separately? </p></speech>

There are two other subsidiaries.  One is Shelbourne Park and while I cannot remember the name of the other, it is the other eight stadia.  Together with Bord na gCon, they form a group, so the group audit pulls it all together, if one likes.  There may be the appearance that things are losing money, but they are actually being cross-subsidised by other parts of the organisation.</p></speech>

They would be what are called commercial State bodies and I do not generally audit commercial State bodies.  What I would be auditing is generally what are called the State agencies or non-commercial State bodies.  Some of them are legally organised as companies but, effectively, they are heavily dependent on Exchequer funding, and that is why they fall to my remit.</p></speech>

The public purse, the taxpayer and the public service benefit from this.  For example, the ESB has paid more than &euro;258 million in one year and Bord na M&oacute;na, despite having gone through a very difficult time, is paying &euro;10 million.  While this has reduced in recent years, hopefully, that will go back up again.  It shows we have a number of very successful semi-State companies that have served the State, the taxpayer and the industrial development of the country very well.  It is proposed to publish that correspondence on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 215B from Ms Rachel Downes, CEO of Caranua, dated 24 November 2020, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the arrangements for winding down Caranua.  We considered this at our meeting on 25 November and agreed to postpone our engagement with Caranua to 17 December.  We have also written to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and the Secretary General of the Department of Education to raise our concerns around the wind-down.  A number of us are concerned about the wind-down and the fact there are still outstanding applications for compensation under that fund.</p></speech>

It would be appropriate if, in advance of that, we wrote to Caranua and advised them that some members of the committee are particularly interested in the provision of supports for survivors following its wind-up.  It would be useful if they were in a position to provide a detailed briefing note on their engagements to date with the Government agencies and the Department in regard to funding for future services and the arrangements that will be in place.  Obviously, it is a matter of concern.  They might indicate what agreements have been in place.  We know that, in previous correspondence, Caranua contradicted correspondence that had been sent to the committee with regard to the level of supports that were available and, in another instance, they said they were not aware of a specific case.  It would be good practice if, in advance of their attendance, the committee asked them to familiarise themselves with the few outstanding issues, and I understand it is only a few outstanding issues, with regard to the processing of concerns about the services that are in place.  We are clearly going to be asking questions and it would be useful if we let them know that.</p></speech>

I note in the correspondence reference to the passage of the residential institutions statutory fund (distribution) Bill.  I am not sure at what stage that is at or when to expect it in the House.  However, I note they say it will not impact on the operational process of Caranua.  Ultimately, our question to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the previous meeting was about the remaining funds for distribution and what happens there.  It is going to form a part of our discussion with them when they are before us.  If they can, through the clerk, furnish as much information as possible in advance of that, it would assist in our process of questioning.</p></speech>

We can write to them if that is the specific issue we want to address, and also in regard to our concerns on dealing satisfactorily with any valid applications for funding and supports that are required.  It is important that survivors be looked after.  Is it agreed to publish that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  First is No. 211C from an individual, dated 21 November 2020, raising further questions about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  At our meeting on 30 September, we agreed to request the correspondent&rsquo;s consent to forward a number of items to SBCI to respond to the matters raised.  I propose to request the correspondent&rsquo;s consent to send this additional information to SBCI so that it can also be addressed.  We need to point out to SBCI that we have not received a reply to our previous correspondence, which would have gone out very shortly after that meeting on 30 September.  We will seek an immediate reply.  Deputy MacSharry had an interest in this issue.</p></speech>

I have an issue with the corporation.  This was established for SMEs.  In this instance, it certainly highlights a failing in the rules because I do not think it captures the spirit of where we were coming from with the SBCI, in that a company that has a substantial foreign holding is given &euro;20 million to pay off a loan from a foreign bank.</p><p>In pursuing this matter previously, I raised it before this committee and I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has also looked into the matter. I know that in responses to parliamentary questions, the view taken, and these are my words paraphrasing it, was that an Irish company had its lunch eaten by another company, but the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, operated within the rules.  It may well have operated within the rules, but it did not capture the spirit of the intentions under which it was established.  A sum of &euro;20 million to a company that was operating abroad, which I am sure is a very reputable company, and good luck to it, certainly was not where we were coming from.  It is something that we should look into, if only to identify the fact that the terms of reference or the regulations and guidelines that underpin the establishment of the SBCI were flawed to the extent that the money did not go to where we intended it to go, which was to the SMEs.</p></speech>

My memory of it is that 50% of it is publicly funded and 50% is funded by the private sector.  The Deputy is correct to state that the funding was intended for SMEs, and Irish SMEs, but this correspondence appears to indicate that a substantial part of it did not end up there.</p></speech>

Essentially, it states that a huge amount of money that we were told was going to be directed to SMEs, which form a very important part of our economy, was actually used to bolster the balance sheet, repay a loan, pay dividends to shareholders and provide significant liquidity to a foreign-based parent company.  According to the correspondence, only 7% of what was loaned to BIFSL, essentially by the Irish taxpayer, was deployed into the Irish SME market.  That is very substantial and I agree with the proposal that has been made.  However, I think it would also be prudent for the committee to ask the Department of Finance for its response in respect of all of this.  At the end of the day we are dealing with Irish taxpayers' money, so it would be appropriate to ask the Department of Finance for comment on this matter.  I would also like to put on the record that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is potentially a very important body, has not responded to this committee on the issue as yet, and that is not acceptable practice.  I agree that we should write to the corporation again.</p></speech>

The whole idea with this fund, was that where commercial banks were not an option for some SMEs, this would ensure that we had a strong indigenous base in that small to medium sector, which is incredibly important and one of the bigger employers, if it is looked at collectively.  This is an extremely important fund and it is not exclusively made up of public money, but there is a large portion of it that is made up of public money.  The correspondent has certainly convinced me of his own bona fides in terms of the research that he has done, and this is exactly the kind of thing that is very useful when it is brought to our attention.  In addition, is there a particular Department to which the SBCI responds, and if so, we should write to that Department also.  I would also like to hear from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the interaction that his office has with the SBCI on this matter, and specifically whether the interaction is through the Department or is direct with the corporation.</p></speech>

It is under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  One of the significant developments in the past year is that the corporation has carried out a strategic review of its operations and it has published the results of that review, which are available.  This year, 2020, is the first year going forward from that review, so the corporation is making some changes in its mode of operation and there has been some paying down of the borrowing, which I believe was borrowing from Germany, so some of that has been repaid.  It is involved not just in the first line of activity, which is lending to SMEs who were having difficulty in accessing the market, but also in providing funding in the context of Brexit.  That is being funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There has been quite a shift in the organisation and it is perhaps timely for the committee to invite it to attend a meeting.  We have certainly dealt with this correspondent previously and we have followed up on matters that he has brought to our attention in the course of each audit.</p></speech>

We can include it on the list when we are moving the next item on the agenda, which is the work programme.</p> <p>  That concludes the correspondence, and we now move on to the work programme for the months ahead.  Some of our upcoming engagements are displayed on the screens.  Tomorrow we will be launching our report on NAMA's 2019 financial statement and also the Report No. 109 of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which concerns Project Nantes.</p> <p>  On 9 and 10 December, we will have further engagement over two days with the Department of Justice and the Prison Service.  This doubles the time that we have to examine the accounts, and we have already agreed going forward that we will try and use that approach rather than trying to cram all the work into the one day.  We then have one public engagement left before the end of the year, which takes place on 17 December, when Caranua, which has been discussed today, will appear before the committee.</p> <p>  There are a number of engagements provisionally scheduled for January 2021, which the members can see listed before them.  We will ask that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is included in that.  On 14 January, it is proposed that we examine the Office of Government Procurement 2019 appropriation account, and on 20 and 21 January, it is proposed that we examine the HSE's 2019 financial statement, with a focus on the awarding of Government grants to agencies, which are referred to as section 38 and 39 agencies, which Deputy Burke, who is now absent, has raised a number of times, and about which a number of members are concerned.  We will also look at agency costs and value for money.  On the second day, we will focus on the integrated financial management and procurement system and capital expenditure.  On Thursday, 28 January, it is proposed that we examine the 2019 financial statements of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  </p> <p>  There are also a number of other engagements suggested for February 2021.  On 3 and 4 February, it is proposed that we examine the 2019 appropriation account for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and focus on chapter 9 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the remediation of landfill sites and the expenditure related to the national broadband plan.  On 11 February, it is proposed that we examine the National Shared Services Office, in particular, chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the implementation of financial management of shared services.</p> <p>  Are members happy with the work programme as it stands?  Yes.  There are have also been a few additions to the programme.  I think RT&Eacute; has been added to the list of organisations engaging with the committee as part of the draft work programme.  If it has not been added to the list, I propose that we add it to the programme.</p> <p>  For the benefit of Deputy Carthy who was temporarily absent, we are discussing the draft work programme, and he will find a list of proposed engagements on the screen in front of him.  One of the Departments we are considering engaging with is the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and the Media, and I have suggested that we add RT&Eacute; to the list of engagements for the new year.</p></speech>

It is an organisation that has a lot of money to spend on PR.  I am just not sure whether it is spending the rest of its money on delivering, so it might be useful to do that.  An important body that could be useful also, and there is not necessarily an urgency about it, is Bord Bia.  In a post-Brexit world, Bord Bia could be very important.

It was running from 1971 until the middle of the 1990s.  Effectively, it was guaranteeing credit.  There were claims paid out under the guarantee and then there was a process of reclaiming those.

We have suggested to the Department that it bring in legislation to get rid of the account because effectively there are some balances that are not recovered and it is very unlikely that they will be recovered, and the Department accepts that.  I believe the figure is about &euro;22 million that has not been recovered and it is very unlikely at this stage to be recovered so there is no point in maintaining the account but it is still there and therefore we have to audit it every year.</p></speech>

Could he give a brief explainer on the local loans fund and the heritage fund, because depending on his answer it might be of interest to us to put them on the work programme.  Others are the sundry moneys deposit account and the State property miscellaneous deposits account.  I was unsure about the basis of NSCDA Operations Limited.  A final one is the hepatitis C accounts.  I can see that a number of those are still in operation.  Are they still operational accounts?</p></speech>

All of them are operational accounts, some bigger and some smaller than others.  I think I did a note a couple of years ago for the previous committee on some of these accounts.  It was brief explainers of what they are.  Of the ones the Deputy has mentioned, the sundry moneys is probably the biggest one.  That is just a holding account.  When moneys are collected it is likely that they will go to the Exchequer but once they go into the Exchequer they cannot be taken out unless there is power in law to take them out.  There is a question mark over whether some moneys are properly receivable into the Exchequer so they are held in sundry moneys.</p></speech>

It was for the provision of loans to local authorities and for the recovery of those.  The heritage fund is under whatever it is called now - the Department responsible for heritage.  Again, that is a small fund.  I would have to refresh my memory on the scale of operation of it but it is a grant giver.  </p> <p>  NSCDA is a subsidiary of Sport Ireland.  It operates some of the facilities in Abbotstown.  Aspects of it are run on a commercial or quasi-commercial basis.  If the committee wanted to examine those, it could bring in Sport Ireland and NSCDA and they could be examined together.</p> <p>  On the hepatitis C accounts, I did a chapter a couple of years ago in respect of that.  I can get the Deputy a copy of it.  It explains the structure.  They are very complicated accounts in the way they operate.  What I tried to do with the chapter was to give an overview of it but there are persons affected by the hepatitis C scandal who are still in receipt of funds in certain ways.  Obviously, it is not operating on anything like the scale it did a number of years back.  One of the things that was significant when I was doing the chapter was a scheme to actually cure hepatitis C and there does seem to have been a lot of success with that.</p></speech>

It very rarely happens but sometimes it does and that becomes State property.  That is an account to receive that, pending any reclaim of it.  Moneys are held there for a period but if, say, somebody is entitled to the proceeds of an estate or something, he or she can reclaim it from that account and after a period, if a tranche of money has not been reclaimed, it is then forfeited to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

The first item on the agenda is the scrutiny of EU legislative proposals.  The committee has already discussed a number of EU proposals and we are now required to make a formal decision on them.  One proposal has been circulated under schedule A, that is, COM (2020) 682 on adequate minimum wages in the European Union.  There are subsidiary concerns with that proposal.  That proposal, therefore, warrants further scrutiny and we will seek a briefing from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The following proposals have been circulated under schedule B, COM (2020) 135, 254, 267, 273, 295,139, 320, 321 and 374.  It is proposed that these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

All witnesses are joining us online.  </p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present, or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that one should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in a speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statement is potentially defamatory with regard to an identified person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction we give them.</p> <p>  We now move on to the opening statements, which have been circulated to all the members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. O'Brien from IBEC to make the opening statement.  Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 restrictions, I stress the need for all witnesses to limit their opening briefing to five minutes or less.</p></speech>

IBEC, as Ireland&rsquo;s largest business organisation, has since the UK referendum on 23 June 2016 been working intensively to support our member companies as they manage the ongoing uncertainty and plan for both the known and the potential disruption when the current transition period ends.</p> <p>  The central priority of the IBEC Brexit campaign has and will continue to be to provide our members with clear and actionable guidance in preparation for 1 January.  We have delivered this through a comprehensive suite of planning documents, a broad range of technical and political seminars and events as well as a whole range of insights and expertise from our specialist staff.</p><p>We have a large number of staff, both at IBEC level and through all our trade associations, working almost continuously and directly on Brexit.  In line with the expected impact of Brexit, this campaign has focused on four central themes: trade in goods; trade in services; the all-island economy and the implementation of the protocol, which is a key issue for business; and the labour market. </p><p> IBEC has held an extensive series of virtual events and briefings to provide practical guidance and advice to members on the range of critical issues we believe they will face.  As part of our programme, since September we have hosted dedicated sessions on customs, trade and VAT preparations, international data transfers, a range of broader business readiness issues, the UK land bridge and direct routes to the Continent from a shipping perspective, and the all-island economy.  The campaign has collaborated closely with a range of key stakeholders and decision makers in Dublin, London and Brussels.  These include the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Transport, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Data Protection Commission, the Department of Foreign Affairs and, outside Ireland, the UK Government and the European Commission.  In total, since September last, over 2,000 IBEC business members have engaged with these sessions.  It has been very broad and extensive.</p><p> We must remind ourselves that earlier this year, on 31 January, only the political Brexit took place.  The economic Brexit will take place on 1 January.  The transition period is ending in less than four weeks.  The UK will depart the EU Single Market and customs union.  As of today, and given how little time there is left, many business still do not have clear information on the trading conditions that will apply for goods and services between Ireland and Britain from 1 January 2021.  We welcome the fact that the EU and the UK continue to engage positively in difficult negotiations on their future relationship, including on the necessity of a basic trade agreement.  Our concern is that now there is insufficient time for businesses to adjust to the outcomes of a prospective agreement, if indeed it is reached.  This transition period was presented to business as a period for accustoming to the known changes of Brexit.  I remind the committee it was intended to commence on 29 March 2019, then 31 October 2019, before eventually beginning on 31 January 2020.  While business prepares for the known effects of the UK departing the EU customs union, the transition period has instead continued to be a negotiation period.  It has left businesses with no lead time to implement significant changes and continued uncertainty rather than the promised clarity.</p><p> Irish businesses, from multinational companies to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, have been working diligently and are committed to ensuring they are as prepared as possible for the end of the Brexit transition period, in terms of engaging both with the EU and the UK.  However, it must be acknowledged and understood that business has been preparing for the unknown in uniquely challenging circumstances, with the dual threat of the continued, extraordinary uncertainty posed by Brexit combined with the evolving consequences of Covid-19.  In addition, there remain significant gaps in clarity on the rules which will apply to businesses trading goods with Britain from 1 January next.</p><p> Despite its limitations, the bare bones future relationship agreement under negotiation would be vital for Irish business.  First and foremost, it would crucially avoid the EU and UK for the first time trading on WTO terms and the subsequent introduction of tariffs and quotas.  If such a deal is not agreed, it would be a further blow to fragile confidence, reduce economic growth in the short term materially and impair potential recovery in future years.  Until there is clarity on whether tariffs will be introduced, businesses cannot fully prepare for the future.  With the UK Government&rsquo;s introduction of the Internal Market Bill, we have seen that the full implementation of the withdrawal agreement and protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland cannot be taken for granted.  Members of the committee will be aware of its vital importance for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, while also safeguarding the integrity of the EU Single Market.  The protocol is critical for business by ensuring the continuation of the common travel area and protecting North-South co-operation towards the advancement of initiatives of mutual interest on our shared island.  As of today, people, communities and businesses both North and South do not have the assurances they need that the protocol will be fully implemented and, crucially, operational by 1 January.</p><p> Over recent months IBEC&rsquo;s work to support contingency planning has intensified.  We have produced comprehensive guidance for business and have hosted numerous events, as I mentioned, providing a range of detailed expert insight into the complex issues that will need to be managed from 1 January.  While our members are very aware of the risks and are planning accordingly, it would be wrong to suggest that business, or the wider economy for that matter, could ever be fully ready for the profound, overnight changes that the end of the transition period will bring.  Despite the best efforts of business, successfully adjusting in a short timeframe, when so many specifics are still not known, to a radically new trading and economic relationship with one of our closest trading partners is neither possible nor realistic, particularly for companies in the most exposed sectors.  What we know is that the imposition of very high WTO tariffs on certain products, combined with additional customs and regulatory barriers, would cause major trade and economic disruption.</p><p> The political brinksmanship involved in setting non-credible deadlines, both in the past and in the future relationship negotiations, has already cost the business community.  Additional collateral damage must be avoided.  While most larger companies have comprehensive plans in place, and IBEC's member companies are as prepared as we can expect them to be for 1 January, we are concerned that a number of SMEs are still working to be prepared.  Despite major information campaigns, some companies have yet to register for the economic operators registration and identification, EORI, number and take the further steps that will be necessary to continue to trade post Brexit.</p><p> While IBEC&rsquo;s work to support contingency planning will continue, it must be stressed that significant Government and EU intervention will be required to protect jobs and businesses should an agreement not be reached.  The Government must bear the ensuing uncertainty in mind and ensure that adequate and agile supports are available to businesses in early January and beyond as the practical consequences of Brexit become apparent.  These supports must prioritise and be quickly available to the worst affected sectors to offset the economic consequences of Brexit. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#B00500"><p>We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a civil society organisation representing approximately 700,000 workers across the island of Ireland.  While we are discussing the issue of readiness for Brexit, I wish to emphasise at the outset the importance of ensuring full adherence to the Good Friday Agreement and the European Convention on Human Rights in a future EU-UK agreement, if there is one.  With regard to the matter at hand, I acknowledge the work to date that has been done by the Department of Foreign Affairs, civil servants and stakeholders, including many businesses, to prepare, but I also wish to express concern, as the Taoiseach did last week, about the complacency of some businesses that have not prepared.  Last Friday&rsquo;s Enterprise Ireland survey revealed that only 42% of businesses believe they are ready.</p> <p>  It is clear that while the pandemic is having the greatest impact on employment, Brexit has major consequences for many workers.  The Department of Finance estimates that a no-deal outcome would increase unemployment by 0.25% next year - that is up to 10,000 workers losing their jobs as a direct consequence of Brexit.  We believe, and all the indicators show, that the impact would be concentrated in agrifood, traditional manufacturing and financial services.  Those sectors have been relatively less affected by Covid-19, but they are also sectors with strong regional footprints, with agrifood and traditional manufacturing in rural areas and financial services in urban areas.</p> <p>  Congress has therefore put forward a number of measures to prepare workers.  First, we believe there should be a genuine short-time working scheme to support the jobs and incomes of workers whose firms are vulnerable but viable.  This should be modelled on the most effective schemes in other European countries, schemes that support a high level of net pay and, hence, aggregate demand and upskilling.</p><p>Recently, we proposed a retraining programme for workers at risk.  Last spring, the OECD highlighted that Irish businesses provide less training to employees than other OECD countries where only one in ten manufacturing workers in Ireland took part in training in 2019, compared to one in four in Sweden and Finland.  </p><p> Third, there should be a job transition programme to help workers made redundant find re-employment.  This should be modelled on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGAF, which has helped more than 10,000 workers in Ireland since 2007.  We believe these complementary measures could ensure workers are better prepared.  </p><p> What would enhance their chances of success is a deeper, indeed a proper, social dialogue between employers and unions on these matters.  It is widely acknowledged that Germany&rsquo;s short-time work scheme is the model to emulate; the IMF calls it the gold standard.  What is less often acknowledged is that what makes this scheme truly effective are the sectoral level collective agreements that accompany it.  Germany&rsquo;s official scheme supports 60% of net pay, but this can be, and is, accompanied by sectoral agreements that support 75% to 100% of net pay and facilitate restructuring.  Consequently, firms and workers emerge better placed for recovery.  The OECD also points out that workers covered by collective agreements are one third more likely to take part in training than those who are not, and that the most effective job transition programmes are those based on social dialogue.  </p><p> Social dialogue, in short, can ensure that businesses, employees and communities are ready for Brexit, and indeed for other major employment challenges we must address over the coming years, including climate change, automation, and digitalisation, which should all form the basis of a much better social dialogue model.  The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, said she is "a firm believer in the value of social dialogue between employers and unions, the people who know their sector &hellip; the best."  </p></speech>

Is mise Tom &Oacute; Muireadhaigh, poitig&eacute;ir as D&uacute;n na nGall agus liom inniu t&aacute; J.J. O'Hara, fearr gn&oacute; san earn&aacute;il turas&oacute;ireachta agus teicneola&iacute;ochta as Contae Liatroma.</p> <p>  Border Communities Against Brexit was formed approximately four years ago as we recognised the threat of Brexit to the economic and social well-being of the communities on both sides of the Border.  As representatives of civic society, we have lobbied and highlighted the many issues which concern us about Brexit in the EU, in Dublin, London and the USA.  We have had several meetings with our own Government, with Michel Barnier, Guy Verhofstadt, Nancy Pelosi among many others.</p> <p>  A common thread runs through the things we will discuss today.  There is a lack of clarity and inconsistency in information on Brexit.  Brexit has already happened.  Britain left the EU, the transition period now ends on 31 December and there is no tangible difference so far and less understanding of what will happen in January.  Many important deadlines have passed and thus far there has been no real change at employee or business level.  This has led to a certain complacency, disinterest and disconnect between employees, businesses and Brexit.  There is a strongly held belief that there will be some form of deal and that all issues relating to Brexit will be resolved at a business macro level or government level, but there is little engagement at a micro level and little understanding at SME or employee level.</p> <p>  Information or detail about the implications of Brexit for supply routes, importation, exportation and associated paperwork and bureaucracy is seriously deficient.  This obviously comes from the lack of clarity at EU and British Government levels as to what form of deal may take place, if one does, and what effect that will have on the day-to-day running of business.  There is an expectation of extra paperwork and possible shortages in supplies but little is clear.  Furthermore, there is a serious evidence of a lack of common understanding of the North of Ireland protocol as already agreed.  British Government action in respect of a breech of the international agreement has led to a level of further disengagement and caused further difficulties.  It has also worsened the lack of clarity among employees and business around administrative details post Brexit.  This requires urgent attention in the form of training and financial supports for businesses and employees, to help understand the impact of Brexit on day-to-day business.</p> <p>  We heard about the economic consequences of Brexit.  This year it was overtaken by the economic consequences of the pandemic.  We need people to re-engage at a business and employee levels about Brexit&rsquo;s consequences.  It will have an economic impact and it has a potential impact on job security.  It is incumbent on business and Government to inform employees about their own financial planning, because of the potential impact that Brexit could have on their job security in SMEs and larger businesses.  </p> <p>  On community preparedness, the level of integration across the Border of families, communities, sports teams, schools and community groups has been largely misunderstood and underestimated until Brexit.  There is a widespread expectation among those groups that the free movement of people will continue and as such much of that integration will continue seamlessly.   However, there is a fear in Border communities where Mr. O'Hara and I operate that the British Government might renege on agreements around free movement as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  Their recent actions on the North of Ireland protocol have seriously undermined trust.</p> <p>  There is also a fear due to lack of knowledge about cross-Border funding and PEACE funding for Border area community initiatives.  The lack of clarity and constant moving of goal posts has worsened that.  We need clarity and information.  There is a very short time for community groups and those living on either side of the Border to implement changes.  </p> <p>  On business, various outcomes are possible and each requires different planning.  All business on the island of Ireland is under great pressure from uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the current pandemic.  We expected to see funding supports rolled out across the country.  We understand the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, has dried up.  The partner financial institutions tell businesses there is very little funding left for business.</p> <p>  There is evidence of great deprivation in recent years because of the Border&rsquo;s presence.  There was some economic resurgence since the peace process but there is urgent need for investment in infrastructure and financial supports in this area.  Under the Border Enterprise Development Fund, BEDF, we expected around &euro;400 million of investment in the region, but only around &euro;15 million has been delivered to date.  The Border regions have suffered massive financial hardships and lack of growth due to the presence of the Border.  Efforts to revitalise sustainable communities in the area have been damaged by the pandemic.  </p> <p>  Anecdotal evidence from newspaper reports tell of youth unemployment among those under 25 years at more than 40% in Border areas.  This is unsustainable for any community.  It is impossible for us to sustain and grow communities in this area where there are such high levels of youth unemployment.  We implore the Government to seek strategic investment to rebrand tourism in the area, particularly in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim to revitalise the industry in these areas and to maintain jobs for our young people so that we can maintain our communities into the future.  </p> <p>  The elephant in the room is the threat of Internal Market Bill in that goods produced in Britain must be available on the market in North of Ireland.  Depending on the nature of the international deals agreed by the British Government, this could include chlorinated chicken, GM foods and other goods which are not acceptable to the European Single Market.  There is a risk of these goods leaking into the EU market area through the Border.  We need clarity on whether that will be protected.  Will some sort of customs border be established on the island of Ireland, which would be against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement?  What protections will be put in place if we cannot guarantee the safety of the market of the North of Ireland in the South, we could see Ireland as a whole become some sort of annex to the EU Single Market?  That must be addressed.</p></speech>

Throughout 2019, congress, in its own right, took several initiatives to speak to various Departments about developing a comprehensive short-time working scheme that would not be just a reflection of the current scheme, but would be one focused on a Brexit scenario involving companies that were going to be in difficulty for some time but had all the prospects of being viable.  As I said in my submission, this would mirror the scheme in Germany.  How could we develop that in Ireland?</p> <p>  I visited a number of Departments, on one occasion in concert with IBEC.  Unfortunately, the response from those Departments was quite slow.  There was a lack of speed in taking ownership of the issue.  I had to visit a number of Departments before I got anybody to take ownership of having a discussion about it.  Eventually, I did.  When we got to that stage, there was little enthusiasm for developing it until the very end.  Covid took over then and we had no substantive conversations.  In principle, I understand that the Departments of Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are now more inclined to explore the possibility of a German-type model being introduced in Ireland.  This is about keeping contact with the workplace, developing and upskilling people and having workers ready in the same employment when the company becomes viable again.  The discussions have been slow.  I was disappointed by the effort we had to put in to get people to take it on board and talk to us.  I am also disappointed that we have not reached any agreement by now.  We should have done so given what will happen by the end of the year.</p></speech>

We do not really have the details of how the Brexit contingency fund, as set out in the budget, will operate in practice.  We also have concerns about the EU Brexit fund.  Obviously, it is crucial for us to get our proportionate share given that Ireland will have some of the most affected business sectors of any economy in Europe.</p> <p>  I fully endorse Ms King's comments on the need for social dialogue, particularly in the context of the short-term working measures we regard as crucial.  We have been calling for that since long before the Covid pandemic.  I know we have again got caught up on a roof in the middle of a storm trying to fix this.  We have not used the past six or eight months well even after we introduced the Covid emergency wage-subsidy supports.</p> <p>  We have been calling for an export credit insurance scheme for a number of years.  With Brexit we know that companies will need to diversify out of the UK.  Covid is also making that more difficult.  People in SMEs in particular cannot travel to meet customers or potential customers in Europe in the same way that their competitors in other countries can.  Their aviation is operating better than ours.  They can get into a car or take a train.  Our companies are feeling particularly remote and disadvantaged at the moment.  Having an export credit scheme is crucial.  We have been engaging with Government for a number of years on that, but it has not been brought into operation.</p></speech>

We have been developing tourism and technology under industry 4.0.  It is a development to look at new projects under youth unemployment.  It is focused on young people and where new technologies within Europe are being developed.  One fund was funded by the BEDF.  The total funding for that was &euro;15 million and this should be increased.  Originally, &euro;400 million from the Brexit fund was to go towards industry.  This has not happened and only &euro;15 million has come out in the past 12 months.  To make a real investment in our young people, we need to develop the brand tourism and technology.  We need people for the future, young people who can go into a new market.  Ireland is lagging behind by five years in technology.  Industry for technology, robotics, cobotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D printing and 4D printing are all areas students in the Border region can capitalise on.  We have six colleges on both sides of the Border that can educate the staff and encourage new companies to come to these areas.</p></speech>

Non-Irish-born EU citizens are not covered under the free movement of people directive and it is not addressed in the current withdrawal agreement or the Northern Ireland protocol.  There is no guarantee of free movement of people.  For example, if a building contractor is working on both sides of the Border and has a Polish employee, nothing allows for the free movement of that employee across the Border, North and South.  There is an expectation of some bureaucratic arrangement being put in place, but that has not been established yet.</p> <p>  People working on either side of the Border are finding it extremely difficult to get mortgages through the banking and financial institutions because they are not applying same multiple of salary to people who work and live on either side of the Border.  For example, a couple living in Donegal where one works in Derry and one works in Donegal do not get the same multiple applied to their mortgage application and they are having serious difficulty in obtaining funding for mortgages.</p></speech>

We are also conscious that other legislation will be needed, particularly on the wage subsidy supports to support the Brexit-ready firms.  There is probably a parallel approach on this for now.</p></speech>

ICTU has highlighted previously the danger of a race to the bottom and I note Mr. Michel Barnier's comments that competing on social and environmental standards, rather than on skills, innovation and quality, leads only to "a race to the bottom that puts workers, consumers, and the planet on the losing side".  How do we avoid a race to the bottom after Brexit?</p></speech>

Workers' rights are one of the key issues under that heading and if the UK Government wishes to legislate for and introduce its own suite of measures relating to workers' rights- a desire it has expressed previously - that will put enormous pressure on companies trading with the UK, post Brexit and will, in turn, mean pressure on workers.  If the UK has lesser terms and conditions, pressure will fall on those companies in Ireland with a trading relationship with the UK to emulate those terms and conditions on a labour costs basis.  In my judgment, that has huge potential to cause great fractiousness between workers and employers.  It will also probably heighten industrial dispute issues.  It will be a new dawn in one sense because while the UK was in Europe, the Single Market meant we never had to deal with such issues because the playing pitch was level.  If it becomes uneven, that will be very fractious from our point of view.  Again, I must say I am disappointed that nobody at central level is having any discussion with us about this.  We do not know whether an agreement will be reached this week which will avoid the consequences outlined by Senator Gavan, but if there is no agreement there is huge potential for fractiousness in the Irish labour market.</p></speech>

This is the most difficult negotiating point between the EU and the UK.  The level playing field is not only about state aid and business subsidies but also about social and environmental standards and standards for workers.  The EU has made it clear, with the unanimous support of member states, that there will not be an overall agreement without agreement on this level playing field and all of the related issues.  This is something that we strongly support and we hope that there will be agreement.  Obviously, in the event of no deal, there is quite a lot of concern about the consequences.  The EU has made clear that a future trading relationship is dependent on a level playing field with regard to social and environmental standards.</p></speech>

I only have 20 seconds left so I will ask the representative from Border Communities Against Brexit a simple question.  He said that there is a serious information deficit with regard to the implications of Brexit for supply routes, importation, exportation and the associated paperwork and bureaucracy.  Are we facing chaos on 1 January 2021?</p></speech>

Until we get clarity on exactly what is required and the day-to-day changes that Brexit will imply at a business level, we are potentially facing chaos.  We do not know if imports will come in freely or whether we will be able to export freely.  We do not know what level of paperwork will be required or what VAT or other levies may be applied.  We are potentially facing chaos because of the lack of instruction and clarity less than 30 days out from Brexit.</p></speech>

This is serious testimony from people who really know what they are talking about because they are at the coalface.  Let us hope the Government responds this week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#E00700"><p>I welcome our guests to this meeting.  As Senator Gavan has just said, the word chaos has been used.  T&aacute; s&eacute; uaf&aacute;sach, gan dabht.  I have been alarmed over this for a long time.  It has been obscured by the fog of Covid-19 but this is just horrific.  There is no other way to describe it.  A deal would be terrible but a no-deal outcome would be absolutely unbearable.</p> <p>  I am struck by a lot of what has been said here, including the fact that 42% of companies feel they are not prepared.  How can any company be prepared when it does not know what to prepare for?  The fact that more than 40% of companies are not engaged is quite concerning.  I agree that social dialogue is hugely important, as argued by all of the contributors this morning.  I was struck by what the representatives from Border Communities Against Brexit said about the level of integration across the Border of families, communities, sports teams, schools and community groups being largely misunderstood and underestimated.  That is an extremely powerful statement and Brexit has the potential to impact in a very negative way.</p> <p>  I know that Ministers and officials across all Departments have been working extremely hard on this for quite a while.  They are as frustrated as anyone else at the lack of clarity at this stage, with only a small number of days remaining until 1 January.  The transport of goods across the land bridge is one issue of major concern.  Some efforts have been made to develop direct links to the Continent.  A lot of our exports go to the UK but the importance of the back haul from Europe should not be underestimated.  Many companies use the land bridge and bring goods back into the UK from Europe as a way of financing their operations.  How might that be affected?  We do not know because if there is a deal, we do not know what will it be like.  I am not sure what the Government here can do but I do agree that workers and companies need support.  </p> <p>  The one word that came through in all of the presentations was uncertainty.  The lack of clarity at this very late stage is difficult and it is very hard to know what questions to ask of our witnesses.  We are operating in a kind of vacuum and do not know what kind of outcome will present itself.  I hope that some agreement is reached but if not, what will the WTO rules mean?</p></speech>

I invite the witnesses to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#E00900"><p>I thank Deputy Stanton for the questions.  I do not think we are going to have chaos on 1 January but I do think we have a lot of challenges facing us next year.  The issues that have been mentioned around logistics, direct shipping and the land bridge are all of concern to business and we continue to work on them.  Many of our companies have de-risked the land bridge option completely by putting direct shipping options in place.</p> <p>  On the specific question of what no-deal means for businesses, there are two issues.  First, all of the other issues that still need to be worked out between the EU and UK become a lot more difficult without the platform of a bare-bones trade agreement.  We know that there are lots of details still to be worked out but if we get that bare-bones trade deal in the coming weeks, it allows us to continue very positive engagement in the weeks and months ahead.  Second, if we are facing tariffs for our food and drink industry, for example, we are looking at something in the region of &euro;1.5 billion in additional costs on Irish business.  In some sectors and sub-sectors, that will be an unbearable cost.  Right now, less than four weeks out, how are companies to price their products commercially for the UK market when they do not know whether tariffs will apply?</p><p>Those are the big issues with which businesses are dealing right now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#F00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy that it is extraordinarily difficult to make any prediction in the absence of knowing whether there will be a thin, bare bones agreement.  That will be instructive in terms of how all these matters are dealt with.  I do not disagree with the projection made by Mr. O'Brien in terms of how catastrophic this could be for certain industries, areas and regions.  For instance, 83% of those who work in the food processing and manufacturing sector work outside city centres.  There are significant challenges in getting to a place whereby those jobs can quickly or easily be replaced in their current locations such that workers are re-employed.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the risk is heightened in terms of tariffs, costs outlay and all of that.  It would lessen the chances of those companies remaining viable and the workers continuing to be employed.  All of those benchmarks become very problematic in the case of a no-deal Brexit yet, three and a half weeks away from the date of Brexit, we do not know whether we will have some sort of an agreement.  That really emphasises the difficulty in this area.  I think the Deputy is right to say that the significant uncertainty around this issue is one of the key problems we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#F00300"><p>I thank our guests.  I am on quorum duty in the convention centre, so I may have to dash if a bell rings.  From the Government perspective, &euro;5.4 billion has been set aside in the budget as a contingency and conscious of the fact that there are many uncertainties and that the Government has to be prepared for various eventualities to which we would have to respond.  One of the important things is to try to identify the areas in which we may use that funding.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray commented that credit has been exhausted.  Is that a problem just around the Border region or is it prevalent throughout the country?  I read comments to the contrary which stated that businesses did not wish to take up the credit.  If that is an issue, I am sure it can be addressed.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree with Ms King about the need for a significant shift in education and training.  To what extent are the institutions responding to that need in terms of employers investing more in training, but also in terms of education institutions devoting more of their time in a flexible way to people who are already in the workforce?  Is that happening?</p> <p>  There is a fear that there will be disruption in Dover and other crossing points.  To what extent have employers tested the contingency arrangements that are in place to find other routes?  Has that been stress-tested to any significant degree?</p></speech>

The evidence we have is certainly regional-based.  I cannot comment on the national picture.  I have personal experience of applying for the SBCI and being told the funds were exhausted.  My experience in Donegal is that it was exhausted, but I was led to believe that the financial institutions involved were talking about their national pictures.  They did not tell me there was a regional fund for each section, area or province; it was that the SBCI funds had been exhausted.</p></speech>

We checked with SBCI and the SBCI loan fund of one of the major banks had been exhausted.  The SBCI loan scheme was meant to be a support for companies in need of assistance.  It was 80% guaranteed by the Government.  The major bank in Ireland did not have funds in its facility to issue loans to businesses.  That is a major problem, especially in the context of Brexit.  We see three possible scenarios in terms of Brexit.  I find it difficult to believe that any company can be ready for any of those three scenarios.  Support is needed.  If the banks that are meant to be supporting the SBCI scheme cannot fund it at this stage, three weeks from a deadline, that is very worrying for us.</p></speech>

It publishes its data on a regular basis now, which is very useful.  What we have observed is probably a varying take-up across the various schemes.  Obviously, there are currently a range of schemes available, including Brexit-targeted schemes and Covid schemes.  What we have found from our members in recent weeks is that there is very strong demand for longer-term loan funds, particularly the seven to ten year loan funds with lower interest rates and some flexibility around repayment terms.  We are aware of the official numbers that have been published but we also understand that the pipeline is very active.  On some of the credit schemes that are available, there is probably a need for a reallocation of resources and an increased allocation into credit financing generally in terms of Brexit supports.  The take-up of some schemes has been low.  It is important that we recognise there is varying take-up across the various schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#F00700"><p>I will deal with the question relating to education.  One of the key components of attempting to put in place a short-time work agreement, for instance, is training.  The take-up of training will be low if people believe that it will mean lower income for them.  The whole idea of having a comprehensive short-time working agreement is that people can train and their income will be covered under the agreement.  Indeed, in spring the OECD recommended that Ireland should introduce a statutory training leave for workers.  If a model is to be developed whereby workers will be reskilled either because of a diversification route a company is going to pursue and take up or in order to retrain and reskill for alternative employment while still connected with the workplace, we will have to ensure it is opportune for people to take it up and that they feel they can do so in the context of their income.  At the moment, we are not in discussions on that issue.  We should be in those discussions and much further along in the development of that model.  The new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has an opportunity to focus on all of this.  It is currently having a very good look at the issue through a review process, for instance, on the whole area of apprenticeship training and so on.  As members are aware, apprenticeships have expanded far beyond the traditional craft worker and construction routes.  There are all sorts of other apprenticeships available, but they have not been developed to the level they ought to be developed.  Some of the structures are in place to allow us to develop a proper upskilling and retraining programme but those discussions should be much more advanced than they actually are.  One of the key things I hope the committee will recommend is that those discussions should happen and should be concluded fairly soon.</p></speech>

I echo the comments of Senator Gavan.  I am alarmed that we have a situation whereby IBEC is proposing an enterprise stabilisation fund or scheme, particularly for the food and drink sector, and ICTU is proposing a not dissimilar scheme in terms of a short-time work scheme, but there has been no progress from the Government.</p><p>We urgently need the Government to make progress.</p><p> I ask all three groups to articulate the chilling effect created by the pandemic and uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which was articulated this morning, on expansion, investment and pay plans into 2021.

What worries us in the Border communities is the fact that 45% of people under-25 are unemployed.  We have three groups here with a great knowledge of real people on the ground so I ask that we are allowed to make a joint submission to the committee that outlines a solution and delivery model to make real projects and outline the implications of Brexit on Border communities.  Unless we deal with the problem ourselves, stand up and go forward, a solution is not going to happen.  We have to consider deliverable solutions.  We have talked for the past four years.  It is shocking to have 45% of people under-25 unemployed but we believe this time next 27% of people aged between 25 and 55 years will be unemployed and the only way forward is to come up with deliverable plans.</p></speech>

We view all of these issues through the K shape and see many sectors of the economy continuing to perform incredibly strongly.  The life sciences, technology and services sectors are all rapidly expanding, hiring and investing.  On the downside of the K, it is very hard to disentangle Covid from Brexit right now and so many companies are dealing with similar challenges.  I have seen previous research that indicated that the Brexit impact on individuals will be quite different from the Covid impact on individuals.  In many cases, those people will be in the same regions and homes.  I mean we could have someone working in tourism and someone working in food processing, for example.  I am quite concerned about the regional impacts.  Overall, the economy will perform quite strongly next year.  There is going to be an unleashing of activity.  We know that households have saved &euro;1 billion extra every single month since the start of this crisis but that does not mean individuals, many companies and many regions are not going to be left behind because I think they will.  The phenomenon of this year, despite what we have seen around Europe, is that the GDP of the Irish economy may not fall that much because some sectors are doing really well while others are not.  It is a parallel economy that we have never seen before.</p></speech>

First, there will be some turnover in the economy in areas like retail, and in some parts of accommodation and food.  All one has to do is look across at the UK to see what is happening to the retail sector and some of that is going to happen in Ireland.  Let us take a regional town where employment depends on a good manufacturing industry located on the outskirts, has solid retail outlets in the town and has some accommodation and food outlets in the town.  Those are some of the basic components of the economic activity in a small or medium-sized regional town.  If one presumes Brexit may cause turbulence in the manufacturing outlet located on the outskirts of the town, and the pandemic has affected retail and accommodation, then one is talking about a very bleak outlook for at least a number of years.  Therefore, one of the key pieces is to build on retraining and reskilling in order to have people prepared to enter the labour market albeit doing different jobs.  Unfortunately, Ireland is very low in terms of how we respond on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Stanton highlighted the issues as being clarity, uncertainty about the supply chain, market access and pricing impacts.  It is very hard to ask businesses anything when we say that they are not prepared for Brexit.  We have to acknowledge that we do not know what Brexit will mean for many businesses.  It is very hard to take a punt on investment when faced with complete uncertainty so I can understand the reticence of many businesses because Brexit is largely outside of their control.  Ireland is largely an export-led economy so we worry about the future that Brexit will deliver.</p> <p>  Can the IBEC delegation explain why we are having difficulty with implementing additional export credit insurance and making it more widely available, particularly to smaller businesses?  If not available, the businesses that did business with the UK will be forced to consider doing business outside of Ireland.  Language is also a big issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton said something about investment in other options and businesses trying to scope other options.  I must point out that in the past number of years there has been continuous talk about the potential development of Rosslare Europort, which has not happened and there has not been significant investment.  The latest talk is of a ferry service being provided by commercial concerns but not by Government.  I cannot understand why we are still in that position but we are.  We must consider the intent of the UK.  There is a very large political intent that I am sure none of us here understands, and the EU is struggling with that.</p><p>I read an interesting statistic last night that the UK metal window and door industry is twice the size of the UK fishing industry and yet fishing has been held up as a hostage in the Brexit negotiations, which might tell us something.  </p><p> Regarding the level playing field, I would have a concern about tax harmony in the EU in the future.  We have seen moves again to discuss Ireland's corporate tax rate.  That will be extremely important, particularly in light of a harder Brexit.  Also, what the Border gentlemen referenced with respect to the telling statistic of under 25s unemployment and the possibility of some UK customs would be disastrous for the island of Ireland.  As they rightly pointed out, it could cause an annexing of the whole Irish market and economy.  We have major problems.  None of us here has had a real input into Brexit.  We will have to wait and see what is the shape of a deal or no-deal.  Apart from Ms King's focus on short-time working, where are the opportunities in terms of a hard Brexit?  Is there anything we should be proactively doing now to consider the worst case scenario and what can we do to protect the Irish economy as we go forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#H00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising those questions and I am happy to comment on some of them.  At an overall level, what I see as the big challenge for the Irish economy from Brexit is risk to our competitiveness.  The benefits of the UK and all of us being in the Single Market and a customs union for a  period of decades have been very substantial for business and consumers.  The untangling of that, which will happen almost overnight, will bring many extra costs to doing business and, unfortunately, for the consumers and across the economy we will see that in all the logistics issues that were mentioned.  As I said, we are seeing a number of our companies derisking in opting for a direct shipping route but it all depends on the nature of the product.  Time to market times become longer in most cases when opting for a direct shipping route.  For some of the more perishable goods and depending on value and complexity of supply chains across the UK into EU, that will not always be possible.  Where companies can do it they are seeking to do it and may have already done it.  All these measures are bringing additional costs and that will be one of the underlying concerns for business.</p> <p>  On the competitiveness point, we are concerned we have not been able to progress an export credit insurance scheme, which we currently see in pretty much most other European countries.  We are not sure what the blockage is but it is a missing part of our artillery to help companies that need to diversify into new markets.  We would urgently ask the support of this committee to bring about that change of policy in government and get an export credit insurance scheme delivered.</p></speech>

Most business is opportunity led and, first and foremost, they must significantly identify where their market opportunities are.  We have the same problem in regional Waterford, as has been discussed on the Border.  I refer to the idea of  trying to identify opportunity and then having the workforce.  It is not always possible, particularly with the market changes in AI digitisation and globalisation, to upskill people to that extent.  Are there any other areas Ms King can highlight?  It is great to say upskilling but what sectors was she targeting when she referred to upskilling workers from the current employment to new employment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#H00400"><p>Every company will be faced, first, with the challenge of what is their in light of Brexit, who do they trade with and if a major component part of their trade is with the UK, can they continue that in a no Brexit scenario?  They have decisions to make.  In light of the possibility of a no Brexit, are they exploring diversification to new markets and, if they are, what does that require them to do?  There is the matter of the agility of their workforce to face up and quickly respond to new products they might have to produce for new markets.  I would not like to give the impression that State agencies have been silent throughout this.  State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia have been working extraordinarily hard with these companies and many of them have responded well to that work by getting themselves Brexit ready and having the agility within their workforce to respond to the possibility of diversification into new markets and so.</p> <p>  Mr. Feargal O'Brien referred to the issue of the risk to competitiveness.  If those companies decide they are best placed to continue to trade with the UK,  competitive issues come in if there is a no-deal Brexit.  That is where the race to the bottom starts.  Those companies will be forced to say  they need to be more competitiveness, that their labour costs, for instance, are too high compared to what is being done in the UK and the way companies can produce the same product for much less.  That pressure will come on the workforces and the companies in Ireland and that will have a ricochet effect on what companies will expect in terms of pay, labour costs and so on.  That is where the pinch point will be.  It would be wrong to give the impression that companies have not been involved in very key discussions with State agencies and that the Government has not been attempting over a number of years to help people to place themselves better to cope with Brexit but, from our perspective, the pinch point that will come will be as I have described.  </p> <p>  The point I have made throughout the discussion is that most companies will advise that reskilling, upskilling  and training workers is a positive thing to do but they will also point out that it costs money and investment.  In some cases they are afraid to make that investment because they might need that money in a post-Brexit scenario.  There are many component parts to this.  The uncertainty leads to the fact that we cannot answer all the questions but, from our point of view, education, upskilling, and retraining are never wasted and most companies would agree with that.  All the big pharma, chemical, medical devices companies are doing very good training.  Training is a complete part of their ongoing daily and weekly work.  The smaller medium sized businesses are not placed in the same order as those bigger companies.  Therefore, the State aid has to go into those to ensure they get everything they need to meet the agility that will be required in a post Brexit scenario.</p></speech>

I advise Deputy Shanahan we have run out time and I must move on.  I call Senator Ahearn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#H00600"><p>I thank our invited guests for their presentations.  A common feature in this process in recent years has been the need for clarity.  As previous speakers said, trying to ask the right questions is quite difficult.  In many ways we are still as confused now 30 days out as we were when we were three years out and the same questions apply today as they did then.  The amount of investment being put into being Brexit ready is positive, whether it be from the July stimulus package or the budget introduced in October, but that still does not resolve the issue of clarity for businesses, and having clarity is the key.</p> <p>  I have two questions, one for Mr. Feargal O'Brien of IBEC and one for Ms Patricia King.  Mr. O'Brien may be aware that a letter was issued by Revenue last week to businesses across the country on the arrangements for imports and exports that need to happen on 1 January next.  When we talk about having clarity and a lack of confusion, it works both ways.  Businesses can be as prepared as they want but there are issues involved for them when they receive a letter such as this one from Revenue.  There will be a requirement for them to submit trade notifications for outbound exports to ports.  The letter also states they would have to go back to the Revenue system again to declare when the export load had arrived at ports.  There are a number of requirements Revenue expects businesses to have to do on 1 January.  In fairness, it seems to have rolled back on one or two of them in terms of a second trader notification.</p><p>I am thinking of businesses in my constituency like Bulmers in Clonmel, which is part of the C&amp;C Group and exports in high volumes.  A letter such as that would have significant ramifications in terms of being prepared in January.  Has IBEC received concerns over the letter being sent out to businesses that export to the UK?  Have businesses been in contact with the witnesses in terms of what is expected of them from Revenue's perspective?  We talk constantly about businesses having a Brexit team and weekly meetings.  Changes are happening all the time, depending on what happens in the UK in terms of the negotiations in Europe, but how can businesses possibly be prepared when something like this is thrown at them out of the blue by ourselves six weeks out from Brexit?  That question is for IBEC.</p><p> I have a question for Ms King as well.  Could she expand on the German short-time working scheme?  Have we done any research on how many people we expect would need it or would come under it next year?  Is there an estimated cost element to how much it would cost the State?  We talk about businesses not being as prepared as they should be for Brexit.  It has almost been forgotten about, and understandably so, for many reasons in recent months.  Are certain business sectors not as prepared as others for Brexit?  I think of the farming community and agribusinesses.  How can we support them to prepare for Brexit next month?</p></speech>

We are also a member of a customs consultative committee run by Revenue.  I might ask my colleague, Mr. Willoughby, to join us on this as he has been leading a lot of the detail on it for IBEC.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Willoughby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#J00300"><p>I echo what Mr. O'Brien said.  The engagement between Revenue, IBEC and the wider business community has been excellent.  I have not seen the communication from last week to which the Senator referred, but what has been outlined would not come as too much of a surprise for business.  We have known that the UK has been divided on the customs union and the full information has been brought out in recent months from Revenue.  We would not have too many concerns from that perspective.</p> <p>  There is a lot of burden on smaller enterprises.  As Mr. O'Brien indicated in his opening statement, we still have concerns about their preparations and getting through them, as they are coming to it now.  In general, it has been quite good.  Where we would have more concerns is due to the requirements on the UK side.  A lot of the information on the UK border operating model has only come out in recent months.  Only last week did we get full information on the health export certificates for agri-food, for example.  A lot of that information is coming in fresh now and so many businesses have to adapt to it within a very short timeframe before the end of the transition period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#J00400"><p>I will answer the Senator's question on the short-time working scheme.  The scheme that operates in Germany is built on a tripartite model, that is, there is a contribution from all three elements - the state, the employer and the worker.  Let us take a company that might have 200 workers.  It is producing well at the moment in the non-Brexit scenario, but it knows that the product it is making is not going to be necessarily viable in the post-Brexit scenario.  What would happen in Germany is that there is a dialogue between the state, the employer and the workforce.  The contribution from the workforce would be the decrease in net income.  In the case of Germany, on average, there is a 75% assurance of net income, so that is the contribution from the worker.  The state and the employer would agree to put in a percentage to ensure that the 75% of net income was maintained.  The workers would be retained in contact with the employer.  The employer would have to demonstrate that it would have a prospect of viability in terms of diversification of market.  For instance, if the product were to be sold in X, Y and Z countries outside of the UK it could take approximately two years to achieve that and it would need the workforce to be agile and trained up to do the work and therefore the training and upskilling would take time.  Everybody agrees to take part in the project to get them to the place where they are at full production in two years when they have new markets opened, they are selling into them and they have the prospect of increasing their employment.  That is the very positive piece that can happen.  All three elements are investing in the company being ready for the diversified market within a certain period.</p> <p>  That is how the German scheme operates.  It is forcing companies to look at finding alternatives to their current model and developing markets outside of the UK, which is what they are comfortable with at the moment.  It is giving a sustained certainty to the income of the workers who stay with the company for the long haul and come out the other end with a full productivity in the new markets.  That is the basis of the scheme.</p> <p>  We have had quite a successful scenario with the Department of Foreign Affairs, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in recent years in terms of a Brexit stakeholder forum.  We should convert that now into a Brexit social dialogue on all of these issues we are discussing this morning.  We should be in there as we speak, looking at options.  The point Senator Ahearn raised about Revenue indicates there is a lack of joined-up thinking there or that we are operating in silos.  We should not allow those things to happen.  That does not mean we ignore the fact that Revenue issues have to be dealt with, but we should have a dialogue where the issues relating to the short-time scheme, the export credit insurance scheme and other such issues could be discussed around the table and we could look for solutions and see what we are going to do to resolve them in a joined-up way.  That is the value of having that dialogue.  I suggest that the Brexit stakeholder forum needs to morph into a dialogue forum on these issues.  That would be my offering in terms of attempting to find a solution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#J00500"><p>First, we should probably get a note from the Department on the export credit insurance scheme and what its thinking is on that, given that the issue has been raised more than once.</p> <p>  I note that the Office for Budget Responsibility in the UK has predicted that a no-deal Brexit will lead to a negative impact over the next 15 years or so of about 6% of GDP.  A no-deal Brexit would have serious impacts here, but it will also have a serious impact on the UK, which could have a knock-on effect on UK companies operating from here.  We have already seen that happening in the retail trade, including in reports in recent days.  Could I ask the witnesses from IBEC and ICTU what connections they have with their sister organisations in the UK?  What are they saying about their perception of the impact of any kind of Brexit on business, employment and workers in the UK?  Am I correct in saying that would also have a knock-on effect here?  A negative impact on business in the UK could have a knock-on impact here as well.</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. O'Brien.  What are companies doing to pivot away from the UK market for exports and imports to markets elsewhere in Europe, for instance to substitute goods, materials and services, as they would not face tariffs or restrictions, as could happen with trade with the UK, no matter what kind of deal we have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#J00600"><p>I might just answer the question about our contacts in the UK.  We have ongoing contact with the TUC and no later than last week we had a conference call with the general secretary of the TUC about all of this.</p><p>To be fair, the Irish Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs facilitated them coming to Ireland and having direct discussions, but they are very concerned about a race to the bottom in a no-deal scenario.  They are very well acquainted with the possibilities and the consequences of that, and indeed the possibilities of it happening.  Without straying into party politics, from their point of view, the current UK Government is more likely to engage in that sort of behaviour in the UK than not, so they have huge concerns about it.  We are an all-island body, so the Northern Ireland aspect to this is a matter of grave concern to us, and we have worked hard with the Northern Ireland Executive and the TUC on all of the issues linked to the Northern Ireland aspect that affect workers.  We are onto that and they have grave concerns, as we do, about the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020120200002#K00200"><p>I will start with engagement and the all-island issue, which is incredibly important, particularly the implementation of the protocol and the shared island initiative, which we know is such a priority for Government.  IBEC has had a joint business council with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the CBI, officially since the 1990s, and indeed has engaged with it for much longer.  That engagement will never be as important as it will be in the next chapter.  Businesses in the North are meeting with businesses with IBEC membership on an ongoing basis, and we are thrashing out some of the challenges to the all-island economy with Government.  We are also engaging with our counterpart in London, the CBI, with manufacturers in the UK and a range of trade associations.  What we find is that they are pointing out the realities and practicalities of what Brexit is going to mean for their businesses, and the challenges it will present, including for the cost of doing business.  However, they are also looking to the future, because that is what they need to do as businesses.  It looks to us like the UK's strategy will be to work hard to become more competitive, and it will spend a lot on innovation.  I note the risks of triggering a race to the bottom, but I feel that the real challenge for the Irish business model will be remaining competitive on the higher value aspects of the economy, because that is what the UK will go after.  It will seek to spend aggressively on innovation, research and development, education and skills.  The entire innovation ecosystem, including the ranking of our universities, is going to be incredibly important.  I would not rule out the UK making aggressive moves in respect of taxation, and that is the real threat to the Irish economic model, rather than a potential race to the bottom at the other end of the economy.</p></speech>

The tourism industry is already on its knees.  Tourism Ireland markets the whole of Ireland, and tourists visit this country and do a 360-degree tour of the island.  A no-deal Brexit would have massive implications for every rural community, and would kill the hospitality businesses that are currently struggling, so it is an issue that must be looked at.  It is the same with the agricultural sector.  In the Border region, there are farms that straddle the Border and the communities there do not see a Border.  In Leitrim, where I am from, for example, there is a farmer who is concerned about feeding his cattle around a bale which straddles North and South.  The simple issues are causing concern, and we must look at the real people on the ground.  We must look at the farming and tourism industries and communities, because they could be decimated.  Tourism is a major player that brings income into rural economies every day, so we need to look at this properly.</p></speech>

We have been working with many of our members over the past three to four years on the supply chains, components and input aspects, to help them to understand the complexity of their supply chains - and not just the first layer of them, but also who are their suppliers getting their supplies from.  We have seen many companies de-risk as a result of this.  On the issue of diversification on the export side, it is interesting to note that our reliance on the UK has been reducing over the past ten or 20 years.  Over the past ten years we have seen particular diversification across some sub-sectors of the food industry.  The one area that we have not seen that diversification happen is in the beef industry.  It links back to Mr. O'Hara's comments on the challenges for agriculture, and it is the sub-sector of the entire economy that I am most concerned about, because we have seen very little practical diversification out of the UK in respect of the reliance for our beef industry.  It has happened in other parts of the economy and other parts of the food industry, but it has not happened in the beef industry, and that is worrying.</p></speech>

Such an approach is fundamental and I hope that all those involved, including Government representatives, deliver on that.  There must be a renewed focus on this, and the forum must morph into a true stakeholder forum, as has been asserted here today.  As we have seen with NPHET, this forum or any future forums concerning this issue must engage with senior industry leaders.  They are not currently being included and yet they possess the most singular expertise in developing new business and markets, and understanding the strategic plans that need to be put in place to mitigate what Brexit brings with it.  There also needs to be a real focus on community enterprise development.  Mr. O'Hara spoke about issues in the Border region and they are issues that affect those in my constituency also.  We have good community enterprise centres around the country that are largely being funded privately, and there is much good thinking and many capable people in those centres.  We must try to build funding inside out, which is unfortunate.  We need to get people together, and in order to do that, we must support them.</p> <p>  On the Border issue, the agrifood sector is a pivotal business area in the south east, and it is very exposed to Brexit.  Like others, I am very concerned about this, but I think the future is going to be about green and sustainable agribusiness, agritourism and tourism potential.  Therefore, I hope that any Brexit Stakeholders Forum will look beyond Brexit, because we all must look beyond it.  Brexit is a fact and it has already happened, other than the mechanics of how the UK will exit the EU.  We need to look forward.  I ask the witnesses to keep my points in mind.</p></speech>

There is another big issue to be considered, namely, fracking.  Despite a ban on fracking in the South, in a no-deal Brexit situation, fracking could still happen in the North of this island.  Currently, research is being carried out in the North, through the Northern Ireland Executive, and it is something we must look at, because it could have big implications for our rural communities.  Fracking should not happen on this island, because it will have major implications for areas such as tourism, health, and agriculture, so I ask this committee and other Oireachtas committees to look into the issue.</p></speech>

I know a rural plan is currently being developed, there are regional enterprise strategies and regional skills forums, the national broadband plan is being rolled out and there is substantial money set aside in the national development plan for rural and town development.  However, it seems people feel that those measures, which, in combination, are designed to address this issue, are not sufficient to do so.  I am interested to hear about new policy tools for addressing this issue.</p><p>Mr. O'Hara mentioned some cutting-edge technologies coming our way.  How do we, in practical terms, develop those in regions that do not have those sectors in place?  Are there new things that Government should think about that are not on the agendas of those initiatives now in place?</p></speech>

We have a new project called W8 Innovation in Leitrim, which concentrates on the quarrying and construction industry under five different points and developing specifically for those industries.  Others include science and technology, and agriculture and food, and we have space under Industry 4.0.  These are real projects that are being developed in the Border region for industry clusters.  Under the first one, we put 40 companies with more than 10,000 staff together and we made a real project with the help of Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has been amazingly helpful.  We got funding of &euro;3.7 million for that project, which will bring 40 jobs in a three-year period, with 200 indirect jobs in the industry.  This is the way we think this should be developed around Ireland and in innovation hubs.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Bruton for the input.  I agree about the dislocation for our regions.  When we overlap the Covid legacy and Brexit impact, the regional disparity will become a much more severe public policy issue.  To build on what Mr. O'Hara is saying, the key to intervention is bringing agility into public policy.  When I look at dislocation that we have seen in industry and in the economy and the past decade, some interventions that have worked well include resourcing institutes of technology, now the technological universities.  Those are crucial to our regional development agenda.  We have seen many examples of them being able to bring agility to work with companies that are either facing challenge or opportunity, to help them pivot, to get supports for innovation, to have upskilling, and to get the labour force resources through to those local and regional areas.  That is a game changer.</p> <p>  We have many programmes that we know work well, whether it is Skillnet or Springboard, and there is a need to be deep and ambitious with innovation.  The most significant challenge of Brexit is competitiveness, and the solution to that will be innovation and productivity, working through these advanced technological universities, resourcing them better, and blending innovation, upskilling and training supports for businesses and organisations working at a regional level with businesses.  That will help the regions.  I am concerned about the regional disparity that we will see in the coming years.</p></speech>

To me, there is an opportunity for the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to have joined-up thinking about this.  We could even specify areas for innovation and home in on that.  If we had an offering from institutes and universities to develop particular skills for an area, that area would then become attractive for investment for companies going into that area because they would want to utilise that skills base.  Those conversations are happening but they are probably not happening in a joined-up way.  We need to be much more flexible about how we are having those conversations so as to develop areas based on their attractiveness with regard to skill.</p> <p>  We are now entering a reform of our economy.  In ten years, we will have much-reformed economy compared with the one that we have now.  Reasons for that include Brexit, Covid and the normal reform process that takes over.  As the Deputy knows from his own experience, our education base is much risen compared with what it was even two decades ago, but we now have to be much more targeted in producing the skills base to attract industry to a particular area.  People will see reason behind that and take part in that, and the institutes, universities and so on will respond to that.  We can have those conversations in a social dialogue and get a quick product from that, but if nobody talks about it in a joined-up way, then everybody will have good ideas but there will be no action at the end.</p></speech>

Evidence has shown that the Border regions have lagged behind other areas of the country already and we think that the Border regions will suffer the most in the event of Brexit, whether there is a deal or not.  Our hinterland for business is cross-Border and we already live in areas of poor social and economic infrastructure.  I ask that the Border enterprise development fund be used to reinvest in technological advances in the Border regions to promote them and to try to prevent some of that regional disparity.  We have institutes of technology in Monaghan, Dundalk and Letterkenny, which are all ready and able for upskilling and to work with industry, but we need to see some strategic investment in the Border areas to help to promote that.</p></speech>

It is a matter of looking outside the box and bringing industry and colleges together, and giving them a real direction.  In every programme that we write, we write a youth programme with it.  We write that from seven to 17.  Kids need to learn about innovation and technology.  It is not just for the older age group.  We have done different tests here, including bringing a kid and a parent together to build a robot.

On joined-up thinking, I refer to my exasperation with a specific issue which might highlight where we are.  When I was elected to Leinster House in February, one of the first things that I brought to the attention of Government was the South Eastern Applied Materials Research Centre, which is the highest-functioning technology gateway in the country, dealing with medical device manufacturers from Waterford to Letterkenny.</p><p>We have been awaiting funding of &euro;2.8 million for a CT X-ray scanner and despite the fact that the Government has now put out almost &euro;30 million in Covid-19 innovation funding, the money for that scanner has still not been dropped.  That is a singular piece of technology that could accelerate integration across to the UK.  I remind everybody the kind of game we are in.  As Ms King highlighted, it is vital that everybody is talking.  These things should be discussed, particularly in industry and education.  We could drive on from here but we can only do that if we get together.</p><p> We also must get the ears of Government and senior civil servants.  Despite all of the positive things that can be said, I will say that it is difficult, as a Deputy, to try to get these messages across.  We have to keep on putting them across to try to get any action on something that should be a no-brainer.</p></speech>

Today's engagement will allow us to explore the migration and asylum pact in more detail.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must advise Mr. Shotter that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I ask him to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence to committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, he or she must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Shotter to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today.  I hope members have received the slides I sent yesterday because I will be speaking to them this morning.  By way of introduction and with reference to the first of those slides, in September the Commission brought forward a new pact on the subject of migration and asylum with the objective of building long-term and stable migration policy and translating European values into its management.  The first thing I would like to underline is that it is a new pact.  Back in 2016 following the migration crisis of 2015-2016, we had tabled a reform of the common European asylum system but as committee members will be aware, we have not been able to close a number of proposals that we put on the table at that time.  The idea was to come with a new pact to break through the deadlock and to create a stable system to ensure a future-proofed system.  The starting point for our new pact is to acknowledge the reality of migration, including the fact that it has enriched our countries, both economically and socially.  In terms of regular migration pathways, this side of our migration policy works pretty well but in terms of irregular migration, we must accept and admit that our system does not work so well.<br/><br/>What Europe has to do now is better manage the challenges that we face with migration because the system we have in place now has a number of shortcomings.  That is why we have tabled this comprehensive approach which is built on an integrated policy-making methodology.  It is built on four main pillars, the first of which concerns the external environment and the importance of good, strong co-operation with non-EU countries and of building win-win external partnerships.  In order for this to be achievable, investment is required and the process involved is long term.  We need to get stuck into that right now and to do so on the basis of tailor-made and mutually beneficial partnerships with third countries.  These partnerships aim to address the shared challenges we face with regard to migration.  Migration is not just a phenomenon that involves people coming to Europe.  If one looks at the figures for Africa, for example, there is migration going on all over the place within the continent itself.  We have common challenges and the partnerships are predicated on the basis of working together on those challenges, such as in the areas of migrant smuggling, developing legal migrant pathways and tackling the effective implementation of readmission agreements and arrangements.  <br/><br/>The second pillar I want to mention in this comprehensive approach concerns more efficient and faster procedures <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>border management.  The Commission proposes to introduce integrated asylum and return border procedures.  This is an innovation of the pact of September.  It will also include a pre-entry phase for screening, which is not a procedure in itself but relates to certain activities that should be carried out, including for example, the identification of all people crossing the EU's external borders without meeting the entry conditions or having disembarked after a search and rescue operation.</p><p>It seems common sense that we should have an identification of each person arriving, and health checks and security checks.  That is what is meant by screening.  We need to also to ensure registration in the EURODAC database.  This screening phase will also allow individuals to be rapidly and effectively channelled towards the right procedure.  That could be the border procedure, which we would make mandatory under certain circumstances, for example, for people coming from a country with a recognition rate of  below 20%, or it could be the normal asylum procedure, or, if a person is not applying for asylum, it could be straight into a return channel.</p><p> By the way, I should mention that the border procedure is an accelerated procedure which is aimed at providing quick decisions but always respecting the fundamental rights requirements.  We have to have an individual assessment of every applicant making an asylum application, and whether or not they are in the border procedure, we always need an individual assessment.  At the same time, we would also envisage strengthening all of the other procedures and subjecting these procedures and the way member states carry these out to stronger monitoring and operational support from EU agencies.</p><p> I should also mention the EU&rsquo;s digital infrastructure for migration management and I have already mentioned the EURODAC database.  It is proposed to modernise this so it is more effective at covering, for example, individual applicants rather than applications.  For example, if a person applied for asylum in one member state, it would be able to track that more effectively by being able to see whether that person then applies for asylum in another member state.  The present database is not so efficient at covering that kind of situation and we need to fix these deficiencies.</p><p> The third pillar mentioned on the first slide concerns the fair sharing of responsibility and solidarity, which is one of the core issues that we need to get right in the pact.  I will come back to that shortly on a separate slide.</p><p> The fourth pillar I set out on the opening slide is about legal pathways and integration.  The pact is not about creating a fortress Europe.  A credible legal migration and integration policy is essential for benefiting European societies and economies, and also for building those external partnerships that I mentioned earlier.  The Commission proposes, therefore, to launch talent partnerships with the key non-EU countries that will match labour and skills needs in the EU.  I would like to make a distinction within these legal pathways in that there can be economic legal pathways but there can also be humanitarian legal pathways, which are, of course, of great importance.  The pact intends to strengthen resettlement and promote other complementary pathways to protection, seeking to develop a European approach to community sponsorship to give civil society a stronger and more structured role in the reception and integration of newcomers.  We have set out these objectives in the recommendation on legal pathways to protection in the EU.</p><p> Last week, the Commission came forward with and adopted a new comprehensive action plan on integration and inclusion.  This action plan promotes inclusion for all, recognising the essential role of integration in a stable asylum and migration policy.  We need to get that right, and there is an important local dimension of that in terms of working in partnership with different stakeholders and also with local and regional authorities.</p><p> I will now move to the next slide.  It is important to ensure the sharing of responsibility and solidarity, and this is a principle set out and enshrined in the treaty itself.  What we would do is elaborate on this principle, in particular through a new proposal, which is the asylum and migration management regulation that will replace the Dublin regulation.  This sets out a common framework, sets out rules on responsibility and also sets out a solidarity mechanism.  Member states, by this solidarity mechanism, will be bound to show solidarity to each other.  Solidarity is not optional; it is compulsory.  In particular, we focus this on situations of pressure because we must make sure that member states contribute in times of need to help stabilise the overall system, support member states under pressure and ensure the Union fulfils its humanitarian obligations.  That is a very important point and I want to emphasise this mandatory solidarity component.</p><p> As I mentioned earlier, the 2016 proposal was also aimed at putting in place a solidarity mechanism and, of course, it proved very difficult to find a way through with our earlier proposal.  We have tried to learn from this earlier experience and Commissioner Johansson and Vice President Schinas were mandated by the President to carry out a series of exchanges with stakeholders, but in particular with member states, to try to find a way by which we can come together on this very important point, which is to find the right balance between responsibility and solidarity.  That has involved an acceptance in our proposals of the need to have a flexible system in place.  We cannot have an unduly rigid system but we cannot compromise either on the objective we want to achieve here, which is to provide effective support to the member states that need that support.  That will most likely be the member states that are geographically exposed and, as we have seen, that are constantly under pressure due to their geographical position.</p><p> On this basis, we need to reconcile the fact we need a compulsory system, we need it to be flexible and we also need it to be effective.  These are the key objectives we have integrated into the design of our system.  This involves, for example, recognising that solidarity should be provided, and that could be in terms of location but it also could be in terms of providing support in the area of return.  That is an innovation in our new proposal.  We call this "return sponsorship" and it is a rather important additional way of offering solidarity.  However, we do not confine it to those people solidarity options.  There are also various other options like capacity building and also providing support in the external dimension, along the route which impacts the member state under pressure.  The mechanism, as I said, needs to always help the member state that is under pressure so this flexibility needs to be counterbalanced by certain guarantees.  This is, in the first place, ensured by the Commission working with the member state that will be under pressure to identify its real needs.  It is not for the Commission just to say to a member state: &ldquo;Take this, it is something that is useful for you.&rdquo;  It has to be something that really is useful to the member state that is under pressure.  At the same time, given the balance we need to strike between responsibility and solidarity, we need to ensure that those rules on responsibility are more effective and address the issues relating to unauthorised secondary movement.  This is the other side of the coin, in a sense, and we need to get that right and acknowledge that the system does not work as it should in that area either.  Therefore, we have proposed some improvements in that area as well.</p><p> As I mentioned, return is of fundamental importance.  We acknowledge this in the solidarity mechanism but we also acknowledge that we need to step up with EU-level support to member states in this area because we need to have a more efficient system.  We need to give protection to those who need protection, but for that system to work well, we also need to acknowledge there are those who, having been assessed after application, have been found not to need protection.</p><p>For those who applied and are found not to require protection, we need to find dignified ways of ensuring that the return system, which is linked with readmission to third countries and so there is an external dimension that also works well.</p><p> Members will see on the slide a reference to common governance of migration and better governance.  It is important that each member state has in place a strong and robust system of its own at national level.  We depend on that.  It is the European way to build on good, strong, national systems.  That is essential for another nucleant of the European way, which is that we can ensure mutual trust between member states.  In this area that is at a premium.  We need to make sure that each member state has a robust system in place which ensures better strategic planning, both at national and European level, and also enhanced monitoring of migration management on the ground with annual reports, etc.</p><p> The final slide shows the pact in the form of a completed puzzle.  The puzzle is intended to depict that this is not an easy area.  It is a challenging area but we need to get all the pieces of the puzzle to fit together.  The internal and external dimensions both need to work.  We cannot have one piece and not the other.  They both need to fit together; the one supports the other.  All of this is essential to ensure full communication in terms of an overall comprehensive approach.</p><p> I mentioned the effective border management through the screening regulation, the asylum procedures regulation, known as the EURODAC regulation.</p><p> I will make a brief comment on crisis.  We are not in a permanent state of crisis.  There was a crisis in 2015-2016 provoked by the situation in Syria but it is not the normal functioning and we should not design a system exclusively for situations of crisis.  We need to prevent crises and put in place stable systems to avoid these crises.  We cannot always avoid crises.  They come from outside, therefore, we need to have better rules in place for when a crisis occurs.  The starting point is a stable system working in a more normal setting, which is able to respond also to pressure without breaking.  That is the reason we have this pressure mechanism for dealing with solidarity.</p><p> I should also mention the special status that we recognise for search and rescue operations and disembarkations.  It has to be acknowledged that it is an obligation under international law to rescue people in distress at sea and, where they have been rescued, to disembark them in the nearest place of safety.  If a person is disembarked on that basis, it is in a rather different setting from someone otherwise disembarking across the border in an irregular manner.</p><p> I mentioned the legal pathway.  That is the resettlement recommendation.  The asylum and migration management regulation is the centrepiece in a way because it is where we find this common approach.</p><p> Finally, the grey pieces of the puzzle are those which discussed last time around.  While we have not completed these proposals there has been a lot of progress in the co-decision procedure.  There is no point reinventing the wheel.  We would encourage the swift adoption of these proposals, for example, setting up of an EU asylum agency.  It is very important to get that done quickly.  I am very happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

I want to touch on a couple of issues but I will start with his final comments on the external dimension.  What steps does he believe should be taken to deal with third countries?  Is there a risk of being overly reliant on third countries, which may start to have a slightly different approach to this issue?  We have seen that in wider EU external negotiations in recent weeks and months.  Is the allowance for differential responses within member states creating a risk also?  We are speaking here in Dublin.  Ireland is located at the most western tip of Europe where dealing with a refugee crisis is not necessarily an immediate challenge.  It is a long way to come here but is there a risk in terms of the different approaches by member states depending on the political mood within member states?</p> <p>  Touching on the political mood and the public mood, I would appreciate hearing some of Mr. Shotter's thoughts in this regard.  This issue has gone back to the Council but what is the more precise role of the parliaments of the member states?  We have been discussing the migration refugee crisis for some time.</p><p>Mr. Shotter has been working on this at the highest level for many years, but still the discussion, unfortunately, can sometimes be too Brussels-centric.  Trying to get public buy-in requires a greater buy-in from member state parliaments.  I would appreciate Mr. Shotter's thoughts on how we can involve member state parliaments to a greater extent than just having <i>ad hoc</i>meetings of committees such as this one.  It is great that there is a detailed focus on this topic, which was suggested by Senator Chambers from the outset.  Is that being repeated by other member states?<br/><br/>To conclude and tie it all together, what is the next step for the pact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020120200002#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Shotter.  I am really happy we are having this conversation because this is one of the most important policy changes at an EU level that there has been for some time and it will have an impact on all member states.  It is one of those controversial issues that, domestically, can be difficult to deal with.  I do not know whether this is to ease the concerns of member states but much of the commentary and the media around this seems to have a strong focus on a robust returns system.  I do not know whether that is to let member states know that this will limit, more so than now, the numbers of people coming into the European Union but I am not sure that is the correct message to send out.  I agree that migration, diversity and people coming in are good for member states and we should champion and welcome that diversity.</p> <p>  The proposal states that there will be a common approach to governance.  Does Mr. Shotter envisage new laws being proposed or new directives issued on that front to try to streamline how member states adopt this pact?</p> <p>  As for how member states deal with this, there is again a focus on flexibility, which is the bedrock of the European Union and of how we do things by consensus.  In that vein, however, there is a focus on member states not having to agree to relocate persons but instead being able to provide financial and administrative support, along with a returns mechanism.  That seems to benefit, to a certain extent, the wealthier member states.  Furthermore, if a government is trying to have a fair migration policy and wants to help to relocate people, it gives domestic opposition, which might be against that, a stick to beat it with because it can say the government should just pay the money instead, provide administrative support and focus on the returns.  If the focus and objective is to ease the burden on the small number of member states that have been most affected by the migration crisis, that is, those at the front line in this regard, will the fact that there is an easy out for other member states not to relocate people and simply provide money instead make the big difference it has been suggested it will make?</p> <p>  How does Mr. Shotter think the pact has been received by member states?  Has the reaction been positive or tepid?  What has their feedback suggested about how they have adopted it or whether they have embraced it wholeheartedly?</p></speech>

It is not that we say to do the external and not to do the internal; all of it needs to be done, and that is what makes it rather complex and difficult.  We cannot ignore the essential nature of tackling the issues.  What are causes and drivers of migration?  One has to consider the smuggling and criminal networks and the challenges third countries themselves have in dealing with migration, such as their own asylum system or the fact they may have many asylum seekers or people seeking protection.  They can be helped with their own systems.  I could go on with examples, such as developing their economies and societies in such a way that they will be better able to meet the challenges.  There is a common ground where we can come together and find these common interests.  It takes time, effort and investment, not only in terms of money but also in getting it right and understanding.  It may be that the circumstances are quite different in one third country compared with another and, therefore, we need to be able to tailor-make these partnerships.<br/><br/>Legal migration also plays a part in this.  We should aim to have a win-win relationship in that regard, where we may have needs in sectors of the economy or the functioning of society and the third country may have an interest in developing training and expertise in that area.  We do not want to have a brain drain but a circular movement in order that we meet that ethical concern.  It is not an optional part of a stable system; it is an essential part of a stable system.  The issue of return is not an attractive subject to speak about but we have to acknowledge that it is part of a stable functioning system to get that side of the policy working well.  That cannot be done without working in partnership with third countries because those third countries need to readmit people, and that is often a sticky and difficult point.  That is why it is so important to get the external dimension right and to do it in a tailor-made way.<br/><br/>Deputy Richmond mentioned the differentiated responses from member states, and I think he was referring to the solidarity mechanism [<i>inaudible</i>].  Therefore, I might join this answer with another point mentioned.  We included the flexibility to acknowledge that that is the way in which the European Union should work and having learned from the previous experience that this was quite a divisive issue.  Equally, we understood that relocation, at the end of the day, is often what makes a difference on the ground to the country under pressure.  We had to find a middle way on this.<br/><br/>In that regard, we built in some guarantees to ensure that the balance is correct.  We have also got a critical mass correction mechanism.  We build in to the regulation a central role for both relocation and return sponsorship to recognise the point that Senator Chambers was making, namely, that we need in the regulation itself to provide some guidance on this.  It is not just total flexibility.  We give some central preference to the role of these people-based solidarity measures, whether relocation or return sponsorship.  If too many member states opt for the other path and if there is too much of that and not enough of the people-based solidarity, this correction mechanism will step in.  It will also make it obligatory for all member states, once a threshold has been passed, to provide a certain amount of that people-based solidarity, whether through relocation or return sponsorship.<br/><br/>On the role of member state parliaments, it is obvious that this is a very important subject in political terms and, therefore, the role of national parliaments is essential.  As for the interest of other parliaments, last week I had a similar hearing with the upper chamber of the Dutch Parliament, and a week before, with the Dutch lower chamber.</p><p>We acknowledged that parliaments have a keen interest.  We have to find a way - that is also for the committee's national system - to keep abreast of how issues are developing.</p><p> Of course, there are some elements of this regulation which are set in Brussels.  There is a sort of tension there and that was picked up also in the question of Senator Chambers.  Also, there is discretion in the way the policy is implemented on the ground.  Of course, the national parliaments have a clear interest in seeing how the policy is implemented on the ground.</p><p> I was also asked how the pact is being received by member states and what the next step for it is.  The pact, when it came out, was as well received as we could expect it to be.  The Commissioner, Ms Johansson, was clear.  Nobody will be happy with this pact.  It is such a difficult area.  She was not expecting everyone to be jumping up and down in the street.  It is a difficult area and we are calling upon all Members of the European Parliament as well to come with an open mind and find a compromise and a way through because that is the only way we will do this properly.  Our objective in framing the pact, therefore, was to find a landing zone territory in pitching the pack and finding the balance so that all could come together and find that ground on which to negotiate.</p><p> There is still a negotiation to be had.  That is for sure.  It could not be expected that our proposal would come out and be instantaneously adopted by the Parliament and the Council, but what we wanted was to find that common landing zone where useful negotiations can take place rather than find ourselves in a deadlock situation.  In that regard, it was well received and well understood that that is what we had tried to do.  That is very positive.  That is how we see it.</p><p> Now, of course, we are two months on from our proposal being made.  We have had quite intense discussions already in the Council.  It is premature to expect a breakthrough in December but we have had very useful exchanges under the German Presidency.  The objective is to take this forward in the Council meeting on 4 December in as ambitious a way as possible through a progress report.  That is my understanding of the objective of the German Presidency.  That would be a good stepping stone to take this further forward under the Portuguese Presidency.</p><p> However, as the committee members could see from that puzzle slide I presented, there is a lot on the table, there is a lot to be discussed and it is complex.  Member states need to feel comfortable with the details of what we have put on the table.  That takes a little bit of time as well.  It will need political steer from the political level but it will also need a sense of ownership which comes when member states have had a chance to study the finer details.  One needs to bring those two elements together and achieve always a sense of momentum on this difficult subject.</p><p> There was a question on the common governance as to whether we will bring forward new legislation.  What we have set out in the asylum and migration management regulation proposal on the governance is the proposed legislation.  We would not be coming forward with anything extra.  It is a framework.  It is not imposing this in a detailed way.  It is rather setting out a framework calling, for example, for a national strategy to be adopted.  However, it does not then set out what precisely is in that strategy, which is obviously for implementation by the member state and also in light of the European strategy.</p><p> When it comes to the question on returns, this is an important essential component of the pact.  I hope I have made that clear.  We need to move towards a common EU system of returns.  It is a difficult subject.  What we have to do here is to find a way that is fully in line with our values and our protection of individual rights and to respect the dignity of those involved.  At the same time we need to draw a distinction, if we are to have a stable system, between giving protection to those in need of protection in line with our obligations and acknowledging that those who do not follow the legal channels that we should put in place do not have an open right to come and stay within the EU.  Therefore, we need for a stable system to be able to draw that distinction and deal with the consequences of it.  I hope I have answered the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020120200002#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Shotter for his informative briefing this morning.  I will begin with a few comments.  Mr. Shotter stated that we are not in the middle of a crisis such as we saw in 2018 and 2016.  That may be true but the figures published on deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean still show that it is very much a crisis.  This year alone, it is estimated that 979 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean Sea.  In 2019, the number of deaths amounted to 1,900.  It is reckoned that between 2014 and 2018, for instance, approximately 12,000 people drowned and were never found.  It is still very much a crisis and there has been a failure by the international community to deal with the entire migrant crisis.</p> <p>  At this point , I want to say "Well done" to the Naval Service which, like many other groups and organisations, and NGOs, went to the Mediterranean.  The Naval Service helped save in excess of 8,500 lives in the Mediterranean.  It is important to acknowledge that and say "Well done" to all involved.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the migrant crisis came to the fore again during the summer with the fire in the M&oacute;ria refugee camp on Lesbos.  It again highlighted the failure of the international community and the European community to deal with the issue.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that a new pact is being looked at.  It is a long time coming.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Back in February-March, as part of a broader geopolitical play, we saw Turkey open its borders and more than 35,000 migrants flooded into Greece.  That breached the 2016 pact in which Turkey was to get &euro;6 billion in return for curbing migrant flows.  On this pact, what is being considered to stop the issue of migrants and refugees being used as a political football by countries such as Turkey?</p> <p>  In 2018, for example, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, committed to Ireland taking in 36 unaccompanied minors.  To date, we have taken in only eight.  Those 36 were supposed to have been taken in by the end of 2019.  Listening to Mr. Shotter's briefing this morning, he talked about flexibility and solidarity being compulsory.  What in this new pact ties a country in?  What if they make a commitment, as in this example, to take in unaccompanied minors and then fail to comply and follow through on that, much to the annoyance of many organisations right across the board?  Once countries sign up and agree to take in asylum seekers or, in this case, unaccompanied minors, what is there to ensure that they follow through?</p></speech>

I would reiterate much of what other members have said, in particular on whether to call this period a crisis.  It is a crisis for a large number of people.  What Deputy Brady discussed was horrific, particularly the numbers.</p> <p>  My questions will be somewhat similar.  I get that we want a stable system that can deal with normal situations and crises.  How will the rapidity that Mr. Shotter mentioned work?  What will the better workable pathways for humanitarian entry and economic entry look like?  What does "return sponsorship" mean?</p> <p>  In this day and age, I do not entirely understand how the EURODAC database was set up to deal with applications rather than applicants.  I would have expected the search facility to sort out that problem.  If basic agile software development had been employed, the need to check the system on the basis of an applicant and have that information to hand would have been solved quickly.  When does Mr. Shotter foresee this problem being sorted?  When does he foresee the better workable pathways, the more rapid system and the sharing of responsibility coming into operation in the real world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Shotter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020120200002#G00200"><p>I thank members for those pertinent questions.  I should clarify a comment I made.  By not explaining what a crisis is, I can create misunderstandings.  We want to have special rules for a defined concept of &quot;crisis&quot;.  That is what we set out in special legislation covering crisis situations.  As a legal construct, we have set these situations as being exceptional because we accept that, where there is a mass influx of such a scale in a crisis that it not only jeopardises the overall functioning of a national system but also places the wider European system in question, we need to have tailor-made rules.  They will be at a high level rather than a low level.  We envisage that the exceptionality will mean that there will be shorter deadlines for certain matters and longer ones for others because the system will be under so much pressure.  We believe the net may need to be cast wider in terms of the kinds of person who will be eligible for solidarity support because of the scale of the crisis.<br/><br/>I wish to clarify my comment on this matter.  When I speak about the crisis, it is a legal definition.  A person drowning in the Mediterranean is a tragedy.  Each life lost is a tragedy and I do not want my comment in any way to be taken as meaning it should be seen as a normal situation.  Of course it is not something that we can accept.  Nor do we.  There is a special focus in our pact on search and rescue activity, which is not a specific competence of the EU.  It is a national competence.  Member states are signatories to the relevant international conventions.  While saying that, I do not want to give the impression that the European Union has nothing to do in this area.  We have acknowledged that we do.  We see the close proximity between search and rescue activities and obligations and migration policy.  Therefore, we have found it relevant and necessary to say something in this field.  For example, we have issued a recommendation to try to bring member states together on this subject and we intend to set up a special contact group between member states, with civil society organisations and shipping companies able to participate.  For example, a Danish vessel picked up migrants in distress in the Mediterranean during the summer.  It saved their lives, then found itself in limbo because of the difficulty in finding a place to disembark them.<br/><br/>We understand that we should have a role, even if it is not our legal competence, and we intend to play a role in bringing member states together as much as we can and avoiding a situation where persons lose their lives because they cannot be rescued.  We have produced guidance to make it clear that rescuing people at sea is not something that can be criminalised under EU law.  There is important and necessary EU legislation that is intended to tackle smuggling activity, but a provision contained therein has given rise to some debate.  We have come forward with guidance to make it clear that people should not be criminalised under EU law for activity that is mandated by international law.  That seems straightforward and obvious, but we felt the need to make it crystal clear because there was a discussion around this subject.  We give special acknowledgement in our legislation to the difference between persons disembarked after search and rescue activities and those arriving irregularly simply by crossing the border.  In a number of ways, we have seen the importance of helping to give extra clarity and support in the area of search and rescue activity.<br/><br/>The situation on the ground in Lesbos has been mentioned.  It is difficult to accept.  We are working with the Greek authorities to improve the situation, including under our existing framework of rules.  We have set up a task force with them to try to improve the situation on the ground.  We must work closely with them to do that.  We can only do something like this by working with national authorities.<br/><br/>The difficult situation in March at the border between Greece and Turkey was also mentioned.  We cannot be naive in our policy.  We must work with Turkey, just as we must work with other partner countries.  It is not an option to build a frontier and then believe we can neglect or not work with our partners.  We must work with them.  That is the world in which we live.  However, we should also have effective border protection and control and a way of managing our border that enables us to avoid being in a difficult situation like the one that occurred in March.  That said, it is a difficult balance to achieve.  We must respect our international obligations, which include giving access to asylum to those who need asylum.  I accept that we must do this in a way that does not lead to us being instrumentalised in this process.<br/><br/>Irish solidarity and how to ensure that solidarity promises are translated into action were mentioned.  Ireland has proved to be <i>solidaire</i>.  It has stepped up.  We acknowledge that, even though it was not obliged to, Ireland has come forward.</p><p>In the voluntary setting we have put out calls for member states to provide support following search and rescue disembarkations, as I mentioned earlier.  Ireland has stepped forward on a regular basis on that, which is very much appreciated.  I also draw a distinction, as I mentioned, between voluntary and compulsory.  With legal pathways, whether humanitarian in the form of resettlement or other legal pathways, we also acknowledge there is a more voluntary approach when member states step forward and volunteer pledge.  For example, in the area of resettlement, this works rather well.  We would like to see the leadership in resettlements spread more widely among member states but the process works rather well.</p><p> For the solidarity we envisage for times of pressure, this would be in the form I mentioned of compulsory solidarity.  There, the regulation itself would impose requirements.  There would be some flexibility but there would also be correction guarantees that I mentioned.  There would be an obligation under EU law to provide the solidarity that has been committed to and pledged in that way.</p><p> There was mention of the rapidity of the system and we want it to work as quickly as possible.  When there is pressure on the ground, although falling short of a crisis, as I mentioned earlier, but still not a position with which we should be comfortable, we need to step in with solidarity in an efficient and rapid way.  We try to make processes as swift as possible while also making this something to bring member states along rather than just issuing a diktat.  We do not want to do that but instead have the process owned by the member states.</p><p> There was a question on return sponsorship, which is an innovation.  It applies if a member state is under pressure and has persons to which a return decision has been given.  These people have gone through the process and been identified as not having a right to stay; they have legitimately been issued with a return decision.  This may have been appealed but the return decision would have stood.  Such persons should be returned.  The member state providing the solidarity, or the sponsoring member state, would offer for a number of such persons with return decisions to help the member state under pressure to return those persons to the third country concerned.  That may involve voluntary return support or reintegration support.  It could involve using diplomatic or other connections in the area.</p><p> The objective is to do this from the benefitting member state, so there would not be a transfer within the European Union to the sponsoring member state.  Sometimes it is difficult for a return to be carried out, and there may be a number of reasons for this, including a difficulty with the third country.  We have also acknowledged that to provide support to the benefitting member state, after a certain period has elapsed - we have put eight months in our proposal - there can be a transfer to the sponsoring member state.  We are interested in relieving the pressure on the benefitting member state.  If we cannot relieve the pressure by the primary route, which is to carry out the return from that country to the third country, then after this period, as a sort of backstop or guarantee, the person would be transferred at that point.  After that eight-month period has elapsed, it would involve the sponsoring member state.</p><p> On the European asylum dactyloscopy database, EURODAC, issue, it is the way with legislation that when it is reviewed we can find elements that can be improved.  This is indeed what we have identified at this point and the system can be improved.  We need a good system in place to effectively monitor how the asylum system is working, track persons and avoid abuse, as the system can be abused.  We should not be naive about that.  It is true there has been a certain openness, in some respect, to playing the system.  It is one aspect we want to tighten and improving the EURODAC regulation is part of that reform we think is useful and necessary.  We would like the EURODAC regulation to be adopted as quickly as possible.</p><p> An earlier question concerned the way ahead for member states.  One of the big political issues between member states is the package approach, with nothing agreed until everything is agreed.  That is understandable.  When there is a balance between responsibility and solidarity, we need to see that balance across instruments.  We understand a certain linkage between the different proposals on the table set on in the puzzle slide.  Having said that, we would like, if we can, to make progress and be able to move ahead with individual proposals on a pragmatic basis.  The European Union asylum agency is one example and we would like to move forward and adopt it as quickly as possible.  EURODAC is another good example where we should be able to move it forward quickly, recognising that there is a linkage with other parts of the pact.</p></speech>

Reform is very much needed in this area and previous attempts at such reform have failed.  In assessing the nation states of the European Union, it seems some countries will have problems for whatever reason with this new proposal.  They are Hungary, Croatia, Greece, Malta, Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria.  It is going to be hard to get agreement on this and I have no doubt the witness is aware of that.</p> <p>  I have three short questions.  I appreciate what the witness has said about the official definition of a crisis.  I understand there were approximately 140,000 arrivals in 2019 and that figure is a decrease on previous years.  Is there a reason the numbers arriving are decreasing at this point?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the agreements with Turkey so far but will the witness speak to those a bit more?  How has the existing agreement been working and how might the process work in future under these new proposals?  It seems the interaction was fraught with difficulty and problems.  Has the existing agreement with Turkey worked to some extent and how might it improve under the new proposals?</p> <p>  Finally, reference was made to the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece.  These proposals were published when it was in the news and very much on our minds.  Is the witness satisfied that the new proposals, if implemented, will end overcrowded and inhumane encampments.  Is he satisfied the proposals will deal with this and how, in practice, will it happen so there will be no need for these encampments on the scale we have now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Shotter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020120200002#H00300"><p>Again, these are very pertinent questions and the Deputy is absolutely right.  This is a difficult matter and it is one of the most difficult on the European policy table.</p><p>We are under no illusions about that, but that is why we have tried very hard to find the landing zone.  Probably as a result, no one is entirely happy, but the point is to find a way of coming together without compromising on our values and standards, and acknowledging our core objective of having in place a better, more stable, fairer and future-proofed system.</p><p> The numbers have gone down but that is not to say there is not a lot of pressure.  We see that.  It varies.  Since 2015, when the pressure was very intense and there was a crisis in the eastern Mediterranean, we have seen shifts along the various migratory routes.  We found there was a period of intense pressure in the central Mediterranean, linked to the circumstances in Libya.  When the pressure reduced in that region, the rate of regular crossings reduced fairly dramatically.  Recently, we have seen a lot of pressure arising in the Atlantic because of arrivals to the Canary Islands, impacting Spain.  The circumstances are dynamic and always will be.  It will depend on the migratory routes, flows and instability in the region.  In some respects, these are issues that can be far outside our control.  We have to be responsive to these developments.  We must obviously work with our partners, to the extent that the issues can be under our control, to help to stabilise the movements and do so in a way that prevents dangerous crossings and prevents people from falling into the hands of the criminal networks.  That is the importance of the external dimension.</p><p> This year, the numbers have been greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.  They are low, relatively speaking, but there are still areas experiencing genuine pressure.  It is a question of the long tail of the movements.  A movement might have occurred a year or two ago, but if a national system is overwhelmed, it can give rise to a situation such as the overcrowding in the Moria camp.  It is important to be able to tackle backlogs in the system and to have efficient procedures in place.  Without these, there is a cumulative build-up.  That is not good and it leads to pressure.  If a system becomes overwhelmed, people become stuck in circumstances in which nothing moves forward as it should.  The asylum process cannot be completed, leading to very bad frustration, which can boil over, resulting in overcrowding.  Therefore, we need to have efficient systems in place and, of course, we need to achieve these by giving the support needed.  If we want to have procedures at the borders, as we believe is appropriate, we must acknowledge that it can increase the pressure on the member states of the first arrival.  Therefore, we have to be there with our support, through the agencies, for example, and through Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office.  It is really important that the upgraded European Asylum Support Office, the EU asylum agency, be as operational as is necessary to provide the required support.  All of this needs to be in place to help member states.</p><p> The task force is a new development that was announced by the President at the same time as the pact was launched, in September.  We have set up this task force to cover Greece.  There is also a pilot project to help the Greek authorities with a new camp or new sort of reception centre on Lesbos, one that is of the standards we need to see, namely, standards that are in line with our values on reception conditions.  We can do this only by working with the Greek authorities, but we obviously need to be there with them to help them because this is what European solidarity is about.  It is not just a matter of operating through the solidarity mechanism but it is also a matter of support at European level.</p><p> The EU-Turkey statement has worked to an extent, as stated.  It has not worked in every aspect, but the EU has done a good job in resettling people from Turkey.  Turkey houses many people in need of international protection, amounting to 3 to 4 million.  We acknowledge that.  It points to the importance of the legal pathways.  That part of the statement has worked well.  The numbers went down dramatically after the statement was put in place.  It really was essential.  It was a game-changer at the time but, at the same time, other aspects of it have not worked entirely as they should.  We need to work with Turkey to make sure there is an improvement.  In this regard, I mentioned the importance of the partnerships.  We must continue to work with partner countries if we are to introduce the stability desired.</p></speech>

I have a few questions and I will try to be as brief as possible.</p> <p>  With regard to the debate and conversations prior to those on the future of Europe, could Mr. Shotter indicate how the debate on migration should be factored in?  Should it have the same prominence as the green transformation and the rule of law, for example, in upcoming deliberations before those on the future of Europe?</p> <p>  I like Mr. Shotter's jigsaw apparatus. We sometimes get a little disillusioned with some of the EU's institutional jargon but, at the same time, jargon is important to get the conversation going.  Community should be an integral part of any conversation on migration.  The EU has a great track record and footprint in respect of supporting our peace process.  In the early 1990s and mid-1990s, a lot of funding was channelled through the peace and reconciliation programme.  There were various programs to build up capacity at community and local levels after the conflict.  It was basically a question of empowering communities.  On migration, are we doing enough to empower communities at local level and to allay genuine fears about the dignity of people looking for asylum and trying to integrate into communities?  Are we doing enough to place community and community capacity-building at the heart of our deliberations on migration?</p> <p>  My last point is a general one based on my insights from having been to Jordan and Lebanon.  In both countries, around 25% of the people are seeking asylum or are in camps, to one degree or another.  Countries such as Uganda facilitate large numbers coming from South Sudan.  Are we doing enough to provide pathways for graduate teachers within the EU to work with the Red Cross or United Nations to provide assistance to people in their own countries?  We should bear in mind the track record and patterns in this regard.  I must put up my own hand in that, in 1995, I went to the Middle East as a teacher, not for the remuneration although an attraction of the Middle East is that teachers get well paid there.</p><p>As a young teacher in 1995, had a pathway or opportunity been provided I would rather have had the opportunity to go to Africa to do some support work.  Are we providing enough pathways for our European Union graduates to spend time in places like Africa or to help out in dealing with the enormous education needs of people who are seeking asylum and so on?</p><p> I thank Mr. Shotter for attending this morning and for his insights and experience in this area, which will be extremely important in mapping out a comprehensive new pathway for the way we deal with migration.  </p></speech>

It is not a matter for a futuristic debate.  We would like these proposals, which are all urgently needed, to become Europe's present.  In that sense, I would not move them to forward looking discussion.  We need them to be put in place now.  That is the priority.  It is interconnected with a vision of the world and with the image the European Union projects.  We need to put in place a stable system that is in line with our values and to show that Europe can come together on what has been a divisive issue.  It is difficult, but we think it is essential to bring member states and the Parliament together now on this and not to push it out to the future.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct about the importance of community.  We are in Brussels at a European level.  We need to reach out to the local and regional level.  We know the importance of the local and regional level.  In terms of integration, for example, it is important that we get it at local and regional level and we are working in that regard with the European cities.  We have a lot of outreach.  As I mentioned, last week we brought forward with our action plan, which is a core component of the overall comprehensive approach but one that can only be delivered at a local and regional level and the sense of community and local ownership referenced by the Chairman.  It is very important, not only in that dimension, but on a range of policy issues.  When we have consultations we are extremely interested in what that local level can contribute.  We need to work to the extent that we can with the local level and to maximise our outreach in that regard.  </p> <p>  The Chairman asked about Jordan, the Lebanon and Uganda.  I understand the third countries, Jordan and Lebanon, have an awful lot of displaced persons and persons in need of international protection.  This is where the importance of the legal pathways of resettlement comes in.  We brought forward our resettlement recommendation, which was intended to send a signal that at European level we intend to take a stand and provide money to help member states, as we have in the past but we want to send the signal that it will be provided through the EU budget to support member states in their pledging on resettlement.  This involves operations with the international organisations like the UNHCR and it is for the most vulnerable people.  The humanitarian pathways that we provide are of key importance in terms of supporting countries like Jordan and the Lebanon.  The Chairman is correct that this leads-in to my first point in regard to the importance of the partnerships.  We need to build up the partnerships with these countries because a lot of them are under a great deal of pressure.  The pathways for developing local skills, such as teacher exchanges as mentioned by the Chairman, can be very rich and rewarding but it is dependent on a third country being interested in this type of arrangement.  It may be that it can participate and so we need to bring our EU funding possibilities into play through, for example, the ERASMUS programme, to provide policy support in this area.  The point that this underlines is a point I made earlier, which is that we need to have an integrated approach or a whole-of-government approach to our policy making.  There are many useful things happening in the development world through our outreach such as, for example, ERASMUS.  We need to bring together these different policy tools.  These are not in the area of my directorate-general, but across the Commission we need to bring together all of our policy tools to make these interesting partnerships, which can be mutually rewarding as indicated by the Chairman.  </p> <p>  I hope I have covered all of the Chairman's questions.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to have this exchange with it today.</p></speech>

On the Eurodac regulation, Mr. Shotter spoke about the need for it to be amended.  I am not sure if I understood him correctly.  He said that checks can only be made on the basis of applications, not applicants.  Is there a difficulty with the database system or is this determined by the regulation?  Is there a software issue that needs to be dealt with?  My understanding is that initially there was a difficulty around the database but perhaps it is the case that this is determined by the regulation.  I would like to be clear on that point.</p></speech>

We have an IT agency called eu-LISA, which we work with closely on all databases.  It is not an IT issue, it is a regulatory design issue.  We need to correct that.  We will have to engage with the eu-LISA agency to have it sorted.  That will take time to roll-out.  We need to get the regulation right in the first instance.  In regard to these databases, we always have to pay particular attention to data protection requirements and we do and have done so.  I do not think that is the issue here.  We have taken care to design it in a data protection by design way.  The issue is that the regulation did not provide for this.  We need to get that right.  It is issues like that we need to fix.</p></speech>

My colleague Deputy Doherty mentioned issues concerning beneficial ownership to former Minister of State Michael D'Arcy.  I welcome the fact that there have been amendments since then.  I have a question on the submission of the annual return.  Could the Minister of State clarify whether that information will be publicly available?</p> <p>  On beneficial ownership, where someone has a 25% shareholding but decides to split it in two, using a shell company and another mechanism, would we know the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner rather than the intermediaries posing as beneficial owners?  Would that information also be publicly available?</p></speech>

If they are Irish, they will have to produce their PPS number, or the equivalent across the EU.  Apart from that, a person will have to produce a passport.  The Deputy has indicated that a company may sometimes have an investment in the investment limited partnership or in a fund under that partnership.  Her question was on establishing the identity of the shareholders behind the company.  There are two tests.  If one owns over 25%, one is identified as a person involved, but if one owns less than 25% but has a controlling interest in the company, perhaps through other people, one is also deemed a person whose identity must be disclosed.  The legislative phrasing is in line with the anti-money laundering legislation that is already in place.</p> <p>  If a person has a 25% shareholding, the owners of the remaining 75% control the company.  A person with only 15% or 20% does not usually have a controlling interest but someone with a shareholding of less than 25% might have a controlling interest if he or she is working in league with other shareholders who also have shareholdings of less than 25%.  However, only one person &ndash; we are talking about a person, not a company &ndash; can be the beneficial owner.</p> <p>  The important point is that it is up to the general partner in the investment limited partnership to satisfy himself or herself that he or she has all the documentation to get Central Bank approval.  If that person does not do his or her job properly, he will lose the benefit of limited partnership and all the limited liability.  He or she would then be open personally and have no protection under the legislation.  The onus is really on the general partner to satisfy himself or herself regarding everybody who invests in the fund.  If the general partner does not do his or her job, he or she will be liable to direct action by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Part 5 of the Bill amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to include the register of beneficial ownership of investment limited partnerships.  There is an amendment in this legislation regarding social welfare which will ensure that PPS numbers can be allocated and that persons can be identified by name.  This will enable the public to ascertain certain information about who the beneficial owners are, but not their detailed financial information.</p></speech>

It will not be in the annual return.  To get approval for a fund, the general partner has to lodge this information, and any amendment thereto thereafter, with the Central Bank.  There is a register of beneficial ownership, which is separate from the annual return.  That is where the names of all beneficial owners of the fund is made known.  This can be accessed through the Central Bank.  It is like a planning register.  One can find out the name of those involved.  That is a publicly available document.</p></speech>

Could two or more entities separate their visible contacts while still maintaining a beneficial interest in the operation and control of the overall policy thereof?  In other words, could two or three venture capital companies be involved under separate headings so that, to the casual observer, each could be seen as an individual although they were all brought together by the same controlling company?  This would give them undue influence.  Rather than being separate entities, they would represent a single entity disguised as a multitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020120200002#B01000"><p>If an individual invests, it is clear who he or she is.  If a company invests, one will know who the shareholders are.  The beneficial ownership threshold is clearly 25% so if there are three investors in a company which holds more than 25% of shares in a fund, the three beneficial owners have to be made known.  It is not the case that a company must only declare one beneficial owner.  Once any investment company owns more than 25% of shares or has a controlling interest in the fund, each and every one of its shareholders must be declared.  What is also important about this legislation is that the beneficial owners - and there may be multiple beneficial owners - have to produce their PPS numbers.  If they do not have one, they must produce their passport.  No shell company can be an investor without the ultimate beneficial owner's identity being listed on the Central Bank's register of beneficial owners.  If a person is a shareholder, his or her passport must be produced before the company and the fund can get the approval of the Central Bank.  We will have the details of these individuals regardless of where they are in the world.  They may be in America, Canada, Malaysia or anywhere else but, if they do not have an Irish PPS number, we will get a copy of their passports.  There will be multiple beneficial owners.  That is the point.</p></speech>

Is he satisfied that the necessary alarms are in place should there be a need to invoke other powers such as the Central Bank?  In the past, we have sometimes had occasion to comment unfavourably on the lack of alacrity with which some of the supervisory agencies were activated.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that sufficient provision has now been made to ensure that the State and the consumers, both nationally and internationally, are protected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020120200002#B01400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On that issue, the Central Bank is the regulator of these funds.  It is seen internationally as a very strong regulator.  The Deputy points to the history in this area.  There has been a strong response to that history with regard to improvements in how the Central Bank deals with this area and the level of supervision it provides.</p><p>The usual complaint I get is that it is overly bureaucratic, whether in respect of banks or credit unions or funds such as those addressed by the Bill.  I do not accept that complaint because it is an asset for Ireland that we can state internationally that we have good, strong regulation.  If a business comes to Ireland, it will have the benefit of one of the best regulators in Europe.  We are particularly strong in terms of regulation.</p><p> On the issue of investors, this is a is very important point.  The essence of the Bill relates to investment limited partnerships.  As is the case when investing in any shares, if a company or a person invests &euro;100,000, they can lose their money if the product does not work or the company does not succeed but, no matter what happens, their losses are always limited to what they invest.  When investing in a financial product, one takes one's chances.  However, there is absolute regulation  The person who manages the fund has no limited liability and, as such, is fully on the hook personally if they do not do their job properly.  If a company or a fund happens to run into a problem, the individual investor cannot be called on to contribute any more than he or she contributed on day one because his or her liability is limited to his or her original investment.  All one can lose is the money one puts in, in the same way that in every walk of life and in every investment one makes there is no possibility of having to contribute further.  Even if there is a loss, the investor's liability is completely limited to the original investment.  There cannot be any greater loss.  As I stated, we have strong regulation.</p><p> I thank members for their contributions.  It is good that there is broad support for this essential Bill which will help to modernise investment limited partnerships offering in Ireland and will make changes to the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle Act 2015.  The amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 will help to ensure that the Central Bank can operate as the beneficial owner register which we already discussed.  I believe the changes will help to further support Ireland's offering as a top-tier global location choice for financial services.  As I mentioned at the outset, the legislation is consistent with the Ireland for finance strategy and is timed well to take advantage of the capital markets union agenda and to promote the establishment of private equity and venture capital vehicle funds in Ireland.  Every new product like this on the market will lead to additional jobs in Ireland.  People will work in this sector that was not available for Ireland before this legislation.  Not only will it create additional investment, it will also create additional employment and additional taxation for the State.  I thank members for their assistance.</p></speech>

On the remarks of the Minister of State, I did not intend to raise this matter but he mentioned it.  The Central Bank over-regulates credit unions.  It should not be the regulator of credit unions.  It should not be the agency to operate protections for consumers.  That really has to be considered and judged.</p> <p>  As far as regulation is concerned, I think the vulture funds have got away with murder.  They have got away with far too much and have not been regulated as they ought to have been.  It is as if they are able to bob and weave around the regulations and legislation we put in place.  They get away with it and they literally torture people.  I wish to put on record that, as Deputy Durkan has often mentioned, people, including public representatives, cannot contact the vulture funds.  They do not return one's phone calls.  Even when one is making an offer to sort something out on behalf of a constituent, their response is extremely poor.  They are arrogant beyond belief and the language they use in confronting people about the issues of the loans and so on is just horrific.</p> <p>  The last thing I will say about the Central Bank, with which we are arranging a meeting, is that if it had regulated properly at the time that Jonathan Sugarman made his complaint regarding a bank, we might not have ended up in the deep trouble we were in during the ensuing financial collapse. </p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State and his officials.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his officials to the meeting to consider the Supplementary Estimates.  I also thank them for providing the briefing note relating to the Supplementary Estimates.  I invite the Minister to make some brief opening remarks, after which members will contribute.  I remind members that, in accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to items constituting the Estimates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#A00400"><p>I thank the select committee for the opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 before it today.  I apologise to colleagues for not being available earlier today, as the committee had requested.  I was attending a meeting of EU health Ministers, an annual meeting.  It was quite long, but it included matters such as a briefing on Covie-19 vaccines so, regrettably, I could not make it to a meeting this morning.  I thank the committee for accommodating this time today.</p><p>The additional funding I am seeking for 2020 is &euro;514.5 million.  In June, the Oireachtas approved an additional &euro;2 billion to meet the costs of the health service&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, bringing the new adjusted total for the health Vote to &euro;19.9 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates request for Vote 38 relates primarily to the costs associated with Government decisions on Covid made subsequent to the Revised Estimates in June.  This includes additional funding for measures, including personal protective equipment, PPE, testing and tracing, &euro;200 million for this part of the winter plan, escalation of no-deal Brexit measures, one-off funding to support disability services, one-off funding to support palliative care providers and the costs associated with the Covid-19 vaccination programme.</p><p>In June, I said that the additional approved funding of &euro;2 billion would not represent the totality of the cost of Covid-19 for this year and that further funding would be required.  This is that request.  The health Vote has required Supplementary Estimates each year for the past number of years, and the HSE worked very hard last year to bring down the additional funding requirements.  I am committed to working with the HSE and the Department to continue to strengthen the financial management.</p><p>On a side note, I draw members&rsquo; attention to the recently published Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report, &ldquo;How does Irish Healthcare Expenditure compare internationally?&rdquo;.  I am sure colleagues have seen it.  It compares healthcare expenditure in Ireland to that of other OECD countries.  It is the first report of its type that does this accurately.  It is something I have sought previously, as have health committees in the past.  There has been an ongoing perception that Ireland spends more than other countries on healthcare.  The ESRI report shows that when measured <i>per capita</i>and on a like-for-like basis Ireland&rsquo;s total expenditure on healthcare ranks ninth among the EU 15 and it drops to tenth when one considers just the public aspects of healthcare expenditure.  It is a topic I would like to engage on with the committee on another day, if the committee is interested.  Between us, we could re-frame the conversation about healthcare expenditure in Ireland with a view from me and many of my colleagues that if we are not as high up the tables, there is room for us to continue pushing.</p><p>The health service has responded in an unprecedented fashion to Covid-19 and has incurred substantial additional costs in doing so.  The single most significant medium-term cost is PPE.  Included in June&rsquo;s Revised Estimates for the Covid-19 allocation of &euro;1.997 billion was &euro;253 million for PPE.  The HSE has forecast PPE expenditure of &euro;920 million to the end of this year, which includes planned stock levels at year end of approximately 12-years supply in line with clinical management guidelines.  This leaves a supplementary request of &euro;667 million compared to the original allocation.</p><p>The June Revised Estimates approved &euro;208 million for testing and contact tracing.  This initial allocation was to fund testing and contact tracing until 31 August.  Included in the Supplementary Estimates today is a request for &euro;68 million, which is required to fund testing and contact tracing to the end of the year.  Up to the end of November, almost 2 million tests had been carried out.</p><p>A significant element of the request relates to the HSE winter plan.  The Government committed &euro;600 million in total to deal with winter pressures and the additional pressures presented by the pandemic.  This includes &euro;600 million for 2020, which is in today&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimates, and &euro;400 million for 2021, which essentially is January, February, March and April.  The winter plan is increasing the capacity of the health service and ensuring continuity of service by providing additional commute and community resources, staff and beds, as well as funding initiatives including the flu vaccination programme and many other items.  Budget 2021 funds the permanent retention of many of these measures, which is very exciting.</p><p>Taken with the June Revised Estimates, the Supplementary Estimates today bring the total net cost of Covid-19 supports provided to the health service to over &euro;2.5 billion and total health expenditure in 2020 to just over &euro;20.4 billion.  While the financial impact is very significant, the value of this investment in protecting our citizens in the face of the global pandemic is unquantifiable and, I would argue, priceless.  I seek the select committee&rsquo;s approval of the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;514.5 million for Vote 38.</p></speech>

Page 5 of the briefing document refers to 15.6 million doses of vaccines that we could potentially procure.  That is across a range of different pharmaceutical companies and types of vaccines.  It states that the estimated cost would be &euro;117.6 million.  Is that &euro;117.6 million for 15.6 million doses?  We may not draw down 15.6 million doses because we may not need that many.  It depends on what vaccine comes first.  Does the figure of &euro;117.6 million relate to those 15.6 million doses of vaccine?</p></speech>

We have 2.2 million doses from Janssen, 3.3 million from Sanofi and 2.3 million doses from Pfizer.  From Moderna we have 875,000 doses.  The sixth vaccine is from CureVac.

That is fine.  We obviously do not know which vaccine will come first.  We see what is happening in Britain and all the different vaccines that are coming on board are very encouraging.  Aside from the procurement costs, I imagine that there will be storage, distribution and administration costs as well.  Are those factored in?  Have we an estimation of what those costs will be?</p></speech>

The Deputy will remember from the budget debate that there is a pot of several hundred million euro as a provision against Covid measures and such things would be pulled from there.  The distribution should be, relatively, cheaper than the vaccines themselves.  The task force is currently working with the various State agencies on exactly how it would work.  The different vaccines will have different distribution mechanisms.  For example, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at -70&deg;C most of the time, although the temperature can be higher for two or three days before it is used.  The doses must be taken 14 days apart and that has to be quite tightly matched, whereas somebody-----</p></speech>

Different types of vaccines will have different storage requirements and could involve different costs but we have to plan for that.  The expert group will be looking at all of those things.  That figure of &euro;117 million, and whatever storage, distribution or administration costs there will be, is still quite small in the context of the overall cost of Covid.  Covid has cost us tens of billions of euro economically and that is leaving aside the social costs, including the people who have lost their lives, and so on.  Is it the Minister's plan, regardless of which Covid vaccine comes first, that it would be rolled out for free?</p></speech>

I was talking to the public health experts about this today in the context of the statement from the UK yesterday.  It is not necessarily the case that whichever vaccine comes on market first will simply be the one that everybody gets.  My understanding is that different vaccines may be more suitable for different people or age groups.  When we get the validation data from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, which will provisionally sit on 29 December to make a decision on the Pfizer vaccine, at that point or before then the EMA-----</p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where there is any question of access being a problem because of affordability.</p></speech>

Is there a need for additional supports beyond GPs and pharmacies?  Would we have pop-up centres to support GPs, for example?  GPs have a very difficult job and there is a shortage of GPs in some parts of the country.  Are we looking at additional supports to support and add value to the work GPs and pharmacies will do to make sure a vaccine is administered as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

Professor Brian MacCraith's group will report to the Government on 11 December, which is not that far off.  This is exactly the kind of matter on which it will be coming to the Government with details and proposals.</p></speech>

I will be at the top of the queue after all those who are at risk and who should be prioritised.  I certainly will be taking it myself.  There is a need for a public education programme but it must be rolled out by experts, scientists, doctors and nurses because that is who people will listen to.  They may listen to politicians but they will listen to public health experts and those who will know about vaccines.  A number of people, including Professor Karina Butler and many others, have done a first-class job of explaining the importance of vaccines, their history and their safety.  That will be hugely important and I hope that will be part of the plan.</p></speech>

To reiterate, while the EMA is moving faster than normal in making its decisions on the Covid vaccines, it is applying exactly the same quality control.  The only reason it is able to move faster is because it has set up special teams, for obvious reasons, because this is so important.</p></speech>

I raise these questions in the context of subhead J2 and the &euro;200 million that was allocated to fund the winter plan.  I had this conversation with the head of the HSE recently.  Outpatient wait times are now out of control, if we are to be honest.  At the end of October 2015, there 396,000 people waiting to see a consultant.  At the end of October this year, that figure was 612,000.  More worryingly, the number of patients waiting 18 months or longer has gone from 13,353 to 153,000.  Much of this predates Covid.  Obviously, Covid has complicated the problem and added to it but the vast majority of those increases occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.  I will not go through all the increases but they have been incremental every year.  In the context of the additional money the Minister says has been spent on nurses, doctors and beds, does the HSE have a plan?  Does it have a target to reduce outpatient and inpatient wait times?  For example, would it hope that by the end of 2021, outpatient wait times will be reduced by 5%, 10% or 20%?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#B02100"><p>I share the Deputy's concern about this issue.  The situation is probably understated in the figures because referrals have also dropped during Covid.  The numbers relating to unmet or undiagnosed demand are probably higher in reality.  What we are doing at the moment with the HSE is going through exactly that.  We have supplied a very large amount of money for the permanent capacity in the healthcare system, at a community level and at an acute level.</p><p>In addition, we have a large access-to-care fund of about &euro;350 million.</p></speech>

I know all that.  That was well dealt with by the head of the HSE and by the Minister in his budget speech.  I asked if we have a target.</p></speech>

However, despite that, the wait times are going in the wrong direction.  If we are going to spend more money, as we should, on our health service and if there is a plan to recruit more staff and open more beds, that should be matched with a target to reduce outpatient and inpatient waiting times by a percentage.  Is there such a target?</p></speech>

I want to reach the point the Deputy is talking about.  There is much talk about waiting lists and the number of people waiting.  The Deputy's question is a much more important question: what are the waiting times?  If 1 million people are waiting no more than a week, that is fine.  The problem is that people are waiting too long.  As a first step, we will look at the number of people waiting.  I then want to move on quickly to answering the Deputy's question on the amount of time people are waiting which ultimately is much more important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#C01200"><p>I will give two real-life examples of people waiting for treatment.  When we talk about waiting times, it is hundreds of thousands of people.  These are real people with real lived experiences.  One is Elin who has Down's syndrome and suffers from arthritis.  She is non-verbal and her parents have told me she is in constant pain.  She has been waiting for two years for an MRI scan.  She had an appointment in November; it was cancelled.  She was told that the next appointment date is July 2024.  I cannot figure that out.  She is on drugs to dull her pain.  Her GP has advised that has severe consequences for her immune system.</p> <p>  A second example is Sophie Redmond who was outside Leinster House this week.  She is an 11-year old child who was diagnosed with scoliosis in 2017.  Her spine is twisting into her lungs.  She has been waiting nine months for surgery.  The waiting times and the number of children who have been waiting more than 12 months for scoliosis are truly shocking, despite a commitment by the previous Minister for Health.</p> <p>  If we do not hire the specialists, consultants and all the support staff, we will not reduce those waiting times.  Earlier this year, the Minister and I attended the conference of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  I imagine he also engages with the IMO.  They have told me that unless he deals with the two-tier pay issue, we will be unable to hire the consultants we need.  Elin, Sophie and all the other children and adults who are waiting for treatment will need to continue to wait for treatment.  I ask the Minister to speak to the long waiting times.  How can we reduce those waiting times if the HSE cannot recruit the staff that are needed?  If the staff needed are not recruited, we will not get there.</p> <p>  I have raised Be on Call for Ireland with the Minister several times.  I got the most recent figures from the HSE today.  A total of 1,470 people who came home or who applied through Be on Call for Ireland are still job ready.  Half of them are in a pool and still need to go through the final interview process.  The other half have completed all of that and are ready to be hired and have not been hired.  Why is that the case?  I cannot explain how 1,470 people who want to work in our health service despite all the promises and commitments the Minister has made.  In the budget the Government promised to hire 15,000 or 16,000 additional staff and yet these people are ready to be hired.  What is the problem?  I ask the Minister to explain that.  I ask him to deal with the issue of the consultant contracts.</p></speech>

When I was appointed one of the first places I went was to Crumlin where I met the scoliosis team.  This covers the situation for both Sophie and Elin.  The hospital at Crumlin needs another MRI machine and the staff to operate it.  The waiting list at Crumlin for urgent MRI scans under general anaesthetic for children is four years.  For non-urgent scans I believe it is seven years.  That basically means we have no such service.  I am working to put in place as quickly as I can temporary measures to ensure we can carry out paediatric MRI scans under general anaesthetic, which is a rather specialised thing.  I have spoken to the team in Crumlin about exactly what is needed because nobody could stand over the present situation.  It is just not fair.  We are failing these children and failing their parents.  It is just wrong.</p> <p>  Children with scoliosis are waiting for far too long.  Progress has been made and another consultant has been hired.  I will meet representatives of the scoliosis network soon.  I have been in contact with some of the advocates there.  I assure the Deputy that it is a priority for me as it is for us all and was in the last health committee.  What is going on is indefensible and we need to move on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if part of hiring those consultants is sorting out new entrant pay inequality for the post-2012 consultants.  Yes, it is.  I spoke very strongly in support of it in opposition.  I feel just as strongly or even more strongly about it now in my current role.  I have every intention to ask Government to solve that as quickly as possible.  It is urgent and important for the very reasons the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I know how the health system works.  Every year we all strive to achieve particular targets and invariably fall slightly short.

Because there are wider pay considerations with upcoming pay talks, it was not possible at the time to do it.  However, I consider it to be a very high priority.  We are looking to do several good things as soon as possible.</p><p>By as soon as possible, I do not mean in a year or two, I mean as imminently as possible.  The first is to move the public health doctors onto consultant contracts.  They would be to the existing A contracts.  The second is to create the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  The detail of that must be done with the representative body, as it has to be done by agreement, but there is provision in next year&rsquo;s budget for full-year Sl&aacute;intecare contracts.  The third, not necessarily in that sequence, is the new entry pay and equality issue.</p></speech>

There should not be glitches appearing mid-stream giving rise to questions being asked about why this happened.

The winter plan is a big plan worth &euro;600 million, which makes it approximately 20 times bigger than previous winter plans.  The budget for next year is the biggest funding package, but it is also the biggest set of targets in terms of new beds, new hires, community home care, etc.  What we have done with the money is worked with the HSE to put a package together that we believe is right at the edge of what is achievable.  The question was less around what we could do with this much money, it was more how far we think we could go for the winter and through next year.  For example, the question on critical care beds was not how many of them we could have for this much money, it was what is the total number of additional beds we think we can get into the system next year and we will fund that.  The flip side of that is because we are pushing on every single lever, or certainly many of them, in terms of beds, acute beds, community beds, eHealth, new drugs and hiring, inevitably, they are all stretch targets and there may be some of them that will be hard to hit.  Even if we had more money, the view is that it would not really be possible to deliver more because there are only so many people one can hire at any one time.  There are only so many beds one can build at any one time.  We feel we have pushed to the edge of what is possible.</p></speech>

Has any thought been given to non-binding temporary appointments that could be carried forward to the future and approved or not, as the case may be?

The Irish Hospital Consultants Association came out in the past day or two and said there were 728 unfilled consultant posts.  That is correct, in that there are not permanent full-time positions in those posts.</p></speech>

There are fixed-term contracts.  For example, of the 3,446 posts that are currently filled, 2,680 are permanent, 520 are fixed-term contracts and 246 are specified-purpose contracts.  There are actual vacant posts and then there are posts which are filled by temporary contracts or agency staff.  What I want, and what I think we all want, is full-time people in those posts.</p></speech>

For example, agency nursing staff are being used right across the system.

I will move on.  Could I ask the Minister the extent to which Sl&aacute;intecare has bedded into the system, albeit in the face of considerable other challenges?  Has adequate, sufficient or anticipated progress been made in incorporating into the health service the terms of the Sl&aacute;intecare report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#D01900"><p>No.  I do not think so.  If we go back to when the report was published and when the implementation plan was published &ndash; I do not have the latter in front of me &ndash; if we were to pull that out and look at the Gantt charts and what was meant to happen by when, I imagine we would find that Sl&aacute;intecare is behind in an awful lot of areas.  If there is any silver lining within the health service from Covid, it is that a lot of Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives and thinking, in particular around innovation, community-based care and one of the most important areas to me, which is linking up the care pathway for patients and designing it all around the patient, is happening at a level it has not happened before.  For example, I was in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital the other day, with the emergency medicine team, and by following through on the Sl&aacute;intecare principles and by providing the funding in the winter plan, there was nobody on a trolley.  The people who were in the emergency department were in their own rooms.  The emergency medicine consultants said to me that they had not seen that in many years.  One of them said he had just given up on there ever being a solution.  What is interesting is that people are still coming to the emergency department.  Admissions are still at 90% of last year, and people are still being admitted to hospital.  Admissions are still at approximately 90% of the figure for last year, but the number of people waiting on trolleys is at approximately 30% of the figure for last year, and it is because of the Sl&aacute;intecare philosophy on patient flow.  One of the things we have done is put funding in the winter plan into home care, which means the delayed transfers of care happen.  Deputy Durkan was a member of the relevant committee.  The flow is beginning to happen.  We are seeing it.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about elective procedures, which are stockpiled at this stage to a considerable extent.  Was consideration given to referring them under the treatment purchase scheme to the private hospital sector, which has been available?  Some criticism has been made of the fact that it has been underutilised.  To what extent, if at all, has it been utilised?  To what extent can it be utilised in dealing with what will become an interminable backlog?  While some of these issues may not be emergency issues today, they will become emergency issues.  If we wait for everything to become an emergency issue, the whole thing will descend into chaos.</p><p>We should be able to deal with these issues as they arise.  I know the Minister will agree.  What action has been taken to do that and use the treatment purchase facilities, if and when they are available?</p></speech>

The NTPF puts out bids asking, say, who wants to perform 20 hip replacements or 100 cataract operations.  Public and private hospitals can bid if they feel they have spare capacity or they want to ramp things up.  Given the length of the waiting lists, I would like us to be more strategic and ambitious next year, so I am putting together an access to care task force.  There is a pot of &euro;340 million.  I want as much of that as possible to go into the public hospitals, but the private hospitals can be used too, and start to go through the list of more than 700,000 to establish the priority groups.  Rather than putting out bids as we do now, that we might say we have so many thousands waiting on orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat procedures, cataracts, etc. and see if we can get that down.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.</p> <p>  Scoliosis was raised earlier.  For parents with a child awaiting scoliosis procedures, a month is a long time and a year is an awful long time.  In some cases, the wait has gone on far longer, which is interminable and unacceptable.  I ask that the Minister put in place some emergency measures, whether outsourcing to the private sector or something else, to get ahead of that.  </p> <p>  In the area of mental health services, drug detox services are appalling.  I do not blame the Minister for that but I spent recent days trying to access services for people in an emergency situation.  The parents are distraught and unable to get residential services for their teenager or child.  There is no ready access.  To be fair to some of the service providers, they are doing their best but they are totally short of resources, space, and expertise.  Will the Minister urgently call together those involved to help them out and spearhead the attack on the deficiencies that exist, because they are appalling?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan and I are working very closely on this.  We have allocated sizable additional funds next year for exactly what the Deputy has outlined to help the providers and the residential care facilities.  The waiting lists are too long.  Again, during the Covid pandemic, many things were done that had never been done.  People were helped and wrap-around services were provided, but we can do much more.  The Minister of State and I will push that hard.</p></speech>

On my way to the D&aacute;il this morning, I heard several radio station carrying sound bites of the Minister's counterpart in Britain, Matt Hancock, announcing how they had the refrigeration facilities and the capacity to roll out a Pfizer vaccination beginning next week.  A comprehensive plan is being developed here but, on foot of the bold plans in Britain, have plans in Ireland progressed further?  Can the Minister give the committee a timeline or some detail on how the roll-out will happen?  There is a debate whether distribution should be at GP level, where they know their vulnerable patients or whether other State mechanisms should be used, perhaps the Army, or whatever is needed undertake an emergency mass vaccination of the population?</p></speech>

The EMA will authorise the vaccines.  The exact timeline is as follows: on 1 October the EMA started rolling reviews of three of the vaccines, from AstraZenica, Pfizer and Moderna; yesterday, Pfizer and Moderna submitted their marketing authorisation applications to the EMA; and yesterday, the agency announced it was starting a rolling review of the Janssen vaccine.  The EMA has been working hard in the background, has set up special task forces to examine this and the first two companies made their submissions yesterday.  Yesterday, Emer Cooke told us that if the applications are sufficiently robust and complete, and hopefully they are, an EMA opinion for their marketing authorisation within the EU and, therefore, Ireland could be issued within weeks.</p> <p>  Specifically on the Pfizer vaccine, she said the committee for medicinal products for human use planned to conclude its assessment during an extraordinary meeting scheduled for 29 December, at latest.  The same committee plans to conclude its assessment of the Moderna vaccine during an extraordinary general meeting scheduled tentatively for 12 January.  Once we get EMA approval, if we get such approval, as with the UK, we can distribute it in a matter of days.</p> <p>  Special refrigeration is required for the Pfizer vaccine.  That arrived in Ireland last week.  The supply chains and logistics are being put in place now.  This morning, I spoke with Professor Brian MacCraith who is leading the task force.  He is confident that the distribution networks will be in place if and when the EMA authorises the various vaccines.</p></speech>

The Minister&rsquo;s opening statement referred to the cost to the State of PPE.  There were many teething problems early on with ill-fitting gowns and gloves, and masks that were sub-specification or did not work properly.  Has this supply chain changed?  Have we adequate supplies at a quality that meets the needs of our front-line health staff?</p></speech>

The Supplementary Estimates for which I seek the committee&rsquo;s approval today include a substantial amount for PPE for this year.</p> <p>  To give a sense of scale, the HSE normally spends &euro;15 million on PPE annually; this year it will be close to &euro;1 billion.  The Supplementary Estimates contains almost &euro;700 million just for PPE.  They put in place very comprehensive systems.  I get a weekly report on PPE.  The reports I have received to date are that the various supply chains are working well and the quality control issues have been dealt with.  We are also providing PPE to the nursing homes.</p></speech>

It is not his responsibility but there is optional PCR testing at point of departure at our airports.  For some, it could cost &euro;100 on top of their air ticket to fly.  It is a transport issue but if it gives rise to increased Covid cases it will become the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Should testing at airports be compulsory so that we know that people coming in and out of Ireland are Covid-free and not adding to risk levels here?</p></speech>

I do not think that public money should be used for that; I would prefer to use that to hire doctors and nurses, pay for vaccines and so on.  I think Ireland and Finland are the only orange zone countries in the EU.  For anyone leaving Ireland for another member state, the rule states they must have had a negative PCR test within three days of flying.</p><p>Regardless of what anyone does on the way out, it is the journey back that we are selfishly interested in.  We have a position if one is coming into Ireland from any country in the EU, other than Finland, or from any country within the wider EEA, although Iceland is in the orange zone as well, and most of the world, including the western world, is red.  The unambiguous position on that is that when one comes in, one must restrict one's movements for two weeks.  One can shorten that to five days if on the fifth day one takes a test and that comes back negative.  That is the situation for Ireland and for most of the rest of the EU as well.</p></speech>

Many nurses have been in contact with all of us regarding their annual Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, registration charge.  As a teacher, I had to pay something similar each year to the Teaching Council and one would bemoan it when one would see this letter coming in.  On top of all they do in the workplace, teachers have to pay this charge to be officially recognised.  Nurses feel that the charge this year has come at a time they are giving everything on the front line.  The charge is &euro;100 whereas their counterparts in Scotland have been given a &pound;500 gratuity.  Has the Department been engaging with NMBI to look at that charge for the year it is in terms of potentially waiving it?</p></speech>

It is not something that has been considered.  This issue has largely come up today as part of a good and well-worked campaign.  I was asked about it early this morning for the first time and it is something I am happy to consider.  As it happens, if it is &euro;100 and we have approximately 30,000 nurses, that would be a cost of approximately &euro;3 million.  The Supplementary Estimates we are considering do not include &euro;3 million for that.</p> <p>  Nurses have done an extraordinary job and more so than ever this year.  It has been incredible.  When the rest of us were staying at home, particularly during the first wave, they were going to work every day and keeping people safe.  I would be very well-disposed to doing something to try to recognise that.  I cannot give a commitment because it is additional spending and it requires a Government decision but I will be looking at it closely.</p></speech>

There is a successful scheme operating in the north-west, specifically in Sligo, with backing from the Department.  It is a simple scheme whereby there is a pathway between appointments and follow-up care.  It is shared between hospitals and local private optometrists.  It is proven to be successful and has driven down waiting times, as well as times in transitioning between phases of care.  The previous Government promised and the new programme for Government promises a national roll-out of that.  Has the Minister examined advancing that?  I know there is a huge amount of work on his plate but has he looked at advancing that roll-out to a national scale?</p></speech>

It is Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is joining up pathways of care and designing and wrapping the care around the patient.  It is an excellent idea.</p></speech>

It is another feature of the programme for Government.  There has been a serious beefing up of home care hours in budget 2021.  Just yesterday we had another report released, which again gives us an insight into the major strain nursing homes have been under since March.  Many families with elderly people in the care of nursing homes are saying that if the mechanisms were in place, they would much rather have those loved ones in a home environment where they could be cared for by a care professional.</p> <p>  I have been digging deep into all of this and there is a certain type of person who goes into working in home care in Ireland and the OECD has statistics on this.  Home carers in Ireland are 80% female and they are of a certain demographic.  There is a trend in western European countries but there are also barriers to these people entering this type of work.  Many people who have made representations to me would like to take on this type of work.  One can train quickly and successfully as a care assistant but there are barriers if one is on a low income or in taxation bands that do not make it worthwhile.</p> <p>  In any given community such as the rural community I come from, there could be 14 or 15 people in direct nursing home care and there could be two or three people at community level in receipt of a social welfare payment or in a low-paid job.  If procedures were to be adjusted and if there was a little bit of ingenuity between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance, a lot more people at ground level could be helped to get to the statutory home care phase an awful lot more quickly.  They tell me the barriers mostly relate to taxation bands and finance.  There needs to be an incentive to do it.  Statutory home care is a feature of the programme for Government and I would like to hear if that has been progressed since the Minister took up office.</p></speech>

When we launched the expert review on nursing homes, one of the leads, who is a consultant geriatrician, was comparing the percentage of people we have in nursing homes in Ireland with the percentage in Finland.  Finland is probably seen as the best example.  I cannot remember the exact figure but it is at a fraction of what we are at.  The goal is to keep people at home.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is taking a lead on this.  We have fully funded the interRAI system for next year.  We are rolling that out straightaway and a number of assessors are being hired.  They will do a full assessment of every person's needs.  Rather than saying one can have five hours or six hours, it will be a bespoke individual assessment.  The programme for Government commitment on increased hours was for 5 million hours over five years.  We have allocated funding in the health budget for next year for all 5 million of those hours next year.  That does not mean we will not do any more in the future.  We are going for this.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that it is not enough to have the systems and the money.  We have to have the carers and to do that we have to look at caring as a profession and at the kind of supports they need.  The exact matters the Deputy is talking about will be considered by myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the sector.  I am excited about this.  If we get this right, we can revolutionise growing older in this country and have far more people living at home for longer.  Our length of stays in nursing homes and so forth are out of kilter with many other countries.  There is a real opportunity here.</p></speech>

Sometimes one has to let these briefings in one ear and out the other but I was told clearly that there is a significant cohort of people willing to take up employment.  These people might respond to an advertisement online or in the local press that is seeking for care assistants and offering to help them to get trained up but people quickly discover there is a large number of barriers.  Those barriers should be broken down.  For a lot of these people it might have been a choice to be a stay-at-home parent for a number of years.  Perhaps if the rules were changed and if they were allowed to go out during school hours and provide home care within their communities for that four or five hours, be freed up in the evening and not have their income overly taxed, it would be a great incentive to get this growing at grassroots level in an organic way.  I hope those aspects can be considered in parallel with the health aspects because income, taxation and threshold barriers are preventing more people joining.  They cannot recruit people.</p></speech>

The high number of people in nursing homes is a direct result of Government policy, which incentivises it.  At various times, a figure has been put on the number of people who are in nursing homes and who should not be there and who do not need or want to be there.  However, Government policy has made that happen.</p> <p>  There is potential for significant additional employment if we respect older people's desire to stay at home.  However, it is important that it is decent quality work so that people have guaranteed hours.</p><p>It should not just be minimum wage work.  Much of it is currently like that without any kind of job security.  That has to be considered when moving to a new system.  It is essential that the health authorities work with the housing authorities, because there are a small number of examples of supported housing complexes with health services provided.  That is an ideal situation where a person is not able to stay in his or her own three bedroom house, with the upstairs part not being accessible or with the house needing proper maintenance.  There are a few examples of where it has been done really well and we should learn from that.  Housing has to be part of that solution.</p></speech>

A number of us raised the waiving of nurses' registration fees with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il this morning and he categorically ruled it out.  It would be welcome if the Minister tried to change the Taoiseach's mind on that.</p> <p>  There are two concerns about the decision to approve and roll out the vaccine in the UK.  According to Kingston Mills, this has not been tested on children, which is a problem.  It has not been established that the Pfizer vaccine is effective in cutting infectiousness.  It may prevent somebody from getting the virus but it does not mean that the person is not a carrier.  To what extent are those issues being pursued at a European level?  Does the Minister expect that it is likely that approval will be given with caveats about key elements, as has happened in the UK?  I understand that there is a requirement for states to take on liability in the event that anything goes wrong.  That is potentially a blank cheque.  We do not know what is involved.  In normal circumstances, the fact that pharmaceutical companies have to carry the liability for their products is a break that is put on developing new vaccines or medications, which can be good because companies have to be cautious in developing new products to ensure that they do not do harm.  Is the Minister concerned that because of the fact that the significant responsibility of taking on liability by a pharmaceutical company is being waived, there could be issues with a rush to roll out the vaccine?</p></speech>

They made a few points.  We are going through the European Medicines Agency, EMA, process.  The UK has its own process.  That authorisation comes with advisory notes.  Our public health people are saying that Ireland is signed up to six people.  They are at various stages with the EMA.  It looks like a decision will be made about the Pfizer vaccine first, then the Moderna vaccine.  They are saying that different vaccines may be appropriate for different groups.  Some vaccines may work better for people who are more vulnerable to it and people of different ages.  They are looking to the EMA to provide this advice.  Our experts will look at the UK&rsquo;s advice too, but we will take our lead directly from the EMA.  As the EMA issues that advice, it may well indicate the priority groups and say that it is not looking to vaccinate children in the short term, and so on.  We will take our lead from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the public health teams.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about liability.  The EU has waived liability, so Ireland, as with every other member state, is indemnifying the pharmaceutical companies to get access to the vaccine.  I am not concerned from a safety perspective because the EMA is the regulator and I have been assured that even though the process is quicker because of the nature of Covid, the same standards and bars have been set as for every other medicine that we take.  It will have the same safety standards as everything else that we go into a chemist to buy, whether it is prescribed or not.</p></speech>

There has been some moving around of budgets too.  One relates to capital spending on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We know that there has been an underspend of &euro;166 million.  We had the children&rsquo;s hospital board here to address the delays which have happened for various reasons and the underspend.  I was told that &euro;100 million of that is being ring-fenced and carried over to next year, but another &euro;66 million has been diverted into other expenditure.  Will the Minister tell us where that has gone?</p></speech>

The Estimate before us today does not include any additional spending, so the allocation the Deputy is talking about is for the total budget.  Today&rsquo;s Estimate does not include any capital element.  The Deputy is right.  The site was empty for quite some time because of Covid.  There was underspending.  We have carried as much of it forward as we are allowed to by the accounting rules.  I will get the Deputy a breakdown of where the other money was allocated.</p></speech>

We were talking about Sl&aacute;intecare earlier, and apart from reorienting services, a key element of Sl&aacute;intecare, if not the key element, is removing cost as a barrier to accessing care.  There was an announcement in last year&rsquo;s budget of a number of measures which would improve affordability of care with medical cards, prescription charges and the drugs payment scheme.  Unfortunately, the current Government decided not to implement that in July as had been promised and people expected, and it was delayed until November.  What was the total saving from delaying those measures?</p></speech>

It was delayed because in last year&rsquo;s budget, bringing in those measures was contingent on savings that did not happen because of Covid.  When I came into office, there was no money available to bring those measures in.  Even though it was in last year&rsquo;s budget, I had to go back to Government with a new memo and say that I wanted additional funding to bring those measures in this year.  Not only were there no savings, an additional cost was required for having brought them in.</p></speech>

I will come back to the issue of consultants' contracts.  There are a number of questions around that and I am aware the Minister has spoken about some of them already.  We cannot run the health service unless we have enough consultants.  It is clear there is a major problem.  Whether it is with consultants or nurses, why do we continue with agency staff when it is much cheaper to employ full-time permanent staff?  Why are so many consultants, in particular, doing agency work?  Is it the case that a person is better paid as an agency doctor over and above what he or she would earn on contract?  Are there other advantages compared with being on contract?  </p></speech>

I have stipulated that next year, the hiring will be done along the safe staffing levels that have been agreed.  There is, therefore, now a new system in place, which was brought in for the pilots, where the acuity of the patients in each ward is basically put into a computer and it will tell what the staffing needs are.  That is what we are scaling up to.</p> <p>  The HSE believes, therefore, the levels it has put in for hiring next year are at the edge of what is possible.  If we could, I would replace all agency staff immediately and I believe the HSE would too.  The plan is to get to a point where, certainly for the day to day work, agency staff simply are not needed because one we have the safe staffing levels.</p> <p>  I will get the Deputy a note on the consultants.  Certainly, from all the conversations I have had over the years, the vast majority would prefer to be on permanent contracts.  The agency work suits some, in fairness, but the vast majority want to be on those contracts.  To be honest, they have never really mentioned pay reasons to me.  They have always said they want to be part of a permanent team, whatever their specialty is, and spend the next number of years of their life being part of that team and growing that service.</p> <p>  My understanding is that we need to fix the new entrant pay and equality fast.

We want to move to public-only work in the public hospitals.  This still all has to be worked out; this is my view.  All new hires should be on the new Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  I imagine as soon as we have it in, everyone on an A contract will move across straight away because it is kind of the same but with more money and supports around it.  Then, there is a good conversation to be had with those on the B contracts to see who wants to move across.  My view and, I believe, that of Deputy Shortall is that we want as many as possible on the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I had not heard that before.</p> <p>  My final question is on that pressing issue on the need to create those public health consultant posts.  It is the only specialty where they are not consultants.  This year, of all years, given everything the public health people have been doing, let us not have a strike.  Is the Minister prepared to upgrade the existing specialists, of whom there are only approximately 60, to give them consultant posts?</p></speech>

Our public health consultants, doctors and public health specialists have been looking for this for decades for all sorts of reasons, for example, for professional recognition, professional standing and the money they earn, which is approximately &euro;111,000 or &euro;113,000 at the moment.  Their consultant colleagues on A contracts are earning tens of thousands more than that and, indeed, the Sl&aacute;intecare contract, when it comes in, will be a significant increase again.  They have worked hard this year.  Never has it been more obvious how important the public health groups are.</p></speech>

Is there going to be a public health consultant contract?  Yes, there is, and the exact mechanism for how that will work must be worked out between the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and the Department or Government.  That process is under way.  The business case for all of it is with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have given a commitment that there will be consultant contracts.  The IMO has a view on the exact mechanism and how it works.  We must respect that and go through that process.  I understand the frustration of the people in question.

That is a positive development.</p> <p>  I will go back to the Supplementary Estimates.  I will bounce around a bit so I hope that is okay.  On section 4.3(7), overseas treatment, there was a &euro;74.1 million overseas treatment estimated spend and the current Estimates have a &euro;32 million underspend.  In the section on capital funds, the document states the Department has written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ask that funds be carried over to 2021.  Is that also the case for the overseas treatment fund?  It is a bullet point on the overseas treatment surplus of &euro;32 million.  Obviously, there will be a backlog and Brexit presents a number of challenges in that regard.  Is that money now unavailable to us?</p></speech>

Section 4.2 of the briefing document relates to Brexit preparation.  The Minister will excuse my ignorance.  I am trying to get to grips with these Supplementary Estimates.  My interpretation of the wording is that the section implies there is a pot of money to look at things like ports and airports, to which the Department has contributed &euro;7.116 million along with other Departments.

Given that there are some shared treatment services across the island, I wonder if there is a separate fund dealing with some of those issues.  I guess the one I am particularly thinking of is the human milk bank in Enniskillen, which is one of the few examples of a shared-island service that really works.  They supply 22 neonatal units across the country.  They organise an amazing band of volunteers.  There is a great deal of volunteer help but it also needs State support.  The service is quite fearful of the impact of Brexit and the need for supports, such as in IT and in distribution.  I wonder if that is something the Department has funding for or has considered.</p></speech>

We have all probably been contacted by constituents who, unfortunately, have been unable to be with their loved ones as they pass away, some due to Covid and some due to whatever conditions they have as normal.  The once-off funding, as outlined, is hugely welcome and is desperately needed.  That is fantastic.  However, I note from the outline given that it is very much geared towards existing specialist palliative care settings.  Is there any funding available, or can that be broadened out, to include additional financial supports to palliative care or end-of-life care in a hospital setting because that is an issue?</p></speech>

The &euro;10 million that we are looking at here was a one-off fund we created for the voluntary sector, &euro;8.5 million of which went to voluntary hospices around the country.  As for the other &euro;1.5 million, there are community palliative care voluntary services in a few of the community healthcare organisations which we funded as well, and then we gave Laura Lynn Foundation, the Irish Hospice Foundation and two others &euro;100,000 each.</p> <p>  We are putting additional money in for next year as well.  For example, probably the nicest thing I have done since I got this job was to go and meet representatives of the Laura Lynn Foundation last week.  I had the extraordinary pleasure of doing a video call with them a while ago and saying that we are allocating &euro;1.5 million to them next year.  Their funding is approximately &euro;4.5 million and they have never got anything from the State.  I had the immense pleasure of being able to say to them that on top of the &euro;1.5 million, they are getting &euro;750,000 of the &euro;10 million we are now talking about.  I had the absolute joy - it is the first time I got a clap since I became Minister for Health - of going to meet them last week and saying that the &euro;1.5 million we are giving them next year is now in the base.  They are getting that from now on.  There is really strong support from the Government for palliative care and for the hospice sector.  That is only one example.</p></speech>

It will have to be rolled out across certain sectors first.  We have heard at previous committee meetings - it might have been at the Committee of Public Accounts - that the HSE has relatively high levels of non-compliance with public procurement processes.  In the past few years, it has fluctuated up and down.  It was 28% in 2018.  It was 49% in 2016.  The Department and the HSE are doing huge amounts of work to try to lower those numbers.  Has the HSE undertaken a procurement review on the PPE procurement process for quarters 2, 3 and 4?</p></speech>

It is a really good question and one I have asked.  I wrote to the HSE quite some time ago to say almost exactly what the Deputy has said.  Given the vast amount of money that is being spent, much of it outside the normal checks and balances that are in place for procurement, I asked whether the HSE could do an audit of it and come back to us.  It has given an undertaking to do that.  We are all quite rightly focused on the appropriate expenditure and the good expenditure of PPE.  When this audit comes back, it is entirely possible that there will be have been purchases outside of the normal procurement process.  In fact, I suspect we will see that.  When that happens, and it probably will be the Committee of Public Accounts which will look at it, and maybe this committee as well, let us remember the pressure that they were under and that we all put them under to do whatever was required.</p></speech>

We all felt the pressure throughout the year.  In general, in these times of stress we can learn a lot about the process.  We have a way to go in Ireland in terms of our procurement process.  I wonder whether the Department will be doing a more general value-for-money review of Covid expenditure during 2020 at some stage.</p></speech>

It is certainly happening on PPE, which would be one of the biggest amounts.  For example, in the amount we are looking at here, &euro;667 million is for PPE alone.  It is a vast amount of money.  Testing and tracing, obviously, involved a huge amount of money as well.</p></speech>

Appendix 3 sets out the initiative funded under the 2020 winter plan, all of which is worthwhile and I am not questioning.  There are measures that we all have wanted to see happen for years, such as an increase in community beds, GP-structured access to diagnostics and community health networks.  I understand that these are in some cases putting down the systems that will make Sl&aacute;intecare possible.  However, they seem like fairly long-term commitments and they will add to the base.  Has the Minister any response to IFAC's position?  Is there a plan for funding it in the long term?</p></speech>

We have done it quite differently this year.  Last year, the winter plan cost &euro;30 million.  This year, it is &euro;600 million.  We are doing things at a completely different scale.  In fairness, what we designed with the HSE was a winter plan.  So far, it is working.  The trolley numbers are at 30% of what they were last year but presentations are still at 90%.  We are entering into the biggest pinch point, now through the end of December, but so far it is working.</p> <p>  We have not entirely designed it as a once-off winter plan.  We have said that there is &euro;600 million for the winter plan.  I am looking for the permission of Deputies for &euro;200 million of this for the current year.  In next year's base, there is &euro;400 million for January, February, March and April of next year.  Essentially, what we are doing with the rest of the budget for next year is saying that this is permanent now.  I refer to the extra beds, critical care beds, ward beds, community beds, community assessment hubs and the extra staff that we are hiring.  We have designed the budget to bring capacity up for the winter really quickly but then lock it in as permanent capacity.  IFAC is correct that many of the commitments for the winter plan are permanent funding commitments.</p></speech>

This is one of the reasons that the budget was so high.  I felt it quite right to point at the Government budgets but as I said at the start, if the Deputy has not already done this I suggest she look at the ESRI report on comparative healthcare spending, led by Professor Maev-Ann Wren led, which is so important.  The narrative in Ireland for years has been that we spend more than anybody else and we do not get the outcomes.  The ESRI&rsquo;s report is really complicated stuff when one compares country to country but it has done it.  It turns out that we are ninth or tenth of the EU 15.  I say as Minister for Health, let us proudly invest more in healthcare.  IFAC may not agree but it has a different job.</p></speech>

I can fully understand if the Minister does not have an update for the committee today but would it be possible for the committee to get an update on whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform comes back to the Minister on that carryover?</p></speech>

We have had a very interesting discussion at this Estimates session.  However, it has been very wide-ranging.  Much of what governs our healthcare system is how we spend our money.  The committee cannot approve or disapprove an Estimate but perhaps if we were to take a position on an Estimate there might be a more targeted or directed questioning of the budgets.</p></speech>

On PPE, as the Minister stated, annually the HSE would pay a fraction of that.  It is an astronomical amount of money.  I am not aware if the Minister has been watching what is happening in Britain in respect of PPE, where it was bought at prices that were completely inflationary compared to what it would normally cost.  Where was most of the new PPE sourced?  Was it outside the EU, inside the EU, or even in Ireland?  Can I have a breakdown of that, please?</p></speech>

Together with the Deputy, I was highly critical of the deal at the time and sought for it to be ended early.  I did not think it was the best way to proceed and am firmly and repeatedly on the record to that end.  Even at the time, however, I was saying that it was easy for me to say that and a review will be done.  Inevitably, it will show that with the benefit of hindsight, were one doing it again, it would be done differently.  Indeed the conversations that we are having with the private hospitals now are not about simply taking over their hospitals and that is because of what was learned the last time.  One would probably do it on a pay-for-use basis and this would seem to me to be the sensible way to do it.  Again we have to be very cognisant of the environment at the time.  We were all looking at the television and seeing car parks in Italian hospitals with patients who were very sick.  The HSE, the Department and the Government at the time did what was required to secure that capacity instantly.</p></speech>

The Covid-19 patients were all brought into the public hospitals and the private hospitals were to try to keep the urgent non-Covid-19 public work going.  I may be slightly wrong here but, for example, my understanding is that the public St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital took over St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital&rsquo;s operating theatres and so forth and many of the urgent cancer work for public patients ended up being done there using their resources.  However, there were other hospitals such as, for example, the Bon Secours Hospital, Limerick, where there was a very small volume of additional care undertaken.  It is a mixed bag.  At the time, I submitted parliamentary questions to get exactly what the numbers were for different types of procedures done and I presume that all that information is available.  I can get that information for the Deputy if he would like.</p></speech>

At the time, the Government acted because it saw what was happening across mainland Europe.  As the Minister said, however, there are significant question marks as to whether this was cost effective for the taxpayer.  When all of the dust settles on Covid-19, questions will be asked about the amount of money that was given to private hospitals because these are run by some very wealthy people who have done very well out of this deal.  There are significant questions as to what we got back as taxpayers.  As the Minister has said himself, this was wrong deal.</p></speech>

I wish to apologise because I know that the Deputy was one of the signatories to that Private Members' motion.  I received it last Friday and worked on a response to it in the Department over the weekend and I talked to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, about exactly what we could put in place.  I put in a lot of work but, unfortunately, I could not attend.  I wanted to be in the Chamber today and partake in the debate but there was an annual EU health ministers meeting that I could not get out of.  I had to be there, for obvious reasons, so I apologise for not attending the debate.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will know from the countermotion, we have secured an exemption to allow student nurses access to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  One of the things that the INMO quite rightly put to me was that there are student nurses who do not qualify for PUP because a job still exists but the nurses cannot take it up.  Students who were working in a shop or bar that had to close are entitled to PUP because that job is not there.  However, some student nurses found themselves in a position whereby their job still existed, the agency was still hiring or the care home was still taking people in, but, for obvious reasons related to Covid-19, those nurses could not possibly be working in a hospital during the week and a nursing home at the weekend.  There were infection prevention reasons that could not happen.  I did not think that was fair at all so we have secured an exemption for these students if they can show any loss of earnings.  Anyone who can say they were earning money and are not any more will get PUP, and this exemption applies only to them.  I have also secured a commitment that any healthcare costs associated with getting sick at work will be covered.</p> <p>  The INMO was keen for an independently verified review to take place which would not just reflect the Department's view of the world.  The INMO wants a meaningful input into that report.  We have agreed with all of that and I think those measures are all in the countermotion.  I want the INMO to input to the review.  I want independent verification of the report and we will then publish it.  It will happen in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

Most of us accept that it was the right road to go down, but many looking in found it frustrating that many of the hospitals were not being fully utilised.  There was a lack of flexibility within the HSE or the Department.  Somebody should have called stop and said that we need to use the private hospitals for something.  That was not going on and was frustrating to many looking in at the system.  We would like to think that we learn from these mistakes in case we are ever in that situation again.  The HSE seems to be such a monolith that no one was able to make that decision.  Would the Minister accept that as a fair analysis of what happened, particularly in the first lockdown?</p></speech>

I do not think the HSE would do the same again if put in the same situation.  It is obviously easy for all of us to talk about it now.  Could or should what the Chairman has just said have happened?  Could people have stepped in and said that we need to get the utilisation rates up?  Along with the Chairman and Deputy Kenny, I was advocating for exactly that.  At the start, there was not a lot of it but the HSE, in fairness, was trying to do something that no one had ever done before.  It took over an entire hospital sector.  There were legal and IR implications and all sorts of different implications.  As quickly as it could, the HSE began to get the volumes up.  I was getting replies to parliamentary questions showing that the volumes of care were going up, although they did not at the start.  Perhaps it could have worked better.  The Chairman will remember the pressure the HSE was under in taking over a whole hospital system and having it ready overnight.  We were all afraid of the worst-case scenario in which our public hospitals filled up and we would end up with thousands of Covid-19 patients quickly filling up the private hospitals as well.  The Army was setting up tents in car parks.  That needed to be looked at, and it has been, to inform our current talks with the private hospitals.  We need to be cognisant of what was going on at the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#L00600"><p>I apologise for being late, I was at another meeting.  The Minister was talking about the issue of community paramedicine.  I have raised this matter before and have seen no evidence of a change for the coming year.  We have taken on an additional 21,500 whole-time staff in the HSE.  Including part-time people and everything else, 30,000 extra people are now working in the HSE compared with five years ago.  Of that, only 70 are public health nurses.</p> <p>  I put this question to representatives of Sl&aacute;intecare who were before the committee.  They were shocked that only 70 additional public health nurses have been taken on in recent years.  We have gone from 1,560 public health nurses to 1,630, there or thereabouts, and I have seen no evidence that that will change.  The Minister talks about community paramedicine.  We need nurses in the community.</p> <p>  A similar situation also applies to public health doctors.  I am advised that at the most recent meeting, the Department was prepared to allow only 30 people in under that category.  There was no agreement over all public health doctors.  It seems to be sending out the wrong messages.  On the one hand, we have Sl&aacute;intecare saying one thing and, on the other hand, there is a policy that allowed an increase of 20.9% across all sectors of healthcare in the past five years, including nurses, junior doctors, consultants and administrative staff, while there has been less than a 5% increase of public health nurses.  Are we serious about Sl&aacute;intecare or is it all bluster?  I am becoming more and more convinced that a lot of it is bluster.  I can see no evidence that we are recruiting people to work in the public healthcare sector.  That is one issue.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates to cataract operations.  I raised this at the previous meeting and I raise it again.  The response I got from the HSE was nothing but downright appalling.  All I got back was a memo defending people travelling abroad to Northern Ireland for cataract operations, without any response to the question I had raised, which was about having people examined at an early stage, put on the list for the procedure and then, if the public health sector cannot deal with doing the cataract operation, it comes in under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  There was no reply to that question.  The reply I got was appalling and extremely defensive of the fact that we are sending people out of the country to have a basic operation.  That really needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  There is a third issue on which I wish to touch.  My understanding is that there are 685 applications for GP training this year.  That is the largest number ever.  One in eight of our existing GPs are over 60.  What can we do?</p><p>Can additional training places be provided?  Obviously, that would be done with co-operation.  For a GP to go into training, he or she needs a practice that is prepared to take him or her on and go through the whole programme.  What discussions have been held with the Department about increasing the number of GP trainees in order that we will have enough people in three to five years' time to fill the vacancies that arise?</p><p> I wish to refer to an issue that I raised recently with Revenue.  We gave a special dispensation to meat factories to bring in people to work in particular jobs and earn less than &euro;30,000.  Some of my colleagues have mentioned that we need people in the community to provide home care and everything else.  A huge number of people live in the same home as those to whom they provide 24-7 care five days a week.  As happens in other countries, these carers are provided with food and accommodation.  However, the cost of providing accommodation and food is not taken into account by Revenue when assessing people for tax purposes.  Let us say that a person wants to bring in someone from abroad who is experienced in the provision of home care and care of the elderly.  The same criteria are not in place for people from abroad to come here and provide home care.  Interestingly, in Israel, more than 5,000 people are allowed to enter to provide home care full-time because there are not enough people to do the work and we will face that challenge here as well.  We need to provide a home care package where people call two or three times a day to different individuals.  However, there are those who need permanent home care.  I ask that this issue be examined.</p><p> In terms of the community healthcare issue, I am not convinced that this happens and there is no evidence to support the claim.  Can the Minister indicate where in HSE budget has money been set aside to deal with this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2020120200002#M00200"><p>I will go through the various questions and the Deputy is free to tell me to stop whenever he wants.  The overall question is linked to the community healthcare question of whether Sl&aacute;intecare is for real.  For me, Sl&aacute;intecare is a roadmap to universal healthcare and having high-quality care when people need it.  I am taking this matter deadly seriously and I hope the Deputy can see that from the &euro;600 million winter plan and the budget for next year, which is the biggest additional healthcare budget in recent times, possibly ever.  It has the single biggest target ever for acute beds, critical care beds, hospital doctors, hospital nurses, community beds, step-down beds, rehabilitation beds and community clinicians, which is daunting because this is a massive task.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will see when he looks at the budget, we have very deliberately broken it up into big chunks one of which relates to community care.  We are looking at a level of investment in community care for next year that is unprecedented for all of the reasons he outlined.  This is in today's Revised Estimate because it included &euro;200 million of the &euro;600 million winter plan.  If one considers the whole approach to the winter plan, it is exactly that.  It is home care hours, GP access to diagnostics, public health nursing and home intervention teams.  Let me give a brilliant example.  There is a pilot scheme, called frailty teams, at St. Columcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown, County Dublin.  Teams of an advanced paramedic, advanced nurse practitioners, occupational therapists and, sometimes, consultant doctors are sent to the houses of people who normally would be brought to the emergency department of St. Vincent's Hospital.  The teams stabilise people in their homes.  The cars that accompany the teams contain some advanced diagnostic equipment.  The teams can conduct a teleconference with the emergency departments and specialists at St. Vincent's and in St. Columcille's.  The pilot scheme has led to a 90% reduction in the number of people having to go to hospital.  I am seeking the &euro;200 million in funding to which I refer in order do these amazing things.</p> <p>  The next issue is cataracts.  I acknowledge that the Deputy has raised the issue before and is absolutely spot on.  My understanding of the issue that he has again raised with me is as follows.  The problem with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is that one can only access it if one has been examined by a consultant.</p></speech>

That is not right and not what we should be doing.  As part of the access to care thinking for next year, which is the pot of &euro;340 million, these are exactly the kinds of issues that I want to examine.  It is a great example.</p></speech>

The issue required a policy response and we will work with the HSE on exactly that.</p> <p>  In terms of training for GPs, absolutely.  Really, it is a conversation that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and I need to have about providing additional places.  I take the point that Deputy Colm Burke made about the ageing GP population.  It is fantastic to see such interest.</p></speech>

There is a workforce planning team that is doing a flow analysis on all of the different aspects such as how do we get people in, are we training enough people, are we retaining them and so forth.</p> <p>  In terms of foreign carers or home care workers and tax reductions, I do not know.  I guess it would have to be a conversation between the Minister for Finance and me.  If the Deputy thinks there is an opportunity there, then let us take a look.</p></speech>

Clearly, the Estimate is massive and perhaps we need to examine how it is done.  Maybe we should provide supports for committee members.  We do it for overseas aid and it is done in other parliaments.  It is something that we should consider.  I did not got a sense that we have dug into the Estimates and where the money will be spent.</p> <p>  I have a question about the national children's hospital because I am unsure about the funding, particularly the &euro;107 million underspend.  A couple of weeks ago, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was before the joint committee.  Its representatives talked about the difficulties they face with hundreds of claims being before the High Court and the project being behind schedule.  We also heard that the Tallaght urgent care centre is seven months behind and how they were worried about a big claim.  On the one hand, we are saying that there has been an underspend but, on the other, we clearly know that there will be a demand.</p><p>It is clear there will be an overspend, not necessarily this year but certainly next year.  Is that budgeted for?  We are also told that 15% per month to the contractor, BAM, was being withheld.  Does that come under the Minister's Department?  How is that held?  We do not have the time to go into them today but those are some of my concerns about it.  </p><p> To get back to the Tallaght Hospital issue, a 72-bed unit project is with HBS Estates.  We are told it is needed because of the number of elderly people presenting at the accident and emergency department but also because of the young population in the area.  Is there any way of fast-tracking that because it is in an area of high unemployment and also because we need more beds within the system?</p></speech>

All of us have been in hospitals when people were informed that their loved one was going to die.  I was in a hospital one night when someone was dying on a trolley.  A man nearby was being transferred to a bed and there was much effing and blinding, so to speak, while this woman was dying with her family around her.  There is a need for those family palliative care systems within hospitals.</p> <p>  We are bringing in the people involved in the vaccine in two weeks time.  The main concern is the hesitancy on the part of many people with regard to vaccines, particularly across Europe.  In the past decade the numbers have gone down again.  As one of the members said earlier, there is a need for a campaign around the efficacy of the drugs we are getting but also their safety and the speed with which they are being made available.  That conversation needs to be had with this committee at some stage but also with the wider population.  I am aware from talking to people that many want to get the vaccine but many others would prefer to get one from the next batch rather than the first.  We need to convince them in that regard.  Other vaccines were introduced in recent years and there was not the desired take-up of them.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for coming before the committee.  He might get back to me regarding some of the questions.  On the Estimates, we do need support as a committee because even as late as yesterday we were getting notes from his Department about significant changes in terms of the allocation of specific moneys.  That might be taken on board by the Minister and his officials.  Does the Minister want to make any concluding remarks?  We are over time now.</p></speech>

N&iacute;or cheart go mbeadh ar na heagrais phobail Ghaeltachta sin troid ar son mhaoini&uacute; ceart le go mbeadh siad in ann feidhmi&uacute; i gceart.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il &oacute; fhuinneamh cruthaitheach forbartha.  Ba mhaith liomsa agus le Comhlachas na gComharchumann &amp;amp; Comhlachta&iacute; Pobalbhunaithe go mbeadh maoini&uacute; ceart ar f&aacute;il agus nach mbeadh g&aacute; leis an gcine&aacute;l sin troid, bliain i ndiaidh bliana.</p> <p>  Ar an bpointe sin, creidimid freisin go mbeadh s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh maoini&uacute; aontaithe, n&iacute; ar bhun&uacute;s bliant&uacute;il ach go mbeadh muid in ann iarratas tr&iacute; bliana n&oacute; fi&uacute; c&uacute;ig bliana a dh&eacute;anamh agus nach mbeadh muid ag cur an m&eacute;id sin fuinnimh chuile bhliain isteach ar iarratas nua a dh&eacute;anamh.

D&uacute;irt fear c&aacute;ili&uacute;il sa cheantar seo nach mbeidh f&aacute;gtha ar na crainn ach na pr&eacute;ach&aacute;in.  Chuireamar tr&iacute; aighneacht isteach go dt&iacute; an chomhairle contae don phlean nua at&aacute; &aacute; chur le ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; an Ghaolainn l&aacute;rnach leis sin.

Is turas &eacute; sin a bh&iacute;onn ar f&aacute;il go pobal Chorca Dhuibhne.  Le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, beidh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il do phobal ch&uacute;ige Mumhan.

I remind members to sanitise their desk area and seat when leaving the committee room.  The main item on our agenda is our consideration of rural hubs, mobile phone and broadband coverage in rural Ireland.  I welcome officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development, Dr. Stjohn O'Connor, principal officer, and Mr. Turlough O'Brien, assistant principal officer, who is joining us remotely.  They are both very welcome.</p> <p>  The committee will today receive an update from the Department on the Atlantic economic corridor enterprise hub network project on which the Department and the Western Development Commission, WDC, have been working since 2019 with the aim of delivering an integrated network of remote working and enterprise hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor.  The work programme and outputs of the national hub network working group will also be explored.  The network has been convened to investigate the feasibility of mapping and developing a national network of remote working facilities, including hubs and broadband connection points in libraries, based on the model developed in the Atlantic economic corridor region.  The committee notes that an additional &euro;5 million was recently allocated in budget 2021 to support the expansion of the Atlantic economic corridor hub network model on a national scale.  In addition, we will consider the broadband connection points, their roll-out and the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP, as well as an issue that is close to my heart, namely, the work programme of the mobile phone and broadband task force.</p> <p>  Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of statements made to either House of the Oireachtas or before a committee.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are required to give to a committee.  However, if during the course of the committee proceedings they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way that would make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. O'Connor to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As the Chairman outlined, I am joined by Mr. Turlough O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal officer in the regional development and innovation unit.  Our appearance before the committee is timely, in light of the increased shift towards remote working that has taken place over the past eight months as part of the country-wide response to Covid-19.  It has highlighted the possibilities for remote working facilities to contribute to a greater regional distribution of jobs and to support a better quality of life for many people who may previously have spent long hours commuting.</p> <p>  A growing body of research and survey data from the organisations such as the regional assemblies, as well as the Western Development Commission and NUI Galway, shows that, in spite of the obvious negative context of the Covid-19 crisis, people are increasingly recognising the benefit of remote working for their own work-life balance.  For example, recent research by the WDC and NUI Galway indicates that 84% of respondents to their survey wish to continue to undertake some form of remote work after the current public health crisis concludes.  Perhaps even more importantly, 7% of respondents have already made the move to counties such as Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  A further 23% of respondents indicated they would consider relocating, with most of them being from Dublin.  It is clear that a seismic shift in how people think about work has occurred and, as many commentators have publicly indicated, there is unlikely to be a full return to the way things were.</p> <p>  The Department was established to advance and support the development of vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland and to promote long-term social and economic development in rural areas and the regions.  Our role is to work with local authorities and rural stakeholders to advance the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure and the adoption of digital technologies.  The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications retains overall responsibility for the roll-out of broadband, including the NBP, and communications infrastructure, such as 5G.</p> <p>  One of the areas that we are particularly focused on is the promotion and development of remote working through a wide range of projects and schemes such LEADER, the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  The first and second calls of the RRDF have approved 36 projects that are delivering remote working or enterprise hubs in rural towns and villages, including the gteic@An Spid&eacute;al hub in County Galway and the Ennistymon digital hub and multi-service centre in County Clare.</p><p>The Department has also provided &euro;570,000 through the LEADER programme and &euro;683,000 through the town and village renewal scheme to develop remote working, conferencing and other facilities.  Budget 2021 allocated a further &euro;5 million for the development of remote working facilities at broadband connection points, BCPs, and digital hubs.  The details of how this money will be disbursed is under active consideration within the Department and an announcement is expected in 2021.</p><p> At a national level, the Department has adopted a lead role through the establishment of a national hub network interdepartmental working group under the chairmanship of the Department's Secretary General, Mr. Kevin McCarthy.  This work aims to complement the efforts of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in developing a remote work strategy, which I understand is well advanced and is expected to be published in December.  This working group will initially develop and map a national data set of hub infrastructure, facilities and services throughout the country.  It will also work to identify current and capital funding and revenue generation arrangements across the network, identify any funding gaps and consider future investment requirements and opportunities.</p><p> Other activities that the working group will undertake will be to identify barriers to developing the network, raising awareness and identifying appropriate development models for remote working facilities.  The working group will build on the classification model developed under the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC, hub project.  This collaborative effort involving the WDC, the ten local authorities in the AEC region and the Department has, to date, identified, surveyed, mapped and engaged with more than 100 hubs in the AEC region.  This work is detailed in the associated slide deck that I provided.</p><p> The WDC has also developed a comprehensive strategy for the network, which the Minister will shortly publish, and a number of supports to drive the development of the AEC hubs into a collaborative ecosystem.  One such support will be a suite of shared applications that is currently being developed.  These will include a common booking engine and client relationship management system and an online community platform to allow for the exchange of ideas and best practice.</p><p> The BCP initiative was established in order to ensure that remote areas are provided with some access to high-speed broadband in advance of the full roll-out of the NBP.  BCPs are located in some of the most isolated and rural communities throughout the country including islands off Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork.  BCPs represent an opportunity for local communities to use the newly delivered connectivity to provide a range of innovative services for their communities, including ehealth, education, remote working and the promotion and development of the creative industries.  We are working closely with our appointed retail service provider, Vodafone, to roll out multiple programmes through the BCP network in 2021.</p><p> In addition to developing remote working facilities, the Department has been actively supporting the development of rural digital infrastructure and improving mobile connectivity through the work of the mobile phone and broadband task force since its establishment in 2016.  The original task force identified more than 40 actions, of which some of the most impactful have been: the appointment of broadband officers in all local authorities to remove obstacles to infrastructure deployment; the laying of more than 1,000 km of ducting by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, enabling operators to expand their networks along the road network route; the publication by ComReg of a composite national outdoor coverage map to inform consumers and assist them in choosing the best operator for where they live and work; and the development of new advertising guidelines to ensure that certain marketing terms used by telecommunications operators convey clear meanings to consumers.</p><p> Options for the future of the task force are under active consideration in both Departments.  Suffice to say that the low-hanging telecommunication challenges have been addressed, and what remains is more complex, more involved and will require a greater level of collaboration among stakeholders.</p><p> I have also included in the slide deck a number of mobile phone coverage maps from ComReg which show 2G, 3G and 4G coverage across Ireland.  The availability of these maps is a direct result of the work of the task force.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I presume he is working in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on this matter.  I welcome the hubs but I have a fear at the back of my mind that some people think hubs are a substitute for bringing fibre to every building and home.  I am concerned about the fact that because the hubs are located in very isolated areas, that tells me very clearly that these are going to be the areas that will get fibre last.  Could Dr. O'Connor confirm whether that is the case?  Looking at the pattern of roll-out to date, it seems to be starting in big towns and cities and working outwards, and the most rural and isolated areas will be four to five years later.  Given the work that is being done with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, could Dr. O'Connor confirm that my guess is right, and that is the reason the hubs are being created by the national broadband plan in these more isolated areas, as he referred to them?</p> <p>  So far, the hubs have been developed by the private sector.  Some of them might be owned by the public sector, as are all the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s ones, for example, but they are for the private sector, they are not specifically for the Civil Service or the public service.  Have discussions taken place on the possibility of providing public sector hubs so that people working in Departments in Dublin or around the country could work from a hub and have secure links into the public service network, and that these would be controlled by the public realm?</p> <p>  I do not know if I can bring the map onto the screens.</p></speech>

We could figure that out easily enough, where Eir did not cover, the rest of the country included and then one could make a guess that from the patterns worked to date that they are working out from the centre and there are a lot of nodes outwards.

Unfortunately, if I understand it correctly, Dr. O'Connor&rsquo;s group cannot do anything about it because this was a mistake made by the Government in giving licences to mobile communications providers.  In other words, they had to cover a percentage of the population and not a percentage of the territory.  That means if one goes into the Wicklow hills, there is no mobile service in plenty of valleys.  When one goes into the mountains in the west, as I do, there is no mobile, no broadband, nothing.  There are a few landlines in some of the valleys.</p> <p>  Did the task force look at the possibility of providing State-owned infrastructure that would then be leased to companies in more inaccessible places?  In my discussions with companies, they are very reluctant to put up mobile masts in the more difficult valley and hill areas.  There are two reasons to do it.  The obvious reason is that people are living in these places, but we also know that there has been an explosion in rural recreation and hillwalking.  We need to have the availability of a mobile signal in as many places as possible.  Many a person who has got lost on a hill has been saved by his or her mobile phone where there was a service, but if there is no service there is no rescue.  What is being done about the issue?</p> <p>  One can have all the task forces in the world but that does not help the people living in those areas with no service.  The issues raised are all valid and laudable but they do not address the fundamental point that compared with some other countries we have much lower coverage because of a Government decision.  I understand the 5G licence will be given on the same population basis rather than on an area basis.  Has the task force made a recommendation to the Government that the law should be changed so that ComReg would be directed by this House to cover by area not by population in any issuing of further licences?</p></speech>

I will start with the first question about hubs and where they are located.  There are two strands.  The first strand is the work of the interdepartmental group.</p><p>That is seeking to map all the hubs in the country and nearly all those are located in what are deemed commercial areas, because they require fibre.  The BCPs, however, because they are part of the national broadband plan, are located in rural areas.  A key feature of that aspect has been to bring high-speed broadband to those locations.  Initially, that will be done via wireless link, and that tells us how rural these areas are.  All the BCPs are located in rural areas and are in the amber area.  I think that addresses that aspect.</p></speech>

A BCP is not going to be put in Moycullen or Bearna, for example, because the fibre is being rolled out fast in those areas.  By the time the BCP was in operation, the fibre would be in place.</p></speech>

The process is starting from the inside and moving out, and the further places outside will get it last.</p></speech>

I am not privy to decisions regarding when fibre is going to reach all those areas; that is a matter for NBI and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  The whole purpose of the BCP project was to bring high-speed broadband to those locations which are isolated from other areas and where it is not available commercially.  If we look at the BCP network and the associated map, and I have the details here if the Deputy is interested in looking at them afterwards, we can take it as read that across the country BCPs are located in some of the most isolated locations.  We have BCPs on nine or ten islands now, and it does not get more isolated from commercial areas than those.  Those BCPs will be transformative for those communities.</p></speech>

I live in an isolated, back of the mountains area and some 100 of our houses already have fibre, while 300 do not.  Nobody can understand how Eir went 300 or 400 yd. farther down that road, where there were three or four houses, and then suddenly stopped.  It does not make sense.  It would have been possible to roll out the national broadband plan from the outside in.  The contract could have been granted, but at the same time stated that it would commence at the furthest out places because they need it most.</p></speech>

If the fibre is put at the most peripheral location, it will not be possible to have a service until it is connected to the MANs.  I ask Dr. O'Connor to respond to all the questions now.</p></speech>

I understand that conversations have taken place between the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and she intends to write to him about this issue.  Ultimately, however, it is a matter for Government regarding whether civil servants will use those hubs.  In the BCP network, however, we have provided a second service set identifier, SSID, which could be used by the Government.  Each of the BCPs, therefore, could be connected and used as part of a Government network.</p></speech>

It grants the ability to create a separate network which could be used for Government civil servants.  This was something we certainly foresaw as being of use, but it is again a matter for Government regarding whether that is turned on.  There is a bit of work involved in doing that, but it could be done.</p> <p>  The third question concerned mobile coverage.  The Deputy is correct, and I draw attention to the 2G coverage map which I included in my presentation, which as I said was very much taken from the work of the task force.  The coverage provided by 2G networks is the minimum level, but it will give voice and some limited data services.  At this stage, however, the vast majority of the country is covered by 2G.  I also draw the Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's attention to some of the initiatives which came out of the task force.  We are keen, and have always been keen, to ensure State assets are available to telecommunications companies.  Most telecommunications' operators now end up on the same masts and they share infrastructure all the time.  </p> <p>  The big challenge is identifying suitable locations in these rural areas to place a mast.  One of the projects we carried out through the digital innovation project was in Malin Bay in Donegal, where we worked with Vodafone, the local authority and the community to find a suitable location for a mast to bring coverage.  Those familiar with Malin Bay will know that there was zero coverage there.  This was a pilot project which we funded to see whether industry could work with local authorities and central Government to bring connectivity into these locations.  I am delighted to say it was transformative.  Previously, for example, doctors would not go to Malin Bay because coverage would drop, and if there was an emergency, they could not be out of an area with coverage.  Now, however, the mast is sited on the community centre and the intention is that they will create a BCP from that.   We have, and continue to have, discussions as to whether that would be a model for rolling out elsewhere in the country.  It is something we and the industry are keen on.  </p> <p>  The other thing I will draw the attention of the members of the committee to as a direct outcome of the task force - and again this aspect goes back to the map - is that outdoor coverage, generally speaking, is fine; the difficulty is indoor coverage.  The difference between having outdoor and indoor coverage can be a factor of many things, including insulation, the thickness of walls, windows and frames, etc.. One of the things the task force did was to work with ComReg to put in place a regime that allowed people to install a repeater, and there are now multiple suppliers of approved repeaters to a technical standard which does not interfere with other users of the network.  They are now available to everybody in rural Ireland, and they will make a substantial difference because they are taking whatever coverage is outside, bypassing all those things interfering with the signal and bringing it into houses.  We are equipping the BCPs with repeaters.  In most of the BCPs, we have outdoor and indoor coverage, and there is a difference.  We are putting in repeaters, therefore, to ensure that the quality inside matches that outside.  </p></speech>

One thing we can all agree on is how positive it is to see the Department moving so quickly regarding remote working facilities.

Most positive of all, is the sight of people moving out of Dublin and to the west again.

Are there plans for additional remote working hubs on the islands or is there an update on the roll-out for people living on our islands?  There was also a reference in the briefing document to a commitment in the programme for Government to accelerate the roll-out of broadband.</p><p>Is there any update on that?  Is there a plan for how that acceleration will proceed?  Many of us will be aware of the frustration people have experienced, especially since Covid hit and more people are working from home and relying on Internet access, when fibre roll-out comes to an area but connectivity stops at a certain house.  There is a great deal of frustration and people are anxious to get broadband rolled out in their areas.  They would very much welcome an acceleration.  Is there an update on how that will happen?</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy some of the backstory to explain where we are with the BCPs and how new BCPs can come into the process.  Since we started the BCP process a few years ago, a number of sites have come in and dropped off because at that stage there was no process as such.  It was just an expression of interest and once the contract was signed, we quickly moved to firm that up by putting an agreement in place.  That process is working.  NBI connects the site to make it ready for service and then it gets handed over to our regional service provider, which is Vodafone.  As of last week, Vodafone has connected 99 broadband connection points. There will be an update to the NBI map in the coming weeks, with the intention that all the remaining sites will be connected before the end of quarter 1 next year.  The crews are working away and connecting between five and 15 sites each week, depending on the number of crews and sites.  There are a number of complexities before a site gets handed over to the Department and Vodafone, which involves all the backhaul licensing.  As it is a wireless link, all of that has to be put in place before the site is ready for us.  From our perspective, the process is pretty quick once we get the site.  Vodafone goes out on the site, connects it and it usually goes live within two or three days.</p> <p>  As to where we are at now, we have 260-odd sites that have gone into the system and will be connected over the next period.  We still have a number of slots available.  I am pleased to advise members that broadband officers have been particularly active in recent weeks and months in identifying new sites.  We are approving sites on a week-by-week basis and pushing them through to get priced up and approved by the NBI and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  They then come back to us and we approve them for Vodafone to connect.  We have still some remaining capacity for new BCPs but I am pleased to say that capacity is diminishing all the time as new sites are identified.  We are particularly focused on sites that would provide remote working.  That is a ministerial priority, one which the Minister has been expressed a number of times.  Many of the newer sites coming on board will have that capability.   </p> <p>  The way in which the BCP project has evolved has been interesting.  From the get-go, it was all about community benefit but it was not only restricted to economic benefit.  I referred to cultural activities and ehealth opportunities.  These are all important.  When Covid hit it changed everything about how we roll out the BCPs.  The increase in the number of locations that we were interested in pursuing for remote working from 20 or 30 to probably 70 to 80, with the vagaries of how we would connect them and the different technical kit that needs to go into those sites, has proven to be something of a challenge.  The NBI has done really well.  Vodafone has done an extremely good job to be able to respond to that and put in place an infrastructure that will be future-proofed.  To take the example of the BCP in Tulsk in County Roscommon, it is up and running and we are working with it.  It is looking for a technically advanced solution because it is a remote facility and an incubator unit.  The solution we need to put in there is much different from what would be needed in a community centre in a more rural part of Ireland.</p> <p>  We still have a capacity if Deputies are interested.  We have broadband officers in each local authority and they are the first point of contact.  If members know of a location that could be a BCP, they should contact their local broadband officer and there is a application process which we would then approve.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there were plans for additional remote working hubs.  That is a good question.  What the WDC identified in the advanced economic corridor area was approximately 70 hubs that it knew of and that figure grew to 114 by the time it finished its data collection exercise.  The interdepartmental working group is in the middle of a data collection exercise.  We recently wrote to all local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, which is a member of the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres, NACEC, and other organisations looking for the first pass in terms of what hubs are out there.  By our reckoning, we expect there will be more than 400 hubs across the country.</p> <p>  I noted that most local authorities have sought to develop new hubs.  It is not something we in the Department are proactively seeking to do but, given the massive infrastructure of hubs that are in place, part of the exercise we are doing is to categorise them in the first instance to know what they are doing and to consider how we can ensure we have the right hubs in the right locations for the right purposes.  That is the where it gets interesting when we look at it as more of a nuanced picture.  Rather than everybody looking to build hubs, everybody should be looking to build the right hub in the right location for the local community.  At this point, we do not have that feasibility.  We have not collected all the data, which are still drifting back to us.  We expect that by the end of quarter 1 and into quarter 2 of next year we will be in a position to publish a map that will give us a clear indication of what is out there.  As we move forward and through next year, we will build up that picture.  We will send out a questionnaire to every hub and gather all those data.  We will then be able to plot them into the five levels of categorisation which I included on the slide.  That gives us a very good data set from which to start looking at this as a national network.  </p> <p>  I referred to the idea of a common booking platform.  One of the most interesting questions is how we will develop that network into a national asset.  We do that by using the same tools.  Imagine that regardless of where one lives in Ireland, one could use an app to book a seat anywhere and this would be done using the same platform.  That is our ambition and where we want to get to.  We will be using the Atlantic economic corridor hub network to trial all of that before we roll it out nationally.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about accelerating the roll-out of broadband.  Unfortunately, that is a matter for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications rather than us.  We have all seen the public statements but I know no more than the members in that regard.</p></speech>

In February, I had never heard of Zoom.  There has been a complete change in milieu and our way of doing work as a result of Covid.  As Deputy Kerrane said, hopefully it is one of the positives we will take out of the pandemic and we will be able to retain some of those gains as we move forward.</p> <p>  In the first instance, I echo what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about the possibility for decentralisation.  For that to happen, we should not only build new broadband points but we should allow flexibility in places where there is existing capacity to allow for more than one Department to be represented in a building.  These are not questions but comments.  Another idea we discussed at the coiste Gaeilge is using moil dhigiteachta or digital hubs and remote working to help us achieve the recruitment figures in the Irish language that we are hoping to do on foot of the Bille teanga that is coming through.</p> <p>  Dr. Stjohn O'Connor referred to the SSID.  Are the moil dhigiteachta designed to the same standard?  Do they have that separate channel if we decide to leverage that network in order to have Government work happen within those communities?</p> <p>  I am playing the devil's advocate in putting my next question.  In the interests of maintaining work-life balance, people want to work closer to home but they like to have a division between home and work life and they also like to go out to work so that they can come home from work.  Are we confident that we are not building a structure that is already redundant?</p><p>As more and more people get high-quality broadband into their homes, will they choose to go to a remote working hub or, instead, to build an office at home?</p><p> I was very interested to hear Dr. O'Connor's remarks on categorisation and beginning to look at how the remote working hubs are being used.  What does the business plan look like after installation?  Will people have to pay for hot desking?  Is a plan being uniformly being rolled out or is it being done very much on a hub-by-hub basis?  I worry that the latter approach would lead to failure.  We should be building towards a situation whereby we know hubs will be able to pay for their upkeep, including heating and other services that are going in there.  Is there any information on what the business plan looks like after launch?</p></speech>

It sits on the interdepartmental group.  The second SSID I mentioned is only in the BCPs because that was an initiative that we were in control of and we always had the idea that this might be something that might emerge.  There is no extra cost for us at this stage because we can put it in.  The additional cost would arise if it is turned on.  I doubt it is overly complicated from a technical perspective to install a second SSID.  In fact, I know that it is not complicated to do so.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked very relevant questions regarding whether the structures we are putting in place will be redundant.  Part of the work is to really understand the network.  Without having any data, one just does not know the capacity, the usage numbers or what one's target market is.  That is what we are trying to understand.  It is probably unlikely that the structures will be redundant.  The research that has been done, even within Departments and the wider Civil Service, indicates that working from home does not suit everybody.  I have two young children and it can be very tricky for me to work from home.  Some of my colleagues have more children than I do and find working from home even more tricky.  Working from a remote working facility not far from their home can make much more sense for all the reasons the Deputy outlined.  The facility may only be a five-minute walk or five-minute drive from one's home and, as such, one is still in the locality and can return home quickly.  The key benefits identified by the research carried out by the WDC and NUIG included the lack of commuting time, while the most important benefit was the cost savings associated with not commuting.  Commuting is a big challenge.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the business plan is.  That is very much on our radar.  One can start with a BCP.  We are paying for the cost of the equipment going into the BCPs.  The plan may depending on whether the location is revenue generating or making a contribution.  BCPs have very low costs of operation.  All that is needed are a few desks and a Wi-Fi access point.  There is effectively no cost apart from a recurring monthly charge, whereas there is obviously much more cost associated with building a digital hub.  We need to understand what the business model is.  There are five categories in the classification and then below them sit the BCPs.  There are also libraries, which provide some level of remote working in rural communities.  There are 300 libraries.  If they are all on the same booking platform, one can take that cost back up onto that single booking platform and thereby generate revenue.  One of the things the WDC and others are looking at is how we would potentially get a couple of the big corporates to act as anchor tenants for the network.  In that way, we would be providing them with resilience and allowing them to choose staff from across the country.  They would no longer have to choose staff based in places such as Dublin, Cork or Galway but, rather, would have access to talent across the country.  Their recruitment would no longer be place-dependent.  From their perspective, there are many reasons they would look at that.  The Deputy is absolutely right that one of the key things is understanding the business plan behind these hubs.  The plans would be very different depending on the nature of the hub.  We are looking at the business plan.</p></speech>

On hubs, who is responsible for setting standards in respect of toilets, heating, lighting and that kind of thing?  In some of the areas where hubs are located, it is left to communities to take care of that, but they do not have the finances to do so.  They do not get assistance from the local authority.  In some cases, those resources are very scarce.  Will there be a certain standard in terms of the facilities?  Who is responsible for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stjohn O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020120200002#E00600"><p>That is a good question.  In the case of BCPs, it is the BCP site owner.  We provided extensive funding this year and we are likely to provide funding through the &euro;5 million fund for the upgrade of those facilities.  It depends on what is required.  In terms of what we are trying to do with the national hub network, we are trying to have a minimum standard in each of the hubs.  The idea is that the expectations of customers using the hubs will be met at each of the levels.  If one is using a community hub, one should expect X, Y and Z.  We will roll out programmes to support the upgrade of facilities to get them to that point.  It is not just about facilities; it will also be about the programme and the level of support one will receive.  There is always the infrastructure piece.  In many cases, that is the easy piece to do.  The more challenging part is to ensure that those using a community hub should be able to expect to contact somebody within a certain number of hours and have certain supports available if they wish to progress their business to the next level.  We will be aiming to do something similar for BCPs.  We expect to be able to bring them up to a certain standard.</p> <p>  The BCPs are a diverse range of facilities, which is acceptable because they are there to do different things.  One could have a BCP hub, the primary goal of which is education.  We know that several BCPs will be used for educational purposes for the time being and may then change to something else.  For many BCPs, it will be important to have that ability to flex between different services.  They may have a separate room.  One of the things we are keen to support is increasing the number of remote working and connected facilities that are available.  If there is a spare room, it could be set up as a remote working facility.  There would then be the capability to do other things in other rooms.  That is something we are very keen to support.  I could pick ten BCPs, all of which are completely different.  We are very conscious that the beneficiaries are the communities and it is about what the community needs.  In terms of what we are seeking to do next year, we will run out programmes relating to e-health, the cultural side and remote working, but also to education and skills.  Not all BCPs will take up everything.  Some of them will go after the cultural aspect, others will go after remote working and others will do a combination of both.  In time, we hope to build that up such that they will be delivering multiple solutions.  We need to be careful to remember that it is about what the community needs the BCP to do.  As such, we will try to facilitate each BCP to become what the community needs it to be.</p></speech>

As I stated, we pushed out nearly &euro;700,000 this year in funding for BCPs.  The vast majority of that money was to upgrade the buildings to do what the communities wanted them to do.  Much of the need this year was for remote working but we think that will change as the programmes start to be rolled out next year.  It is hoped that BCP site owners will see the opportunities for them and will decide that they wish to tie in with their local schools, for example by offering VEX robotics or Coder Dojo.  They may decide that is what is really needed and put in a dedicated room to enable children to take part in Coder Dojo or to be used as an overflow classroom.  Let us be very cautious about saying the facilities have to be X.  They should be multifunctional spaces.  We need to make them capable of providing multiple services.</p></speech>

The hub has been great.  I worked remotely for 14 years full-time at home on my own and it was a very lonely place.

Social enterprise is important as well.  Can social enterprises apply for funding for hubs or is this provision only available through the broadband officers?  When people set up social enterprises in remote areas and the local authorities then set up state-of-the-art hubs in the same areas, it is a challenge for the social enterprises.  As I said, two social enterprises have closed but perhaps it is because they had served a purpose at a particular time and now that the service is being rolled out through government they do not need to remain open.  I would be interested in hearing if social enterprises can apply for funding.  There are broadband officers in place so I will try to find that out from them.</p> <p>  Another issue is the 5G masts.  I do not believe in the fear of 5G but it would be madness not to raise the issue because it is a concern.  I know from my psychics background, and having researched it and talked about it with my brother who works in IT, that the issue is that it is coming in at a higher frequency because of communications regulations.  Hopefully, it will come down to a frequency below 4G.  This is an issue we will have to address.  In Donegal, a mast used for emergency services was burned down because people thought it was a 5G mast.  I have been to public events where people have expressed real fear of 5G even though they all had mobile phones in their pockets.  When issues such as this are raised in communities it is usually a case of NIMBYism, "not in my back yard", as we saw in regard to wind farms.  Unless the 5G is explained properly roll-out will be delayed.  There is a need for an educational campaign around it.  Is the Department engaged with ComReg on that issue?  Is it proposed to bring it in at a lower frequency and to run an educational campaign on 5G such that no more masts are burned down?  </p> <p>  I will give an example which may help the witness better understand the point I am trying to make.  The people in my local village, Inagh in County Clare, want the old Garda station converted to a Wi-Fi-BCP remote working hub but they are unsure if they can apply as a community group to do that.  The local area housing development committee needs a place for its staff member to work.  I made a pre-budget submission on Wi-Fi hubs to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, which fed into the &euro;5 million allocation provided in the budget.  It is not all about new build.  There are many community halls and old buildings that could be used for hubs.  I was involved in the pre-budget process but I am still unclear as to whether the community group I mentioned should engage with the broadband officer to have the Garda station converted or if it can seek to set it up as a social enterprise.  In my view, if we allow local communities to set up these hubs it would generate funding that could be reinvested in the communities.  Communities are used to fund-raising for initiatives in their villages or towns.</p></speech>

There are many advantages to these digital hubs.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked if they would go out of fashion.  If a person is working at home alone, it is lonely.  There is an attractiveness and advantage in having access to a digital hub where there are other people in similar situations.  Hopefully, that collaboration will stimulate new enterprises and businesses.  I ask Dr. O'Connor to touch on that point in his responses to Senator Garvey.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct.  I refer the committee to the National University of Ireland, Galway,-Western Development Commission research on remote working which found the top challenge is loneliness and isolation.  This is one of the few times I have been out of my children's playroom because that is where I am working remotely.  I fully understand the Senator's point that remote working in hubs addresses the issue.  The Department is of the view that a blended approach is required.  It may be that a person will work at home one day per week, in the office two days per week or in a remote hub two days a week.  Covid has taught us that we need a more nuanced solution.  The idea of bringing everybody back to the office is, I am sure everybody realises, somewhat unrealistic.  If we move to only working from home we will have challenges.  There are companies who are entirely based on their staff working from home and they manage that by providing toolkits and so on.  In terms of my team, it does not suit one of my team to work at home because he has children but it would suit him to work remotely in a hub and that would address the loneliness issue.</p> <p>  Urban McMahon is the broadband officer in Clare.  He is also responsible for building the DigiClare hubs.  DigiClare hubs are really interesting in that Mr. McMahon and Clare County Council are advanced in their thinking.  The hubs provide hot-desk facilities at a cost of &euro;10 per day.</p></speech>

The type of social enterprises mentioned by the Senator should be a different kind of offering.  I refer to the classification.  We need to be able to locate hubs in different places and move on but that is not what social enterprises need.  A social enterprise hub should not be threatened by DigiClare because that is not the market it is working towards.  DigiClare should be an added benefit for a social enterprise in terms of supports.  Anybody can provide a desk.  A social enterprise or a business start-up needs more than that.  That is the piece that requires different levels of provision.  Part of it is provision for people in the right places.  A person may want to go to a hub but it is not right for him or her because it does not offer what he or she needs to get to the next level of business.  We are very conscious of this because social enterprise is also part of our responsibility in the Department.  We are keen to support social enterprise and hubs that will be focused on social enterprise but we would clearly distinguish those from other offerings.  They would be distinguished by the level of support provided.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned existing buildings.  The town and village renewal plan and the future rural strategy place hubs at the centre of regeneration of towns and villages.  We have all this infrastructure and we need to use it and to re-equip it.  The lessons we have taken from all activities and hub development is that they need to be in towns and villages.  People going out to work want that social aspect.  They want to be able to pop out to the local caf&eacute; for a cup of coffee and to be able to walk around at lunch time.  They cannot do this if the hubs are located outside of towns.  That works in some instances but not in every instance.  We are talking about economic hubs.  We want those to be located in the centre of towns and villages.  That is really important.  </p> <p>  The Senator is correct in regard to 5G.  We have a monthly meeting with the broadband officers, which has been happening since we established the network about four years ago.  The Chairman will be familiar with this network as he launched it when Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have dealt with 5G a number of times.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has presented to the network.  There is a substantial amount of material that was generated for broadband officers to deal with this issue at a local level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.639" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>We are very familiar with the matter and have a lot of close engagement with industry.  As I outlined, it is a matter for the Department of  Environment, Climate and Communications primarily.  I know the EPA is very active.  The Senator may have seen some research that it published in the past couple of weeks.  It touched upon 5G radiation, ionising and non-ionising.  I will butcher an analogy, and I apologise to the EPA for this, but it always says that spectrum is spectrum - it is there, we are not creating it - and the question is how one uses it.  It is like a road, and the devices are what one puts on the road.  We need to get that message out that there is nothing inherently dangerous about the spectrum, the only question is its use.  If the Senator is interested, I can point her in the direction of a lot of material.  It is something that the broadband officers would be engaged in at a local level and is something we have briefed chief executives on.  It has been raised all across the country at local council chambers.  We have provided materials to support them in addressing those concerns.  It will definitely be an ongoing issue.</p></speech>

On phone coverage, according to Dr. O'Connor's opening statement, we should have 2G coverage almost everywhere in the country.  I raised this the last day.  I am from Kildare, just outside Athy.  It is not a million miles from here but there are people who have to go out to their back gardens to receive or maintain phone coverage.  How can we address that?  These people live less than 50 miles from the capital and cannot get basic phone coverage.  It is a huge problem in that area 30 or 40 miles along the bottom of south Kildare and into Laois.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Connor said it is probably a matter for the Department of  Environment, Climate and Communications, but I am aware of several businesses where the exchange stops within 100 m or 50 m, or 10 yd., from them.  This is a significant challenge for many businesses in rural Ireland.  I have dealt with one company which employs seven people which could employ many more, doubling or trebling that number, but it cannot get the broadband it needs to increase its workforce.  It has been regularly ringing the Department and the provider but the exchange remains 200 m from their door step.  It cannot continue.  How can we help a company like that?  It should be all about job creation, particularly in rural locations.  We should be giving such a company the answers it needs, but it has not had a response to date.</p> <p>  I welcome the appointment of a broadband officer in the local authorities.  The one in Kildare, who I deal with, has been a godsend for many public representatives.  There have been many occasions when I had to phone or email him.  </p> <p>  On hubs, has the Department had to refuse any applications from communities and, if so, why?  The information that will be built up in the first quarter can be fed out by public representatives and local authorities.  I know of local communities which are looking at this and require that information.  I was interested to hear about e-health.  Have there been discussions with service providers in the primary care centres that have been and are being rolled out with the Department of Health about locating hubs in those primary care centres? It would mean health officials on the doorstep and the hubs to answer questions or queries that may come from the communities.  I have seen it work in places such as Ballymore Eustace in Kildare.  </p> <p>  The common booking platform was mentioned.  How do we go about that?  I also worry about the advantages that might be there in the private versus public sectors.  I thank Dr. O'Connor.  I think everyone will agree that the town and village renewal has been a godsend for many rural communities.  </p></speech>

There is a framework and repeaters are there to solve that problem.  I do not know anything about the area.  The houses could be new or very old.  If they are very old they could have very thick walls which can be a problem for the signal getting through.  If they are very new, they are probably extremely well insulated which creates an issue because insulation blocks the signal.  ComReg's website has a list of providers of repeaters.  They are relatively new but they are available and many companies install them.  That would be the first solution and it should work.  We install them in BCPs.</p> <p>  On helping companies, it is difficult to respond without knowing specifics.  I can address it if the Senator wishes to send me details.  I would normally direct people to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications because it actively engages with providers to improve services.  There is no stick to compel operators but I am happy to take on board any information.</p> <p>  We have had to refuse communities for BCP applications.  It is primarily in cases where what was being offered for the substantial State investment did not balance out.  That was only in a small number of cases.  The whole idea of BCPs is that it is for community gain and public benefit, therefore they are not approved where opening hours or facilities were not to an appropriate level or there were no plans.  The key determinant for us for approving BCPs was whether the applicants had an active community group.  If there is an active community group, one knows that they are behind it and things will happen whereas if there is a community group that would like a hub but it has no plans and the facilities are not great, that does not represent a good return on a substantial investment but that has been in a minority of places.  </p> <p>  The question on e-health is interesting.  We are actively engaging with both the HSE and Department of Health in the area.  We have four pilots which we would like to try for different areas of e-health, including a couple of the islands.  There are obvious benefits.  We have established a group, chaired by one of my team, to look at this very specific idea.  The clinicians are very much on board.  It is a question of how to roll it out.  We were holding back a few BCPs to potentially address what the Senator outlined.  I am keen for it to happen.  There are obvious benefits and savings to the health sector. </p> <p>  On private versus public hubs, the booking platform which we are putting in place is not restricted to public hubs, it is for everybody.  There are AC hubs, private, public, social enterprises, every kind.  The tools we make available will be available to all hubs across the country.  </p></speech>

If someone can get coverage outside, it shows the problem is not the mobile phone coverage, but, as Dr. O'Connor said, one of insulation or the thickness of the house.  Returning to Senator Garvey's comment on 5G, that is an even bigger problem inside because that frequency does not go through the insulation or thick walls so as the technology improves, it is travelling reduced distances.  Repeaters will become required indoors in many cases.  Approximately 80% of mobile phone usage is indoors.</p></speech>

Two or the three operators are offering Wi-Fi calling on the networks.</p><p>Ironically,  I was talking to my own mother about this yesterday.  She has a different broadband provider from her mobile provider.  Depending on the nature of a customer's phone and the package, phone calls could potentially be made over Wi-Fi, so that somewhat addresses the indoor coverage issue.  If a customer has decent broadband, the phone provider will use that.  That is interesting, because I understand two of the three, but all three of them may be offered at most.</p></speech>

I welcome the allocation of &euro;5 million in this year's budget for the further development of the network along the Atlantic economic corridor, because it is key.  We must work together and put a strategy in place so that there is no overlapping of services.  As Senator Garvey mentioned, there was a case where one hub was developed, which displaced two other similar hubs.  There needs to be co-ordination, and it is good to hear that there are monthly meetings with Urban McMahon and others like him throughout the country to try to achieve that co-ordination.</p> <p>  I must say that Clare is very much at the forefront in this, because there is a digital strategy in place and there is a network of hubs throughout the county.  There are plans to develop further hubs in locations such as Ennis, and I have been working with the county council and the Department on that project.</p> <p>  I would like to go back to what Senator Burke mentioned about a minimum standard, and that is important in respect of the broadband connection points, BCPs.  They are diverse and they are not all uniform, which I accept, but there must be a minimum standard.  To reach that minimum standard, community groups need access to funding, which they currently do not have.  Will a tranche of that &euro;5 million that has been allocated be made available to community groups in particular to meet that minimum standard so that they can offer a service to the local community whereby people can engage with local public services and can possibly work remotely?  Will Dr. O'Connor confirm if that is the case?  The use of town and village renewal fund and the rural regeneration development fund, RRDF, to roll out this network is welcome too, but it is a bit disjointed.  If there was one single fund and local authorities worked in conjunction with the Department, there would be a more uniform system in place whereby they could feed into the plan in a more co-ordinated way.  Perhaps Dr. O'Connor would comment on those points.</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's second question on the difference between the funds and having a coherent approach, if we step back 12 months, this issue was not as topical as it is now.  The world has changed and our response has changed.  Previously, for 2020 - obviously the budget was allocated in the previous year - hubs that were applying for works up to a certain value applied through the town and village renewal scheme, and if an applicant was seeking to construct a hub or do substantial works, he or she applied through the regional rural development fund.  That was appropriate and worked quite well, and it was generally considered to be coherent and people understood it.</p> <p>  The world has changed in 2020.  More was drawn down for those smaller works than was probably originally envisaged, but that is okay and we are able to flex with the demand and we have responded to that demand quite well.  Around &euro;670,000, which is a substantial amount, was spent.  There were very few counties that did not benefit from that in terms of the BCPs.</p> <p>  The idea behind the &euro;5 million fund is to bring greater coherence for next year.  Looking at the bigger hubs, such as the PorterSheds and Ludgates of this world, &euro;5 million would not go very far in developing those kinds of hubs.  The RRDF is still the appropriate vehicle because it is a much larger source of funds, whereas everything else could fall into the &euro;5 million fund.  In designing that fund, we will take account of what we are learning around the hubs that are out there and what the demand is.  Earlier this year, through our Covid response and the Western Development Commission, WDC, we allocated out about &euro;180,000 to hubs in the AC area for Covid response.  That was done at very short notice and the WDC did a great job, and we learnt a huge amount about what is required to make a hub Covid-ready.  We are using this data collection exercise from the interdepartmental group as a means of informing how we design that &euro;5 million fund so that we get the best bang for our buck.</p></speech>

BCPs are for areas without broadband, and the hubs are for areas with broadband where people want the socialisation of work and to work in good workspaces.  These are very different requirements.</p> <p>  On the wider issue, people work where they are.  I think most Deputies have been doing this for years; I certainly have.  For example, I have worked in airports, hotels, at home, and in my offices in Galway and Dublin.  People who do this want broadband everywhere, and I think that Dr. O'Connor will find that many ordinary people are doing this.  When I visited America, I found that people in some of the big companies had already moved into a context pattern of work that suited their day: working from home, working from the formal office, working on the road, and working in other offices that the business might have in other parts of the state.  That is going to happen here.  There is no question about that.  I do not think that anybody is going work to always in one place.  The world must allow for that flexibility.</p> <p>  My concern relating to BCPs is that people will think that they are a substitute for fibre to the home.  I hear reference to the islands and that we will give them BCPs.  I am telling Dr. O'Connor, on behalf of the islanders in County Galway, which account for well over half of the islanders in the country, that they want what everyone else wants.</p> <p>  I was interested in what Senator Garvey said and I understand it perfectly, because we all like moving around and meeting and connecting with people.  As Deputies, many of us have found over the past eight months that it has not been our broadband connectivity that has been missing but the face-to-face contact with people in constituency clinics, where it would be better just having the face-to-face contact for certain meetings.  On the other hand, other things we have done very successfully because we could work where we were.  I imagine Senator Garvey, and maybe she could be prompted by the Chair to answer this, really likes the Wi-Fi hub, but she would not like it if that was at the expense of the broadband in her house, because I bet she uses that sometimes.  That is what people really want.  People want choice everywhere they go.  For example, if I am ever booking a hotel, I want a bed and I want Wi-Fi.  It is very simple, and I would not stay in a place that could not provide me with Wi-Fi.</p></speech>

On behalf of rural people, I must re-emphasise that the quicker the national broadband roll-out, the better.</p><p>It would be useful if we could very quickly get a fix on the different usage of a broadband connection point, BCP, versus a hub in an area where there is already broadband fibre to the home, or by the part of the area where the broadband fibre is to the home.  How do they use the hub as compared to those people who do not have the broadband at home?  We need to get that fixed.  The future is going to be the hub where everybody has fibre to the home.</p><p> I often believe there is a misconception, not by the Department or anyone here, but by some people and certainly commentators who seem to have an idea that rural Ireland has no bite.  The Chairman will be able to confirm that when the manual exchanges were abolished in the 1980s they were replaced by small exchanges.  These were brown boxes one would see around the countryside in all sorts of areas and every little village had one.  It is quite some time since Eir rolled out fibre into each one of those boxes.  Eir started with the box and worked out for a mile or two in each direction but suddenly stopped.  Many of us could never figure that out.  There is one place close to me where it went out a road and stopped short of what is for our area a good cluster of houses.  Nobody could figure it out.  One would think that Eir might say, "Having gone this far we will pick up these houses", but it did not.  I understand that it was due to some logarithm it had.  There is no area, village or street in the country that has one of these brown boxes that does not have fibre in it.  Everywhere, from County Dublin outwards, all over rural Ireland the fibre is going down and there are two communities: one with fibre and one without fibre.  It is not just a west coast problem.  This is the midlands, the east coast, or three miles from a city.  We need to encourage the national broadband company to get on and get the job done.  I am disappointed.</p><p> I now turn to the technicalities of it.  It is my understanding that they are hanging the fibre on the existing telegraph poles, and that one of the big jobs Eir had to do in rolling out its fibre was to upgrade the poles.  Where they are being upgraded there should be no problem in hanging another fibre wire and actually starting that part of the work.  I understand they are going back to base with the wires but in hanging the fibre one does not have to do the whole thing of checking the poles and renewing them because that would already have been done by Eir.  One could start having to check those and the last pole out.  As an aside, it is my understanding that when the fibre is rolled out the copper wires become redundant.  The copper is very heavy and tends to be the cause of blown down poles.  There was also a problem that under some ComReg regulation they were not allowed to remove the copper even when it was redundant.  We need to clarify that issue because it causes issues with the wind blowing down poles.  The fibre is so light that this is not an issue.</p><p> I accept the socialisation and the working in groups, but even those people are going to work from home.  I have made that point.  I am still not happy or reassured that there is a will and that it is really happening to put in mobile signals.  While there are places where there are no mobile signals full stop, for example, inside a rock, I still do not see the will or the way to make sure that infrastructure is put into these areas.  I cannot see from a technical point of view that it is any more difficult.  While more small masts are needed it would be no more difficult to find sites than it is to find all the sites that must be found in the rest of the country.</p></speech>

It is important that I make this clarification.  Broadband connection points, BCPs, are not a replacement for fibre.  They are there to address a gap while the fibre is rolled out.  Very interestingly, we are connecting our first direct fibre BCPs, which are currently wireless connectivity.  The intention is, and it is our view, that all the BCPs will convert into fibre BCPs for all the reasons we have discussed today.  Just because there is fibre in everybody's home it does not invalidate the need for the BCP.  The first one of these will be connected in the new year, which is a trial run.  Obviously, the kit and how it all hangs together needs to be tested.  Again, it is really important to understand that it is not a replacement for fibre to the premises.  It is an offering for the community.  That is very important.</p></speech>

It is important that we understand what is being used.  We would be very cognisant of that.  As it stands, when one connects there is a short survey as to how the experience was.  The intention is to roll out a questionnaire at some stage next year, probably towards the latter half of the year, to understand how the hubs are being used.  We believe this to be an iterative process.  Some hubs very clearly will not be needed when fibre is rolled out, but the vast majority will.  It is about making the community benefit real.  That is our objective with the BCPs.  The fibre is only the infrastructure.  The interesting bit is what we do with the fibre.</p></speech>

I will bring him back to the mobile phone and broadband task force.  I was very surprised to see this particular task force put into abeyance at the start of the year.  As Dr. O'Connor is aware, many of the challenges we came across this year in network capacity were dealt with because of the work done over the past three years by the mobile phone and broadband task force.  If that task force had not been established a number of years ago, our network probably would have collapsed on quite a few more occasions than it did over the past nine months.</p><p>Due to the capacity issues with our network, right across Europe the EU asked Netflix and other video channels to reduce the capacity of their streaming services.  The quality was disimproved in order to take pressure off the network.  Here in Ireland, ComReg did the same thing with the mobile network.  Our voice services were diminished in quality in order to increase the capacity of data, 4G and 3G services.  There are clearly deficiencies within the existing networks in a European context but also in our mobile and wireless networks here in Ireland if ComReg took that decision.<br/><br/>I have gone on to the website <i>downdetector.ie</i>, which logs reported problems with various online networks.  This issue came to the fore last Friday night.  I happen to be a Vodafone customer.  I was watching the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; on Friday night and was frustrated, like everyone else, by what happened when the service went down on a number of occasions during the show.  That brought to the fore what is taking place on a regular basis.  During the most recent lockdown, there were 24 reported service outages, according to <i>downdetector.ie</i>.  Vodafone, Three, Virgin Media, Eir and Imagine all went down at different times over the last six weeks.  Clearly, there are ongoing problems with our broadband network and our mobile network in particular.  Surely it makes sense, at this stage and in light of those capacity problems, to re-energise the mobile phone and broadband task force rather than put it in abeyance.  Can someone explain to me why, at a time when unprecedented pressure was put on our mobile networks, the liaison between the Government, the industry and the various players around the country was shelved?  Why did that happen?  What is the future of that task force?</p></speech>

The implementation group spent three years implementing the first task force report and identifying new actions.  That work concluded in the first quarter of this year.  We then got hit with everything that has gone on, including the election and formation of the new Government and so on.  It is certainly not the intention of either Department for the task force to be in abeyance.  However, as I alluded to in my opening address, at this point in time the low-hanging fruit or easy fixes have been addressed.  The Chairman referred to the work of the task force and what it has achieved and I have spoken about maps and repeaters.  All of that emerged out of the work of the task force.  The relationship with the industry is extremely strong on foot of the task force and it would like to see the task force maintained, as would both Departments.  We just need to fix on the best use of the task force and what it could be put to bear on, such as bigger ticket items.  The matter of 5G was referred to earlier and that is certainly something that could be considered by the task force.  It needs to change and shift because by and large, those low-hanging fruit and all the issues the Chairman noted, which were impeding the ordinary operation of the networks, have been addressed.  The task force needs to find a new identity.  I am hopeful that proposals will be put in front of the Government very shortly.</p></speech>

During the recent lockdown, one of our networks went down every second day.  Either a fixed broadband or mobile network went down every second day over the last six weeks.  That should be at the top of the agenda and I cannot believe that the task force has not been re-established.  Dr. O'Connor can take that back to the Department.</p> <p>  My second question is a bit closer to home and is relevant to all of the members here.  The map on the national broadband plan website has two colours on it.  The first is amber, which covers about 96% of the geographical area of the country, and National Broadband Ireland and its contractors are mapping those locations at the moment.  Before Christmas they will bring fibre to the first of those houses and it will be rolled out in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's constituency early in the new year.  That is great.  People in dark blue areas have a mix of fibre to the door or fibre to the cabinet.  In my constituency, Eir is bringing fibre to the door in the urban areas, and Virgin and Siro have done so as well.  However, a cohort of people are in no man's land.  They are not part of the current planned fibre roll-out by the commercial companies in urban areas, they are not getting a minimum of 30 Mbps over the existing copper wire from fibre to the cabinet, and they are not part of the National Broadband Ireland intervention as they are not in the amber area.</p> <p>  When one zooms in on the map, there are little pockmarks of amber in the dark blue areas.  These are people who have been identified as not getting a minimum 30 Mbps for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  They will be part of the National Broadband Ireland intervention.  Some of them are within a mile of where we are sitting here in the city of Dublin, while some are in peripheral rural villages.  However, I know of more than 80,000 homes across the country, besides those little pockmarks, that are not getting 30 Mbps.  Some of them are getting 29 Mbps and some are getting 2 Mbps.  Once National Broadband Ireland installs fibre in an area, it moves on because it has to meet its timelines, and these homes will then be left behind.  These people will not be able to sell their homes.  The value of their properties will depreciate dramatically because it would be like trying to sell a house without electricity or water where the buyer has to pay &euro;5,000 to get them connected.  People will not want those properties.  What can be done in the short term to make people aware that if they are not getting this service at the moment, they need to report it and ensure they are part of the intervention?  There are a substantial number of people who do not know that, have not reported it and are going to be left behind. </p></speech>

We have asked the broadband officers about it and I reiterate the message we have been giving for almost three years.  If a person's premises is in that situation, that person needs to record the speeds available and then send an email to broadband@decc.gov.ie for the Department to record it.  I understand that NBI recently attended the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, where it indicated that it would engage on this subject.  The first thing, which we have been saying repeatedly for three years, is that we need to know where those locations are and they must be categorised and sent in to the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  If any Deputy or Senator is in a similar boat, he or she needs to talk to the broadband officer in the first instance, capture that data and then make sure it gets sent on to the Department.  It is primarily an issue for the Department because it manages the national broadband plan but that is the message we have been pushing out to all the broadband officers for the last three years.  We know it is happening every day because I get copied on a lot of those emails.  The message is quite simple.  If people are in that situation and are not getting the relevant speeds, they need to alert broadband@decc.gov.ie.</p></speech>

When I was a Minister, I brought all Deputies and Senators to a room here in Leinster House and explained this issue to them.  However, it has not been reported back that way.  Both Departments have been putting this out into the public domain, as have I, but it is not getting traction.  My point is that a proactive approach must be taken urgently before these homes are bypassed.  Very soon people will be contacting Deputy Kerrane and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and saying that National Broadband Ireland came and went and they were not included because they did not report that they had a problem with their broadband.</p><p>If I am having a problem with my broadband and I live in a dark blue zone and they have to come back to resolve it, that has a direct impact on communities in the more peripheral areas, which is the point that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was making earlier.  Most of the peripheral locations are not, as perceived, on the west coast.  Deputy Kerrane's constituency and my constituency are the most difficult locations to reach and it is the people in those communities who are going to be left behind if we have to go back in respect of these areas.  It is in everyone's interests that people check the website and take note of whether they are located in dark blue zones.  If they are and they are not getting the 30 Mbps, they should report that now.</p></speech>

It is not that on the ground they have not been doing anything because many broadband officers have been actively canvassing communities and passing on this message at local level.  I agree, however, that more can always be done.</p></speech>

I also thank Mr. O'Brien, on whom we did not exert a huge amount of pressure.  A number of important issues have been raised.  The committee needs to hear from ComReg, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and National Broadband Ireland in regard to some of the issues that members raised.  We will revisit this issue and we will continue to engage with the witnesses on it.  Dr. O'Connor clearly has a passion for this particular issue.  I again thank him and Mr. O'Brien for their participation and their comprehensive contributions.</p> <p>  Before we conclude, I would like to comment on the mobile phone and broadband task force.  Much of the work done by the task force was at a very technical level.  While it will improve mobile and broadband coverage, people do not actually see that.  One of the very significant pieces of work that was done that has a direct impact on consumers is the mobile coverage maps.  Christmas is a time of the year when many people will upgrade their mobile phones.  I plead with people, before purchasing mobile phones and signing contracts with whatever operator they choose, to visit the ComReg website where they can see the map, input their Eircode postcode and find out which provider can provide them with a service in their homes and communities.  There is not much point in a person buying a cheap package from a particular operator only to find out that it does not provide coverage in his or her location.  The information is available to people.  A massive amount of work was done behind the scenes to make this happen.  Before purchasing mobile phones, people need to visit the ComReg website in order to discover which service suits their particular location.</p></speech>

Witnesses will have three minutes for opening statements, followed by questions from members.  The committee may publish opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  I must explain some limitations in parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to another person in their evidence.  Witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege, but witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  Some witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way to make him or them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  If statements are potentially defamatory in relation to the identification of somebody or an entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p></speech>

In 2019, tourism accounted for 260,000 jobs.  In some counties, as many as one in five jobs relied on tourism.  In 2020, sector revenue has declined by a massive &euro;6 billion and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. While revenue stopped for businesses, the costs did not and the stress on business owners is immense.</p> <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s response has been comprehensive.   Our Covid advisory group of industry, agencies and Department officials has met 26 times.  We have refunded &euro;3 million to businesses in fees and delivered 14 separate suites of online support tools, which have been accessed half a million times by industry.  We developed and continuously update 11 sets of sectoral safety guidelines, which have been accessed 90,000 times.    On business tourism, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, working with industry, continued to win future business.  This year, we generated 206 new conference leads worth &euro;121 million and our total future leads pipeline is now worth more than &euro;1 billion.  We delivered 12 virtual international sales platforms with over 2,000 global business tourism buyers.</p> <p>  On international leisure tourism, we supported more than 1,100 Irish industry members to engage with international buyers on 17 virtual sales platforms organised in Ireland by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s overseas platforms. </p> <p>We launched a major new summer marketing campaign, Make a Break for It.  We also launched the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Covid safety charter designed to deliver, and instil confidence in, safety in tourism.  Thus far, 5,000 businesses have registered.  This week, we are launching campaigns to promote safe indoor dining and to promote accommodation gift vouchers.  We also established 23 local recovery task forces nationwide.</p> <p>  In addition to our own programme, we have provided extensive analysis and input to our Department, the tourism recovery task force and wider Government to inform the July stimulus, budget 2021 and ongoing supports.  We are administering four new grant schemes for Covid adaptation, bed and breakfast accommodation restart, coach tourism and inbound agents.  Combined through these four schemes, we hope to distribute &euro;54 million to more than 12,000 businesses.  Budget 2021 allocated an additional &euro;55 million for strategic tourism business survival, and we are currently developing this scheme.  Extensive research informs all this.  Since March we have completed 27 separate research projects, thereby getting insights from 3,000 businesses and 32,000 individuals. </p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland team and our Department on behalf of the tourism industry.  In addition to this, the F&aacute;ilte Ireland team has also contributed significantly to the wider national effort from helping speedy processing of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, applications to working with the HSE in developing the "Keep Your Distance" and "Hold Firm" communication campaigns.</p><p> Looking to the future, while the industry is very grateful for the very significant Government support, the severity and longevity of restrictions means that for many, current supports will not be enough.  Insolvencies have started and will accelerate after Christmas unless something significant changes.</p><p> Tourism will recover and the speed of Ireland's recovery will primarily be determined by how many tourism businesses have survived.  We cannot rebuild employment without employers so we must not shy away from providing the business supports required, and to do so would be to abandon regional development and self-sustaining rural communities.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of Tourism Ireland.  As members know, Tourism Ireland is the organisation responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas.  It was established as one of the six areas of co-operation under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>Before I speak about the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the tourism sector, I will give some context about overseas tourism prior to the outbreak and spread of Covid-19.  Overseas tourism had recorded nine consecutive years of record growth and in 2019 we welcomed almost 11.3 million overseas visitors, who spent &euro;5.9 billion across the island of Ireland.<br/><br/>With our unique all-island remit, we have seen a renaissance in overseas tourism to Northern Ireland over the same period, with 2.2 million overseas visitors last year, generating almost &pound;600 million in revenue for the economy there.  In a normal year, we deliver world class marketing programmes in over 21 markets around the world, with an audience of approximately 600 million.  Our extensive and targeted programme of activity includes: advertising; social media and digital marketing; and overseas publicity and co-operative promotions with air and sea carriers and other travel partners.<br/><br/>Since March, because of the restrictions on international travel, unfortunately most of our paid promotional activity has been cancelled or postponed.  However, the Tourism Ireland teams around the world have been engaged in an extensive programme of activity throughout 2020 to keep the island of Ireland &quot;front of mind&quot;, with prospective future holidaymakers until such a time as they can visit again.  We have been running an online campaign, which is using the hashtag &quot;#FillYourHeartWithIreland&quot;.  Because people are not travelling this year, the aim of the initiative is to bring the best of Ireland to their screens.  It is about the sharing of inspirational content that speaks to the world at this difficult time and connects people with the island of Ireland.  This campaign has achieved excellent engagement with our fans and followers on social media.  It has delivered almost 300 million impressions on our Facebook channels, with 30 million views and 5.7 million engagements.  There have been 170,000 engagements on Twitter, as well as 5.6 million engagements and 5.5 million &quot;likes&quot; on Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Instagram channels.<br/><br/>A key element of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s promotional activity is to showcase Ireland&rsquo;s unique cultural and artistic experience around the world.  Examples of this from our &quot;#FillYourHeartWithIreland&quot; campaign have included our collaboration with Philip King and his &quot;Other Voices: Courage&quot; series, as well as our work with <i>Hot Press </i>magazine to highlight a musical celebration of Van Morrison&rsquo;s 75th birthday &quot;Rave On, Van Morrison&quot;.<br/><br/>During 2020, Tourism Ireland has been carrying out an extensive programme of Covid-19 research in our major markets.  The research has supplied learning into developing consumer behaviour and attitudes, and these are fundamentally shaping our activity programme.  Tourism Ireland has been represented on the tourism recovery task forces in Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as on the aviation recovery task force in Ireland.  Recommendations from the task forces will be integral to our restart activity.<br/><br/>Looking to the future, this has been a catastrophic year for tourism but it can and will recover from this pandemic.  Recent news about vaccine programmes is positive and gives us hope.  In our research, Ireland has consistently been shown as one of the destinations that holidaymakers would be most comfortable visiting, even while social distancing measures are in place.  We have a three-phase plan to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand.<br/><br/>Our success in supporting the recovery of overseas tourism and driving business development is dependent on many factors.  However, there are three key areas of action.  The first is consumer motivation and identifying when consumers will be ready to consider holidaying again and which markets offer us the best short-term prospects.  Our research shows that summer 2021 is most commonly seen as the next holiday window; younger holidaymakers, as well as those who have visited before, or have family or friends here, are most comfortable about travelling to Ireland; and closer to home markets are likely to present the best short-term prospects.  However, it is fair to say that consumer sentiment has deteriorated in our more recent surveys.<br/><br/>The second element is access, and the airline industry has been hit particularly hard by this crisis.  Ireland has now found itself in a competitive position for air routes, with no guarantees about which routes will return.  Support will be required to build demand and increase the viability of new and existing routes.<br/><br/>The third element is industry and trade.  The overseas travel trade has long been a loyal supporter of Ireland; however, we are now facing higher levels of competition than ever before from destinations across the world.  The excellent relationships which Tourism Ireland enjoys with the overseas travel trade are vital to our long-term success.  We will need to invest to create the demand that will support the product on the ground.<br/><br/>While remaining very flexible and adapting to conditions, Tourism Ireland has developed a clear work plan.  This will include the launch of a significant kick-start campaign as soon as the time is right, the development of a new consumer campaign to address evolving consumer motivations, with stage 1 of the new campaign ready for our kick-start activity and extensive social media and publicity activity, as appropriate, to keep the island of Ireland in the minds of prospective visitors.  A significant redesign of our international website, <i>ireland.com</i>, and our digital marketing capability has been under way throughout 2020.  The new site is currently going live, with weekly market releases happening since the end of November.  These will conclude in the middle of this month.  Our new <i>ireland.com</i>will be fundamental to our proposed kick-start success.<br/><br/>The pace of recovery is unknown.  However, based on the best information to hand, Tourism Ireland currently predicts the recovery could take in excess of five years.  In order to improve on this position, an effective, sustained and large-scale marketing approach will be required.  This should begin as soon as the health situation allows.  As international travel begins to restart, it is clear that keeping the island of Ireland front and centre in consumers&rsquo; minds will be critical.  Every destination across the globe has experienced the impact of Covid and will be seeking their share of the recovery.  This increases the competition in the market.<br/><br/>When the time is right, Tourism Ireland needs to punch through the noise and create an immediate desire to visit.  To achieve this, a significant marketing investment will be required to enable large-scale, reframed consumer communications in markets with the greatest opportunity.  Tourism Ireland is committed to working with our colleagues in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Northern Ireland, the tourism industry and all stakeholders to support the recovery.  We have a shared ambition for a sustainable recovery.  Once this crisis is past and Ireland is open again to overseas visitors, we in Tourism Ireland will be ready to play our part in delivering a sustainable recovery for the long-term future of our industry.<br/><br/>Speaking of sustainability, I was delighted that Lonely Planet recently named the Burren Ecotourism Network a &quot;best community tourism project&rsquo; in its <i>Best in Travel </i>list for 2021, placing it in the top 30 on the globe.<br/><br/>I am in regular contact with my counterparts in other Ireland agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and Invest Northern Ireland, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs, about how we will promote the island of Ireland overseas with a &quot;team Ireland&quot; approach in 2021 and beyond.  I thank the committee for listening to the submission and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

One of the successes was the "Make a Break For It" campaign, which was a major success.  During July, August and September, we saw an a wonderful phenomenon of people starting to discover parts of Ireland they had never seen.  Instagram lit up with images of Ireland that we had never seen before because people were discovering Ireland for the first time.  It was tremendous and realised what was on their doorstep.</p> <p>  Have we learned lessons from that for future strategy?  We must still work on the international market and getting people in from other countries.  There was a worrying statistic, however, that the spending of overseas visitors compared with domestic visitors is skewed.  Is there now an opportunity to address this and build on the success of the "Make a Break For It" campaign and the wonderful experience people had in July, August and September?</p><p>That is my first question.  I would love to hear if there is a strategy in that regard.</p><p> The success of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is a F&aacute;ilte Ireland strategy, has been amazing.  I can attest to that first-hand being from west Cork.  Huge credit is due for that.  I want to ask Mr. Kelly about the breaking up of the Wild Atlantic Way into regions.  For example, an effort is being made to break up west Cork, where I am from, and rename and remarket it as the Haven Coast.  I warn against doing that because west Cork is a unique brand in itself.  It has a unique culture and unique food, and as we can see from the Old Head at Kinsale there behind Ms De Saulles, the scenery is phenomenal.  There is already a brand there and I would be worried about reinventing the wheel.  I ask that we stay away from that type of rebranding and stick with what is already there.  West Cork is a brand in itself.</p><p> The backdrop behind Ms De Saulles is the Old Head at Kinsale.  About 4 or 5 miles off that, right now, are the most incredible megafauna and marine wildlife to be seen anywhere in the world.  I must declare an interest here.  I was formerly a whale watching guide in Courtmacsherry, which is only approximately 7 miles from where Ms De Saulle is.  The marine wildlife off the coast of west Cork is absolutely phenomenal.  There are fin whales, which are the second largest whale species that has ever lived, humpback whales, common dolphins, minke whales and basking sharks.  It is unbelievable.  During July, August and September, people realised for the first time that they had this on their doorstep.  I am not sure F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland recognise that and I would like them to take that criticism on board.  I am not seeing it in a big way.  There should be a much bigger push because the whale watching in Ireland is among the best on the planet in terms of the number of species one can see.  It is a bit nippy and cold but if people dress up they can have an absolutely amazing experience.  That is something I would like to see addressed in future strategies.</p><p> I will make one final point and hopefully there will be a second round of questions.  I refer to the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  The witnesses cannot answer this directly but I would love to know if they have had feedback from their members.  We are getting a lot of contact and phone calls from businesses, and hotels in particular, that have had their CRSS withdrawn under level 3.  This is a backward move.  My understanding of the legislation is that where there are restrictions to accessing a business, it should be able to avail of the CRSS and there are still countywide restrictions in place.  Take a smaller county like Carlow, for example.  People there cannot rely only on business from within their county.  That needs to be reversed, at least up until 18 December.</p><p> I have only left the witnesses with 25 seconds to respond but there will hopefully be a second round because I have other questions as well.  If they could elaborate on any of those issues, it would be great.  I ask Mr. Kelly to address the strategies, the Haven Coast idea in the context of west Cork and so on.</p></speech>

We have a very significant programme to follow up on the Ireland, "Make a Break for It" campaign as soon as we are ready to go.  We have a suite of creative ideas under the name Keep Discovering, which is the follow up from that.  The research we got back showed that 95% of people who took a domestic holiday during the summer were either very or extremely satisfied with it.  We think there is a significant opportunity to drive up the amount of revenue and employment that comes from domestic tourism.  Previously, Irish residents spent roughly the same amount of money abroad as overseas holidaymakers spend in Ireland.  Irish residents spent in the region of &euro;2 billion holidaying in Ireland and approximately &euro;5.5 billion holidaying abroad.  If we could get even &euro;1 billion of what Irish residents spend holidaying abroad into Ireland, that would be a huge boon to the tourism economy.  It spreads all around the country and across the year.  It is very valuable and we have a very significant campaign to follow up on that.</p> <p>  As regards the Wild Atlantic Way and the Haven Coast, there is absolutely no intention whatsoever of dividing up the Wild Atlantic Way.  The Wild Atlantic Way is the Wild Atlantic Way.  The Haven Coast was a way of describing a part of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It was not intended to be a brand on its own or anything like that.  We have dialled back from that idea because it was creating some confusion.  We are very much focused on the Wild Atlantic Way as the brand.  There is no need to be concerned about that.  Destination brands like west Cork will still exist their own right.  We are completely aligned on that.</p> <p>  On dolphin and whale watching, we did a bunch of international research on different experiences, how appealing they were in terms of their breadth and how motivated people were to travel specifically for them.  Dolphin and whale watching came out high and we are keen to dial that up.  There are issues around scalability and so on, and it has to be done in a sustainable way, but that is very much on our radar and it is available all along the west coast, from Donegal to west Cork.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and acknowledge F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland's teams, as well as the Department officials who work extremely hard to promote Ireland.  The tourism sector makes a vital contribution to the local economy in the constituency I represent in Mayo.  It supports over 5,500 jobs and generates something in the region of &euro;208 million for the local economy.  The challenge for businesses all over the country is to ensure we rebuild employment.  We must ensure that employers are supported during this very challenging period.  I refer to the adaption grants that were designed for tourism businesses to make improvements in order that they could continue trading through level 3, 4 or 5 restrictions.  Caf&eacute;s and restaurants, or premises that did not have an alcohol licence, were excluded from those grants.  Is there any justification for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#C00900"><p>Our primary remit is tourism.  We extended the adaptation grants to include as much of hospitality as we could, such as pubs and restaurants.  Our issue with caf&eacute;s is about the definition of a caf&eacute; because there are coffee stations in Applegreens, Centras and petrol stations throughout the country.  The criteria we had to go off was what was a licensed premises.  We were processing thousands of applications on for these grants in a short period of time.  That was the practical issue.  It is also important to note that that money came from a diversion of our capital funding so it could only be used for capital items such as Perspex screens and hand sanitiser.  It could not be used for wearable PPE or other items.  It was not a general thing.  Those are simply the rules from finance because it was capital funding.  The amount of money caf&eacute;s would have had to invest in capital type items would be very small and therefore, the amount we would have been able to give any caf&eacute; would have been tiny.</p></speech>

An awful lot of restaurants that were not in a position to have an alcohol licence closed during level 5 restrictions and found it extremely difficult to be viable if they reopened.  That is the real challenge that we had to listen to as public representatives.  Many of these restaurants were sole restaurateurs and not gastropubs, which could afford to do without the grants.  It was very difficult for us to explain that situation to people.  One has to come from the business point of view in terms of looking at criteria and trying to meet them.</p></speech>

They would not have been on our system and they would not be used to these type of grant applications.  That was the reason for many of the issues.  We extended the deadline to allow more businesses apply and we have given as much support as possible.  Any restaurateur with an alcohol licence, whether he or she was open or not, was able to apply as long as he or she had a commitment to reopen.  We do not want to be putting taxpayers' money into businesses that are not going to reopen.  As long as they were giving a commitment to reopen at some stage they would have been eligible to apply so there should not have been an issue in that regard.</p></speech>

My questions are for Ms De Saulles and Mr. Gibbons.  To start off on the good news, a vaccine will be available in a shorter time than we previously thought.  In my area of Wexford, hoteliers such as Billy Kelly, Colm Neville and Anton Treacy, who run three of the biggest hotels in Wexford, are major employers.  They were very concerned about their staff.  How can we further support hoteliers without compromising public health?</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly of F&aacute;ilte Ireland said in his opening statement that it established 23 local recovery task forces nationwide.  Would it be possible to get more detail on that, for example, the destinations, whether local businesses can tie in with them and, if so, how they can do that?  </p> <p>  Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland.  What impact do the witnesses believe Brexit will have on its work?  Have Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland explored the possibility of engaging with the next generation of content creators who often conduct travel blogs on new media such as TikTok?  There is an opportunity in that regard for a new audience that might no longer be on Facebook or Instagram.  Has that potential marketing avenue been explored?</p> <p>  How do the witnesses believe they can increase international travel?  How can we improve the traffic light system being used?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gibbons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#D00500"><p>Regarding Brexit, we established a Brexit task force the week after the UK voted to leave the European Union.  We have conducted approximately five or six waves of research in our key markets of North America, Germany, France and Britain to see the impacts in respect of travel to Ireland.<br/><br/>In terms of the major standing, first, if the UK was to leave without a deal on 1 January there might be a possible depreciation of sterling, which makes Ireland more expensive.  Second, in the context of Covid-19, there are a number of what appear to be very small issues but they matter to families travelling.  For example, what is their situation with regard to the European health insurance card for people who travel from the UK, which is a third country now?  The situation with regard to car insurance and pet passports are trivial in the context of Covid but in the context of summer holidays how will they impact on people's capacity to travel?<br/><br/>The other issue which works to our advantage is the fact that the common travel area will continue post 1 January.  That is something Ireland will enjoy as a competitive advantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>British people travelling to the Continent from 1 January onward.<br/><br/>The other concern we have is that on the Northern Ireland front the research we have conducted on France and Germany indicates a level of confusion among consumers who pick up their newspaper, do not know the details of our politics here and decide that it might be a lot of hassle to come to Ireland with all that is going on at the Border.  They may wonder if they can cross it, for instance.  We are getting those questions from German and French travel operators.  It is a minor hassle but enough for people to say, &quot;I'll leave it this year and I might go next year when all the issues have settled down&quot;.  We are on top of those issues.  Our Brexit task force met again last month.  It consists of senior members of the UK and Irish travel industries.  We plan to meet again in the first week or two of January when, hopefully, we will have a clear answer as to where we are going.<br/><br/>On the overseas issues, the Deputy mentioned travel influencers on TikTok.  We have a range of things going on in the digital space.  Our new <i>Ireland.com</i>suite of websites has just been launched in 12 different languages.  It is for English speaking countries, such as the US and Britain, and for France, Germany, Japan, China, etc.  We also have a digital marketing project which will include more personalisation in terms of advertising.  <br/><br/>Regarding social media, we have a new strategy under way that is looking at the areas the Deputy spoke about such as TikTok and other new media that can reach a new audience that traditional platforms like Facebook do not meet.  In terms of where we stand right now, Facebook is still colossal for us.  We are the fourth largest agency in the world on Facebook and Twitter.  We have 4.5 million friends on it and they all have an average of 200 friends each.  If we can get everybody to like our share about Ireland, we will reach an audience of more than 900 million people.  They are still very significant platforms but things are changing rapidly in the area.<br/><br/>On the traffic light system, we were very pleased to see it come in.  It is also complicated by the fact that the UK is not operating the traffic light system.  It is operating air corridors.  We did an analysis to see what would have been open, in terms of Covid infection rates, if the traffic light system had been in place since last March.  Britain could have been open to us during the summer for a few months, and Germany also, but a market like the United States is completely outside the zone; it is in the red zone.  The traffic light system combined with the comprehensive track and trace system, and hopefully a vaccine, will see us open the doors next summer.</p></speech>

Obviously, not all the tourism businesses will be able to be involved in it but it is about the leadership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tom Enright's team in Wexford County Council.  As a Castlebridge man I was never going to not have a recovery task force and that is under way.</p> <p>  In terms of the support for the hotels, which another Deputy mentioned, there are a number of major issues.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, at level 3 is essential to allow hotels get sorted.  I could speak for a long time about all the various challenges the industry is facing but we might come back to that when answering other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#D00700"><p>I welcome our guests, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Gibbons and Ms De Saulles.  This is a huge issue and the figures given by the witnesses are stark and scary in terms of the number of insolvencies we will face.</p> <p>  I want to be positive regarding the products we have in Tipperary.  I congratulate Pat Slattery, Triona O'Mahoney and Marie Phelan regarding the Munster Vales and the new product they launched recently.  I thank the witnesses for their support of that.  It is a tourism development strategy encompassing three or four counties and mountain ranges.  We have nice places to visit in Tipperary.  We are not only renowned for hurling and horses.  We have a lot of scenery also.</p> <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been involved as an advisory body to the HSE and it has been blamed by the publicans in respect of the wet and dry pubs.  Who came up with the name "wet pubs"?  We do not have to wear Wellingtons going into any pub, thank God.  It is a horrible name and I would like to get some clarification on it because there are major issues now around the CRSS.  In the last opening up, some pubs got food from approved providers and made arrangements for it to be safely eaten in their premises but that has been denied to them now.  I have been told by gastropub owners that they will not be able to reopen because they are afraid of crowds who may come from 20 or 30 miles away.  There is not a level playing field in that regard and that needs to be sorted out because it is very unfair.</p> <p>  Knockmealdown Active, which is a small voluntary group, and other voluntary groups are working to promote tourism and get their areas fit for its return.  I often use the greenway in Dungarvan but also the new blueway.  Deputy Griffin, when he was Minister of State, was down in County Waterford with us but we have a fabulous blueway on the River Suir and I want to compliment all involved in that.  That is good for our health also but we need to market it.</p> <p>  The hotel sector needs to be supported because even though they were closed they were paying huge amounts of money in standing orders to a plethora of different providers and they were fleeced.  They have accrued massive losses while their doors were closed.  The witnesses cannot deal with that but I appeal to them to consider it in their role as an advisory body to the Government.  I would be happy if they would answer those few questions.</p></speech>

We were delighted to support the team in Munster Vales.  I have cycled the Carrick-on-Suir blueway and know how beautiful it is.  Tipperary has got tremendous potential.  I welcome the new tourism strategy for the area.  I have been through it and it is a fabulous county and we support the development of it.  I believe there is a bright future for tourism in Tipperary.</p> <p>  With regard to the language around wet pubs, I have no idea where that word originated from but the Government, following health advice, was trying to allow pubs that serve food to open.</p><p>The distinction between a gastropub and a restaurant is unclear.  I am not sure whether I am in a restaurant or in a gastropub these days.  It is hard to draw the line but we wanted to find some mechanism to allow those pubs that serve food to open when restaurants were open.</p><p> I completely agree with the points on the challenges that businesses face and the standing costs.  One area that struck me recently is that of insurance, which needs attention.  If businesses are not trading and if they have far fewer customers and staff as a result, there is a significant reduction in their risk profile.  However, we are hearing stories that insurance premiums are only being reduced by 6% or 7% in some cases and those reductions are applying to next year's premiums as opposed to a rebate being provided on this year's premiums.  That is not strictly within the remit of F&aacute;ilte Ireland but looking at some of those costs that businesses have had to incur, there should be better supports for the industry in that area.  That issue should be looked at.</p></speech>

I thank them all for being with us today.  It was a great honour and pleasure to work with them for three years from 2017 until the middle of this year.  I have seen at first hand just how hard they and their teams work.  It is more than just a job.  Those who are working in agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland must have a passion, and that is clear to everyone who has contact with them.  I thank them for the work they do on behalf of the people of Ireland and I acknowledge the huge work that goes on behind the scenes.  In particular, I pay tribute to the efforts that have been expended this year since the arrival of Covid-19.</p> <p>  Often with tourism events, whether they are overseas or here, we talk about the need for resilience in the face of shock events such as foot and mouth disease, the attacks of 11 September 2001, the ash cloud event or the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, epidemic but nobody could have envisaged what 2020 has brought.  It is ironic that this day last year, I was with Tourism Ireland - Mr. Kelly would have been there as well - launching the 2020 marketing plans.  Who could have foreseen where we would be a year later?</p> <p>  It will be very important, as we move into 2021, particularly into the second, third and fourth quarters, that we are ready for the recovery and ready to bounce back.  I concur with the statements that have been made on supports for business.  I ask that every effort is made to speed up the processing of applications for business supports.  It is also important that the CRSS be made available for the hospitality sector at level 3 as well.  I am glad that was mentioned because level 3 is similar to level 5.  Is there a specific focus for 2021, given that we do not expect to be fully back to normal?  Is there a particular focus from F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland on the outdoors and on trying to promote activities that the consumer might be more comfortable with?  Is the research showing that this is what people have an appetite for when they start travelling?  Beyond that, assuming we will have a full vaccination roll-out during 2021, how long will it take to get back to where we were in 2019?  Will we revert to 2019 figures in 2022?</p></speech>

It was a great pleasure to work with him during those years and I thank him for all of his support during that time.  His passion, enthusiasm, energy and insight were valued and I thank him for that.</p> <p>  On the outdoors, that is a central part of our strategy in terms of development because it will be important not just during Covid-19 but post Covid-19.  We have to define the outdoors as both urban and rural and we have to define both daytime and night-time.  We are looking at all of those aspects.  Just yesterday, we engaged with a number of local authorities, including Kerry County Council, on a proposal that we will announce in more detail after Christmas around the building of facilities for shared activity use to access the water in beach locations and so on.  We are working through all of our destination towns, which the Deputy launched with us in Tralee last year.  There are a bunch of public realm improvements that will facilitate improved enjoyment of the outdoors in urban areas in terms of public seating, signage and general public realm improvements.  The research completely backs up the view that this is what people want and that is coming through from the Irish and international research.  That is a big part of what we will be doing.</p> <p>  We are acutely aware of the cash flow pressures businesses are under and we are moving as fast as we possibly can on the processing of grants.  Unfortunately for the adaptation grants scheme, the applications came through late and we had to extend the deadline.  We then got thousands of applicants in the last two days, which slows everything down.  We are working through them as fast as we can and we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

What are our customers saying about us?  We have conducted thousands of surveys in recent months and some of the key messages are that when people get travelling again - as they are very keen to do - they will travel to destinations that are closer to home.  They are keen to get back to visiting their friends and family and they will likely go to familiar destinations.  That is different from the message we would have been given a year ago when people were looking for destinations they could brag about and the new and the wonderful.  What does that mean for us?  It means we are well-positioned and that we are likely to be out much earlier in markets such as Great Britain, mainland Europe and North America than we will be in long-haul markets, which we do not expect to really come back until 2022 and beyond.</p> <p>  There are other trends.  For example, 20% of European travellers do not see themselves taking a break until 2022.  There are still a lot of people who are undecided on their destination for next year.  Ireland benchmarks well against a competitive set.  Unfortunately, higher Covid-19 rates put people off.  The types of issues people are looking at online are the costs of travelling and also cancellation policies, which are significant.  They are also wondering if their travel insurance will cover them if they get Covid-19.  There is still a big cloud of uncertainty out there.  The big message coming through is that people are still planning and dreaming of a trip and very keen to travel.  As I said, there will be a bigger focus next year on markets that are closer to home.  We are looking to be ready to get out of the blocks as soon as the time is right.</p></speech>

I wonder if he could expand on that.  Does he have any predictions in that regard?  What do we need in the short term, over the coming months, to stop the large-scale failure of businesses in the sector?</p></speech>

We are key accounting hundreds of businesses around the country and providing business mentoring and financial support.</p><p>Through those engagements and through our engagements with some of the leading accountancy agencies, we are seeing more and more of those businesses teetering on the brink and which are likely, in the first half of next year, to have difficulty returning a set of accounts that would classify them as a viable going concern.  When the July stimulus and the budget were done, the outlook for the tourism and hospitality business was probably more positive than now, given the level 5 restrictions we have had for the past six weeks.  While it is great that intercounty travel will be open for three weeks at a key time and one that is good for safety, those restrictions are probably tighter than was envisaged at the time.</p><p> We have spoken about the CRSS.  Regarding how banks are approaching businesses now, the moratorium, which was absolutely vital for survival, ended in October.  It is still relatively early days since that ended but we are now getting to hear back how banks are treating tourism and hospitality businesses on a case-by-case basis.  Whereas in some instances we are hearing of banks being supportive and flexible, we are also hearing of cases where banks are demanding full capital and interest repayments in line with a normal schedule as if business was ongoing.  That is clearly unsustainable when businesses cannot trade and cannot get any revenue.  We do not have enough evidence to call anybody out individually yet, but we are hearing of some cases, which we will be monitoring and following up as appropriate.  The support from banks will be essential.</p><p> The Government-supported schemes through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, have very low applicability and uptake in tourism businesses.  They are not helping the tourism sector to any material extent.  Only a handful of businesses in the tourism sector have been able to access those.  It is not that the Government does not want the money to go there but because of the process and the involvement of banks, the money is not going into tourism businesses.  For businesses to be able to refinance and restructure their debt, as Mr. Gibbons said, the recovery will not come immediately and there will be a period before we can build back up to the types of business levels we thought we would have.  It will be critical to find a mechanism to help businesses restructure their financing.</p></speech>

Can what is left over be carried over to 2021?  Mr. Gibbons said that its already paid-for promotional activity had been postponed or cancelled.  Can it recoup any of that?  Does it have a bigger promotion budget for next year, given what we will be coming out of and what we will be going into?</p></speech>

We still have ongoing investments to keep everything running.  Our staff were engaged in a very active programme during the year.  We are in talks with the Department about how unspent funds at the end of the year can be handled; hopefully it will supplement our budget next year.</p> <p>  The Government set up a tourism recovery task force.  Its report in the summer recommended a doubling of the tourism marketing fund for next year.  That will be under consideration in the coming months when the time is right to do that.  The existing budgets would be insufficient for the level of work required when we get back to a post-Covid world.  I am sorry I do not have the exact figure but we are-----</p></speech>

It is complicated by the fact that we get 25% of our funding from Northern Ireland, which comes in sterling and has a different year-end.  We have funding ratios that we need try to maintain.  I would be very happy to come back to the Deputy with the figures.</p></speech>

We all agree that 2019 was a fantastic year for tourism in Ireland with 260,000 jobs.  Every &euro;1 million spent on tourism supports 27 jobs, while generating money for the Exchequer of &euro;1.8 million.</p> <p>  I come from the wee county, Louth, which contains the M1 motorway connecting Dublin to Belfast.  Louth is very lucky to have the two biggest towns in Ireland, Dundalk and Drogheda, as well as plenty of small towns and villages.  We appreciate the capital investment in Louth in recent years on King John's Castle in Carlingford, as well as the money invested in the Fleadh Cheoil in Drogheda.  We, in Louth, feel we have much to offer and this corner of Ireland should not be neglected.  We have the Drogheda Museum in Millmount, St. Peter's church, the Monasterboice high cross and round tower, the Carlingford adventure centre, the great eastern greenway, which connects Omeath and Carlingford, as well as the County Museum in Dundalk, to name just a few.</p> <p>  The alarm signals are in the report.  In 2020, the industry will lose &euro;6 billion, with thousands of jobs lost especially along the Border.  What plans have been put in place?  All counties have done well in recent years.  To make money requires investment.  We are hoping that the funding is there.  The witnesses spoke well together.  What plans do they have for tourism funding in Louth?</p> <p>  It was mentioned that &euro;3 million was refunded to businesses in fees etc., which seems like a small amount of money.  What are the plans?  I ask the witnesses not to forget County Louth.</p></speech>

The pressure is now on Mr. Kelly.</p></speech>

On the &euro;3 million in fees, as soon as the Covid pandemic hit we immediately refunded to businesses any registration fees for accommodation and fees to participate in sales platforms that either we or Tourism Ireland would run.  It was a tiny drop in the ocean in the context of a &euro;6 billion revenue loss, but it was important for us to get whatever we could back to businesses.</p> <p>  Regarding our own funding, we repurposed about &euro;16 million at short notice.  The Government gave us a further &euro;10 million for the adaption grant scheme.  In recent weeks we launched a grant scheme for inbound agents.  These are the people at the top of the funnel who bring people into Ireland who then stay in hotels, eat in restaurants, use buses and taxis etc.  If these people go out of business, we lose the business they have on their books and we lose the vital relationships they have with international buyers.</p> <p>  We have swept up any money that we have left over in our budget and put it into a fund total of about &euro;10 million that we will now distribute to those inbound agents.  They did not qualify for CRSS and the only support they have had was the wage subsidy scheme, which is not enough to cover any of their fixed costs.  We have allocated any funding we have had left over into that to help fund those businesses.  Basically, any funding we have been able to get from our own resources we have prioritised giving that to businesses.  In all of our work and analysis we have advocated for more Government support going into the businesses.</p> <p>  We have been working with Louth County Council.  For a wee county, Louth is a very important part of Ireland's Ancient East offering and has some great historic assets.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned King John's Castle and so on.  I am delighted to say that we will complete our destination towns project with Louth County Council in Drogheda in the second half of next year.  That will further improve and enhance Drogheda's offering and appeal to tourists.  It is very much on our radar.  We continue to invest in the area.  That is just one example of an upcoming project.</p></speech>

We have already had a few genealogists who have mapped his ancestry contact us.  We can make the most of that when the time comes.  We have good connections with Louth.  It is an important part of the future.  When we get going next year, it will not be off of our map.  I assure the Deputies of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#G00300"><p>I thank all of the witnesses not only for the time they have spent with us this afternoon but for the significant time they have spent in working with those involved in tourism and hospitality, shepherding them through what has been an unprecedented time for all.  I have just a couple of observations to make.  I suppose there is no harm in being somewhat parochial when one gets the opportunity.  I live approximately 20 minutes from the Wild Atlantic Way.  Some excellent work has been done over recent years to determine how to drive some of the significant traffic this wonderful concept generates further inland and off the Wild Atlantic Way, both to make it more sustainable with regard to how it is traversed and the impact it has on towns and villages along the route and to drive additional economic activity inland.</p> <p>  One such proposition is the Burren loop, which takes in the north of the Burren and southern Galway, an area we like to refer to as the Burren lowlands.  Significant work is ongoing in that regard.  It was supposed to be live for the season just gone but that was obviously never going to happen in the context of where we are.  I hope it will be live for next season and that all necessary signage will be in place.  There is a very large number of tourism operators in the area.  Mr. Gibbons mentioned the award for sustainable tourism recently given to operators in the Burren area.  They are very ambitious with regard to what this loop can do for some of the smaller inland towns and villages off the Wild Atlantic Way.</p> <p>  While I am on the Wild Atlantic Way, through nobody's fault, an excellent project to develop a cycling event along the length of the Wild Atlantic Way was not successful.  It is a massive undertaking for any cyclist.  The event was broken down into 16 stages, which may have been one of the reasons it was not as successful as had been hoped.  I still believe, however, that we have a powerful opportunity to develop a number of cycling events along the Wild Atlantic Way, which could be marketed internationally.  It is one of the most stunning locations in the world with regard to its scenery, the welcome, and the people, traditions and culture of the area.  I hope that, despite difficulties having arisen with the first iteration, we might try to get something similar under way again.</p> <p>  The Beara Breifne Way, which is Ireland's potential answer to the Camino, starts in County Cork and winds its way all the way to Cavan.  A significant part of the route runs through east Galway along the Hymany Way.  An initial commitment of just over &euro;1 million was made a number of months ago.  How has that money been spent?  How do we intend to further market this extraordinary opportunity to open up Ireland's Hidden Heartlands?  As somebody who has a passion for tourism, exploration and using his bike to see different parts of the world, I believe there is an incredible opportunity here to open up a whole region, that middle part of the country running through the spine of Ireland along the banks of the Shannon, through places that have yet to experience the kind of economic lift that tourism can provide.  What are the plans for that area in the future?</p> <p>  Well done to all the witnesses for the exceptional work they are doing in very challenging times.  When we emerge from this, we will emerge stronger and more focused on where our real strengths lie with regard to marketing ourselves internationally.  Well done to both groups on their excellent use of social media.  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland can hold themselves up as global exemplars in the use of social media.  We have really upped our game in this regard over the past five to ten years and we are seeing the results internationally.</p></speech>

It should be fully open by the time tourism gets up and running again.  It is a fantastic part of the world.  We were delighted to see the work of everyone involved in the ecotourism project recognised.  The idea of looped drives off the Wild Atlantic Way will be key in helping people have an even better experience and helping to spread visitors in order that it is more sustainable and better managed.  It will also share the benefit of tourism with a wider proportion of the community.  The Burren loop is a great example of that and I believe it will lead to a lot more development and new small businesses, such as sustainable ecocraft businesses, setting up in that part of the world.  It will be ten years' time before we really see the full benefits of the Burren loop.</p> <p>  We have a master plan for both the Beara Breifne Way and the Shannon navigation.  These are in train at the moment.  As for the Beara Breifne Way, it is really important to note that it is not just about the walk or the path itself but about how these paths and walks, when built, connect with businesses and communities along the way.  How do we get people onto the Beara Breifne Way from a town that is 1 km or 2 km away from it?  How do we get people off it and into local bed and breakfast accommodation, local cafes and so on?  All of this tourism development is part of the master plan for the development of the Beara Breifne Way.</p> <p>  With regard to cycling on the Wild Atlantic Way, we were very disappointed that things went wrong with the first iteration of that but we are fully committed to, and believe massively in the potential of, the Wild Atlantic Way becoming globally famous as a cycling route or as a number of cycling routes.  We are working with a range of stakeholders to try to bring that to life.</p></speech>

I will pose a couple of quick questions.  I thank both organisations for their presentations and for the work they do on behalf of the sector.  It is appreciated.  The stark figures outlined in the presentations demonstrate the severity of what we are dealing with both from an economic point of view and the point of view of sectoral interests.</p> <p>  With regard to the supports, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was before the committee at the start of October and was looking forward to the three or four-month period during which various incentives were to be put in place, one of which was the stay and spend initiative.  There was a fund of more than &euro;200 million for this scheme.  In the context of the number of weeks for which we were in level 5, I expect that, if one were to break it down, somewhere in the region of &euro;40 million was saved.  Will that money be reinvested in the sector as grant aid?  What sort of communication has there been between Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister as to what is going to be done with that money?</p></speech>

We worked with them to market and promote the scheme.  As the Senator will know, the mechanism is one of tax rebate.  We were never allocated a pot of money or anything in this regard.  There is no pot that can be reallocated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.737" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#G01000"><p>I know that but Mr. Kelly's agency is an industry player and will have communicated with Mr. Niall Cody or whoever as to whether the timeframe was to be extended or as to how the money it was proposed would be lost to the Exchequer in tax could be reinvested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#H00100"><p>That will be a matter for our Department to take up with the Department of Finance.  I imagine that the financial projections that were done at the time across the whole economy in respect of the stay-and-spend scheme have ended up being quite different from what has come out because of the deteriorating health position.  Importantly, because we moved to level 5 restrictions, the stay-and-spend scheme could not be accessed.  A tax rebate on money spent on tourism, considering that 23 cent in every euro spent on tourism goes back to the Exchequer, with the Exchequer reinvesting some of that to stimulate demand would pay for itself as an initiative.  The principle of the initiative is great-----</p></speech>

I will move on, but Revenue will never come chasing anyone to hand money back, so the liaison and the communication are important.  The concept was good.  I am not too sure it will be realised if we go into January with further restrictions.  We will not see the scheme realise what it was supposed to do in the domestic market.</p></speech>

Whatever the Government allocates in the context of what it thought would be lost to the Exchequer on one side, that theoretical pool of money must be driven back in.</p> <p>  The issue of liquidity was touched on.  Paul Gallagher was before the committee before the move to level 5.  He discussed this briefly with me.  He said hotels would not disclose that they are having liquidity issues.  He talked about the forecast numbers for November.  We are talking about an occupancy of 4%, which would equate to nearly 60,000 empty bedrooms during the month.

Given the gravity of liquidity issues, what are the sector's expectations for January, February and March?</p></speech>

At the moment, the sector has only been told it can open with inter-county travel until 6 January.  What will happen after 6 January?  Obviously, what will happen on the health front will be a massive determinant of that.  That period until the season gets going again post St. Patrick's Day is always the worst time of year anyway.  It is always the toughest time of year to get through.  People are now facing into it with nothing left in the reserves, so I think the expectation is, once again, very grim.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Mr. Kelly said about the bar that was used in licensing and so on.  Is there good collaboration between Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland on marketing the food product?  Tourism Ireland has used that as a marketing point and has carried out analysis as to what can differentiate us from other countries and bring tourists here.  Is there good collaboration between both bodies in that respect?</p></speech>

About this time last year we were just coming to the end of Taste the Island, which was a three-month-long food initiative we had developed to build and market the island of Ireland as a quality food destination.  It was a joint initiative between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism NI and Tourism Ireland that had got off to a great start.  It was just being established last year.  This year was supposed to be the year it was going to be marketed internationally but, obviously, it made no sense to run it this year.  That is just one example of how we work together to promote the food offering in Ireland.  Does Mr. Gibbons wish to add anything?</p></speech>

That was a good initiative.  Food will be another passion point in the new campaign we will go out to shoot in the first quarter of next year and which will be part of the major relaunch.  I heard a great phrase a number of years ago.  We got research from a company called Cond&eacute; Nast, one of the most prestigious publications in our industry.  It stated that food is the new currency of tourism.  It influences people's choice of destination.  It is not always about going to gourmet restaurants, by the way.  It could be about going to the farmers' market.  It is about the local ingredients and the artisan producers.  Ireland is very well positioned now with some of the great work Bord Bia has done, for example, and we overlap with Bord Bia in this space to bring the taste of Ireland to the world.</p></speech>

There will be a huge number of people having left the industry who will not come back.  We have heard the anecdotal evidence of people going to work in supermarkets and so forth because they can get a guaranteed contract.  What will F&aacute;ilte Ireland's supports be for people getting back into the industry when it gradually reopens?</p></speech>

Just as Mr. Kelly was saying, that will be the huge challenge in bringing people into the industry.  We have a careers oversight group and we have been working with the third level education bodies as well as the ETBs on creating a range of easy-to-access training that can bring people into the industry.  One of the big challenges we have had with retention in tourism is the perception that there is no career, so we are doing a big piece of work within F&aacute;ilte Ireland on continuous development.  That is for those in the industry whom we can upskill in order that they can take the opportunities that will come in the future and will be encouraged to stay in the industry because they will believe there will be career progression opportunities for them.</p></speech>

Like my colleague, I apologise for being called away to vote.  A number of the issues I wanted to ask about have been raised but I will put a couple of specific questions to the witnesses.</p> <p>  One of the issues is the outcome of Brexit.  There has been a lot of emphasis on additional shipping routes.  Most of this has been around avoiding the land bridge, but I often think we have not focused sufficiently on ferry traffic.  Coming from Wexford, I have a particular interest in enhancing the offering in Rosslare.  With new ferry routes being put in place, there are opportunities.  Are there plans to develop and market those?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gibbons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#H01700"><p>This needs to be put into perspective.  Ferries are a really important source of business.  On the three corridors, in a normal year, so to speak, pre Covid, there are nearly 50,000 car spaces every single week.  People who travel on ferries tend to stay longer and spend more than people who arrive by air.  Ferry travel is a really important source of business for the regions on the northern, centre and southern corridors.  We have been talking to DFDS about the new ferry that was announced last week with a view, perhaps, to putting some supports in place for marketing in that regard.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is meeting Brittany Ferries as well to talk about Cork, so we are briefing him on that as well.  We do a lot of co-operative work with the existing carriers.  Again, I am talking about a pre-Covid environment, but the likes of Irish Ferries, Stena Line and P&amp;O engage in joint marketing campaigns with us, mainly in the British market but also in the French market, to stimulate that car traffic.  It is an important source of business, and the Brexit comment is very relevant at the moment too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#H01800"><p>One of the other issues is the CRSS and the need to extend the wage subsidy scheme.  We have talked about this extensively already but I have specific concerns about some of the not-for-profit tourism ventures.  I am thinking of Wexford and Hook Head, Dunbrody and the Irish National Heritage Park, which have not been able to avail of the commercial subsidies and supports.  It will be essential that such ventures, which are located all around the country, will have the supports to survive until next summer, when the vaccine rolls out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#H01900"><p>In addition to the CRSS, the Government has allocated &euro;55 million in business continuity support for 2021 to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We are working through the detail of that scheme and how we might bring it to businesses.  There was very much a sense that we did not have clarity as to what the CRSS would and would not cover but that there would probably be gaps in it.  One of the issues is that to be eligible for the CRSS one has to be eligible for corporation tax, and those not-for-profits are not eligible for corporation tax.</p><p>We cannot confirm any details but we are aware of those sectors of the tourism economy that do not quality for the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and not-for-profit attractions such as the Dunbrody Famine ship, Hook Head, etc., would fall into that category.  We are very aware of those.  It is important that those types of community projects get supported because they bring visitors into areas.  They are strategic tourism businesses.  They bring business in and drive demand in an area.  We will be doing all we can to help in that regard.</p></speech>

International golf tourists are hugely important to Ireland.  That industry has been badly hit and has not been able to avail of the same supports.  How are we going to revitalise that sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gibbons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#J00300"><p>The whole golf space is a key part of what we offer internationally.  We saw, for example, the success of the Open Championship in Northern Ireland last year.  It got amazing publicity.  I know from personal experience that the absence of golfers up and down the west coast had a considerable impact on golf clubs this year.  That has a knock-on effect on caddies and downstream activities, so to speak.  Certainly on the marketing front, golf will be to the forefront of our promotional campaigns.  That is not only for attracting golfers, it is about the destination and all that goes with it because it is much higher end.  Mr. Kelly might want to talk about the product side of things.</p></speech>

All of the members of the association should be eligible for the inbound agency survival scheme that I spoke about and which we are funding with &euro;10 million.  That scheme is now open.  We are now working with those inbound tour groups to make sure of their survival because if they do not survive, we lose those relationships.  Those are the key people with whom Mr. Gibbons's team works in international markets so we have to make sure that those businesses survive.</p> <p>  I know that for some golf courses, though not all, international revenue is the mainstay of their finances.  They are struggling at the moment and will need some form of support.  We will be having conversations with our colleagues on the sport side because we do not want those trophy courses going out of business because they are really important.</p></speech>

We must think about getting to next summer and beyond, but Covid will have an impact on international travel and business travel.  If they were to make a pitch and look at the Irish tourism product in five years' time, where do our guests see it?  What will have been the impact of Covid and Brexit?  This is a bit of crystal ball gazing, but where do our guests see the industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#J00600"><p>I am sure Mr. Gibbons will talk from a marketing and positioning point of view.  I will talk from a product point of view.  It is important to say that there is a considerable amount of development going on at the moment.  We have approximately 50 to 55 large capital grant projects in train all around the country.  I think 15 of those are due to be completed and to open between 2020 and 2021.  The work is continuing on those projects.  One or two of them were delayed because of Covid but, in the main, they are all continuing.<br/><br/>We have invested &euro;15 million with local authorities in destination towns all around the country.  The Department of Transport is funding the development of greenways in conjunction with local authorities.  Local authorities around the country have carried out public realm work to enhance their outdoor offering through cycle lanes, outdoor seating and stuff.  All of that development has continued apace while we have been, effectively, closed to international tourists.  When those international tourists come back here, Ireland is going to be a far better place to come to than before the closure because of all that development work.  We will be going in with a strong product offering in that regard.<br/><br/>There are a couple of key areas when we look to the future.  The outdoors is essential and opening up and improving access to the outdoors, and boosting its enjoyability are essential.  Making the most of our State-owned land and assets is essential, as is improving access to them.  I am thinking of our national parks, Office of Public Works, OPW, sites, Coillte sites and all the assets that local authorities have.  <br/><br/>The digitisation of the industry is also important.  There are parts of the Irish industry, such as activity providers and attractions, that are behind the best in class in the world in their digital presence and online bookability.  During the pandemic, the global digital transformation has been massive.  Some of the metrics that the likes of Google look at indicate that the world has moved as much, in digital terms, in the past eight months as it had in the previous eight years.  A huge transformation has just happened.  That means that our tourism businesses and products must have a brilliant online presence.  We have done a complete overhaul of <i>discoverireland.ie</i>.  I know that Mr. Gibbons has done a fantastic job on <i>ireland.com</i>for international visitors.  We need all of our industry to be in the same space and we have a big project that is going to be driving that.<br/><br/>The final thing I will say relates to sustainability.  That is another big initiative that needs to happen and the tourism sector needs to play its part in Ireland meeting its climate change targets.  We need to drive the further decarbonisation of the tourism industry and find more sustainable transport solutions and things like that.  That is another big theme for the next five years.</p></speech>

I compliment both organisations.  If we look at the figures for Tourism Ireland prior to the pandemic, huge numbers were coming in and we were doing the job right.  I am involved in the county tourism committee in Longford and get regular emails with updates from Mr. Kelly.  Particularly since the outbreak of Covid, the Make a Break campaign has been excellent in the promotion that it has given to all parts of Ireland.  I was involved with the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, in pushing to get the Hidden Heartlands brand for our midlands area.  It has proved more than successful and the numbers are ahead of the projections at the beginning.  I compliment Mr. Paddy Matthews and the rest of the team working on that brand because they are doing an excellent job.  It has also given an opportunity for people to get to know their own areas.  People in Longford have got out and used the greenways and blueways, the walks along the river and our excellent forest walks.  A part of what the Hidden Heartlands brand is about is slow, easy tourism.  Hidden Heartlands has created opportunities.</p> <p>  I apologise if I cross over with questions that have already been asked because I had to go out of the room for a while in order to vote.  Mr. Kelly mentioned a number of schemes, including CRSS.  Have our guests identified areas that have not been serviced by various supports from the Government, a number of which Mr. Kelly has mentioned?  Have they met with Department officials to make sure that all areas of our tourism are being supported to make sure they will all be there in 2021?  Do our guests feel that F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have sufficient funds for a marketing campaign in 2021 and 2022?  Are there sufficient funds available to regain visitors to Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.765" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#J00900"><p>I thank the Senator for his kind words about the Hidden Heartlands.  It is surpassing expectations.  The businesses in the Hidden Heartlands had a disproportionately good summer and that Make a Break campaign worked particularly well for the area.  Businesses along the Shannon corridor, in particular, did very well for the period of time they were allowed to be open.</p> <p>  I am delighted to say that we will be finishing the destination town work in Longford town next year.  It will link up along the canal greenway which will further enhance that part of the world.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if we have enough money.  I would say, first and foremost, that the priority needs to be on business survival.  Of course, we could always spend more money but the priority would be to get as much money as possible to businesses to enable them to survive so they can be there to re-employ people and take advantage of tourism when it can come back, which it will.</p><p>We have regular meetings with all the sectors of industry, and there are people in the Hidden Heartlands who are facing challenges.  For example, those providing boat rental services are not included the scope of the CRSS, and that presents a real challenge to all those operating cruise businesses along the Shannon.  Those working in car rental and as inbound tour operators also fall outside of the scope of the CRSS.  Indeed, because of the way the scheme is set up, there are a number of sectors, which are not currently supported, other than through the wage subsidy scheme, and will need further support.  Boat rental is excluded from the reduction in VAT rate to 9% for historical reasons.  It is important that reduction is maintained into the future, to enable us to be competitive in a recovery, but if at all possible, it should be extended to include some sectors that are currently excluded, such as boat and car rental.</p></speech>

It must be extended next year, and hopefully businesses will be able to open for this.  We need to do more promotion to encourage businesses to register with the Revenue.  I checked on the statistics in October and in many counties the numbers of businesses registering are very low.</p> <p>  On the issue of the retail export scheme, I am cognisant of that.  I am thinking of the English tourism trade coming to Ireland.  There is an issue with the threshold of &euro;75 that has been put in place by the Department of Finance in respect of the VAT refund for purchases made and subsequently exported.  What are Mr. Kelly's views on that issue?  Is the threshold sufficient, or does he see it having an impact on the English tourism market in the years ahead?</p></speech>

Ideally, we would prefer there to be no threshold, but we do not think that there is a major issue with it.  Other countries are being more aggressive and are offering a tax refund.  I am not sure of the exact rationale behind the introduction of the threshold, but a threshold of &euro;75 is much better than one of &euro;175.  We would prefer the threshold to be zero so as to stimulate as much spend as possible in small retail outlets such as craft shops and other shops when tourists visit the country.</p></speech>

I am from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, which I believe is part of the Hidden Heartlands and part of Ireland's Ancient East.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success, and illustrates what marketing and packaging a destination can do for an entire region.  The Wild Atlantic Way campaign opened up that whole coastal area, which, prior to that, had not been viewed in the same light.  Are there any statistics available on the level of tourism to the Wild Atlantic Way, the Hidden Heartlands and the Ancient East?  I assume that the Wild Atlantic Way is the most popular of the three packages or concepts, but I would like the witnesses to comment on the issue.  Unlike places such as Killarney, west Cork and other beautiful tourist hotspots, Cavan-Monaghan is not somewhere that people automatically think about going for a week or a fortnight on holiday, but there are fantastic facilities and outdoor activities available there.  There is the additional aspect of being in the Border region, and with Brexit coming down the tracks, the area will face a new set of challenges.</p> <p>  In respect of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's engagement with the local authority in the area, I know that Joanne Hayes does wonderful work in trying to promote the county of Cavan.  I ask the witnesses to comment on their engagement with local authorities in the promotion of tourism in the area.  Belturbet is a town along the River Erne, which I recall as being a hive of activity ten years ago, with boats coming in, and tourists on the streets, but it is a very different landscape today from a tourism perspective.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the emphasis they place on areas and counties like Cavan-Monaghan.</p> <p>  I also want to get the views of the witnesses on festivals that have been completely shut down during the pandemic, which is something we have not discussed in detail today.  In this context, the Galway Arts Festival and Galway being the European Capital of Culture 2020 spring to mind, but also festivals all around Ireland, in particular those in coastal areas.  I am mindful of the loss of the revenue and tourism associated with the festivals and how we are going to come back from that.  I hope that we will only be living with Covid-19 for a certain period, and that the introduction of a vaccine will bring all those festivals back to what they were. The cancellation of the international arts festivals and concerts has caused huge loss to the tourism industry.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly also mentioned the Beara Breifne Way, with which I am unfamiliar.  I ask him to brief us on that. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#K00500"><p>I will first deal with the issue of cancelled festivals.  My heart goes out to all those involved with the Galway - European Capital of Culture 2020 project.  It was a fantastic opportunity and a great programme of work was devised, which was subsequently decimated by the impact of Covid-19.  We provided a great deal of support to festivals this year to help them to survive.  Festivals take a long time to plan and a significant amount of work goes into them, and it is more important that festivals survive so that they can return when they are permitted to do so.  While we do not envisage that festivals are going to happen in the first half of 2021 in the way they normally would, we will be giving them some level of funding.  The funding will be reduced, but it will help them to survive into the future.  We need to look at the situation in the second half of 2021 and how things are developing as to whether festivals can happen.  Perhaps Mr. Gibbons might comment on the international marketing of these festivals.</p> <p>  On the points the Chair raised about Cavan-Monaghan, I can confirm that the west part of County Cavan is in the Hidden Heartlands and the eastern part is in Ireland's Ancient East, as is Monaghan.  The opportunity that that brings for the area is very much on our radar.  Unfortunately the work to make Monaghan town a destination town will not be completed next year, but hopefully it will be completed in the first half of 2022, and we will have enhanced the offering of Monaghan town as a tourism destination.  We are working with the local authority in Cavan on the Hidden Heartlands concept, and the opportunities it provides, including  linking in with Fermanagh to promote the Cavan lakes and the Marble Arch Caves area, which is something that we think can be developed.</p> <p>  The Beara Breifne Way will be a big addition when we can bring it to life.  It is effectively a continuous walk from Blacklion down to the Beara Peninsula.  Cavan will be at one end of the way, so it will provide an opportunity to drive tourism growth as either a start or finish point on that walk.</p></speech>

We like to see a county fall into one brand area, because it is simpler for engaging with local stakeholders and local authorities, etc., but it also has to make sense when we are presenting it international visitors and sharing a map with them.  I do not think that tourism development in Cavan has in any way been harmed by it, it has just made it a little more complex.  It is something on which we are happy to continue to engage with the local authority and stakeholders, and keep it under review.</p><p>It is important that west Cavan is part of the Hidden Heartlands.  The offering there, including its lakes and so on, fits in better with the natural outdoors offering of the Hidden Heartlands than with the historical-based offering of Ireland's Ancient East.  That is important.  We will keep that split under review and continue to engage with local parties on the matter.</p></speech>

The Wild Atlantic Way has accelerated that.  It is the oldest of the brands.  These brands are all incredibly new by international standards.  They are babies.  The Wild Atlantic Way has been incredibly successful.  Ireland's Ancient East has grown very well and areas such as Wexford and Kilkenny have done very well.</p></speech>

Ms De Saulles may wish to address this issue because she was in charge of building Ireland's Ancient East.  The Hidden Heartlands has had a faster start than we had with Ireland's Ancient East.  We have had more industry engagement over the first year or so and it is going incredibly well.  Does Ms De Saulles wish to speak to Ireland's Ancient East, given her history?</p></speech>

They are babies.  As Mr. Gibbons will confirm, the Wild Atlantic Way has significant resonance with the domestic audience.  The Ireland's Ancient East brand had less resonance with the domestic audience, but it actually had significant resonance with the international audience.  When the international audience thinks of Ireland, it thinks of a green Ireland with castles and culture.  Where Ireland's Ancient East resonates is really with the US market and the market in European countries such as France.  It resonates better with the international market than it does with the domestic one.  That said, the Keep Discovering campaign we ran last year raised the profile of Ireland's Ancient East domestically.  It is continuing to grow in the domestic market and has great potential, as does the Hidden Heartlands.</p></speech>

I refer to Covid and the impact on outdoor activities.  Tourism attractions such as fishing have been kind of lost over the past ten or 15 years.  Do the witnesses have any plans to invest in that type of tourism again for counties such as Cavan?</p></speech>

It is important to focus on the activities that can bring the best revenue in to areas, but fishing is certainly within that remit.  Does Mr. Gibbons wish to contribute from an international point of view on the brands or fishing?</p></speech>

The Chairman referred to festivals.  They are really important for us.  Events such as the St. Patrick's festival, the Galway international Arts Festival - it was a tragedy this year - the big Listowel Writers' Week and the Belfast International Arts Festival are all major parts of our promotional platform overseas.</p> <p>  On Border counties, as an all-island agency, we would point out the importance of cross-Border dialogue.  It is important that we do not let the consumer think that all these experiences just stop at the Border.  A significant amount of great work has been done, going back to the Shannon-Erne project 20 years or 30 years ago.  That need to be continuously built on.  There is some good funding available under the PEACE initiative that we are continuing to talk to colleagues and tourist boards about to ensure the experiences do not just stop at the Border.</p></speech>

We are nearly up to the two hour limit.  The witnesses have been fantastic in their answers.  I will start with a positive.  It is phenomenal that the Chairman's constituency and my constituency are by a Camino-type walkway.  The Beara Breifne Way has significant potential.  It must be promoted and pushed because it involves everything good that Ireland has to offer.  It runs from the tip of the Beara peninsula up to County Cavan.  The Chairman and I will meet halfway on it some day.</p> <p>  I wish to get into a bit more detail on a few issues that have been touched on, particularly F&aacute;ilte Ireland operations.  I refer to the adaptation grant.  How much has been paid out on the adaptation grant so far and how much remains to be paid out?  When is it expected that the remainder could be paid out?</p></speech>

Importantly, we opened the scheme for pubs that do not serve food.  The closing date for those premises is not until 18 December, so we will be taking applications until just before Christmas.  It will only be in the new year that we will have some sense of how much has been drawn down.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Kelly referred to the fact that petrol stations, for example, might have coffee shops.  I think that decision has to be revisited.  I am not suggesting for a second that coffee shops in petrol stations should be brought within the remit of the adaptation scheme but there are some really impressive caf&eacute;s in towns and cities that have big demands for PPE gear, be it separation between tables, cleansing material, visors, masks and so on.  Some of them are quite surprised and disappointed that they have been left out of the adaptation grant just because they do not happen to have a liquor licence.  I ask Mr. Kelly to elaborate on that issue and maybe revisit that decision, if that is possible.</p></speech>

As the scheme was funded from capital money, it had to be designed to cover capital costs. Personal protective equipment and things like that could not be covered under the adaptation grant because of Government financing rules.  The scheme only covers assets.  For example, a Perspex screen could be covered but a mask could not.  A hand sanitiser unit could be covered but the hand sanitiser liquid could not.  That is because it is capital funding that we had to allocate and we were trying to get it to as many businesses as we could as quickly as we could to help cover those costs.  There may be a misunderstanding regarding the amount of money involved.  For example, the average amount allocated to pubs that do not serve food is &euro;1,000, while restaurants get an average of &euro;2,500.  It is important to recognise that the grant will not be the difference between closure and survival for these businesses.  The level of funding is probably dwarfed by what is available through the Covid restrictions support scheme and it is definitely dwarfed by the extended wage subsidy scheme, etc.  I do not want people to think they have been excluded and will miss out on &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 as a result.  That is not why the fund is there.  It is a relatively small amount of money and it can only be drawn down if the business has spent money on those types of assets.  That is a requirement of the grant.</p></speech>

When their neighbour competing for the same lunchtime market is able to get a bit of a competitive advantage because they can avail of this grant, it does make a difference.   I ask for the decision to be revisited.</p> <p>  When or how will the &euro;55 million contingency funding provided in the budget be spent?  Which stakeholders will be consulted regarding the allocation of that &euro;55 million?</p></speech>

We have four schemes under way at the moment.  We have the adaptation scheme, we are administering the bed and breakfast accommodation restart scheme and the coach tourism scheme for &euro;10 million, and we have the inbound agents&rsquo; scheme for &euro;10 million also.  We have a total of &euro;54 million between those schemes that we are trying to get out to businesses.  We have started work on the next &euro;55 million and have started designing the scheme based on all the inputs that we are receiving from the industry.  We hope to have further news on that in the first quarter of 2021.  I am not saying that we will have the detail of the full &euro;55 million by the first quarter of 2021 because we may end up doing that as a number of different schemes.  We are looking at all of the options at this stage and we may end up with it being a phased process.

I am conscious that we are getting close to the end so I will be very brief.  Can Mr. Kelly tell me about the development of two routes that I was very keen to have included in the programme for Government?  The first is the Carlingford to Cobh coastal route and the development of an experience along that route.  The other is the development of the wild Atlantic walking route from Malin Head to Kinsale.  I live along that route and have been very keen for years to see the linking up, for example, of the Dingle Way to the Kerry Way through Castlemaine Harbour.  Can I have an update on both of those experiences; is there a projected timeline in moving those forward?</p> <p>  Can Mr. Gibbons also tell me his views on international travel in the aviation sector?  In particular, I note that he envisages our best markets are the closer to home ones right now.  I was always struck in my time in the Department on the huge increase in lift between North America and Ireland during the years from 2011 to 2018-19.  Correct me if I am wrong but it went from seven routes in 2011 to 24 or 25 at the time of the peak in 2018-19.  What is Mr. Gibbons outlook as to our seat capacity from 2022 onwards?  How long will it take is to get back to the level of lift that we had at the peak period?  I am conscious that our witness does not have a crystal ball, as if he had I would be asking him for tonight&rsquo;s lotto numbers, - I believe is approximately &euro;12 million tonight - but on a serious note, what is Mr. Gibbons's best judgment on the above question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gibbons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020120200002#M00500"><p>That is a hard question to answer right now.  All of those aviation routes have been decimated.  The Deputy is quite right in that the North American experience was spectacular for the past seven to eight years.  Traditional gateways like New York, Boston, and Chicago are there and they will come back on a smaller scale in the initial sense, but we are looking out for where the real spectacular growth came from in the last six to seven years which was from places like San Francisco, LA, Seattle, and Dallas with American airlines, together with Philadelphia and Charlotte.  I have no crystal ball right now but we need to talk to all of the carriers which are living now day by day.  Back in March Delta Airlines had a cash burn of $100 million a day which is now down to $18 million.  These are big numbers which are impacting on the connectivity.</p> <p>  The American airlines have been granted a bailout of $50 billion by the US Government to keep things going; and Lufthansa has received &euro;9 billion as have Air France and KLM.  We are fortunate to have two great carriers in Ryanair and Aer Lingus that serve us really well and we have to do everything we can to work with those airlines to help restore connectivity, particularly into our regional airports.  Dublin Airport is in very difficult shape now but many of the airlines will return to Dublin.  Ireland West Airport, Knock, however, is closed at the moment.  Shannon Airport has no commercial flights right now and Cork Airport has an average of two per day.  One of the biggest crises we will have will be the restoration of the numbers of people coming here.</p> <p>  People are putting out some projections that perhaps we will see it restored within three years.  There are many factors which will underpin this.  Ryanair made that comment recently and we would love to think that because that would be the ultimate driver of how fast recovery comes.  Many of those airlines and routes, however, were hard won.  They are sometimes marginal calls as to whether one will fly from Dallas to Dublin or to Manchester.  We go in and work very hard to sell the destination and we are going to have to do that again.</p></speech>

We are continuing to work on research and scoping around the Wild Atlantic Way coastal walking route.  That was another one of those immense ideas when we researched different product ideas that could drive much incremental business.  We are continuing to do the scoping work on that.  We were delighted to see the Carlingford to Cobh route in the programme for Government and we are beginning to scope out the thinking on what that might look like but that is at the very early stages.  The one thing I can say is that, as Mr Gibbons has stated, the visitor experience does not stop at the Border and I had one conversation with my colleague, John McGrillen of Tourism Northern Ireland, about what might happen if we had that route and how that might go up and around places like the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway etc.  It is an excellent initiative and we will be working on it but we are in the very early stages of looking at what kind of shape it might take and are trying to be as creative as possible in looking at different alternatives there.  It is also important to think of sustainability within that.</p></speech>

I remember doing reconnaissance in January 2018, in driving south from Dublin to Wexford and Waterford along that part of the coastline.  There is immense potential.  I agree with Mr. Kelly on the issue of sustainability, which is the buzzword we need to focus on.  This can be done and become a very successful product and can again mirror the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, which is only seeing the beginning of its success.  In further developing that into a continuous walking route, this can be something for many generations to come and can be a great moneyspinner for local communities along the way.

We promote a great deal in Ireland and in Longford alone recently F&aacute;ilte Ireland have invested in the Knights &amp;amp; Conquests Heritage Centre project, which I was involved in at the beginning, together with work on Maria Edgeworth, projects where we are telling stories about different parts of our history but we do not tell the story of our own independence.  This is a period for which I have a great gr&aacute; myself and although we are now within the Decade of Commemorations there is no site that tells that story.  We have the GPO and Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin that are specific, but we do not have anywhere that tells the whole story through which we can teach our children.  This is something that they are more aware of now and were not for years, as this was virtually never taught as history in our schools up until recently.  It is of great importance.  As I have said I am from Longford which has very strong links to that whole period of our history, together with Cork and Tipperary.  What are our witnesses' views on this?  This is a project that could be developed somewhere.  Naturally enough, I would be prioritising my own area because of the very strong links that it has.  We need a place to which people who come to Ireland can go and in which they can get the whole story told them.  We are telling other stories in other ventures and projects around the country.</p></speech>

The GPO Witness History Museum and, as the Senator has said, Kilmainham Gaol are two that stand out and are very near here, together with the Michael Collins Centre down in Clonakilty and various other places around the country.  It is important when looking at that story that it is told sensitively.</p><p>We are looking at developing destinations by using stories that are distinctive to an area.  Every parish in every county has great history and great stories from various parts of history.  What we have to see is what is unique to an area as well as being compelling and of interest to visitors.  If we invest in projects that do not meet all of these criteria, we will put taxpayers' money into things that will not necessarily give a return to the local community and economy.  We have to make sure that they are of interest to visitors and distinctive - in other words, they are not the exactly the same as something else down the road.  This is our developmental point of view.  I am sure it is difficult for Mr. Gibbons to market.</p></speech>

From our experience, one of the best ways of bringing stories to life is walking guides.  There is a big interest in local history and everyone's interpretation of independence throughout the 32 counties of the island is very different.  It is something people need to think about at community level as opposed to always the national tourist board doing it.  The walking tours in west Belfast tell a very interesting story of modern history, which is very sensitive and raw at present.  It brings a chapter of history to life.  There is a great deal of capacity in other towns and villages to do this.  From an international perspective, this is sometimes the feedback we get with regard to investing, as opposed to an interpretive panel.  Museums are great and what has been brought to life through the 1916 journey has been very good.  It has great resonance.  EPIC tells the story of the diaspora.  Some really good products have come on the scene.  Do not discount the local walking guides to bring the story of the locality to life.  Sometimes they are the best people to do it.</p></speech>

We will have an update on it at some stage during next year.  In the context of a timeframe for its completion, until we get the full scope of what is required from a developmental point of view, I could not say.  No doubt it will be completed over phases.  There is already a Beara Breifne Way walk.  There are sections of it that need to be upgraded.  There are sections that are on the road that we need to take off the road to improve the visitor experience.  The walk is already there and people can do it today.  It is not uniformly up to a standard that we would say is good enough for us, with confidence, to ask Mr. Gibbons and his team to promote.  The international visitor expectation would be higher.  We need to get it up to that standard, which is what the master plan is about.  We will have more on this.  I will find out a bit more detail on the timetable and send it on to the Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Michael Lowry and I welcome his substitute, Deputy Verona Murphy.</p> <p>  Today's meeting will involve two sessions.  The purpose of the first session is to engage with Ms Liz O&rsquo;Donnell, Chair Designate of the Road Safety Authority, and Mr. Jerry Grant, Chair Designate of Dublin Port, to discuss the strategic priorities for their roles and hear their views on the challenges currently facing the organisations.  On behalf of the committee I welcome them both.  Accompanying Ms O'Donnell is Mr. Declan Naughton, and attending virtually is Mr. Brian Farrell and Mr. Sam Waide from the RSA.  All are welcome.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise to engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative to comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  In terms of housekeeping, participants will be aware that under Covid rules we are limited to two hours, so we have had to split the session, and this session is 30 minutes.  The witnesses have made statements that all members have received.  I ask that the witnesses confine their contributions to a summary of their statements that lasts four minutes to allow us time for questions.</p> <p>  I call Ms O'Donnell to make her opening statement.  The time is restrictive and we have her written statement, so I ask her for a summary that lasts four minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.813" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#A00300"><p>I am very happy to continue to serve in this capacity as Chair of the Road Safety Authority.  It has been an honour to contribute to the organisation and ambition of the Road Safety Authority for the past five years.</p> <p>  I would like briefly to put on the record a recognition of the work that Gay Byrne, my predecessor as Chair, put into the Road Safety Authority.  He was the first Chair and served two terms.  Because he was such a fabulous broadcaster in every way, an interviewer of people and a chat show host, it would be a shame if his contribution to road safety was a footnote in his career.  He made a very big difference to public awareness.</p> <p>  The aim of the RSA is quite simple.  It is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce the number and severity of road injuries.  To achieve success in delivering this is quite complex.  Although the RSA is the lead agency in co-ordinating the Government's road safety strategy, we depend absolutely on collaborations with stakeholders and partners such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  Since the Government&rsquo;s first Road Safety Strategy 1998&ndash;2002, the number of deaths on Irish roads has fallen from 458 in 1998, which is an extraordinary number, to 140 in 2019.  Ireland's safest year on record was in 2018 with 139 deaths reported.  None of the success could have been possible without all the stakeholders.  It is the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy and many people have contributed to its success by working in a co-ordinated way.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, this year we have seen an increase in fatalities, with 11 more people dying on our roads this year compared with last year.  This is a concern and emphasises the need to continue focusing on educational and enforcement measures to tackle the main causes of collisions.  A breakdown of road deaths is included in the appendix accompanying my statement.  Having said that, Ireland is now a world leader in road safety, which is to the credit of the Irish people and the efforts made by successive governments.  Ireland is now ranked the second safest European Union member state in 2019 after Sweden and the fourth safest country in the world.  At an EU level Ireland is contributing to helping less progressive nations in Europe to improve their road safety performance.</p> <p>  The current road safety strategy started in 2013 and concludes at the end of this year.  Between 2013 and 2019 fatalities have reduced by 26% in Ireland while EU 27 rates have reduced by only 6%, so we are doing well.  The new road safety legislation has had a positive impact on behaviour.  For example, there were new laws for learner drivers, safe overtaking of cyclists, the introduction of screening for drug-driving at the roadside, tougher penalties for drink driving, and an increase in penalty points for speeding and for seat belt and mobile phone offences.</p> <p>  The introduction of the Garda mobility enforcement app has made a big difference to the capacity of the Garda for enforcement.  The graduated driver licensing system saw the introduction of the novice grade for newly qualified drivers and a lower penalty points threshold for both novice and learner drivers.</p><p> As for the new Government road safety strategy, we are now entering into the next ten years.  It is a very exciting time for the Road Safety Authority, and we look forward to the next ten years.  We are putting in place new measures and engaging with all our partners.  More than 2,000 members of the public have made submissions to the Road Safety Authority for the next strategy.  That is very encouraging.</p><p> The vision zero approach is the way forward at European level, and we hope to play our part in that.</p><p> I am trying to summarise as much as I can.  The next road safety strategy is an opportunity to improve and broaden the base of our studies, research and data collection and to look more seriously at the number and gravity of serious injuries on the road.  Our remit in the legislation is to reduce the severity of fatalities and serious injuries, so that will be a main focus.  At a practical level we are engaging with our key partners, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Justice and local authorities.  All these bodies will be extremely important in improving road safety in the next ten years.</p><p> Like other organisations, the RSA has been materially impacted throughout 2020, both financially and operationally, by the Covid-19 health emergency.  We have put measures in place that allow for the operation of our services in a safe manner, adhering to public health guidelines.  Doing so has, of course, reduced capacity.  However, protecting RSA customers and staff is our primary goal.  While we have resumed most of our public services and continued to operate most services through the current level 5 lockdown, they have, as I said, been operating at reduced capacity.  I am very aware that the issue of most concern and frustration for our customers and for this committee, I am sure, is the delay in driving tests arising from Covid-19.  The RSA has taken steps to increase our capacity and we have made a formal submission to the Department of Transport seeking sanction for the recruitment of additional driver testers.  In October we made a submission for the recruitment of 80 extra driver testers, and I am hopeful that that will be approved soon.  The RSA has continually engaged with the Department of Transport on its financial position because, unfortunately, Covid-19, the suspension of our services and the loss of revenues have really affected our finances.  We are hoping to continue this engagement with the Department.</p><p> If the committee ratifies my nomination today, I will continue in my role as chairperson working with my fellow board members and the staff of the RSA and other agencies to prevent further needless loss of life and injury from road trauma.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.815" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#B00200"><p>I am delighted to be here.  I look forward, with the committee's approval, to taking up the appointment of chair of Dublin Port Company at a very exciting time in the development of the board.  The committee will be aware of my background.  I have a lot of experience in major infrastructure planning and development and considerable executive experience in both the public and private sectors.  I consider that I am in a good position to be able to help the board and the executive in delivering on the major challenges they face over the coming years.</p> <p>  My predecessor, Lucy McCaffrey, has left a very powerful legacy in Dublin Port, principally in ensuring a strong commercial entity that is profitable and efficient.  There have been huge efficiency improvements over the past seven or eight years.  I refer in particular to the 2040 master plan for the port which, with the funding we hope to have available, will be able to self-generate and deliver a doubling of capacity in Dublin Port over the next 20 years to potentially up to 77 million metric tonnes per annum by 2040.  That figure is currently approximately 38 million metric tonnes.  That is purely a reflection of the growth pattern that has existed for almost 50 years in Dublin Port.  It has been consistent year on year at between 3% and 4% per annum, occasionally reflecting economic declines in downturns.</p> <p>  The efficient, effective performance of Dublin Port is vital to the economy of the country.  As the committee will probably be aware, the port handles approximately 84% of the unitised trade in goods, or up to 1.5 million units, per annum.  One third of the national energy requirement is catered for by the petroleum imports through Dublin Port.  Very significant quantities of ore from Tara mines are exported through the port.  The port welcomes approximately 2 million passengers in a normal year.  In the context of all that, we welcome and continue to be very supportive of national ports policy on diversification and the opportunities for growth in throughput in other ports, notably in Rosslare because that takes some pressure off Dublin Port.  The more successful that diversification is, the longer the capacity of Dublin Port will be available and the more we can be somewhat slower, perhaps, in rolling out the investment.</p> <p>  The scale of investment that is required over the next ten years is up to &euro;1 billion, and that can all be delivered for a number of reasons.  First, the port has been very successful in obtaining planning approval for huge parts of its master plan.  It is not just a plan on a shelf; we now have two major strategic infrastructure development approvals that between them cover the entire long-term development of the northern port.  Work is now commencing on preparing the ground for the next major strategic infrastructure application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which will be for the south port and Poolbeg, where there are a lot of interfaces with Dublin City Council and TII.  There is the new access road, for example, to service the south port and link it back to the north port.  All that work will form part of the application.  There has been a huge amount of consultation.  Furthermore, the master plan that Ms McCaffrey and her board oversaw incorporates very strong features linking the city back into the port, or the port back into the city.  In some ways over the past 30 years, that link has been broken.  That access through and connectivity between what is a port city is really important.  A lot of work has been done on the reinstatement of the old archaeology of the port and on pedestrian and cycle routes now being developed to link the Tolka and the Liffey rivers.  It is not just about the port; it is also about how the port and the city work together.  I am delighted to say there is an excellent relationship between the city council and the port, which was not always the case.</p> <p>  In 1999, the throughput achieved was 38 million tonnes.  Nine years earlier, it was 27 million or 28 million tonnes, so one can see the scale of growth that has been happening.  The port achieved turnover of &euro;93 million and &euro;39 million profit after tax.  That profit is what will drive the investment potential over the coming period.  The port currently has debt of approximately &euro;199 million and a further &euro;250 million available and drawn down for investment in order to deliver the immediate projects it will undertake in the coming years.  It is a very exciting time.</p> <p>  Covid has hit the port.  In the middle of the year, we were looking at a decline in activity of approximately 20% but, thankfully, the final figure will be nothing like that and is looking like a 6% reduction.  Whereas foot passengers are down by 80%, lo-lo and ro-ro traffic is almost back up to last year's levels, so there has been a very significant recovery.  Again, this is a reflection of how the economy has stayed strong and developed.</p> <p>  The big challenge in the immediate term is Brexit.  I know that the committee will talk to the chief executives in a little while so I will not go into this in detail, other than to say &euro;30 million has been invested in Brexit-related infrastructure between the buildings and the facilities in the port and the rearrangement of traffic routes through the port.  All that work is on schedule and is being delivered.  The relationship and the co-operation between the State agencies, notably the OPW, the Department of Transport, TII and the port company, has been second to none.  There is a significant challenge now to get the operation of all that functioning effectively.  I know that Eamonn O'Reilly will talk about that when he comes before the committee shortly.  As I said, we welcome the new link between Rosslare and Dunkirk.  Anything that takes pressure off the land bridge is very welcome because that is a significant concern.  We are not in any way complacent about the circumstances on 1 January, but at least I can say with hand on heart that the port company has left no stone unturned in putting the facilities in place.</p> <p>  I am happy to take questions and leave the statement at that.</p></speech>

I speak for myself but I am sure they will get unanimous ratification.  We would be delighted to see them take on these new roles.</p><p>I will home in on one or two small issues.  I am delighted to hear that Ms O'Donnell is pushing for the appointment of 80 new driving testers because there is a very significant backlog.  Families are taking risks getting to and from work when their 20-something-year-old children are driving without a licence.  It is a fact.  It is what is happening in rural Ireland because of a lack of connectivity.  It is certainly a positive thing to hear that tests will be advanced.</p><p> The only other brief point I would like to make is that I would love it if, during her tenure, Ms O'Donnell would champion schools.  Throughout my primary school years, with the exception of those mornings when it was horrible and raining, I always walked or cycled to school and back.  It was fresh and healthy and one would arrive at school in better form.  Most of our schools are now not safe to walk or cycle to.  There is no place for children to leave their bikes when they get there.  I would love to see the Road Safety Authority, RSA, engage proactively with this committee, with the Department of Transport and with the Department of Education to ensure that a day will come when children can get to school in a healthy and safe way.  Will Ms O'Donnell share any thoughts she has in that regard?</p></speech>

They are, unfortunately, inevitable.  It is a legacy issue arising from the suspension of all of our services during the first lockdown.  Since July, we have managed to increase our capacity to deal with the backlog.  There are currently 64,500 people either scheduled or eligible to take a driving test.  Before Covid, our waiting time was a very healthy six weeks but it is now in the region of 25 to 30 weeks.  This is of concern.  We are trying to eat into the backlog.  Since July, we have managed to carry out approximately 30,000 tests at an average rate of 3,500 tests per week.  We have a shortage of driver testers.  We have applied to the Minister for Transport and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for authority to hire 80 more testers.  The Department has been helpful in that it allowed us to again recruit or rehire 18 driver testers whose contracts had finished and 16 others whose terms were due to expire.  It is basically a capacity problem.  We are doing our best and carrying out an average of 3,500 tests per week.  We have carried out 30,000.  The capacity plan has been submitted to the Department and I hope it will respond very quickly because we are aware of the inconvenience to members of the public.</p></speech>

I compliment Ms O'Donnell on the work she has done.  She is coming back to us with a proven track record, which is exceptional.  She has laid out very clearly the efforts she has made in advancing the strategy that was drafted.  The results of those efforts speak volumes.  I hope she continues with the good work and I wish her well.  We are also very pleased that she addressed the issue of the backlog, which is not of her making but rather has arisen as a result of the pandemic.  It is a significant problem.  I will put on record that the RSA has been engaging with people who can produce documentation to show that they need a driver test as they are essential workers.  That has worked very well.  My constituency office has dealt with many such cases and I compliment the staff in the RSA on the responses we have been getting.  They really have been working with people to address their needs and concerns, which is very welcome.</p> <p>  I also wish Mr. Grant well.  He has a significant track record in many other areas and we have seen him before committees in the past.  He has an enormous task before him in dealing with the implications of Brexit for Dublin Port.  I wish him well and I look forward to having him before the committee when he has got his feet wet in the post, both metaphorically and literally.  We look forward to that engagement.</p></speech>

I have some questions for Ms O'Donnell.  I welcome the push to recruit 80 additional driving testers but is it not the case that we have fewer driving testers employed today than we had on 31 December last year?  The figures I have show that we had 145 testers at this time last year and that we now have 139.  I heard the Minister of State say that 18 were to be rehired and 18 were to be kept on.  How quickly can we expect to see this additional 80?  What is the hold-up?</p> <p>  With regard to driving instructors, there is currently a lock-out whereby driving instructors are being refused access to testing centres.  I have raised this issue with the junior Minister.  A driving instructor posted a video which showed that she had to stand outside in horizontal rain.  The only response she got from the RSA was to say that she should not take a video in the vicinity of a testing centre.  It is my understanding that a review is under way.  When will that be concluded?  Will Ms O'Donnell give a commitment that it will be expedited and completed as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

We are hoping to reduce waiting times to an average of ten weeks but it will take time.  It is a capacity problem.  The Department has responded well to our requests for support so far.  We submitted that plan in October so we hope to have the resources necessary to eat into that backlog.</p> <p>  With regard to the approved driving instructor, ADI, situation, I am aware that driving instructors have complained that they are not allowed into test centres.  This is, unfortunately, essential.  Nobody is allowed into the driving test centres with the exception of those taking tests and driver testers.  This measure is required to comply with Covid rules.  Mammies and daddies are not allowed into the test centres either.  It is not as if we are focusing on refusing entry to ADIs.</p></speech>

The issue in respect of instructors is significant and needs to be resolved.  With regard to the capacity issues, the committee might look at writing to the Minister.  This issue needs to be expedited.  I accept that the RSA is trying to move it on as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The main focus of the RSA is, obviously, on reducing the number of fatalities and the severity of injuries.  Ms O'Donnell has already talked about legislative changes, penalty points and so on.  Does she see any other useful actions that Government could take in the future?</p> <p>  My other question relates to Dublin Port.  I welcome what has been said in respect of Brexit.

Does it require anything else from Government to deal with the situation as regards Brexit?</p></speech>

We are also concerned as to whether everyone involved in the supply chain is aware of what is needed so that people turning up at customs will have the right paperwork.  It is a matter of how all of that will perform from 1 January.  One of the things that is required in the coming weeks is a significant information exercise.  I believe the CEO will deal with that in detail during his contribution.</p></speech>

That has happened very quickly because of the pandemic but we can build on that.  Irish people will not go back to the old days of the car having the priority on the roads.  Many children and other people are cycling to school and work, as well as recreationally, and this will continue.  The new strategy must embrace the fact that people want to live in sustainable communities and societies while sharing the road safely.  I look forward to that.</p></speech>

I ask about waiting times for driving tests, particularly around Cork.  There was a list of 5,936 in October for the three Cork test centres so could that be addressed by the Road Safety Authority?  It is important.</p> <p>  The RSA's advertising campaign was brilliant and it resonated with people.  There are three elements involved with this, including education, enforcement and engineering.  There is a deficit in engineering and that involves the councils and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  I hope the RSA can address that.  I have a "hobby horse" issue in the way the speed vans and Garda checkpoints are located on motorways in particular.  I hope they are not a money-making exercise.  I am 100% supportive of the need for enforcement and the reduction of fatalities, and I commend the RSA on its work in this regard.</p> <p>  I thank Ms O'Donnell, who is underselling herself.  She followed the late Mr. Gay Byrne in the role but she is doing so with distinction.  She is creating her own niche and I hope she continues to do so.  I met Mr. Grant before when he worked in a previous role.  I hope this work will not be as stressful.  He comes with a great track record and I wish him well.</p></speech>

We will deal with the port's chief executive in the next session but the lack of a vehicle booking system in Dublin Port is a major issue with hauliers.  Is it a matter of which Mr. Grant is aware and will a system be put in place?  I hope the answer is "yes" to both questions.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donnell indicates an application relating to the capacity plan has been put in with the Department of Transport but when did that happen?  How long will it take?  I ask in order that we can support that application.  Drug testing of drivers is a major issue in Limerick and the local chief superintendent has applied for testing equipment.  It falls under the remit of the RSA so is it supportive of providing such equipment.  More recently, there have been as many drug-driving tests on the roads as there were for drink-driving.  It appears to be going under the radar.  This costs people their jobs and they could have drugs in their system a month after taking them.  I am not certain people are aware of the potential consequences.  Will Mr. Grant answer the question about the vehicle booking system in the port?</p></speech>

With regard to the RSA advertising and educational campaigns, I do not see much attention on parking on footpaths.  It is problematic and it has an impact on wheelchair users, people with buggies or even those who are now walking kids to school using narrow footpaths.  Many motorists may not be aware of the problems they cause when they park on a footpath but it causes considerable road hazard and safety concerns.</p> <p>  As part of the RSA strategy, I ask for an advertising campaign that highlights the difficulties presented by parking on a footpath.  Often a motorist would not see the perspective of a pedestrian and see the problem being caused.  I ask that this concern could be addressed as part of the strategy.</p></speech>

Parking on footpaths is a matter for the Garda to enforce but our focus is primarily on protecting the rights of vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and cyclists.  As I mentioned, the recent Covid-19 restrictions have allowed us to expand the space for pedestrians and cyclists, and this will continue with road engineering.  All over the city we can see that space has been provided for vulnerable road users.  We will not go back from that.</p></speech>

We seem to have learned quite a bit and people have adapted.  There have been improvements in cycling infrastructure that have been rolled out very quickly, which is really positive.  We could highlight to drivers how, when they park on a footpath, other road users are affected.  These include people in wheelchairs and those using buggies.  Some of the footpaths are very narrow in our towns but people think it is right to park on a footpath to leave the road clear.  We need to flip it to show the impact on pedestrians.</p></speech>

I also welcome Mr. Glenn Carr, general manager of Rosslare Europort, Mr. Barry Kenny, corporate communications manager of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Mr. Pat Keating, chief executive of Shannon Foynes Port Company.  Witnesses representing the Port of Cork are attending virtually.  From this quarter I welcome Mr. Eoin McGettigan, CEO, Mr. Conor Mowlds, chief commercial officer, and Mr. Donal Crowley, company secretary and chief financial officer.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege.  Such witnesses may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that we are limited to an hour and a half.  I ask them to summarise their statements and confine them to four minutes.  I apologise for these limitations, which have been caused by Brexit exigencies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.864" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#E00300"><p>Starting in December 2017, the Dublin Port Company took "Brexit means Brexit" literally and began to prepare for the introduction of border controls in Dublin Port.  The company has spent &euro;30 million on Brexit infrastructure.  On foot of joint efforts with the Office of Public Works, OPW, huge inspection capacity is now available in Dublin Port for the challenge of Brexit.  The Brexit facilities are on eight sites, covering a land area of 14.5 ha.  They include 16,000 sq. m, that is, 170,000 sq. ft., of warehousing and 25 inspection bays.</p> <p>  Dublin Port accounts for 84% of all containers and trailers that carry goods in and out of Irish ports.  In total, 1.5 million units pass through Dublin Port in a year.  Today, 200,000 of these carry goods coming from or going to non-EU destinations such as the Far East and are already subject to border controls.  On 1 January, 200,000 will become 1.1 million.  The extra 900,000 units that will require control are evenly split.  Half will be on the longer ferry route to or from Liverpool and half will be on the shorter ferry route to or from Holyhead.</p> <p>  Liverpool trade is mostly unaccompanied but Holyhead trade is mostly driver-accompanied.  As a result it will be particularly urgent to get the 800 to 1,000 driver-accompanied loads that come off the Holyhead ferries every day through the new border checks.  Border checks will cause delays and the current Holyhead ferry arrival times will increase these delays.  Some eight ferries arrive in pairs from Holyhead in four waves, six hours apart.  There is typically ten minutes between the arrival of one large ferry and that of another.  We would like these eight ferries to arrive at three-hour intervals.  The ferry companies say their schedules are determined by customer requirements.  The timing of ferry arrivals in the morning is the same today as it was in the 1980s, when the British and Irish Steam Packet Company operated from Dublin Port and Sealink operated from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.</p> <p>  The huge Brexit infrastructure is necessary but not, in itself, sufficient.  It needs to be manned and operated by State agencies on a truly 24-7 basis and we have been assured that it will be.  However, more transparency on the capacity of State agencies throughout all 168 hours of the week would be beneficial for all stakeholders.  Supply chain behaviour will have to change after Brexit.  It would be helpful if the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could be persuaded to publish key performance indicators showing inspection activity levels each week.</p> <p>  Dublin Port is already very busy and there is a risk that container terminal traffic, combined with the movement of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, between ferries and border control facilities, could exacerbate delays and lead to congestion.  By mid-December we will have completed major works to increase the capacity of the port's road network.  We will then launch an information campaign targeted at hauliers and cargo owners to explain new traffic management measures that will be in place before year end.  We will take the opportunity to suggest to hauliers and cargo owners that they tell the ferry companies whether or not the current Holyhead arrival times actually meet their requirements.  We will also suggest that the hauliers insist on being given booking times by the port's container terminals so that excessive on-road queuing and wasted HGV driver time can be avoided.</p> <p>  In the worst case there could be congestion in Dublin Port and contingency plans have been prepared.  Most notably, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has developed a procedure to allow HGVs exiting the southbound bore of the Dublin Port Tunnel to be U-turned to the northern bore if the port congests.  In this way, traffic can be kept flowing in the tunnel and on the motorway network until congestion abates in the port.  In addition, sites where HGVs can be directed to park up if required have been identified.  The Department of Transport will make a public announcement on these arrangements shortly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.866" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin McGettigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#F00100"><p>I have been the chief executive of the Port of Cork Company since October.  I am accompanied by Donal Crowley, chief financial officer, and Conor Mowlds, chief commercial officer.</p> <p>  The Port of Cork is the second largest port in the State.  It handles all cargo types and operates facilities in Cork city, Tivoli, Ringaskiddy and Cobh.  The port also includes Whitegate oil refinery and Whiddy oil storage facility.  The Tivoli container terminal has limitations, hence the requirement for us to relocate to Ringaskiddy at a cost of almost &euro;90 million, which will economically benefit customers and Cork city and the region and future-proof Cork as an international gateway.  This commercial development is due to open in 2022.</p> <p>  In the context of Brexit, in 2019 the port bulk trade amounted to 6.7 million tonnes, of which 1 million tonnes, or 15%, was with the UK.  The Port of Cork has nine container ships per week carrying 240,000 20-ft equivalent units per annum.  Approximately 12% of this cargo is with the UK.  In 2019, 111 cruise liners visited the port, of which 75% had touched UK ports as well.  We are working locally and nationally with customs and relevant Departments to ensure we are Brexit-ready.  We have considered the impact of Brexit in various forms on our activities as well as our overall economic concern about the effect it will have.  Our ro-ro services are currently directly linked with the EU and are not impacted by Brexit.  They comprise ro-pax services to Roscoff and con-ro services to Zeebrugge.  We have extended our compounds in Ringaskiddy to cater for these services.  The expansion of direct routes to the Continent would offer a solution to the UK land bridge problem and congestion.  As for container traffic, the Port of Cork has a Revenue-approved customs bond.  Brexit should not impact these traffic lead times as customs clearance of non-EU cargo is done electronically.  In addition, any shift from ro-ro to lo-lo containers would help to alleviate congestion.  The port also has two transatlantic services.  Our liquid bulk customers, which relate mainly to oil, are concerned about the additional administrative burden but do not anticipate any interruption in supply.  Animal feed customers have concerns about crossing the Border into Northern Ireland and increased tariffs.</p> <p>  The port faces significant challenges from the indirect consequence of decreased trade as we look to service the debt we have taken on for the new container terminal.  However, we are well positioned to enhance Ireland's trade connectivity by establishing more direct routes to mainland Europe.  We do not, however, have a border control inspection post, where products of animal or organic origin can be presented for introduction into Europe and undergo the necessary checks.  If we had such a post, the Port of Cork could act as an alternative, contingency and overflow facility should difficulties and congestion arise at other ports.  The commencement of the transatlantic container service also accelerates the need for such a control post.  The cruise trade involving the UK and Ireland common travel area is important, and an efficient mechanism for checking passports should be maintained.  Finally, the completion of the Dunkettle interchange, the M28 Ringaskiddy road and the road from Cobh are critical to connect our port facilities to the rest of Ireland's internal road network.</p></speech>

Brexit has presented and will present many challenges and opportunities for Rosslare Europort, our customers and our stakeholders.  Over the past two and a half years we have worked closely and in alignment with Government agencies, shipping lines, the haulage industry, trade associations and other key interest groups.  At the forefront of all these discussions, working groups and planning processes has been the commitment of all parties involved to deliver the best workable solution that will have the least impact on the customer and the free movement of traffic in and out of Rosslare Europort.  Rosslare Europort is the second busiest roll-on roll-off passenger port in the country and is a key strategic port for the country as we trade through Brexit.  We handle on average approximately 14% of ro-ro traffic in the country, serving key routes into the UK and mainland Europe.  For the sake of time, our services are set out in our written statement.</p> <p>  Increasing the connectivity and frequency of shipping services is the key objective in growing Rosslare Europort and its importance to the country.  In particular, the growing of services to mainland Europe is essential to protect our exporters' and importers' supply lines and avoid the predicted disruptions to the UK land bridge envisaged post Brexit to these essential markets for Ireland.  In 2019 direct ro-ro services from Rosslare to Europe decreased in number to three sailings per week following the decision of Irish Ferries to operate its Cherbourg service via Dublin.  Today I am delighted to tell the committee that from January 2021 there will be 11 direct services from Rosslare to Europe, further increasing to 13 from March, representing a quadrupling of direct services to Europe from Rosslare in the past 18 months.</p> <p>  Despite the very positive increase in direct services to Europe from Rosslare, trade will continue with the UK, and it is equally important we ensure the smooth transition on our services to and from the UK in the new post-Brexit environment.  Extensive planning and works have gone into Rosslare Europort, and I thank the Ministers and the Secretaries General and their teams from the Department of Transport, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Office of Public Works for their enormous support and guidance in our preparation.  Significant investment in both infrastructure and resources has gone into Rosslare Europort from all Government agencies and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as port authority, and I am confident that Rosslare Europort is well prepared for Brexit.  Recent consultations between port management, Government agencies, shipping lines and the haulage sector have highlighted the general view that Rosslare Europort is well positioned to handle events post 1 January 2021.</p> <p>  The temporary border inspection post facility, which will be the designated area in which to carry out the required checks post Brexit, is fully completed and operational, and all State agencies are amalgamated on the one site.  Rosslare Europort is in a unique position in that the border inspection post is located approximately 1 km away from berths.  This will ensure that freight and passenger traffic will continue to move freely to and from ships and the port post January, as it does today.  While no doubt some congestion may occur during the initial stages of Brexit, no major congestion is envisaged.  Consultation has also taken place with Wexford County Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with an agreed traffic management plan in place for both the port and the surrounding area.  Furthermore, extensive signage at key locations has been identified both inside and outside of the port to ensure that the routing of traffic is clearly visible and understood to direct movements to the appropriate areas and avoid unnecessary congestion or confusion.  State agencies have also engaged extensively with shipping lines and the haulage sector on the requirements post Brexit and the required paperwork and notifications that will be in place.  Recognition should also be given to the shipping lines and industry associations such as the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, FTAI, the Irish Exporters Association, IEA, and many others for their commitment and partnership approach in proactively engaging with customers, State agencies and Rosslare Europort.  This has been a great all-round team effort, and I am very grateful to all who have been involved over the past 24 months in preparing Rosslare Europort.</p> <p>  Finally, while Brexit has presented and will present real challenges to the country, it has also highlighted the strategic importance of a regional port such as Rosslare and the key role it can play in supporting our economy.  Rosslare Europort is now less than 90 minutes from the M50, and continued investment in road infrastructure is essential in order that the port has the required connectivity to all key industrial hubs in the country.  Rosslare Europort can also help to alleviate the congestion that other ports such as Dublin experience.  In doing so, it can provide real alternative options for the vital supply chains of Irish industry.  This was most evident last week with the announcement by the DFDS shipping line of a new six-times-weekly direct service between Rosslare Europort and Dunkirk.  The new service, which begins on 2 January 2021, will give Irish industry a vital post-Brexit connection, with congestion-free access to Rosslare Europort and land bridge-free access to the Continent of Europe.  Added to our existing services, it will cement Rosslare's status as Ireland's gateway to Europe.  I thank the Chairman and committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.868" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to present to discuss the challenges facing ports in the context of Brexit.  Shannon Foynes Port Company is Ireland's largest bulk port company and has statutory jurisdiction on the lower Shannon Estuary, covering 500 sq. km.  With channel depths of up to 32 m, the port handles the largest vessels entering Irish waters and has capacity to handle over 11 million tonnes per annum.</p><p>Its activities have a trade value of &euro;8.5 billion per annum, supporting 3,900 full-time jobs.</p><p> Shannon Foynes has 1,200 ha zoned for maritime development, making it ideally suited for future national port infrastructure of scale for this country.  In order to fully realise these comparative advantages, expansion and development of the port is led by its 30-year master plan, Vision 2041.</p><p> As SFPC is currently a bulk port, its operations are less likely to be materially affected by Brexit.  Brexit operational implications consist of increased customs and increased agricultural checks on primarily roll on-roll off, RoRo, and lift on-lift off, LoLo, traffic to and from UK or using the UK as a land bridge to and from Europe.  However, a no-deal Brexit will affect underlying sectors and accordingly, SFPC faces significant risk from a revenue perspective if these sectors are negatively impacted.  In relation to our customer base, the agricultural sector appears most exposed.  This could then have consequential knock on effects on feed and fertiliser imports.  Other cargoes may also be impacted.</p><p> While unitised transport has rightly being receiving much of the attention regarding Brexit and ports, SFPC is also a substantial energy port.  Brexit is likely to have implications for the energy sector as the UK will be deemed a third country under new trade rules applicable from 1 January.  Accordingly, Brexit planning at SFPC is focused on business development as well as ensuring we have sufficient port capacity and hinterland connectivity in place.</p><p> Some of the key targeted growth areas include organic growth, that is, increasing trade form existing customer base across all underlying sectors; establishing the Shannon Estuary as an offshore renewable energy, ORE, hub for floating offshore wind energy; establishing a Foynes logistics hub and global transhipment facility for intermodal-unitised cargoes; facilitating alternative fuel transhipment and-or production, such as hydrogen, ammonia, LNG, on the Shannon Estuary; and implementing the Limerick docklands strategy.  For example, the establishment of an offshore renewable energy hub on the Shannon Estuary could generate thousands of jobs in the regional and national economy.  A recent Danish study concluded that for every 1 GW of offshore energy generated supported 14,600 full-time jobs in Denmark's wind sector.  Shannon Foynes is the closest deep water port to this resource and is ideally suited to locate the associated energy supply chain.</p><p> Land availability has arisen as a critical issue around Brexit planning.  In this regard, Shannon Foynes Port Company is well resourced, with more than 1,200 ha zoned and 160 ha available at Foynes.  Accordingly, and together with the completion of the Limerick to Foynes road, Foynes Port can offer choice and contingency to the market in the short to medium term.</p><p> Consistent with our master plan Vision 2041 and the national planning framework, the next phases of our investment programme, costing around &euro;26 million, are planned to commence in the first quarter of 2021.  In addition, preliminaries have also commenced for a new 700 m deep water jetty at Foynes.  Lead times for port infrastructure of this nature is seven to ten years.  Other matters such as the national marine planning framework and the new foreshore Bill are outstanding.</p><p> While Brexit will undoubtedly bring its challenges, it is not our greatest impediment from an ongoing operational or growth perspective.  Insufficient hinterland connectivity remains a primary obstacle.  Without it the port cannot fully integrate into the supply chain and its potential to establish an offshore renewable energy hub will be undermined.  Both the completion of the Limerick to Foynes road and the reinstatement of the Limerick to Foynes rail line are critically important if the substantial port assets of the Shannon Estuary are to be fully optimised.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Keating provide an update on progress on the potential to develop an offshore renewable energy hub?  That ties into the work proposed for a Shannon Estuary task force.  Will Mr. Keating bring us through that and the opportunity to develop a Foynes logistical hub and global transhipment facility along the estuary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.872" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#G00400"><p>On offshore renewable energy, depending on who one talks to the resources out there are 30 GW to 70 GW per annum.  For context, the Irish grid is approximately 7,500 GW, so it has a scale by ten of the Irish local grid demand.  The current climate action plan is for 70% renewable electricity supply by 2030.  That misses the opportunity because the other 90% of availability of potential power on the Atlantic needs to find a market.  It will not be potentially the Irish market; it will need to be exported.  That can be done in two ways, either by using the power to create hydrogen or ammonia which can be used as a liquid fuel for heavy transport and can be shipped around the world or used on the domestic market or one can build a new super-grid.  We have been very active with the industry and the industry has come to us, which is good, with major wind developers looking at the potential to develop the offshore renewable energy in the Shannon Estuary.  It is about bringing the supply chain to the resource.  Regarding energy, that 70 GW is one part of it that is up for harnessing.  It is 30 GW for the Government's programme.  That is technology that will increase over time.  That is the power aspect but the underlying supply chain is where the real added value exists for the country.  The Danish report showed that was where the 14,600 jobs were coming from, not the actual energy generation.  It was the supply chain.  Facilities are required to manufacture potentially turbines, floating devices for platforms, plus the anchorage systems and all the underlying components.  There is a raft of a very diverse engineering type of supply chain required and it is needed near the deep water port to access the energy itself in order to keep operational costs down.  For example, for wind, the levelised cost of energy, LCOE, which is the key performance indicator that measures the cost of energy across difference sources, is due to reduce to a similar level as thermal gas generation by late next decade.  Everyone in the industry and commentators say the efficiency of off-shore wind will be comparable to the best we have today in thermal gas generation.  This is a massive opportunity for Ireland to realise that potential but we have to act fast.  We are competing against France, Spain, Norway and Denmark, countries which already have established supply chains in this area.  We would like policy recognition from the Government that there is a huge opportunity here.</p> <p>  The next question is how we realise that and what we need to put in place.  As I noted in my opening statement, low hanging fruit include the marine spatial plan due next year and an update of the foreshore Bill.  They are critically important.</p></speech>

That relates to the 12,000 ha of zonings.  This is so big that it will potentially have to be done on several sites, the SPL sites that were zoned on the estuary.  It could include the likes of Foynes, Monneypoint, Ballylongford, Cahericon in Clare.  All the sites that have zoning are made for this.  The potential and scope is huge but as a country we need to get ahead, because we are behind.  We do not really have a national policy for floating offshore.  We have the objective of getting 70% of electricity from renewables by 2030 but that is only for our own local grid, not for the big resource of 70 GW.  Our own local grid is only 6,500 GW or 7,500 GW.  That needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  On the Foynes logistics hub, currently Foynes port is relatively isolated.</p><p>We do not have adequate hinterland connections.  The first piece of this is to get that port and the port assets into the system, so we need to connect it.  Hence the road.  The Limerick to Foynes road is critical-----</p></speech>

There is much good work going on in the Shannon Foynes Port Company, with &euro;8.5 billion generated through its activities, supporting 3,900 jobs.  Going forward, there is huge potential on the Clare side of the estuary.  That has been identified in the strategic framework.  As we know, Moneypoint will be moving out of fossil fuels by 2025 and its future beyond that is not fully known.  However, it is widely expected that it will relate to offshore renewables, particularly wind energy.  Moneypoint has an awful lot to offer the region and the whole west.  It has 400 kV power lines that were installed in the 1980s, the likes of which we have not seen installed elsewhere in Ireland in recent decades.  The jetty at Moneypoint is also 380 m long.  I am sure it is the envy of the people in Foynes.  It will not have the same level of usage when we move away from coal shipments coming in to west Clare.  There is a huge opportunity to have a longer jetty there in the deepest channel of water in the Shannon, which can accommodate vessels up to 290 m in length.  It is colossal.  Its potential is huge.</p> <p>  How does Mr. Keating envisage Clare looping in to all Shannon Foynes's plans going forward?  I also ask him to comment on the cross-Shannon cable.  This is the large, heavy volume electricity cable that will go below the estuary from Moneypoint to Kilpaddoge in north Kerry.  Has Mr. Keating any inputs there in terms of generating the renewable economy along the estuary?</p></speech>

Our harbour bounds Clare, Kerry and Limerick county councils.  We were a major contributor to the integrated framework plan, and the new sites or strategic development locations, SDLs, that have been zoned were done with our involvement.  We look at the estuary in its entirety.  We do not look at it on a county-by-county basis because the port authority encompasses the Shannon Estuary.  There are huge advantages for the site in Moneypoint and the deepwater port there.  It is the only port in the country that can take in capesize vessels, which are 300 m long.  The energy White Paper for 2025 is fast approaching.  The jetty is owned by the ESB and we talk to it regularly.  From those discussions, there is a consensus that floating offshore renewables will be a prime target for that jetty.</p> <p>  One other huge advantage the Shannon Estuary has with regard to attracting floating offshore energy is that there is already 1.6 GW of fossil fuel power generation on the estuary between the ESB and SSE.  Those two utilities are very significant players in their own right and it is common knowledge that the ESB and Equinor are in a tie-up as well.  What we have at the moment is 1.6 GW, which can act as a catalyst for offshore renewable energy, ORE.  That grid connection is potentially there.</p></speech>

What I am hearing is that Moneypoint in Clare can take the longest vessels in Ireland.  Our airports can also take the largest aircraft.  The transport commission notes that there is huge potential for Clare and the mid-west going forward with air and seafaring vessels being able to come in.</p> <p>  My last point impacts on all the witnesses.  The minute they step their toes into the water beyond their ports, they must deal with foreshore licences.  It concerns me hugely that the Foreshore Act dates back to 1933, with very little overhauling.  Is that inhibiting what the witnesses are doing at the moment?</p></speech>

We have made a new foreshore application on a Foynes jetty that is almost three years in the running.  Currently, foreshore applications can only be made after we get planning permission, so with the two systems added together, it takes nearly five years just to get the consents for marine infrastructure.</p></speech>

It is unforgivable that projects such as this one could be delayed by five years.  County Clare has lost out on key projects like those at Cahiracon and Kildysart, and this is multiplied many times over in Foynes.  I am sure we will hear the same from Rosslare and Dublin ports.  It  is unforgivable that key legislation underpinning our foreshore has not been overhauled in 87 years.  This committee needs to demand action on that.</p></speech>

I wish them all well in their endeavours.  I am sure they are in competition with each other, but from our perspective we would all like to see some degree of co-ordination and a successful outcome for the State and the country as a whole.  I will direct my questions to Mr. O'Reilly.  He has outlined the scale of the challenge.  It seems quite a spectacular one in terms of the level of transformative change needed at the port.  He says he would prefer staggered arrival times rather that the ships coming in on top of each other.  At the other end we hear from hauliers and shipping companies criticising the current traffic management systems.  There are issues relating to the vehicle booking system and the IT systems for pre-clearance, which are not actually in existence at some of the ferry companies.</p> <p>  My question relates to modelling and what we can expect to see on 1 January.  This idea of potential traffic chaos, of lorries doing a loop around the M50 and the port tunnel, will worry a lot of people.  What modelling has Dublin Port done and what is the expectation there?  As regards what it is asking of the Government and this committee, what does it need us to hear to support it in its role in preparation for Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.887" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#H01300"><p>As to what we expect, before coming here one does lot of thinking about what to say to a committee like this.  Inevitably, one tends to focus on the challenges that are coming.  Maybe what I should say is that I think Dublin Port is remarkably well-prepared for Brexit, given the scale of the challenge.  The sheer physical infrastructure the OPW has put in and the amount of work done by customs and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is enormous.</p> <p>  Reflecting on the comments I made, I was more worrying about the efficiency of what will happen rather than its effectiveness.  The focus on efficiency comes from the sheer busyness of Dublin Port.  It is an unbelievably busy port.  It is two and a half times busier than the port of Rotterdam, based on the number of tonnes per hectare per annum.  Likewise, it is also two and a half times busier than the port of Barcelona.  The likes of that U-turning facility I mentioned must be understood in the context of contingency planning.  All the UK is doing, as I see it, is planning for catastrophe with things like Kent passports and such.  There is no doubt that there will be problems in January, but I believe the preparations that have been made will be effective and the types of contingency measures I set out are essential.  Risk management is at the core of the industry.  All of us within the ports are always looking at risk management and identifying contingencies.  It would be bad if I came here today and was not able to answer the question of what happens if things go wrong.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about vehicle booking systems.</p><p>We are developing Dublin Port.  We have a master plan for 2040, though perhaps with the year ahead of us we should aim for 2041.  The plan aims to double the volume of throughput on the same land footprint between now and 2040.  That can only happen with an awful lot of digital technology.  Brexit is accelerating the need for us to digitise Dublin Port.  Very sophisticated systems are used to manage the internal operations of the three container terminals.  We need an overarching system to manage the flow and traffic in and out of those terminals and the roll-on roll-off terminals.  Nearly all of the land movement of goods in and out of the port happens during 60 hours of the week from Monday to Friday.  It is still a very traditional working week.  However, the ships come in and the terminals operate 24 hours a day.  It is absolutely essential to push some of the activities of Dublin Port into the other 108 hours.  That would give us access to the capacity of the Dublin Port tunnel and the national motorway network at times when it is not otherwise busy.  That is the real challenge.  We need digital technologies to do this.  That will be a big focus of our future development. </p><p> In recent years our focus has been on concrete and steel.  That will continue.  In the last three years we have made &euro;216 million worth of capital investment.  Another &euro;83 million of investment is planned for next year.  The scale of investment in infrastructure in Dublin Port is absolutely enormous.  That is necessary but not in itself sufficient.  We also need to drive efficiencies through digital technologies.  As I say, Brexit is really highlighting the need for this.</p></speech>

However, if we are to drive efficiencies, we need to understand the key performance indicators.  When ferries arrive with containers of food products or products of animal or plant origin, they have to go through a particular set of checks.  We must understand the hourly capacity of that system and see how it runs so the hauliers and cargo owners can get a sense of what they need.  That will allow them to have a more informed conversation with the ferry lines.</p></speech>

Dublin Airport has a similar pre-eminence.  We need to get more traffic to the regions through Shannon Foynes Port, the Port of Cork and Rosslare Europort.  My first question is for Mr. Keating.  How would building a rail link and a road from Limerick to Foynes affect the Shannon Foynes Port Company's container capacity?  How much additional traffic could it take?  How much pressure could it take off Dublin Port?</p></speech>

I have some questions for Mr. O'Reilly.  Hauliers have been in contact with me and many other members.  They frequently raise one issue.  There are three competing terminals in Dublin Port.  There is no vehicle booking system.  The Port of Cork has one.  It appears to be a huge source of frustration for the hauliers.  They say that having such a system in place is the responsibility of Dublin Port Company.</p><p>The hauliers also note that two ferries arrive from Holyhead at 5 a.m. each morning, one from Irish Ferries and one from Stena Line.  Both are chock-a-block with trucks.  Mr. O'Reilly noted that ferries currently arrive in pairs, in four waves six hours apart.  What is Dublin Port Company doing to put a vehicle booking system in place?  How would this benefit our ferry connections to Europe?  Mr. O'Reilly's written submission states:</p> <blockquote> 	The huge Brexit infrastructure in place is necessary but not, in itself, sufficient.  It needs to be manned and operated on a truly 24/7 basis by State agencies. </blockquote> <p>That looks like a qualified criticism of the supports offered by the State to ensure the checks can run.  Mr. O'Reilly suggests that hauliers and cargo owners should tell the ferry companies whether the current arrival times actually meet their needs.  They are doing that.  They say this is the responsibility of Dublin Port Company and Mr. O'Reilly as its CEO.  Why is there no vehicle booking system?  When will one be in place?  What has Dublin Port Company done to avoid a situation where two ferries arrive at 5 a.m., chock-a-block?  What is Dublin Port Company doing to develop container traffic through direct ferries to Rotterdam?  That would cut down on our carbon footprint because it would not involve trucks.  I ask Mr. O'Reilly to comment on a vehicle booking system, the arrival times of ferries and the development of a container business.  Many hauliers are saying that the container storage facilities currently in place are wholly inadequate.  They are spread around Dublin and are not located at the port.  They say this is going to cause chaos.</p></speech>

Regarding booking systems and container terminals, there is a big difference between the three container terminals in Dublin Port and the one in the Port of Cork.  The Port of Cork owns all the equipment and operates the terminal.  The three terminals in Dublin are operated by three private sector companies which are competing with each other.  They have systems which are capable of being expanded to incorporate a booking system.  The systems are unbelievably complex because of the amount of data they handle.  A container ship might contain 600 containers.  In the first instance, it is up to the individual terminals to put booking systems in place with the technology available to them, as the Port of Cork has done.</p></speech>

Surely the company can make it a condition of the licences that the terminal companies implement consistent and compatible booking systems.  The hauliers say that at the moment it is like a zoo when the ferries arrive at 5 a.m.  The hauliers come in at different times.  They say that a booking system would make this much more efficient.  This was a concern before the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, but it would make an enormous difference to our response to Brexit.  Will Mr. O'Reilly commit to engaging with the terminal operators and looking at the licensing requirements with a view to putting a streamlined booking system in place?</p></speech>

That is the case.  We are talking about it but, as the committee will appreciate, these discussions are immensely commercially sensitive.  The companies are of the very firm view that the market requires something of them that is different from what the hauliers seek.  One of the very good things about this session this morning is that it allows this issue to be aired.  The airing of this issue-----</p></speech>

I will direct my questions specifically to the CEO of the Shannon Foynes Port Company, Mr. Pat Keating.  I spent 16 years involved with projects on the Shannon Estuary as a director and as a commissioner.  I worked with Mr. Keating and I congratulate him and all of his team at Shannon Foynes Port for the outstanding work they are doing.</p> <p>  I have a couple of brief questions.  Reference has already been made to the changing situation with regard to fossil fuels.  These fuels have played a significant part in the profitability of Shannon Foynes Port as the power station at Tarbert runs on oil and the station at Moneypoint runs on coal, although both of those statements in the future will have to be in the past tense.  With the unfortunate decision in the programme for Government not to support the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminal, which I believe was very short-sighted, is there a threat to the ongoing profitability of Shannon Foynes Port?  It was fairly dependent on fossil fuel business.</p> <p>  With regard to the region, by way of compensation for the loss of the jobs the LNG terminal was expected to create, the programme for Government said that the Government would investigate alternatives, invest and set up task forces to find alternative employment.  Shannon Foynes Port will obviously be central to that.  Mr. Keating has mentioned offshore renewable energy, ORE.  Has the port company been contacted directly by Government with regard to progressing what was promised in the programme for Government?  Are there plans afoot?  Is there anything on which Mr. Keating can advise us in that regard because I raised the issue in the Seanad recently and I am as wise as ever?</p> <p>  On a positive note, because of its position on the map, Shannon Foynes Port may be in a position to benefit from Brexit more so than other ports.  Brexit is obviously a threat but it also creates opportunities.  Is there a case to be made for reopening the question of establishing a trans-shipment port somewhere along the estuary to deal with major imports that could then be redistributed to European ports?  As Mr. Keating will know, we have the deepest natural port in Europe outside of Rotterdam.  There are huge delays and long turnaround times in these European ports.  Surely the Shannon area could take in larger loads before breaking them up and redistributing them to Europe, bypassing the UK.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.928" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Keating" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#K01800"><p>Our underlying business was absolutely very reliant on fossil fuels such as coal for Moneypoint.  Even in the area of home heating oils, petrol and diesel, change is coming.  As a commercial company, it is necessary to deal with change all the time.  Returning to ORE, given our location, we are actually very well placed to capitalise on that potential.  This potential may in fact be much greater than anything that has come before.  Our ambition is to set up what is known as a marshalling port, which is a port that provides for the supply chain needed for the construction phases of floating wind farms.  One then gets into the manufacturing of the floating devices or platforms themselves.  These are primarily made of steel and concrete.  They are basic enough but they are very big, chunky, heavy devices that require a lot of shipping and port infrastructure.</p> <p>  With regard to fossil fuels, there is a dip in current and short-term profitability, but in the long term, we are very well placed to capitalise on the move towards a low-carbon economy.  ORE is one part of that.  It is not just about electricity generation.  Coming from that, there is also the potential to produce hydrogen or ammonia as new liquid fuels.  This fuel will be more geared towards HGVs and buses.  The Senator will have seen Dublin Bus ordering its first hydrogen-powered buses as a pilot scheme recently.  Offshore floating wind energy goes hand in glove with hydrogen and ammonia production.  With regard to the transition away from fossil fuels, in addition to generating energy at an ORE hub, there is the possibility to produce hydrogen.</p></speech>

We almost have to go back to first principles in that regard.  A base must be built up from a port that supplies the domestic market.  There are no facilities entirely dedicated to trans-shipment in the world.  A portion of domestic cargo is required to support it.  We cannot run before we can walk.  Given that we are the closest port to the US market, there is potential for trans-shipment between Europe, Ireland, North America and South America.  As I have said, that is more a matter for the medium term.  We need to get connectivity to the port, which is absolutely critical, sorted before we can move on to such objectives.</p></speech>

It will certainly go a long way towards dealing with the issue of Brexit traffic.  I will address this point to Mr. O'Reilly.  As the Chair mentioned, four ships arrive at Dublin Port within 45 minutes in the morning.  Between 5.30 a.m. and 6.15 a.m., two ships arrive from Liverpool and another two arrive from Holyhead.  When did Mr. O'Reilly last meet the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA?</p></speech>

That was in 2018.  I reviewed the minutes last night.  All of the points Mr. O'Reilly has made in his statement with regard to the shipping companies are points that were raised by the IRHA.  Mr. O'Reilly was asked to request that the container terminal operators vary their opening times.  He was also asked whether the shipping companies could reorganise their sailings.  All of these measures were aimed at preparing for Brexit.</p><p>That was three years ago.  All those points were made then.  What progress was made on those points in those three years?  From Mr. O'Reilly's statement, I assume none has been made.</p></speech>

The issue is we have public infrastructure, namely, Dublin Port, that is congested today and that is expected to be chaotic post Brexit.  Mr. O'Reilly said in his statement that everything operates the same way as it did when the B&amp;I was there.  Is he absolving himself of any responsibility as the chief executive officer, CEO, of Dublin Port in that everything has stayed the same?  Every day we hear from politicians and people like the witnesses that Brexit will change things and that we have to go with the change.  What has changed about any of these things?</p></speech>

It is not commercially sensitive.  This is publicly owned infrastructure that depends on the economy of Ireland surviving in terms of our having free-flowing traffic for exports and imports.  I do not believe it is commercially sensitive.  Taking a public service obligation, PSO, to make those schedules work and to change them around is the type of proactive approach I am looking for.

I am not a haulier but hauliers have phoned me and I have met them.  We have met them repeatedly.  I bow to Deputy Murphy.  She has treaded that board.  Hauliers have phoned me exasperated by the fact ferries are coming in early in the morning all together.  Suddenly there is absolute chaos.  The hauliers are waiting hours.  It does not even fit within schedules.  They have no booking system.  Can Mr. O'Reilly go through in detail what his engagement with the ferries has been?  What are their objections?  What would work?  We cannot have a situation whereby we will put hauliers at risk.  Many of goods they supply, to which Mr. O'Reilly made reference, are agricultural produce and perishable goods.

It is not chaos.  I have had Ministers visit the port, probably half of the Cabinet in the previous Government were down in the port at 5 o&rsquo;clock.  That is the normal time I would invite guests down to have a look.  It is not chaos; it is unbelievably busy.</p></speech>

The chaos is trying to get one&rsquo;s empty container delivered outside the port and trying to get back into the port to get another container on but the container terminal closes and the driver has nowhere to park and there are not toilet facilities.  Further chaos is caused by four ferries disembarking at least 1,000 trucks every morning during the week which means the container terminals opening at the same time in the morning and all the traffic converging on to the M50 at rush hour.  In any case we do not even have a traffic management plan, which I will touch on.  Mr. O'Reilly was asked what engagement he has had with the ferry companies and what result was yielded.</p></speech>

Let me deal with them separately.  The ferries come in of a morning.  There are four ferries, two from Liverpool and two from Holyhead.  The Deputy is correct on that.  The Liverpool ferries are unaccompanied.  They do not generate a lot of traffic-----</p></speech>

It is completely at variance with what has been said to the Chairman, so I am caught between a rock and a hard place.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Reilly is not.  He is the CEO of Dublin Port.  He said he is caught between a rock and a hard place, but what did he do with the information?  Did he wait to come here today, a month out from the end of the transition period, to tell us that the ferry companies will have to engage with the hauliers whom he does not engage with, to get those timetables shifted?

I am going to follow up on some things already put to Mr. O'Reilly.  We are looking at the gauntlet of Brexit.  Deputy O'Rourke also raised issues in respect of the Revenue Commissioners.  At one stage, I thought Mr. O'Reilly may have been seeking a greater level of resources.  He said that the IT systems have been stress-tested in respect of the Revenue and that could be stood over.</p></speech>

I am going back to what was asked of Government.  Hearing that Dublin Port tunnel could be used as a sort of drive around and inefficient parking system frightens all of us.  Does Mr. O'Reilly have any information - and this could also be a matter for Mr. Carr - regarding any changes that might be happening, including relevant numbers, concerning people seeking to move goods directly from Europe or using the land bridge?  We are in a Brexit situation and Michel Barnier has said that it comes down to the next couple of days on whether there is going to be a deal.  None of this is going to be perfect, but it could be much more imperfect.</p></speech>

There is also now a connection from Rosslare Europort to Dunkirk, and we were delighted to see that.  There is a real issue of geography here.  Once the land bridge is lost, it really is difficult for driver company services and Rosslare Port is undoubtedly the best place for this to happen.</p></speech>

In the publicity concerning last week's announcement, and Mr. Carr would know more from Rosslare Europort, some 50,000 to 60,000 trucks might use the Dunkirk service.  There are many variables.  Regarding the direct delivery of goods from Dublin into continental European, there is enormous increased capacity.  It is all unaccompanied trailers or containers, and I have no doubt that if demand goes up, then the ships will follow.  I suspect, however, we will not be seeing many direct driver company services from Dublin.</p></speech>

I will put the same question to Mr. Carr.  A similar question concerns how feasible it will be, then, to stagger times regarding ferries coming in.  Whatever the rights and wrongs may be of what has been done, I accept there are difficulties concerning this issue.  It will involve a conversation with all stakeholders, however, including hauliers and the representatives from the ferry companies, etc..</p></speech>

The whole essence of the service going to Dunkirk is to tap into that market.  On average, each ship would take 130 trucks per sailing, so we are looking at approximately 40,000 trucks coming in and 40,000 going out.  However, one of the positive things regarding DFDS is that company's capability to ramp that service capacity up, if needs be.  In Rosslare Port, we certainly have the capability to do that.  Regarding negotiations with these companies, they want to provide the best possible services to customers to attract business, and there are consultations, therefore, not only in respect of the port but also the market.  The schedule which has been agreed for DFDS services reflects what the market wants and our capability to ensure we can deliver the service to the shipping line, which is equally critically important.  There is no point being in a port just to be held up on the ship for some two hours.</p></speech>

I am sure that the witnesses will be interested and probably aware that the proposed marine planning and development management Bill is progressing.  It will implement a single and more efficient marine planning system, and input from any of the ports would be welcome regarding that process.</p> <p>  Mr. Keating referred to the importance of the reopening of the rail connection between Shannon and Foynes, and the importance of the offshore renewable energy, ORE, industry.  Those are two projects which I firmly support and that are positive for that region.  The loss of liquefied natural gas, LNG, and other fossil fuels will be more than made up for by the renewable energy industry and the potential that sector brings to this country.  There is no future in fossil fuels whatsoever.  On what Mr. Keating spoke about regarding Shannon Foynes Port, therefore, I ask Mr. Carr and Mr. Kenny, possibly, to comment on whether there is scope for rail freight as part of Rosslare Europort.  Is Rosslare Europort in a position to scale up to take advantage of the ORE industry and the 5 GW in the Irish Sea?  I ask that because there is a great deal of land around Rosslare Europort and we have heard much talk about road-based freight, which will always be part of the movement of freight in this country.  There is no doubt about that aspect.  If we are going to reduce transport emissions and issues with air quality, however, we must concentrate a great deal on rail.  Rail transport is the future, and 2021 has been proposed as the year of rail in Europe.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses regarding Rosslare Europort and rail freight.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.1000" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Glenn Carr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020120200002#M01900"><p>I will take those aspects separately, and start with offshore energy.  I look after rail freight as part of my remit.  Today was about Brexit, so I did not submit information regarding offshore renewable energy.  Offshore wind, however, is absolutely our next target in Rosslare Europort.  It is the best geographically positioned port in respect of where the development of offshore wind resources is happening along the south-east coast.  There will be floating offshore wind energy, but that is some way away.  Our initial target with the climate action plan is to put in place the existing planned offshore wind farms.</p> <p>  No port currently has the required facilities for what is expected to be developed.  However, we have engaged extensively with the offshore wind market and with the developers of offshore wind projects, and we are now taking plans to the Government and the Department to develop Rosslare Europort as the offshore wind hub for the country.  I believe strongly that we are the only port which has the potential to be developed.  Investment is needed, but we have the land and road connections.</p> <p>  Turning to offshore wind and rail freight, the offshore wind energy companies want to assemble at the quayside and then go straight back out.  There is positive news regarding rail freight, because we have just commissioned a final report on the development of rail freight.  There are great opportunities for rail freight to be developed here.  It has been underutilised and probably undersupported.  Investment is needed in that area and, again, we are also taking plans on board regarding developing rail freight, part of which would involve connections to ports.  We are already connected to Dublin Port and the Port of Waterford, but we would also like to be connected to the Port of Cork and to Shannon Foynes Port.  </p> <p>  It is more challenging for Rosslare Europort, because there is only a single line running up to Dublin.  In addition, the current Waterford to Rosslare rail line is not in operation.</p><p>From a policy perspective, that would have to be examined.  There is nothing to prevent rail freight being developed into Rosslare, and we will play our part in that, however we have been concentrating on growing our roll-on roll-off business.  We see a great opportunity for the port and region in offshore wind.  That is our focus.   I see rail freight as developing more for other ports, particularly as Waterford is so close to us.  It is lift-on lift-off.  </p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. McGettigan on his appointment as CEO of the Port of Cork and thank him for his very important contribution.  I have two specific questions.  Will he speak about the roll-on roll-off opportunities for Cork in avoiding the land bridge?  His presentation spoke of the border control inspection post.  Will he expand on that in the context of EU-Atlantic connectivity and the relationship between hauliers and container traffic?  I thank him for his work and wish him every success.</p></speech>

We could increase that to 35,000 with our existing facilities.  The border control inspection point is related to that.  If we had one in Cork we could receive goods from outside the EU, which would be the UK then.  That is something that people from Cork would seek from Government.</p> <p>  Our new container terminal can handle 50% more volume than we currently have, which would be about another 100,000 container annually.  Those containers could come directly from the Continent avoiding the land bridge.</p></speech>

Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will make a general introductory statement first in terms of where we are at and the considerations we have.</p> <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to come before the committee to give an update on Brexit developments.  I last updated the Seanad on Brexit developments in September and, of course, we are all aware of the Brexit omnibus Bill which completed Second Stage yesterday ahead of the Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow.  I wish to convey once again my appreciation for the solidarity shown by the Oireachtas throughout the Brexit process.  It has been of critical importance to have that support and unity of purpose as we face the challenges Brexit brings because they are significant.</p> <p>  I will give an update on the three strands of Brexit work ongoing across Government, that is, the EU-UK future partnerships negotiations, the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and readiness for the end of the transition period in less than a month's time.</p> <p>  This week, as members will know, is a crucial one for the EU-UK future partnership negotiations.  Mr. Michel Barnier and his team are in London engaging intensively with the UK side to secure a deal in the short amount of time that remains.  We are in decisive days in this process.  Commission President von der Leyen briefed the European Parliament last week.  She noted that while real progress has been achieved, gaps in the three key issues of level playing field, the governance arrangements to ensure those level playing field agreements can be enforced in the future and fisheries have not been bridged.  Closing these gaps is a prerequisite for a successful conclusion of the negotiations.  I believe that with political goodwill, a deal can be done.  The EU wants a deal but our stance has always been that it cannot be at any price.  Any deal must uphold the integrity of the Single Market and reflect the long-term political and economic interests of the Union.  This is why free and fair competition is at the heart of these negotiations.  It underpins our common current high standards on labour and social rights, the environment, climate change and tax transparency.</p><p> As Senators will be aware, fisheries are an area of the utmost political importance and sensitivity, not only for the UK but for Ireland as well.  It is vital we do everything possible to protect our vulnerable coastal communities and fishers.  In particular it will be important to ensure that no EU member state is disproportionately affected by any new arrangements.</p><p> Throughout this process we have worked closely with the EU task force, Michel Barnier in particular.  From the start Mr. Barnier has been a good friend of Ireland.  He is acutely aware of our concerns and knows that Ireland continues to support fully his work.  The work on implementing the withdrawal agreement is formally separate from the future relationship, and the withdrawal agreement is designed to operate regardless of whether there is a separate trade agreement.  We remain committed to building a positive and fruitful future relationship with the UK, but this can only be on the basis of trust and confidence that the withdrawal agreement is fully implemented.  We have emphasised this in our discussions with our EU counterparts.</p><p> The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is a central component of the withdrawal agreement.  It is devised to protect stability and certainty on the island of Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland and preserves the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland's place in it.  It ensures access for Northern Ireland goods to the Single Market and allows the trade in goods to continue to flow freely on this island.  It is vital that the protocol is now fully and faithfully implemented.  There has been some positive momentum on implementation in recent weeks.  Progress has been made on a number of key issues, including medicines and the operation of the single electricity market in Northern Ireland.  It is vital that this momentum continues, and we expect intensive engagement on the joint committee on implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the specialised committee on implementation of the protocol in the immediate period ahead.  We are acutely conscious of its sensitive nature and critical importance in terms of all the issues connected to it.  I am confident we will be able to find and implement solutions that work for businesses north and south on this island.</p><p> I know that Senators have been following the progress of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill very closely.  I support the Private Members' motion brought before the House on the withdrawal agreement in September.  The EU has made clear that a future relationship agreement is predicated on implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  We expect that the UK Government will take the necessary steps to ensure there is no suggestion of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol, being undermined.  The withdrawal agreement provides structures for handling issues surrounding implementation of the withdrawal agreement and protocol, and these are the only appropriate way to deal with the outstanding questions.</p><p> The third strand of the Government's Brexit work is our preparations for the end of the transition period on 31 December, just 29 days away.  Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, the end of the transition period will bring substantial and lasting change, and action must be taken now to prepare for this.  There will be no extra time or extension of the transition period.  The date 1 January will mark substantial change, and people need to be ready for that.  From 1 January the UK will be outside the Single Market and the customs union.  This means that new controls and procedures must apply to any goods moving to, from or through Great Britain, processes that do not apply to such trade today.  I urge Senators to continue to amplify key readiness messages to stakeholders, particularly businesses large and small.  Time is running out, and it is imperative that they now finalise their preparations for 1 January.</p><p> In September the Government launched its Brexit readiness action plan.  The plan sets out the actions the Government will take and that businesses and citizens must take to address changes arising at the end of the transition period.  Since it was launched, there have been more than 50 separate ministerial engagements dealing with Brexit.  These were supported by a range of official level meetings and briefings.  We are using a multitude of virtual tools, from webinars to instructional videos, to assist businesses to prepare for the new realities they will face.  The T&aacute;naiste has sent a Brexit readiness checklist to 225,000 businesses registered in Ireland.  The Revenue Commissioners, separately, have written to over 90,000 businesses trading with the UK and have followed up with some 14,000 phone calls.  We have made a range of financial upskilling and advisory supports available to businesses.  Budget 2021 allocates &euro;340 million to Brexit-related preparation measures.</p><p> In response to a specific demand from industry, the July stimulus package included a &euro;20 million ready for customs package to assist with hiring and training staff in customs.  As the committee will be aware, businesses that trade to or from the UK will now have to have a customs number.  They will have to understand how the customs system works in terms of declarations, checks and so on, something that most businesses in Ireland had simply no experience or understanding of until Brexit came along.</p><p> Preparations in our ports and airports are well advanced.  In addition to the new infrastructure, we have invested in new staff and ICT systems.  Some 1,500 additional staff will be engaged in supporting and carrying out customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, and food safety checks and controls.</p><p> We are working closely with the European Commission to ensure that the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve targets the sectors and member states most disproportionately impacted by Brexit, and that certainly means Ireland.</p><p> I was here yesterday for the Second Stage debate on the 2020 Brexit omnibus Bill, which is another key part of our national preparations for the end of the transition period.  I am grateful for Members' co-operation in ensuring this essential legislation is in place by the end of the year.</p><p> Just as the future shape of the relationship between the UK and the EU will be decided in the coming months, we must continue to develop Ireland's bilateral engagement with the UK outside of the EU.  We will always be close neighbours, trading partners and co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The context of our relationship has changed but we are committed to building on and strengthening the British-Irish relationship.  Ireland will also continue to work to ensure the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK in the time remaining.  Ireland's place remains at the heart of the European Union, and I will continue to inform the House on the developments in the days and weeks ahead.  I look forward to Senators' questions.</p></speech>

I would like to raise just one issue with the Minister in addition to all the other myriad issues he has addressed and which have been well ventilated at this stage.  Some retailers, particularly those in the west and those around the east coast that are served by Dublin Airport, are concerned that the new threshold included in this Bill for the money back, if one likes, or tax-free nature of shopping through airports is set too high at &euro;75.  I know there was an original proposal to set it much higher, but there is a belief that retailers, particularly those at airports and those that serve the US and Canadian markets, will be disproportionately affected by this measure.  I know there is justification for it in the context of the travel between Ireland and the UK and that there was a necessity to address that, but there is real concern among retail outlets that serve the tourist market, particularly from the United States and Canada.  It must be recognised that many of these retailers have had a very difficult year.  They have had no business because they have had no tourism.  They are looking to next year and looking to try to rebuild their businesses.  There is a view that this threshold will have a negative impact on their sales and will further negatively impact them as they try to recover their business.  While I know it falls outside the diplomatic efforts the Minister is making, he might still wish to comment on behalf of the Government and in particular on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

I do not know how he keeps going.  He is doing a great job on Brexit, and we really appreciate his taking the time to come before us because we know he is very busy.</p><p>I am still a little bit confused about several points and I want to check on them.  The measures set out in the omnibus Bill to protect the common travel area and North-South co-operation are very welcome.  I know there are measures in the Bill to ensure citizens in both jurisdictions enjoy flexibility and eligibility regarding social protection.  This is important given there are 30,000 cross-Border workers at present.  It is crucial that we work together to ensure the British Government introduces and implements a worker scheme that offers full protection to those who live and work on both sides of the Border.  Are there are contingency plans to do so?</p><p> I also want to check on the report published by the Oireachtas committee.  I could be behind on all of this stuff and, if so, I apologise.  I was a member of the committee on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU in 2019 when Professor Colin Harvey from Queen's University highlighted discrepancies on current implementation gaps in the Good Friday Agreement that would be further increased.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, thousands of citizens who do not live far from this committee room could have far fewer rights than all of us sitting here.  That is the concern.  How will we reconcile a no-deal Brexit with the inevitable rights-based issues, such as co-operation on health care, the provisions set out in the Social Welfare Act between the North and South and the protection of employees?  I want to highlight the rights of citizens in the North and policy developments and make sure these rights-based issues are not an afterthought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.1020" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2020120200002#C00200"><p>I will deal first with Senator Dooley's comments on the VAT retail exports scheme.  This is a scheme that allows people to claim their VAT back after they have made a purchase.  It is for people from the US and other third countries outside the EU.  As the UK is now becoming a third country, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of non-EU tourists who come to Ireland.  Tourists from Great Britain will effectively be coming from a third country.  Therefore, the Department of Finance saw the potential for a substantial loss of VAT revenue as a result of this.  Originally, it proposed that we put in place a threshold of &euro;175.  In other words, people would have to spend &euro;175 to be able to claim back the VAT.  Because of concerns raised by a number of political parties, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has reduced the threshold significantly by &euro;100 to &euro;75.  Some retailers are still concerned about this but because of the numbers who might be using the scheme, if people were to be claiming back VAT on relatively small payments of &euro;20 or &euro;30 there would be significant bureaucracy and cost in doing so.  That is why it has set a medium threshold.  It is not over &euro;100, which is what it was.  The figure of &euro;75 was seen as reasonable.</p> <p>  Senators will have an opportunity to question the Minister for Finance on it tomorrow in the Seanad.  He has committed to review it so it could be changed or adjusted if it is not working for retailers or for Revenue.  It could be adjusted in the finance Bill next year.  The Minister has committed to having a review within 12 months.  We will have a budget next September or October and a finance Bill.  There will be an opportunity to adjust it if we do not have the threshold at the right level.  We are very conscious of the fact this is a new approach to the VAT retail exports scheme and there will be an opportunity relatively early on to adjust and change it, if necessary, with the finance Bill next year.</p> <p>  With regard to Senator Black's question on the common travel area, for a number of years, linked to Brexit, we have been speaking to the UK on a bilateral basis about formalising the common travel area.  It goes right back to the 1920s but there was never a bilateral treaty on it.  It was always a loose enough series of arrangements, with some of those arrangements backed up by legislation and other elements not.  With the previous British Government, when Theresa May was Prime Minister, I signed with David Lidington a memorandum of understanding on protecting and maintaining the common travel area through the Brexit process and out the other side, adding more formality to it.  We decided consciously not to put in place a bilateral treaty on the common travel area because if we needed to amend it or change it, it would become much more complicated if a treaty needed to be amended and changed.  We felt we should have the flexibility to be able to adjust and adapt to the new realities of Brexit and redesign elements of the common travel area, if necessary.  Having this flexibility made a lot more sense to both sides.  As long as there is a bit of goodwill on both sides it can be done and is being done.</p> <p>  Essentially it is a recognition of each other's citizenship, although this is not fully true but it explains what we are trying to do, when British people are in Ireland and Irish people are in the UK, in terms of access to education, healthcare, social welfare payments, voting in many elections, being able to carry pension entitlements, recognition of qualifications, obviously the opportunity to work and all of those other privileges that Irish people get in Britain and British people get in Ireland that even go beyond EU membership.  We got an agreement early on with the EU that we would have to protect the common travel area through the Brexit process which, in many ways, meant Irish citizens get a lot more privileges and rights in the UK than other EU citizens.  We were careful in how we managed that messaging so as not to raise hackles in other member states because there are more Polish people in Britain than there are Irish people but the Irish will get special treatment under the common travel area.  Brexit is now exposing this difference in quite a significant way.</p> <p>  It is a really good arrangement for Irish citizens in the UK and UK citizens in Ireland.  It will help to protect many of the practical arrangements we have on the island of Ireland in terms of free movement of people to work, study and access healthcare.  The formal EU directives that have reinforced this in EU law, such as, for example, the cross-border healthcare directive, will no longer apply to Northern Ireland.  We are going to have to put some other arrangements in place to accommodate the practicalities of children coming from Belfast to Dublin for paediatric care, people from Donegal going to Altnagelvin hospital or people from west Cork going to Belfast for cataract operations.  These are things we will have to ensure can continue but we have to do it now in the absence of an EU directive that requires it.  That is easier said than done but we are committed to doing it.</p> <p>  Likewise, we are also ensuring that we try to protect many of the other rights linked to the Good Friday Agreement.  This time last year, I announced that the Irish Government was committed, if necessary, to pay for Northern Ireland students to benefit from Erasmus, or for Northern Ireland citizens to benefit from the equivalent of the European health insurance card, EHIC, which allows EU citizens to travel across the EU and access healthcare.  They will not work in the exact same way as they did previously but we are committed to redesigning a scheme that goes as far as we can to replicate EHIC, which will allow people from Northern Ireland to travel across the EU and if they have health bills because of an accident or because they get sick when abroad, they will be able to recoup the cost of it from the HSE south of the Border when they go back to Northern Ireland.  There is a cost to this that we are willing to pay.  Likewise, the arrangements for Erasmus will probably have to happen through Irish universities south of the Border if there is not an agreement between the EU and UK to facilitate Erasmus.  The Department of Education has been working on this.  There is a hope and expectation that EHIC-type schemes and Erasmus will be facilitated through negotiations between the EU and UK.</p><p>If that negotiation does not result in a positive outcome, we will intervene to offer that to people in Northern Ireland if they want to avail of it.  The Government is willing to commit to the taxpayer paying for that, which, I hope, people will support us on if it comes to that but I do not expect that it will.  I think the British Government will be supportive of those approaches in principle.<br/><br/>I want to reassure the committee that this is not all about economics and trade.  It is also about citizens' rights and protections.  Irish people living in Northern Ireland are European citizens.  They are EU citizens who happen to be living outside the EU but that does not mean they lose their rights as EU citizens when they enter the EU to work, travel and study.  We will try to ensure that those rights and privileges are protected.  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee them that while they are living in Northern Ireland EU law applies because it does not.  Under the protocol, there is an obligation on the British Government to ensure that Northern Ireland mirrors or has equivalence to EU standards in law in many areas.  Under the protocol, Northern Ireland becomes a <i>de facto</i>extension of the EU Single Market for goods.  As a result, there needs to be a commonality of standards and a level playing field to allow an all-island economy to function in that context without any border infrastructure.<br/><br/>This a complex arrangement.  It is, however, the best possible arrangement in view of the circumstances we were landed with in the context of Brexit, trying to protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent border infrastructure re-emerging on the island of Ireland, respecting that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom and, therefore, is leaving the European Union.  We are trying as best we can to manage all of these issues in a way that limits disruption.  It is about no diminution of rights for people in Northern Ireland, which is very much the language of the protocol, and about facilitating trade in the absence of border infrastructure North-South while facilitating unfettered access for businesses in Northern Ireland into Great Britain, GB.  The price of all of this, which is where the controversy lies in regard to the protocol, is that goods coming into Northern Ireland from GB have to have some checks because, owing to how the protocol works, that is effectively an entry point now into the EU Single Market for goods.  This limited series of checks is a necessary consequence of the protocol to ensure that Ireland's place in the EU Single Market remains protected and that its integrity is protected too.  In other words, we cannot have a protocol that opens up an unguarded backdoor into the EU Single Market via Northern Ireland.  That will not wash with our EU colleagues or the European Commission.  That is why the protocol is controversial.  It is the best outcome that we could have designed in view of the politics of the issues.<br/><br/>I will try to brief in my responses to the next questions but perhaps in this response I have answered some of the questions members had intended to raise.</p></speech>

One of the key issues in terms of the negotiations is the fishing sector.  The fishing community is vulnerable in the context of the Brexit negotiations.  Following on from Mr. Barnier's remarks at the weekend that even with a good Brexit there will be in a 15% to 18% reduction in quotas, I would welcome the Minister's views on the likely outcome of the negotiations in this regard.  On 15 and 16 December, negotiations will take place within the European Union on quotas for next year.  In the Minister's view, is it likely a deal will be in place before then in order that the negotiations at EU level on quotas for catch for next year can take place?  Mr. Barnier's reference to a 15% to 18% reduction in quota came as a surprise to the fishing community, even though it was obvious there would be some reduction in quota.  I would welcome the Minister's views on the direction he believes that negotiation will go over the next ten days.</p> <p>  Another issue is that of infrastructure, both here and in France.  I ask the Minister to comment on whether he believes we are Brexit-prepared in regard to key infrastructure at the relevant ports and if the Continent has the capability to deal with the trade, hopefully, coming directly from Ireland.</p> <p>  In regard to the passports issued over the past four years in particular, is it anticipated that that trend will continue such that large numbers of passports will need to be processed by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  What are the numbers like currently in terms of passport applications, particularly from the UK?</p> <p>  My final question is on a political point.  Since the mid-1970s, Ireland has been involved with the UK in regard to the European Union.  That political involvement will be broken.  Through what forums will Ministers meet and interact with their colleagues?  If we are to have a coherent approach to our engagement with the UK, which is our nearest neighbour and our dearest trading partner, that political interaction will be important.  I would like to hear from the Minister what that might look like.  For example, will there be a forum or will special meetings take place?  How does he envisage that political dynamic will work and to the benefit of the Irish community in the UK and in Ireland to make sure that they have representation on key issues?</p></speech>

I also welcome the pragmatic flexible approach he is indicating that Ireland is taking.  People sometimes elevate principles to too much importance when practical matters are more important.</p><p>Following on from Senator Lombard's point in respect of fisheries, my take on it is that when Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972, we had different territorial waters.  People cannot blame the EU for everything that has happened since.  Waters which were international then have become national now.  When one looks at fisheries as a percentage of UK GDP and Irish GDP, while it is important, there are other more important matters that have to be dealt with.  From my reading of the English press, the <i>Daily Mail, The Daily Express </i>and so on, this is the jingoistic issue on which people are taking robust stances and elevating to a matter of principle, ignoring the fact that Britain has to get fish exporting rights into the EU if its fisheries industry is to prosper at all.  Is there a question of postponing it or having a temporary arrangement?  I ask the Minister to comment on that matter.  While we are all shaping up to each other, is there a possibility that the temperature could be lowered a bit?  Leverage is not all that important now.  One of the thoughts in the back of my mind is that reflagging of ships could probably happen and the industry will be very flexible in the context of what is agreed.</p><p>The Minister mentioned the state aid mechanism.  I appreciate that on the previous occasion I raised it with him, he had to be somewhat coy and diplomatic.  I presume that remains the case so I will not press him.  I am interested in the free ports that the Tory Party in England is always talking about.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs, as the Irish trade Department, considering any proposals for free ports in Northern Ireland such as the Belfast-Larne area?  The Minister also mentioned the governance of future agreements as an issue.  Will that be dealt with by way of a dispute mechanism resolution or a tribunal?</p><p>We have an awful lot of mutual interests with the United Kingdom and with the island of Great Britain as well as just Northern Ireland.</p><p>In respect of the shared island concept that is part of the Government's programme and the common travel area considerations, do we have a plan to develop UK-Ireland relations to a higher degree than they are at the moment?<br/><br/>In the context of the<i>Daily Mail</i>, <i>The Daily Express </i>and so on, and the Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson's, remarks about devolution in Scotland having turned out to be a total disaster, I get the impression there is a great deal of macho unionist talk and integrationist talk in the UK.  Are we squaring up to that tendency, which is not a very helpful one?<br/><br/>When I was involved in government, between 1999 and 2007, there was immense reliance by Ireland as a State on UK research and analysis and legislative scrutiny of what was happening in Britain.  I refer even to UK university research, not just state research.  Britain was far more tooled up to deal with EU legislation and proposals for EU legislation.  I am really worried that I do not see a development of our intellectual infrastructure, either at an Oireachtas level, outside the Oireachtas or at a departmental level to make up for what will be a huge vacuum in our capacity to fire on all cylinders when we are interacting with other member states at Council level and dealing with the Commission and the European Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.1025" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2020120200002#E00200"><p>I will respond to Senator Lombard first.  On fishing, for members who have been following this process or have been talking to me about it, we have been flagging for 18 months that fishing was going to be the most difficult issue to resolve in regard to Brexit.  The reason there was not a significant discussion of fishing as part of the withdrawal agreement was that we knew it would be very difficult to resolve and that it would in some ways poison the discussion that resulted in a withdrawal agreement last year that involved the protocol and all the other matters we know about.  The idea of the protocol, and of the commitment in the political declaration that framed the approach towards getting a future-relationship deal, was that we would try to get fishing out of the way first and have it done by mid-summer.  As part of that, an informed decision would then be made as to whether there would be an extension of the transition period to allow for all the technical work that would be required for all the other areas, from aviation and road haulage to data, services, financial services, judicial co-operation, security co-operation and climate co-operation.  Eleven different strands of negotiation were all moving forward in parallel to constitute the future-relationship deal.  Fishing was one but it was always earmarked as potentially the most difficult because of the politics and emotion that come with fishing.</p><p>On the British side, one of the reasons that fishing is so difficult relates to the political promises that have been made to coastal communities and fishermen in the UK, and the emotive language of taking back control of laws and waters.  The fishing issue has been inextricably linked to the expression of sovereignty on which many people base their Brexit perspectives, which makes it really difficult.  On the EU side, it is equally difficult because, at the outset of the future-relationship negotiations, the mandate for Michel Barnier was to maintain the <i>status quo</i>on fishing, in terms of access and quota share.  The reason the EU was so demanding of Michel Barnier was that fishing was to be negotiated in the context of an overall deal and the UK was seeking and still seeks EU facilitation in many different areas.  The UK wants to access for free the EU energy markets and to get a facilitation for aviation access, road haulage access and tariff-free and quota-free access to the EU Single Market.  It also wants access to financial services.</p><p>The EU, perfectly reasonably, said that if it was to facilitate UK access to the benefit of the British economy in all these areas, surely it was not unreasonable that the EU would ask for access into British fishing grounds to ensure that it could protect the interests of its fishermen in the same way that the UK is seeking access into EU markets for the benefit of many different sectors of its economy.  Michel Barnier was instructed that the price of the facilitation in many of these other areas was to seek a reasonable agreement that would involve compromise, and potentially some transfer as the negotiations have developed of increased fishing opportunities for British fleets in British waters, but that there would still be a long-term certainty about access and quota share that would be reasonable.  That is where these negotiations have gone.</p><p>The starting points were extremely far apart and they have moved slightly closer to each other.  The combined EU fleets in British waters - Spanish, French, Dutch, Danish, Belgian, Irish - catch about &euro;650 million worth of fish per year, although the UK, obviously, catches a substantial quantity of fish in its own waters.  The UK has stated that it wants 80% of that back, that is, &euro;500 million of the &euro;650 million.  The EU has offered about &euro;100 million, or slightly more than that, in recognition of the change that Brexit will bring and so on.  While both sides have moved slightly closer to each other, it is still a significant gap.  How we bridge that in a way that will not create winners and losers on the fishing debate linked to Brexit is the big challenge.</p><p>There will not be an agreement unless we can find a solution on fishing.  There is no way the EU or I will support an agreement that can, effectively, be described as selling out our fishing interests to get a deal on everything else because fishing represents a very small percentage of overall GDP.  About 16,000 people in Ireland have employment linked to the fishing industry.  It is worth between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion to our economy.  The communities that rely on that income and those jobs do not have a whole lot of other alternatives.  Coastal towns such as Killybegs and Greencastle, Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Union Hall, and along the south and east coasts, are heavily reliant on the fishing industry, both demersal and pelagic, and on accessing some of that stock in British waters.  The two most important stocks for us in value terms are mackerel, on the pelagic side, although it is supplemented by herring, horse mackerel, blue whiting and so on, while on the whitefish side, there are all the other demersal stocks from haddock and cod to saithe and all the others.  Prawns too are a significant part of our fishing industry.</p><p>We are trying to ensure that the Irish fishing industry survives Brexit, not on the basis of financial compensation for loss of fish but by ensuring it can access fishing opportunities in the future to keep these communities intact from a fishing perspective.  As for the effort to suggest that they could be paid off and financially compensated for dramatic losses in order to get a deal, that would be a disastrous outcome.  We want fish, not money.  Compensation packages are about restructuring industries and so on and money will be needed arising from Brexit and Brexit disruption but in the case of fish, the most important thing is to maximise fishing opportunities and access into British waters.  We must also limit the displacement problem that will arise from limited access to British waters, which may drive many other EU fleets that currently catch fish in British waters, which may lose those opportunities, into Irish waters.  That would be a double negative for the Irish fishing industry in terms of sustainably managing our stock.</p><p>If I am overdoing it on fish, the Chairman should stop me but this is an important issue.  The final thing I will say on fish is this assumption some people have that all fish caught in British waters are British fish also needs to be challenged.  It is this idea of zonal attachment that where the fish are caught is where the fish are owned.</p><p> If one looks at the most valuable stock, which is mackerel, the truth is that most of the mackerel we catch off the west coast of Scotland are actually born off the west coast of counties Kerry, Cork and Clare.  They mature, grow and swim north past the coasts of counties Galway and Mayo and mature into adolescent fish off the coasts of counties Mayo and Donegal, where some of them are caught as they become adults.  Most of them, however, then swim into Scottish waters as adults when the fat levels are right and they are ripe to catch in the most sustainable way.  These are not Irish fish and they are not British fish.  They are a shared stock that is hugely valuable for everybody who catches them.  We need to manage them in a sustainable way that does not create perverse incentives for the Irish fishing fleet to catch them as juveniles before they swim across this imaginary line at sea where they enter British waters.  That is the danger.</p><p> If, therefore, we are serious about protecting our stock, which is an extraordinary resource that is shared in a sort of transnational way between EU, Irish and British waters, then we need a fisheries deal that recognises this is a shared stock which swims between jurisdictions and cannot have these simple hard and fast political slogans attached to it linked to sovereignty, and so on.  I suspect a mackerel off the coast of County Mayo swimming towards Scotland does not feel Irish or British, quite frankly.  They just happen to be swimming in those waters that are highly fertile fishing grounds for everybody.</p><p> That is the challenge of fish and whether it gets put off.  The danger for putting it off or doing a partial agreement now and coming back in five years' time, which has been written about, is that if one puts the decision off it is hard to then come to an agreement on fish that is part of an overall agreement where there is give and take in many other areas, whether that is energy, services, financial services or whatever.</p><p> The only way to get a fair deal on fish for the EU side is if it is part of a bigger package of arrangements where the UK wins in terms of accessing EU markets in many areas and the EU gets a reasonable deal which allows our fleets to be able to access fish in British waters, whereas, if one isolates fishing and does it on its own it becomes a sort of horse trading session, stock-by-stock, where the UK demands X and the EU can only give Y.  One then tries to find some arrangement in the middle, which is not easy. </p><p> We need to try to take the emotion and emotive language out of this particular element of the negotiation and try to have as much pragmatism as we can towards recognising British sovereignty.  That is a must to get a deal.  Britain needs to be respected as an independent sovereign country outside of the EU.  At the same time, however, it also needs to respect that we have fishing industries and families who rely on income from fish and who have been fishing in these waters for many decades.  As part of an overall package where the UK is facilitated, the UK also needs to recognise EU concerns in this area.</p><p> I will be much quicker on the other issues and around the governance issue.  My understanding is the negotiations at the moment are centred around, first, that the EU can never sign up to a trade deal that involves no tariffs or quotas unless it can have reassurance around fair competition.  The UK is just too big an economy and too close to the EU Single Market to have tariff-free trade and a risk that a future British Government could decide to create competitive advantage for its economy by deregulating that economy or by applying state aid that goes way beyond what the EU allows in the Single Market, and then have free access into the Single Market to use that competitive advantage for the British economy.  That can never be facilitated.  The EU wants tariff-free trade and a trade deal that allows as seamless a trading relationship as possible.  It must, however, get guarantees around fair competition between both economies.  There needs to be a series of sectoral agreements around the principle of fair competition on a level playing field.  We know the kinds of areas we are talking about there from environment to labour standards, consumer protections, taxation, state aid and so on.</p><p> Second, one then needs governance arrangements that can deal with disputes if and when they arise.  In other words, what is the consequence if somebody breaks that agreement?  As a result of the Internal Market Bill and the approach taken by the British Government in these negotiations which said, effectively, in the case of the Internal Market Bill, unless it can implement the protocol in the way it would like, then it will pass legislation anyway to give a British Minister the power to do that, overriding the protocol and breaking international law and the terms of that treaty.  Since that approach, which has damaged trust, I believe the EU is even stronger now.  It needs a robust and independent dispute resolution mechanism and a governance around it, which the UK and the EU accepts, that allows there to be a consequence that would be triggered quickly for a breach in the level playing field agreement.  In other words, if one side breaches it, the other side can retaliate within the framework of a deal and that would be facilitated through a governance arrangement, and so on.</p><p> These kinds of things are difficult to design and get right and, of course, all this must respect British sovereignty outside the European Union, making its own decisions in its own parliamentary system through its own legal mechanisms and courts, and so on.  That is complicated, to say the least.  Those two issues are level playing field and governance and the difficult issue of fishing, which goes way beyond its value financially because of the reasons I hope I have outlined.</p><p> The state aid issues as they relate to the protocol are slightly different because there is a dispute between both sides.  No one is disputing that under the protocol that Northern Ireland needs to mirror EU state aid rules in terms of level playing field.  It gets complicated if a company has a footprint in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  If a future British Government provides significant state aid to a parent company in Great Britain, does that derive competitive advantage for a satellite of that parent company in Northern Ireland in a way the protocol does not cover?  We would say the protocol covers that but the British Government has a different perspective.</p><p> I want to pay tribute to both Mr. Michael Gove and Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, who are the two co-chairmen, one might say, of the joint committee which is responsible for the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.  They have a good relationship and I believe there is much pragmatism now in the process of trying to find ways of implementing the protocol in a way that makes life as straightforward as possible for all the different stakeholders impacted by that.  We are getting pretty close to agreeing the outstanding issues in terms of the implementation of the protocol because of that pragmatic relationship between those two individuals and their teams.  I believe that would be fair to say.</p><p> All of the media coverage focuses around the Michel Barnier-David Frost relationship and the task force versus the British negotiating team.  Much quiet and good detailed work linked to the joint committee and specialised committee has been done and few outstanding issues are left in the context of implementing the protocol in full.  I hope that will mean the British Government will not make what I would regard as a significant mistake next week as this process hopefully draws to a conclusion and reintroduces Part 5 of the UK Internal Market Bill, which had been removed by the House of Lords, in a way that threatens to breach, in British law, the withdrawal agreement again.</p><p>There is also, potentially, a second piece of legislation, a finance and taxation Bill, that would do the same.  If the British Government does that, it will be a clear signal to the EU that this process is not going to conclude well and, effectively, that the UK does not want a deal.  I hope that does not happen.  We have certainly given signals in as respectful but blunt a way as we can that it would be a mistake for the UK to do that at this stage.  That was reflected in Michel Barnier's briefing of the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, meeting this morning.  </p><p> Days matter in these negotiations.  A lot of negotiating will happen between now and next week when the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill may come back into the House of Commons and the finance Bill may also come to the House of Commons.  I hope that there will be no need for any domestic legislation that threatens the implementation of the protocol because of a successful outcome of negotiations.  Time will tell.  I am afraid that there is still quite a lot in this.</p></speech>

The Minister made a point around Michel Barnier's warnings and described his own fear of the UK making a significant mistake.  The reality is that next week is make or break.  It is up to the UK.  If it makes a particular decision about the internal market and finance Bills and breaches international law, the reality is that we are into a no-deal situation.  I appreciate that the Minister is being diplomatic but those are the stakes.  We obviously hope that we do not get to that stage but if we do, if Boris Johnson's Government decides to go ahead and we end up in a no-deal situation, I would like reassurance that we, as a country, are ready for that and in a position to address a lot of the concerns.</p> <p>  Part of the challenge is that most of the public are aware of Brexit but not of the direct impact it will have.  Food is still on the shelves and supply chains are still operating.  People are aware it is a big issue but it is not directly impacting their lives.  I know that the Minister is talking about fish but the issues for people at home were sausages and chips.  I heard people start to talk about the potential impact in that regard.  Is there a communication strategy in place if we end up with a no-deal Brexit?</p> <p>  I will follow on from what Senator McDowell said.  I raised a point during the debate in the Seanad yesterday and we had a discussion around the data issue which is going to be critical in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  I would be concerned about the introduction of state aid.  The policy of Boris Johnson's Government has been to pump money into particular industries and sectors.  I have a particular concern that there would be a decision to pump money into some of the airports in an effort to attract transatlantic flights into the UK.  I know that they will not necessarily have air access but it could distort other sectors of the economy, including our tourism sector which is crucial at the moment.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister said that we need ways to continue to develop the bilateral arrangement.  That is important.  Not having the UK at the EU table is going to be a difficulty for Ireland and we need to look at building relationships and forming alliances with other member states.  The Minister might make reference to that.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell made a point about our intellectual infrastructure and the capacity to engage, and that is going to be a challenge.  We, effectively, operate a common higher education and research area with the UK.  It is going to be absolutely essential that we avail of the opportunities that Brexit provides to Ireland and that, in building the bilateral arrangements that the Minister talks about, the strong existing links in education and research between Ireland and the UK are maintained and strengthened, but that we also explore ways to further strengthen links at a European level.</p></speech>

He helped to achieve European cohesion and all of that.</p><p>I was fascinated by his description of the fishing situation.  I was thinking that it was great that he has a background as a fisheries Minister.  It is good to know that there are no nationalist or unionist fish.  There is enough nationalist and unionist cleavage without having it among the fishing stock.  That is encouraging.</p><p>I will have to leave because I have a matter on the agenda of our parliamentary party meeting and I want to go.  I will read and hear about the debate tomorrow.  The Minister yesterday indicated a good confidence about customs working well and that we will have a green lane for Irish trucks, etc.  He thought that there will not be long delays and, of course, we have the 1,500 new people.  I would again like to hear the Minister go into that and give assurances in this forum on that score because it is a real concern with implications.  I was this morning talking to a good haulier, known to the Minister, from a good firm.  He said that any delays would have huge implications for his margins.  It would be interesting to get clarification around that matter.</p><p>The Minister also said yesterday that the cross-Border health scheme could not continue in its present form because the UK will no longer be in the EU.  I am interested in how he sees that being rectified and over what kind of a timeframe. </p><p>The Internal Market Bill is the great chestnut.  The reintroduction of the section that was defeated in the House of Lords when the Bill is presented in the House of Commons next week would almost be seen as a <i>casus belli</i>, a declaration of war by the UK.  It would declare an intention to not go ahead with agreements and to breach protocols.  We certainly hope that does not happen.  All I can say publicly is that all of us, of whatever party and Independents, are proud that Ireland is firmly standing up to the Internal Market Bill because it breaches ethics, international law and high principle.  How do we expect the ordinary citizenry to be straight and proper in their dealings with the state if states' dealings with each other are to be crooked and not honoured properly?  It is hard to instil confidence in politics and the democratic system in those circumstances.</p><p>That is all I want to say.  I want to leave.  I thank the Chair.  I do not know if I got the opportunity to publicly congratulate her on her election.  I wish her well.</p></speech>

The update today has been comprehensive and helpful.  It gives the committee the benefit of being able to have this kind of conversation.  I have two brief questions.  RT&Eacute; today reported that many thousands of businesses across the island have indicated they are unprepared for post-Brexit trading realities.  What is the likelihood of a grace period post 1 January to allow some of those businesses to allow for a gradual shift to the new, post-Brexit reality to which the Minister earlier spoke?</p> <p>  I appreciate the update from the Minister on things such as the European health insurance card and I sincerely hope that issue is resolved.  If it is not, has an oven-ready plan been put in place?</p><p>Does it include a communications strategy to let people in the North know how the process will work?  I assume that there will be a number of communication strategies to convey the information.</p><p> The Minister should think about the following matter, on which I have engaged with him previously.  As we move through this Brexit period and edge ever closer to 1 January, regardless of the outcome, there is an increasingly strong argument and rationale for the Irish Government to consider providing a service or facility that will meet the requirement of Irish citizens and EU citizens in the North.  We know about the controversy surrounding the British Government's refusal of an EU presence.  The Irish Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs has, through its secretariat, space in Belfast, for example.  There will be a range of Irish and other EU citizens who will want to and will be entitled to engage with the Irish Government - and with the EU structures through the Irish Government - whether that is in respect of the European health insurance card and its complexities or of the Erasmus programme, as the Minister has noted, or of passports, as other colleagues have mentioned.  We need a one-stop-shop or a signposted satellite service that can work to meet the needs of citizens.  It is all well and good to have plans in place but people will need to avail of them, understand them and communicate them.  If they are in the North, they will need a very direct interface with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Government.  There is a genuine and clear rationale for providing such a service.  I ask the Minister to consider my proposal outside of everything else that he is dealing with at the minute.</p></speech>

We have wasted so much time talking about the Internal Market Bill and on what is the motivation for the British Government to do it, whether that is a negotiating strategy or a way to sink these negotiations if it wanted a tool to do that.  Five former British Prime Ministers from both parties have come out against the legislation and its approach.  The Bill has, undoubtedly, damaged Britain's international reputation, not just in the European Union but on the other side of the Atlantic as well.  People are trying to understand what the British Government is at.  In the context of these negotiations, they should be between two negotiating teams that are trying to put a future relationship in place that benefits both.  I hope that our future relationship with the UK will be very close for mutual benefit.  In some ways, the Bill is a very provocative approach that has undermined trust and sucked in a huge amount of oxygen that could have been used to focus on resolving issues through negotiation.  It is what it is and we cannot ignore it, which is why I mentioned it today.  We could have a second item of legislation that doubles down on the issue, through the Finance Bill next week, in the context of another element of the protocol.  One would have the state aid element and the list of goods not at risk issue in two different Bills.  I believe the EU will draw only one conclusion from that course of action if it happens, which would be hugely regrettable but again, that is a matter for the British Government.</p> <p>  If that were to happen and there was a no deal on the back of it, then what happens next?  We are as ready as we possibly can be.  There are companies, mainly small ones, that have not thought about Brexit as much as they should or could have.  They have been greatly distracted by Covid.  They have been closed down, opened, closed down again and are opening again this week and they simply have not had the bandwidth to focus on Brexit as well as Covid, and perhaps other challenges too.  They have got to find the bandwidth, however, because they will be impacted whether they like it or not.</p> <p>  There is not going to be a grace period on 1 January.  The UK is applying what is, in effect, a grace period on some of the checks that they will require at their ports on goods coming into the UK.  I understand that the UK will facilitate us by providing a period of flexibility that will last about six months.  The EU does not have that luxury because it i s not a single country; it is a Union of 27 countries.  If the EU sets a precedent by offering flexibility on timelines when everybody has known about this for quite a long time, then a precedent will have been set that could cause problems with other third countries with which it may be developing relations, such as Turkey or whatever.  There may well be some flexibility in some specific areas that simply do not have political solutions right now where there is more time needed.  There are some examples, potentially, in the implementation of the protocol of the need for more time, and medicines is a good example.  There will be goodwill to try to give some time.</p> <p>  A general extension of the transition period beyond 1 January is not going to happen.  It is very important that we are honest about that in order that people sit up and take notice.   </p></speech>

I mean that the UK will be no longer be in the customs union and the Single Market.  Legally it is out and there is no legal mechanism to extend the transition period.  That time has passed.</p> <p>  At different stages there has been a lot of marching the army up to the top of the mountain and back down again about Brexit.  This time, there is no extra time, which every business needs to understand.  There are about 100,000 businesses in Ireland that either trade with or through the UK, which is a lot of businesses in a country of 4.5 million people, and about 200,000 people are employed in that trading relationship.  There are about 40,000 businesses that trade with the UK regularly, that is, something like once a fortnight.  In some cases, such as supermarket chains and so on, it is every day.  All of our data indicate that the vast majority of the businesses that trade regularly with the UK are gearing up to be as ready as they can be in terms of having a customs number.  They are gearing up to make sure that they can do the customs declarations that they need, the processes, the sanitary and phytosanitary or SPS checks and all of the other things but there will be some that will be caught out and we need to help those companies.</p> <p>  Let the message not go out that there will be a period of flexibility for three or four months to allow everybody get in shape.  I do not believe that is where we are going to be.  That is why I think there will be a lot of disruption at the start of January, particularly in the UK and in ports where our hauliers may get caught up in the disruption.  That is why we have placed a big emphasis on direct ferry routes between Rosslare and Dublin Port, primarily, but also Cork and other ports.  Last week alone, a new Port of Cork to Zeebrugge service was announced and a Rosslare to Dunkirk daily roll-on, roll-off service was announced.  The capacity on the existing direct ferry links between Ireland and the rest of the Single Market through mainland Europe has had less than a 50% uptake.  We are ready for a big shift over on to direct ferry routes should that happen.  I think we can deal with that capacity if it happens.  If we have to have extra capacity, the ferry companies have made it clear that they can shift capacity off the Irish Sea to the direct ferry routes, should it be necessary.  As the UK land bridge is still the fastest way in principle to transport goods to and from mainland Europe, we would like to continue to do that but of course we must avoid disruption and delay should that happen in early January.</p> <p>  I hear what the Senator said about state aid.  If we can get a deal, then state aid is not going to be a problem because it will be part of the level playing field negotiation.  If we do not get a deal and if the UK decides to use state aid, beyond what the EU is allowed to do, to create a competitive advantage for itself, then that has consequences in the context of a trading relationship that continues to have tariffs and other disruptions, which is regrettable if that is where we go.</p><p>In responding to disruption, the EU will allow some flexibility in the application of state aid rules in Ireland.  If we had to put a package together to support the beef sector, for example, I would be surprised if there were a problem around state aid limitations to keep people in jobs and give families incomes.  We will access as much of the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund as we can.  It should not be forgotten that this is a fund for the whole EU.  Ireland will have the strongest case and, I hope, secure more of the fund than any other country.  I am pretty confident we will, and rightly so given our vulnerabilities.</p><p> A number of Senators asked about the future bilateral relationship with the UK.  It is really important.  The offices of the Taoiseach and UK Prime Minister have been talking about that quite actively, and I suspect we will hear a lot more about it early in the new year.  What we previously considered with the British Government was having an annual British&ndash;Irish intergovernmental conference or summit, alternating between Britain and Ireland every second year and involving at least half a dozen, if not ten, Ministers plus the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.  This would force in being circumstances in which senior civil servants would have to compare agendas on areas of common interest on which they could work together, whether it was transport, climate change, foreign policy, development aid or marine protection areas.  There are dozens of such areas on which the UK and Ireland should be working together to their mutual benefit.  It is important that we have time to get to know our counterparts in the British Government so we can build relationships of the kind that can keep the British&ndash;Irish relationship strong and intact.  We are simply not going to meet the British at EU meetings anymore.  They are already gone.  If structure is not created, it is very hard to build relationships that will last or exist in difficult times when we need to find solutions.</p><p> I have probably answered most of Senator Joe O'Reilly's questions.  We are going to try to replicate, as best we can, the cross-border healthcare directive to make sure cross-Border healthcare continues to be facilitated on the island of Ireland.  Regarding the consequences of reintroducing Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill, we have probably addressed that issue in making reference to the grace period.</p><p> Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised the issue of an office or one-stop shop in Northern Ireland to facilitate many of the services required.  I am aware that he has been raising the issue of a passport office for the North.  The number of passport applications has been tiny this year by comparison with last year because nobody is travelling.  There has not been much demand but I suspect that when people start travelling next year, many will realise that since they have not been travelling this year and have therefore not looked at the expiry dates on their passports, their passports will have expired.  When they look at them, they will see they are out of date.</p></speech>

To go off script significantly, I have a lot of sympathy for people with British passports who have been able to live here as Irish citizens for many years.  Owing to the common travel area and EU membership, they could gain access to all services.  They cannot vote in referendums but they can vote in virtually every other election.  For people in that category who want to get an Irish passport, we should make the process as easy, quick and cost-effective as possible because, in many ways, they have essentially committed their lives to living here.  There are many thousands of British people who have happily been living in Ireland with a British passport but who will now, all of a sudden, realise that holding an Irish passport is quite different from holding a British one in the context of the relationship with the rest of the European Union.  There are differences in respect of business, travel, holidays and other purposes, and in accessing EU services and so on.  I want to do some work on this matter with the Department to ensure we can facilitate the transition for those who want to make it.  Unfortunately, holding a British passport now means something quite different from holding an Irish passport in that the latter affords all the rights and opportunities associated with being an EU citizen.  It is one of the many consequences of Brexit, I am afraid.  I would like Ireland to be as welcoming a country as possible for British people living here who want to apply for an Irish passport.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I can only imagine how busy his timetable is.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the common travel area and the unique relationship between Britain and Ireland.  Thankfully, on a very significant day for a maturing democracy, the people of Ireland voted in the mid-1980s to allow British citizens here to have a vote in a general election.  The British were far ahead of us in that the Irish in Britain got to vote many decades sooner.  In one sense, the cultural, social and economic ties between the North and the Republic are closer than the ties between the north of England, such as Yorkshire, and the rest of England might be.  It is a unique set of circumstances and it is not of our making.  Ireland is the new frontier of the EU in the sense of protecting the integrity of the EU, with all its complexities and challenges.</p> <p>  I really welcome what the Minister said about the Erasmus scheme.  Some ingenuity, generosity and inclusivity have been applied.  Even if the students from the North have to register with a university in the Republic, they are not being deprived.</p> <p>  The &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment reserve targets sectors and member states impacted most disproportionately by Brexit.  Ultimately and legally, it is the EU versus the United Kingdom, and we have put our trust in the EU.  For instance, Mr. Michel Barnier, rather than a senior Irishman, is directly on the front line.  We are the EU.  There has been great generosity on the EU's part in respect of the protocols.  Apart from that, has a lot been done for the special categorisation of the Republic of Ireland?  Is the Minister confident we will get the lion's share of the &euro;5 billion?  Ireland will be the member state most adversely impacted.  Does the Minister trust and hope we will get the funding?  Does he get reassurances?  I am sure the EU will not sign off on this without Ireland on board if, as I hope, there is to be a deal.</p> <p>  Also on the question of the &euro;5 billion, will there be an ongoing fund to help us owing to the inconvenience, disruption and disturbance Brexit will cause &mdash; but not of our making &mdash; as we become the new frontier of the EU?  Even if there is a seamless agreement or soft Brexit, there will be many challenges for the State and for so many businesses.  As the Minister said, 40,000 businesses trade regularly with the UK.  We have a special relationship, and I am aware that the Minister is aware of that.</p> <p>  I detect the goodwill in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They are two Houses that know when to disagree with the Minister, and they would let him know about it.  There is considerable good-will directed towards the team led by the Minister, but that does not mean that we cannot at all times seek assurances and reassurances.  We are very grateful for the good work he is doing.</p></speech>

I do not know how the Minister does it.  I am wrecked just listening to all the comments on what is going on over Brexit.</p><p>It is hard enough to be a Senator, not to mention sorting out the Brexit issue for the country.</p><p> I am very interested in enterprise, trade and employment and rural development, on both of which I am spokesperson.  We must have looked in great detail at the amount we import from Britain.  Something I raised earlier today in the Seanad is that in the future this country needs to be resilient because of Brexit, Covid, climate change and who knows what else is coming down the road.  To that end, I would value access to the figures the Department of Foreign Affairs has on exactly what we are importing from England.  I hear all sorts of figures, such as 42,000 tonnes of potatoes and onions and all sorts of mad things.  If we cannot grow potatoes in Ireland, there is something seriously wrong.  I know the Minister is going to sort it all out, with everybody behind him, but I would like access to figures.  We should try to become more resilient and use the figures we have when dealing with Brexit to see how the country can reduce our imports for both climate change and resilience reasons.  We should put our land to good use and see what we can do for ourselves.</p></speech>

I note that my colleagues are all behind him provided he gets the right result.  They did not say whether they would be if he did not get the right result, but perhaps that is for another day.  I am sure the Minister noted that.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the word "focus".  Being from a Border county, it was difficult to get people to focus on it even before Covid.  It is one of those scenarios where people think it will be all right on the night, that it will work itself out eventually, a deal will be done and life will go on.  One thing I have taken from the Minister's very informative contribution, and it is an important message to convey, is that when we pull our bedroom curtains back on 1 January, the world will look like a different place.  Perhaps more work needs to be done to convey that message between now and the end of the year, because I am not convinced people are tuned into what life will be like on 1 January.  Some form of television or marketing campaign to hammer that point home might not be a bad idea.  There is so much happening at present with people's attention on Covid and trying to stay safe that I sense Brexit is very much on the back burner.  I worry about that and that we are not understanding what the consequences will be for us when 1 January arrives.</p> <p>  Senator Martin mentioned in his contribution that no country will be more affected by Brexit than Ireland, which is a fair comment.  I would dig deeper and say no part of the country is going to be more affected by Brexit than the Border counties.  That concerns me.  I am concerned about the free movement of people over the Border, how that is going to affect relationships North and South and how it will affect business from the point of view of businesses in the South trying to trade and keep going.  It is to be hoped the issue of smuggling along the Border will not be a problem, but traditionally there always has been movement between North and South.  If prices are cheaper in the North, the reality is that people in the South, especially in the Border counties, will travel there to shop and so forth.</p> <p>  The other issue is that when push comes to shove and in all negotiations, we are one player in the EU.  When the pressure is applied, and we all understand that every side has to give a bit to get a deal, is the Minister concerned that the pressure might come from the EU to get a deal and basically get this off the table, and that we might be asked to take a deep breath and swallow things that we would not swallow today?  We might be forced to do so as it approaches the finish line.  How concerned is the Minister about that at present?</p> <p>  The other issue, which the Minister mentioned, is the relationship with the UK post Brexit.  That is vital because the UK is our nearest neighbour and we have a unique and close relationship with it, despite the history.  It is and always will be our closest neighbour.  I worry that relationships could become fraught when these negotiations are over.  I hate to think that would be the case.  It is important that there are channels whereby we can rebuild the relationship with the UK, if that is necessary.</p> <p>  I wish the Minister well.  The country is in safe hands with him at the wheel.  I sincerely hope he gets a deal we all can live with and that we will all be back here singing his praises after 1 January.</p></speech>

I concur with the many Senators who have spoken about beyond Brexit and building that relationship or setting up the structures.  Minister, you have spoken about exchanges between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.  They are already looking to that new mechanism, but it might be worth considering, and perhaps it is being considered, to have it not just at governmental level but also at parliament level.  It would be not just Ministers but all Members of this Parliament having more opportunity to engage with Members of Parliament in the UK.  Some of those Members will end up moving up the ranks to the level of Government.  We should not seek simply to replace the structures that exist but to go better and stronger than that.  We should get beyond this and make it an even better and stronger relationship post Brexit, and get everybody working on it.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will clarify one matter.  If a person is living in Northern Ireland and working in the Republic, is it the common travel area that is the legal basis for doing that in terms of getting a personal public service, PPS, number, being paid and the practicalities of it?</p> <p>  With regard to Dover port, has the Minister had any more recent updates as to how it is preparing in comparison with the preparations that have happened at Dublin Port, for example, in terms of building new infrastructure for checks and a traffic management plan?  How is it fixed for 1 January?</p> <p>  As regards the Finance Bill, I am concerned that it is even being suggested that there is a possibility the UK Government could be setting out purposely to undermine the negotiations with a view to having a no-deal scenario, and perhaps with a view to trying to blame the EU for it.  I sincerely hope that what is being rumoured and suggested by some is not true.  I am finding it difficult to decipher the end game of the UK Government.  Whenever a person starts a negotiation, he or she always knows where he or she wishes to get to, and usually that person has an idea of where he or she is willing to compromise.  Perhaps he or she ends up compromising a little more, but that person knows what the end result is supposed to be.  I assume the UK Government knows whether it wants or does not want a deal, but it is quite hard to read the situation at times.  I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on what he is hearing on the Finance Bill.  Are we going to see a repeat of what happened with the Internal Market Bill, with a direct and overt attack on the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Northern Ireland?</p> <p>  They are the main questions.  In terms of the Brexit supports, there might be a job of work to be done after 1 January, and this committee will certainly examine it.  The supports we have in place are many and substantial.  Perhaps those supports should be assessed in mid-February or thereabouts to see if they are still fit for purpose and working and to see if anything else must be done to help.  Regarding the sausage wars and the potato wars, it was unfortunate that we had news reports this week of a shortage of potatoes and they were lined up alongside the RT&Eacute; documentary on the Famine.  It brought people's minds back.  It is amazing what focuses the mind and the things that impact on people.  There is an element of citizens thinking things are going to be fine, because they have been fine to date, and perhaps not fully understanding that after 1 January they will change.</p> <p>  What struck me most from the Minister's contribution on the fishing issue was his comment that what we want is fish, not money.  I support him on that.  We could financially compensate fishing communities today, but if we do that there will be no fishing communities 50 years hence because the next generation will not have those fishing opportunities.  It is very important for protecting the fishing industry in the future that people can actually fish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-02a.1047" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2020120200002#L00100"><p>There are a couple of principles on which, from an Irish perspective within the EU, I have tried to be vocal.  One is that whatever deal is done in respect of fish, the priority has to be access to fishing opportunities, not big compensation packages to compensate for the absence of fishing opportunities.  The money in that regard will be gone in a few years' time and then we would be dealing with the consequences.  People will remember what happened to the sugar beet industry in Ireland and all of the political rows relating to compensation packages.  We have got nothing now in terms of that industry.  We still grow sugar beet but it is for different reasons.  What we want here is an outcome.  We have got to be realistic as well.  The UK has serious concerns in respect of fishing.  Therefore, a deal is difficult and requires compromise on both sides.  First and foremost, this is about trying to protect our fishing industry by protecting stocks and ensuring that we will have opportunities in the future for fishing communities.</p> <p>  The second principle that is important for me is, whatever compromises are necessary to get a deal, if we get a deal, that there will be fair burden sharing across the EU of the loss of opportunities, if there are some losses of opportunities, for the EU fleet as a whole and that one, two or three countries are not being asked to have to carry that burden on their own, for example, Ireland, because we happen to be located next door.  I spent quite a lot of time discussing this issue with Mr. Michel Barnier, particularly in the context of those two key principles.</p> <p>  There are linked issues in terms of the displacement of fishing fleets into Irish waters as a result of lost opportunities in British waters.  This is also a big problem that needs to be factored into how we manage EU fish stocks in the future in Irish waters in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, etc.  This is difficult, complex stuff.  I agree that solidarity needs to mean something in the context of how the EU collectively addresses the consequences of whatever deal might or might not be agreed.</p> <p>  It is a good observation that we do not know what the British Government wants but that is a deliberate strategy by the UK.</p></speech>

The British Prime Minister has done quite a good job of persuading people that he is willing to do that if he is not happy with the deal as a way of trying to maximise pressure to get what he wants.  One has to look at the practical consequences of a no-deal for Britain and for Ireland and the cost of that, which would, in my view, be significant.  It is not only not getting a deal on trade in terms of the absence of tariffs and quota, but it also makes it much more difficult to get the sectoral arrangements in place on all these other areas that are hugely important for the British economy and for the EU-UK relationship in the future politically, from security to data, to access to aviation and haulage, to services in banking and financial services, energy, etc., that will fall into place if there is a trade deal or are likely to do so because the mood music will allow for that.  If there is not a trade deal, it makes it much more fractious because we will essentially move into a political blame game very quickly in the absence of a deal which makes these sectoral arrangements around contingency planning in the absence of a deal for 1 January next much more difficult.  For both sides, the absence of a deal has real consequences.</p> <p>  I would not be ruffled by not knowing what the British Government really wants.  That is a fairly standard negotiating strategy.  Actually, the EU is the opposite of that.  Everybody knows what the EU wants because it is such a predictable animal.  It works, as stated earlier, on the basis of precedent, law, treaties, directives and mandates that the negotiating team has been given.  The two sides have approached this very differently but, hopefully, they will be able to find a way of getting a deal that everyone can live with.</p> <p>  I do not want to comment on the level of preparations in Dover.  That is a matter for the British side.  All I would say is that when the French tested the system of checking passports last week, the queue was 5 km long.  This would suggest that there could be significant disruption here, at least, in the short term after 1 January.  One cannot compare Dover with Dublin.  Dublin is a busy port, but not in comparison with Dover.</p></speech>

We have got to get our house in order in the context of Dublin Port.  We have spent a lot of time and money trying to do that.  It is really a partnership between Revenue, Dublin Port and the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport and Health all trying to work together to make sure that we have a plan that works for everybody.  In truth, the challenge for Dover is many multiples of that.  That is why - we will have to wait and see - we must have contingency plans in place in case that does not work out to well, and we do in terms of direct ferry links.</p> <p>  On the common travel area, CTA, and frontier workers, etc., if you are an Irish or British citizen living on the island of Ireland, you have no worries.  Your freedom to move around and work will be the same on 1 January as it is today.  If you are an EU citizen living in the Republic of Ireland and working in Northern Ireland, you will be able to travel, of course, because of the CTA, but you may need to avail of the permitting system the UK will have for EU nationals working in the UK post Brexit.  If you are currently an EU national who works in the UK, including Northern Ireland, you are automatically covered - it is a sort of formality - and somebody who comes in the future to do that will have to apply for that permitting process.  That is why the CTA is a fantastic solution if you hold an Irish or a British passport.  If you hold a Polish, Dutch, French or German passport, while you can travel without restriction, your ability to be able to work and access welfare and all the other things requires some paperwork.</p> <p>  On the island of Ireland, North and South, I do not envisage huge problems.  There is also then a frontier workers' issue of facilitation which will cover many of the workers also.  This will not be a too difficult a space.  If, however, you are a non-Irish but EU citizen in Ireland and you need to go to GB, for example, for a six-month contract, that will not be as seamless as it is today.  It will require an application process and permitting system.  What we take for granted today, namely, hopping on a flight to London and doing what one needs to do for a few weeks, if one is a Dutch person working for Apple, Dell or an Irish company that has a footprint in the UK, it is not so straightforward anymore.  This is Brexit, I am afraid.</p></speech>

If an EU national comes to Ireland, he or she can work at whatever he or she wants even if that person is resident in Northern Ireland.  Such a person is an EU national resident outside the EU but, in the context of work, in the fairly extraordinary arrangement under the protocol, is frontier working in the EU.</p><p>I believe I am correct in that.  The person is frontier working in the EU, so there is no issue.</p><p> In response to Senator Gallagher's point on the Border counties, in the first half of the Brexit negotiations, when we were trying to get a withdrawal agreement, I spent a lot of time in the Border counties at public meetings with stakeholder groups and so on, because the big concern near the Border was whether we were going to have a physical border again, a barrier to trade and movement of goods.  Of course, that is no longer an issue.  The danger is that many people in the Border counties, because the Border issue gets solved by the protocol, think everything is solved.  Actually, for the all-island economy, most things are solved.  That is what the protocol does: it allows the free movement of goods on the island of Ireland without any checking system.  However, there are other issues that, under the protocol, need teasing out in terms of implementation, so people need to be alive to that.  Even on issues like purchasing online from the UK, the consumer protections we take for granted under EU directives and EU law today no longer apply, and we will be relying on whatever consumer protections the British Government decides to introduce.  For example, we are potentially exposed in terms of returns policies.  If there is a fault with what is bought, people normally get their money back.  However, all the things we would have taken for granted whereby people trust purchasing something in the UK, just like they would trust purchasing something in Ireland, now have question marks over them because we are purchasing from a third country, the equivalent of the US, Canada or elsewhere.</p><p> I take the Senator's point in regard to the communications campaign.  Believe it or not, we have actually had a communications campaign going in the last few weeks.  It has been on television, on radio and on local media, but it is so hard to break through the Covid fog that has descended on Ireland, which means everything is seen through a Covid lens and it is dominant in terms of media coverage.  By the way, it is the same in the UK too, which might be quite helpful to us in the context of finalising a Brexit deal, in my view, because there is not huge interest in Brexit in the British media right now, and it is very much focused on Covid, on vaccines and on the three-tier system that has been introduced, and all of the debate around that.  I hope that may potentially give some cover to allow for sensible compromises that can get a deal done, but we will see.</p><p> I spoke earlier about the UK-Ireland relationship, which is very important.  We are going to put structure around that.  I take the Senator's point in regard to that going beyond Governments and Ministers.  There is an interparliamentary group and maybe we could look to modernise that a bit and to add to its agenda in a way that creates a bit more dynamism and more interest to discuss policy, as well as build relationships.  If the Senator has suggestions in that area, I could discuss them.</p><p> On the &euro;5 billion Brexit adjustment fund, as I said yesterday and earlier today, this is a &euro;5 billion fund for the whole of the European Union.  I am pretty confident that Ireland will make a stronger case than any other country because it is simply the truth that we are more disrupted than any other country due to Brexit and, therefore, we should be accessing more of this fund than any other country.  When the Senator says we should get the lion's share of it, I think that is perhaps dangerous language.  If there is a fund for 27 countries, no one country is going to get more than half of the fund.  If we got 20% of the fund, we would be doing very well and it would probably be twice the amount the next closest country gets.</p></speech>

We are making a very strong case.  I have met the line Commissioner twice to make our case and he is very receptive to that case, and very helpful to Ireland, as so many of the Commissioners have been.  If ever we needed an example of what it means to be in the European Union, Brexit is it.  It is extraordinary how a small country, hugely vulnerable to something that is happening outside of its own control, has been protected by the collective negotiating strength of the European Union.  We have had European Commissioners coming to Ireland to understand in real detail the vulnerabilities and concerns that Ireland has, backing that up with an approach to the negotiations and maintaining solidarity across the European Union.  It has been quite extraordinary in the context of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol initially, and again now in terms of the Brexit reserve fund and the negotiations that Michel Barnier and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic are leading.  I get phone calls from Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, who is Vice-President of the European Commission, really wanting to make sure that Ireland is being understood through this process.  We sometimes hear loose language around unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels, and so on.  These people are working night and day to protect Ireland at the moment.  As someone who is very passionate about the European Union, I suggest that if we want a pragmatic example of why it matters, this is it.  Covid is another example in terms of getting vaccines through the central purchasing power of the European Union, but Brexit is a phenomenal example of solidarity and the backing of a small member state in the face of huge challenges that we could not have faced on our own.</p> <p>  On trade, which Senator Garvey raised, we have a trade relationship with the UK worth about &euro;80 billion a year.  By the way, we buy more from Britain than we sell to Britain, which many people do not realise.</p></speech>

The UK's trade with Ireland is worth more than its trade with China and Brazil combined, which demonstrates the scale of this.  We are a very important trading partner for the UK, even though we are much smaller.</p><p>On the food side, we export about &euro;5.5 billion worth of food and drink to the UK and we purchase about &euro;4.5 billion worth from the UK.  We need to be a little careful with this narrative of whether we could stop importing and produce more for ourselves.  We export over 80% of everything we produce in Ireland, not just food but manufacturing generally.  Our whole economy survives on being competitive but also being an exporter to Europe, the UK and other parts of the world.  We try to do it at the lowest carbon intensity we can, and I think we have set standards in regard to food, and dairy in particular, in terms of how we do that.  However, as to taking an approach that we should stop importing and do more at home, if other countries that import huge volumes of Irish product decided to do that, we would be in a difficult place fairly quickly.

We primarily buy varieties that do not grow very well here, what are called ware potatoes, which are very good for chips because of their sugar content.  We have not traditionally grown them here and we are potentially going to have to find alternative sources.  The other thing is that almost our entire stock of seed potatoes, which is, of course, hugely important for our entire industry, is imported from Scotland each year.  We may have to restructure our potato sector if we cannot get a negotiated agreement around sourcing from the UK.</p></speech>
