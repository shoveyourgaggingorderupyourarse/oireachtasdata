Amendments Nos. 1, 43 and 44 are related and will be discussed together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#A00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:  	&quot; 'Community Organisation' means an established, active and representative, residents organisation, based in the locality of the proposed development;&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 1 defines a community organisation, which is important to define because the term &quot;community organisations&quot; is mentioned in amendment No. 43.  I will speak to amendments Nos. 1 and 43 together.</p><p>Amendment No. 43 provides for community organisations to be consulted as part of the planning application process, as outlined in the Bill, which allows for developers to meet officials to discuss a development.  It is vitally important, especially in urban areas, that local community groups are aware of what is happening.  The amendment would go some way to short-circuit and prevent complaints about planning.  The natural opposition that most people have to this is that the amendment gives opposition a more open hand.  I believe that by being open and fully discussing matters with the people on whom the development would have an impact, they will know what the process involves and what is being discussed.  Amendment No. 43 would streamline this process.  </p><p>Amendment No. 43 is very long so I will not go into it in great detail.  The amendment outlines the process.  The amendment provides for community organisations to attend meetings and participate in meetings, which is very worthwhile.  The purpose of this legislation should be to involve the community as well as the developer because it is the community that will have to live with the development.  The amendment can only strengthen the process and the development.  A number of community groups have been involved in the consultation stage and made suggestions.  In fact, this amendment was put forward on behalf of one of them.  This amendment is worthwhile and should be given consideration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#A00800"><p>This legislation is quite significant.  Many Deputies will have spoken in the Chamber on the importance of this legislation, and how it effectively gives back to the local authorities by making them the first port of call for planning applications.</p><p>The strategic housing development, SHD, process deprived local communities of the opportunity to contribute to the planning process and gave them very limited recourse to appeal, a judicial review being the only option in many cases.  I thank the Minister for brining forward this legislation to bring an end to the SHD process.  It is crucial.  The previous Government relied far too much on the market for the types of homes that were delivered and on the belief that a fast-track process in itself would deliver homes.  That has proved not to be the case.  This is important legislation.  It will end the SHD process and ensure local communities have a voice in the planning process.</p><p> The Minister and I attended a community consultation with residents in Santry, it being a community that has seen significant development but that has had very little opportunity to contribute at the planning stage.  What was being provided was largely buy-to-let properties.  Those in the community wanted more housing to accommodate families with children and the people who lived in their community but what was delivered did not satisfy that.  I thank the Minister for coming to Santry to discuss these proposals with the community and talking through what this legislation would achieve. </p><p> The wording of my amendment differs slightly from amendment No. 43.  Amendment No. 43 seeks to include community organisations or representatives in the planning process.  A difficulty with that, with which other parties might also have a problem, is that it is difficult to define that.  My amendment seeks to use the structure known as the Public Participation Network, PPN, as one body that might be consulted.  There are different ways of consulting and involving the community.  If the Minister has a difficulty with some elements of my amendment, he might consider it and his officials might be able to improve on it.  Using both the PPN secretariat and the PPN itself would be one method of including the community at an early stage in the planning process without that in any way delaying the overall timelines.  We all know those timelines are very important.  It would not be my intention to delay the process in any way.  My amendment seeks to include communities, iron out problems early in the process and ensure communities have a voice and can contribute to the process, which the Minister have provided, at an early stage.  I thank him for that and ask him to consider the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendments.  As I did not get an opportunity to respond to the Second Stage debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il due to the time having elapsed, I want to put what we are doing here in context.  I welcome the broad agreement on the legislation.  It will reinstate the two-stage planning process and put planning decisions back in the hands of the local authorities, which is where they should be.  That is something in which I firmly believe.  These amendments relate to public participation.  Many residents felt they could not participate because applications were made directly to the board under the SHD process.  If people were not happy with that decision, while they had some input in a process through their councillors, which with I would not have been particularly happy, there was recourse to the courts through a judicial review.  We are reversing that now for these developments, and rightly so.  That means at the pre-application stage, on which I made amendments to the Bill in the Seanad, the records of a pre-application meeting with a developer must be kept and published, and the opinion on what is being asked for at the pre-application stage must also be kept and published with the file.  Resident and interest groups will get to make observations, and rightly so, on any planing application at the beginning of the planning process once the application is lodged.  A pre-application stage does not necessarily bring about an application.  We are also restoring democracy to planning at a local level, effectively, to make our planning system more efficient.  This is one of a number of measures the Government will bring forward.  This legislation will not merely stand on its own.</p><p>Effectively, we are restoring the input that we want people to have.  I accepted two amendments in the Seanad covering transparency of the pre-application process in order that people would know what has been discussed at pre-application stage, what has been agreed, what has been asked for and, furthermore, what opinion the local authority has given on the pre-application.  This is important and fundamental, and it is tied into the process.</p><p>We are ensuring people will be able to make observations to their local authority once an application is submitted, as should be normal in large-scale developments.  Furthermore, when any large-scale residential development, LRD, application is lodged, every elected member of that local authority will be advised, as a matter of course, and not on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, that an application and its reference number has been lodged and that it is in the planning process in order that local elected members are aware of what applications are in planning.  </p><p>I closely examined these amendments.  I wanted to give the overall context of what is being done under this legislation.  It appears the proposed amendment might have its origins in the initial process outlined in the general scheme.  It may also be that Deputies wish to amend the provisions in section 32(c) and (d) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 3.  However, as drafted, the amendment would technically provide for a further new consultation process, which could have quite significant impacts on timelines.  I do not think any of us want that.  </p><p>Deputy McAuliffe referenced a means of involving many different community groups.  The Deputy and myself met residents of Santry on the general issue covered in the Bill.  What residents wanted was a say in planning, and rightly so, and an end to the SHDs.  In this legislation we are restoring the primacy of development plans, local area plans and master plans.  Our planning must be plan-led and development-plan led.  Other contributions were made on Second Stage on ministerial guidelines.  I intend to examine that in the future and I take this opportunity to state that.  </p><p>However, in the context of this legislation and the fact we need to move forward on it and have the new legislation and regulations in place by 17 December, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.  Regarding the suggestion of how we might structure something around the PPN to make the process streamlined, I will examine that in more detail before Report Stage.  However, I cannot accept the amendments, as drafted.  I thank the Deputies for the time and effort they have put into tabling them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  I agree with him that residents want to have a say at the planning stage and the Bill grants them that.  Being aware of proposed developments at the pre-planning stage give residents more of an opportunity to be prepared for that process.  In particular, I ask the Minister to consider those sections that provide information at the pre-planning stage level.  Everyone would accept community organisations are not like a traffic department or a drainage department where they need to contribute in a technical manner but they should have an opportunity to at least have access to information early in the process.  Having access to such information would not in any way delay the process.  All it would do is arm them and perhaps clarify some of the issues they have in advance of the formal planning process.  Once the formal planning happens that conversation tends to be closed and the process moves on to a statutory level.</p> <p>  I appreciate the Minister's comment that he will consider including the PPN system, or notifications through the PPN system, on Report Stage.  Perhaps we can work on that between now and Report Stage.  I understand the timeline involved.  Nobody in my community wants the SHD process to be on books for any longer than it has to be.  I do not want to delay it through this amendment but I ask the Minister to consider doing whatever he can.  I appreciate his response.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#B00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with having community groups involved, especially where their members live in the area that would be directly affected by the development.  They will have to live with it long after the developer has left.  </p><p> As I understand it, this amendment was also taken as one of those put forward in the context of the original heads of the Bill issued by the Department.  Therefore, the Department must have considered at some stage as well.  That is important and for that reason, I will let my amendments stand.  We could address the matter on Report Stage if the Minister intends dealing with it then.  We can see what comes from forward in the meantime.  I am, however, leaving the amendments to stand as they are now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#C00200"><p>On what will be done before Report Stage, much of what the Deputies are looking for is in the various sections of the Bill already.  I fully support and want public involvement in our planning system.  That is why I am bringing SHDs to an end early and why I want to do that.  We will tease out this issue a bit further.  It is up to the Deputy whether he presses the amendment, and I fully respect that.  However, we will examine a mechanism that we could potentially bring forward on Report Stage, perhaps under regulations, whereby we could explore giving the public participation networks, PPNs, a role.</p> <p>  This aspect must be structured properly, though.  The definition of "Community Organisation" in the Deputy's first amendment is very broad.  What is it?  Do they have to be registered?  I have discussed this with Deputy McAuliffe previously.  If organisations are registered with the PPN, at least a formal channel would be in place.  It would mean that a group is not just set up as the "Thomas Pringle Group", for example, and then we could also have "The Provisional Eoin &Oacute; Broin Group", or something like that, where groups are just set up overnight.  I do not mean to be facetious.  However, we would need to have a structure, and potentially the PPN could be that structure.  As I said, I think we can do something in that regard by means of the regulations.  As we go through the Bill, the Deputy will see that we have vastly improved the input at the initial planning stage.  We are restoring that, and, equally, all the information concerning pre-applications must be published at the application stage.</p> <p>  Let us think about it this way.  Not every pre-application goes forward as a planning application.  When that does happen, all the records of those meetings and the opinions and information sought must be published with the formal application.  Therefore, there is full transparency, and rightly so.  Every time an application is lodged under the LRD process, every local authority member, namely, the councillors, must be advised as a matter of course.  We will see that as we move through the Bill.</p> <p>  As I said, it is up to the Deputy to decide whether he wishes to press his amendment.  We can come back to an element of this on Report Stage and we might be able to provide further clarification then.  I hope that is okay.</p></speech>

Our amendment would delete &quot;&ldquo;, or such other percentage as may be prescribed,&rdquo; because, as it stands, that phrase means that the 70% can become entirely meaningless.  It could be reduced to 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% or 10%.  That could happen, and it would then be possible to have a large-scale development with only a small percentage of residential units classified as an LRD.  The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to address that issue.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 relates to floor space not being used for residential or student accommodation, and states that &quot;a public consultation shall take place with individuals and community groups which the planning authority shall have due regard to in determinations of the granting of permissions for such floor space&rdquo;.  Again, this is to ensure that even if it is not 70%, this is to ensure that the 30%, for example, of floor space would not simply be a free-for-all regarding what goes there and, instead, that there be real community input, etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#C00600"><p>We are taking feedback from the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and other bodies, on this matter.  One of the big challenges we have concerns brownfield urban development sites.  It has been said to us clearly that the 15% limitation in this regard was restrictive.  We are looking at some larger developments which we want to have that desired mix of cr&egrave;ches, shops, launderettes and whatever else.  To achieve that outcome, 15% was far too restrictive.  Therefore, we are saying that we should go to 30% and allow that to be varied, as is deemed appropriate.</p> <p>  This is a positive move which speaks to the experience we have had of a lack of development on brownfield sites in our cities, in particular.  It is genuinely considered that this proposed amendment would limit our ability to respond to possible future external factors, which could affect the viability of sites with which we already have issues.  The ability to vary by regulation the percentage of the LRD floor space that comprises a development would allow the planning system to respond to changing conditions and circumstances in certain communities, depending, for example, on what facilities are required.  I genuinely do not foresee a situation where we are going to see what the Deputy suggested.  We need more people living in redeveloped brownfield sites in our cities, but we must have liveable communities with facilities.  </p> <p>  The Deputy referred to cases where the amount of floor space would be varied to below 50%.  That is not going to happen.  The 30% maximum other use threshold in the Bill, and that is where it is set, will allow the relevant local authority, and it is the local authority concerned and not the board, to decide, based on the local development plans, what is appropriate in a relevant area on a case-by-case basis.  It is important to remember that context as well.  We must allow that ability, and it would be far too prescriptive to do otherwise.  This process is about returning planning to those who should know best, namely, local planners and local authority members.</p> <p>  The whole purpose of this legislation is to bring the planning process back to the local area and to the planning officials who know the prevailing local conditions and circumstances best.  It is better for qualified planners to do that, and to be able to make that distinction as applications come in, rather than for us to be far too prescriptive and restrictive at a general level.  If we are to restore planning for these large-scale developments to a local level, as I am going to do, and involve planners who know the area and who must have regard to and will be following the local development plan into which local councillors will have input, as they should, there must be a level of flexibility to allow for those conditions.  </p> <p>  Housing developments of this scale need local supporting amenities.  I realise the Deputy is aware of that point.  Such developments require services and other facilities, and planning authorities must be able to ensure that they are provided for in LRD proposals.  Therefore, this change I am bringing forward is a positive one, and I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.  They are far too restrictive and on a one-size-fits-all basis.  Allowance must be made for a local ability to vary specifications and to make decisions on a local level.  I think it is appropriate to do that, but I thank Deputy Paul Murphy for the amendment.</p></speech>

The point is that this is the threshold by which developments can get in to this special LRD process.  If they do not get into this process, they still have to go through a regular planning process.  The point we are making is that it is appropriate to provide that to avail of this special planning process 70% of the development must be made up of residential units.  The Minister said he does not propose to bring it down to a particular level but, presumably, he will not be the Minister forever.  A future Minister may well decide to bring it down.  That is a problem.  </p><p> There is also the basic democratic point that a future Government could have a problem with the 70% and want to reduce it to 60%, which is fine, but the matter needs to be brought before the D&aacute;il for debate as opposed to the Minister, with the stroke of a pen, having the capacity to do that.  That is problematic.</p></speech>

Is there a potential here that if the 70% was to be varied, it could find itself in conflict with a city or county development plan's retail or enterprise strategy?  In such conflicts, which would take precedence?  Many of us are engaged in city and county development plan reviews.  For example, in Dublin Mid-West, which is my constituency, we are locating a lot of the new retail in the Clonburris strategic development zone.  We have set out very clear volumes for both residential and retail, amenity and public services.  I presume there is nothing in this provision which the Minister is defending that would in any way undermine, for example, percentages or floor space requirements that are in an SDZ or, more generally, in a local area plan or a county development plan.  I would be interested in his response on that.</p></speech>

I do not see the development plans that are being put together now right across the country and the mix within different zones, be that major town centre zones or mixed use zones, which is a matter for the local authorities, being in conflict.  This relates to future applications through the LRD process.  We would be saying that, at maximum, 30% of a use threshold would be that.  It would be 70% minimum residential.  The rest is varied within it.  We would not be going past that.</p> <p>  On Deputy Paul Murphy's point, any future Government could do anything with any legislation.  Equally, any member of the Opposition could also do that.  This is the best approach right now.  We are returning to the local authorities, and rightly so, decisions on these large important developments that most of us want to see delivered.  We want to see homes for our people and good planning and good developments that are affordable for people to buy to live in and to rent in.  That is what we want.  This is appropriate to where we are right now.  It is about future-proofing the process for new applications and getting this planning back to our local authorities.  That is why we want to have the new regulations up and running by 17 December.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 or 4.</p></speech>

Therefore, I would like us, as Deputies and a Minister, to ensure that the LRD is in line with development plans and does not materially contravene them.  This was a feature of the SHDs and it consequently led to many unsustainable developments, which were vehemently objected to by local residents and representatives.  This is still ongoing and costing communities a great deal of money and stress.  The idea behind this amendment - I have spoken about this in the Chamber as well - is to not allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to contravene the development plans that are in place.</p></speech>

One of the issues that has arisen is the very significant increase in judicial reviews of decisions by the board with respect to SHDs.  A large number of those judicial reviews have been won.  In 90% of the cases that were won, the developer materially contravened the city or county development plan and the board approved that permission.  The cause of that conflict was not so much the SHD, but the mandatory ministerial or section 28 guidelines, in respect of building heights and inferior design standards for rental apartments and, to a more recent extent, the misapplication of the planning objectives contained in the national planning framework, which are very high level, overarching planning objectives that, in a number of instances, have been used to make a decision by the board in direct contravention of new county development plans, which, in some cases, have the approval of the Planning Regulator.</p> <p>  The issue is that material contraventions should only be in exceptional circumstances.  More important, now that we have a new round of city and county development plans that have gone through the process with the Planning Regulator, the number of potential conflicts should be far lower than arose in the previous period.  My amendment is very specific.  It states that an application should not be accepted unless the applicant demonstrates what exceptional circumstances warrant its consideration and, to ensure that process is done in a legislatively appropriate way, I am giving the Minister of the day powers to set the regulations that would determine that.  Everybody here has had cases where the controversy at the centre of a development has been the breach of a development plan.  If the development should only be breached in exceptional circumstances, surely there should be a filter and, therefore, I see no reason an amendment either in the form of the wording I have provided, or some other version of it brought forward on Report Stage, could not be considered.</p></speech>

We discussed this issue at some length on Second Stage.  There was a great level of discussion on it in the Seanad as well.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 37 relate to the issue of material contraventions of a local development plan.  Again, the purpose of this legislation is to bring planning back to have regard to the development plans.  The making of development plans - Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Duffy and other Deputies know this as well as I do because some of us have served as councillors - is a statutory process undertaken by the local authority, which is a reserve function of the local councillors.  The development plan is made with the advice of the executive and must have regard to proper planning and sustainable developments in the area.  Most of our local authorities are currently engaged in the process of the next round of their development plans.  However, certain circumstances may arise in the making of a planning application for lands, including land banks of strategic importance, where particular considerations may arise either in documentation lodged with the planning authority in the submissions received from elected representatives, members of the public or other committees, that require determination and may require planning permission to be considered, which would result in a material contravention of a development plan. This would be to ensure a sustainable or other appropriate form of development on lands the development plan or a local area plan may not have considered.  This is not like SHDs in that sense either, which brings me to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point.</p><p>He is right.  The reason many of these judicial reviews were taken is that there was no process at local level to identify where those issues were.  They were going straight to the board.  There were some quite infamous cases in which the board granted decisions having no regard whatsoever to development plans or local area plans.  There is a process set out in this Bill through which planning authorities must go if they are to undertake material contraventions of the development plan.  This may include the development of large-scale residential developments, as proposed in this Bill.  While the need for material contraventions has arisen recently in response to inconsistencies between adopted development plans, local area plans and, indeed, national policy including ministerial guidelines, the current programme of review of draft development plans being undertaken by councils, with the oversight of the Office of the Planning Regulator, which is important, will ensure that statutory local plans will comply with national and regional plans, in addition to relevant ministerial guidelines, some of which I will be reviewing, as I said earlier on.  This should reduce the need for material contraventions of development plans in future in the case of specific planning applications, and I believe it will.</p><p> Let us remember what the process is now.  Contraventions of the development plans, where required, are still a reserved function.  A very high threshold must be met.  No less than three quarters of the elected members must vote in favour of any such resolution.  This is considered a safeguard that provides for input into the process through the public consultation in addition to oversight by the elected members of the local authority.  The Planning and Development Act provides for appropriate consideration of all planning applications, including proposals for large-scale developments, as outlined in this legislation, with oversight and direction from elected members.  I do not consider it appropriate to remove the provision on material contraventions within the planning legislation.  Perhaps that was not the intent of the amendments but this would reduce the options for consideration of proposals which may be in the interests of proper planning and the sustainable development of a given area, on very rare occasions.  These proposals would obviously be subject to scrutiny and, rightly, the approval of the elected members.</p><p> Furthermore, clear direction is given to the board in section 37(2)(b) of the 2000 Act, as amended, on the circumstances in which the refusal of a planning application by a local authority for reasons of material contravention can be considered.  Such circumstances include situations where a proposal is of strategic or national importance, where there are conflicting objectives in the development plan, where ministerial planning guidelines, strategies or policy directives are required to be taken into account or where the pattern of development in the area is to be considered.  The board is therefore restricted to considering particular parameters in this matter.  Outright restriction of the board's ability to consider material contravention of a development plan for a large-scale residential development would potentially be counterproductive for significant housing developments, in particular where such proposals would be in the interest of overall proper planning or sustainable development in a given area.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 3, 9 and 37.</p></speech>

It asserts what is already in the Planning and Development Act, as amended, that is, that such requests to materially contravene development plans should only be made in exceptional circumstances.  It goes on to say that, other than in circumstances set out in regulations by the Minister, applicants would have to justify in their application why they are seeking to breach the city or county development plan.  The problem is that even though material contraventions are meant to be exceptional, not only have we had a litany of SHD applications that have breached development plans but they have been approved by the board.  These were then challenged and overturned in the courts.  Despite the fact that the courts overturned these applications, the board continued to approve other proposals for SHDs that included material contraventions of development plans.  This amendment aims to reassert the exceptional nature of such contraventions.  It gives the Minister the latitude to set out in regulations the circumstances in which these may be justified.  The fewer legal challenges there are to decisions, the faster planning permissions get through and homes built.  Therefore, if we introduce this additional check where the applicant will have to justify proposals for material contraventions of development plans with regard to regulations set out by the Ministers, the likelihood of judicial reviews being taken and decisions being struck down will be reduced.  It would therefore speed up and improve the planning process, thereby delivering much-needed homes.</p></speech>

They normally go beyond what development plans say can be done to see what they can get permission for.  That makes this difficult.  I will mention two recent examples of problems.  In rural areas, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has given permission to developers to build large developments in areas where there are no transport facilities for school and so on.  The other issue is that, while county councils may object to developments, they have already been objecting to SHDs but An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been ignoring them.  That is concerning.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's recent track record has been one of just giving permissions.  It may then follow that a local authority may refuse a planning application on whatever grounds only for it to be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which will rubber-stamp it and say it is fine.  That is an issue and we need to keep our eye on it.</p></speech>

Anyone can make an application for anything.  Our process will involve a pre-application stage.  Applicants coming in will have to go through the pre-application stage.  A local authority may point out a contravention of the development plan in the applications and say it does not want that.  If the application came through and the local authority, rather than the board, granted it, the elected members would still need to vote to contravene the development plan.  I take Deputy Duffy's point.  I have not been talking about any specific planning decision but I take the Deputy's point regarding some of the decisions An Bord Plean&aacute;la has made with regard to SHDs.  However, where a council has let it be known that it disapproves of an application, this has only happened through a consultative process by way of a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  These provisions are much stronger.  In the instance of an application for a large-scale residential development going through this process, the planners would have to agree to bring any contravention of the development plan to the members for a vote.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about exceptional circumstances.  How do we define such circumstances?  I take it that Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment No. 9 relates to the local authority planning system rather than the board.  There are existing provisions.  They refer to exceptional circumstances.  I have tried to outline what some such circumstance might be in my initial response but we cannot accept amendments Nos. 3, 9 or 37.</p></speech>

The problem is, as we saw with the SHD process - and this speaks to Deputy Duffy's point - a much higher number of material contraventions were sought, granted and then overturned in the courts.  If a local authority planning department approves a planning application that materially contravenes the county development plan, there is no requirement for a vote by the elected members.  People appeal such decisions to the board, which decides whether to proceed with them.  We need to weed out those applications involving a material contravention, excluding those that the Minister, with the good guidance of his officials and, I suspect, some advice from the Irish Planning Institute and others, would frame by way of regulations.</p><p>Otherwise, Deputy Duffy is correct.  Certain categories of developers will always seek to push the boundaries beyond the development plan.</p><p> I am also alerting the Minister to the fact we already have a problem whereby the board is looking at high-level policy objectives, for example, with respect to compact growth, and approving planning applications that are in clear contravention of city and county development plans, even where it is clear the city and county development plan is compliant with the housing needs demand assessment provided by the Minister or the more granular application of the high-level planning objectives in the national planning framework.</p><p> I acknowledge he will not accept the amendment, so I will not labour the point.  I urge him to consider how we can weed out planning applications to this new process that materially contravene the development plan where that is clearly not appropriate.  I ask him to talk to his officials about the issue before Report Stage and I reserve the right to return to the issue then.</p></speech>

I take the points the Deputies made.  I firmly believe the reality of bringing forward this process will both reduce the volume of judicial reviews residents have felt they have had to take because they had no other option, given they were not a part of the normal two-stage planning process, and ensure that where applications are made that materially contravene the development plan, our pre-application stage will be much stronger, and I think the process has a role in that regard.  We will nonetheless examine the matter before Report Stage next week.</p></speech>

Deputies across the Chamber, both Government and Opposition, highlighted many of the difficulties with the scale and nature of large-scale developments under the SHD process, many of which are subject to judicial review and eventually overturned.  There seemed to be a sense from Members that this legislation, in and of itself, will resolve that problem but, unfortunately, it will not.  The reason is that a number of significant changes made by the previous Government, in parallel with the SHD process, will remain in place.  It is worthwhile considering these because, if we do not deal with them now, we will have to return to them at a future stage, just as we had to come back and deal with SHD.</p><p>As members will know, when Deputy Kelly was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the dying days of the most recent Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, he passed legislation making very significant changes to planning law that allowed a Minister, without any vote of the Oireachtas or local authority, to make substantial changes to planning law by way of decree.  There could, of course, be a consultation but, ultimately, it was within the gift of the Minister.  Previously, ministerial guidelines were made by way of advice and major planning policy was made by legislation or city and county development plans.  I have no objection to a Minister or a Government wanting to set standards and have consistency.  My view is that if they do that, they should have the approval of the Oireachtas and that, therefore, there should be a vote and not a unilateral declaration.</p><p>The mandatory ministerial, or section 28, guidelines have been used only twice, as most members will know, both times by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy.  One time related to building heights, removing the ability of a local authority in a city and county development plan to have any height restrictions.  I am absolutely not against height in appropriate locations, but I believe the city and county development plan is the best place to have those discussions.  More controversially, the then Minister introduced a two-tier system of design standards for apartments, where the original 2015 guidelines by the Department, which are very respectable in my view, apply to build-to-purchase apartments, and an inferior set of design standards was put in place as an option for build-to-rent.  Some build-to-rent, because it is higher end, sticks to the better standards but most do not.  That means renters get less natural light, less storage and a higher volume of student apartments in the development, and a higher number of apartments is permissible to core-shaft, whether that is a lift or a stairwell.</p><p>The problem is the national planning framework rightly wants compact growth, with far more people to live in our urban centres with greater densities, which means greater levels of apartment living, yet it is virtually impossible to buy an apartment in our urban centres, particularly in Dublin, because of the astronomically high development costs.  That means that if we want people to live in the urban centres, particularly Dublin centre, they have to be able to rent, yet we are saying they should accept lower design standards.  That is completely contrary to the national planning framework.  I know that many members of the Minister's party share the concerns I and others have about that two-tier set of standards.</p><p>These amendments will remove the ability of a Minister to introduce mandatory ministerial guidelines in the manner Deputy Kelly introduced them.  Such changes should be made only with the democratic imprimatur of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendments will also repeal both sets of mandatory ministerial guidelines introduced by Eoghan Murphy.  We tabled legislation on this previously and had a debate, where Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party opposed that legislation.  If we do not improve the design standards for rental apartments, which we need more of in order that people can live and rent in the urban centres, and if we do not deal with the issue of heights and what the best way to determine heights and densities is, something on which we are still waiting for the Department's guidelines for local authorities, we will have the same problems, even within the large-scale residential development process, which will lead to more judicial reviews at the latter end, something most of us would prefer not to see.  We want to see the best planning decisions made by the local authorities, with people on either side having the right to appeal to the board.</p><p>I urge members to consider getting rid of these regressive changes introduced by Eoghan Murphy and Deputy Kelly, in both the previous Government and the Government before it.  Let us do exactly what the Minister said he wants to do, although he will not do it fully if he does not support these amendments, namely, return the power to the local authorities and the development plan process to make those decisions in line with the national planning framework and the work of the Planning Regulator.  Let us remove these draconian, unilateral changes to planning law by any Minister, which have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever and should not be part of our planning code.</p></speech>

To promote more sustainable living, develop better infrastructure and public transport, meet our climate change targets and create more vibrant cities and urban centres, we need more density, but how we do that needs to be realistic and should be decided locally.  On Second Stage, I gave the Minister some examples from my constituency of where quite excessive planning permissions have been granted under the SHD process, which has resulted in areas that should be developed and built on and have homes delivered being considered unviable at present and possibly unviable for years to come.  Rather than this having facilitated the delivery of homes, it has been holding that up.</p><p>Amendment No. 51 seeks to remove the ability of any Minister to undermine planning guidelines set at development plan or local authority level through those mandatory section 28 guidelines.  It is welcome that the Minister said beforehand that this needs to be addressed.  It should be done now with our amendments rather than delayed.  There has been a lot of discussion in local communities about the problems of the SHD process.  While the problem is known as the SHD process, the actual SHD legislation is just a part of it.  Another part is the section 28 ministerial guidelines.  Putting initial decision-making back with local authorities is very welcome but leaving these guidelines in place will lead to more problems and conflicts.  The quicker we can address and correct this and bring it back to the way it was, the less conflict we will have through the planning process and we will also have more realistic and more viable planning permissions that can then be developed.  This is a key problem.  There has been a rake of speculative planning permissions and increased land values but this does not lead to homes being delivered because we are looking at densities and heights that simply cannot be supported.  Where they can be supported, it is only through the investment fund build to rent model, which is skewing the level and type of supply in certain areas without bringing about the kind of mix all of us would be supportive of.</p></speech>

In my locality, areas we want to see developed for height and are identified for height have not seen that investment but areas where the city would not have preferred that height because it wanted to concentrate it in a certain area have seen development.  Any height strategy encourages height in some areas and discourages it in others.  Previous Ministers have taken that ability to have a strategy away from us.  My only concern with the proposed wordings from both Deputies is that they might also limit the Minister's powers to bring in positive measures.  The Minister recently stepped in to prevent student accommodation being converted into tourist or hotel-type accommodation and also stepped in with regard to co-living.  I wonder whether in trying to seek this change, we are also removing the power of the Minister to take positive steps.  I appreciate that local authorities are the places for these types of decisions but there are times when local authorities get things wrong.  I would not like to see us completely remove the power of the Minister if we want him to make positive decisions such as that on student accommodation, which was taken earlier this year.</p></speech>

Let us take a small step back.  What we have done as a Government so far - in fairness, with the co-operation of the Opposition in support of most of these measures - is ban co-living.  We are getting rid of SHDs and restoring planning to local level and rightly so.  We are restoring local democracy according to commitments we made in the programme for Government that we are seeing through.  There is a real point in what Deputy McAuliffe said.  I do not dispute some of the issues that have been raised here and as part of the planning review that is under way about some of the issues around this but I think most people would understand that we need a consistent approach to policy areas such as student accommodation, co-living and other positive measures we may make.  If we remove the legislative provision to empower a Minister to ensure a nationally consistent approach to planning in all 31 local authorities, the three regional assemblies and An Bord Plean&aacute;la when we are implementing national planning policy, it would be very problematic.  I agree with some, though not all, of the points that have been made.  One of the amendments would repeal and delete the ministerial planning guidelines, which is in direct conflict with my statutory role as Minister.  I genuinely believe that while the views put forward are well held and well made, this is the wrong place and time to do it.  It needs to be more considered than what we would be doing by literally deleting a statutory power any Minister would have to ensure there is consistency in planning approach.  I take it that neither Deputy would want that to happen or none of the three so-----</p></speech>

The reason I say that is because the strategic housing development planning process and the section 28 ministerial guidelines on heights and design standards are a package and it is the interaction of that package that has caused so much conflict and led to so many judicial reviews and decisions by the board being overturned.  One cannot treat them separately.  I agree with the Minister that we need very careful consideration of these matters but that is what this session is for.</p> <p>  Also, the Minister is incorrect in his characterisation of the first of the amendments.  I absolutely believe a Minister should have the authority to bring forward proposals that try to achieve a consistency of planning across local authorities.  The difficulty I have with the current legislative framework is the Minister can do that without the vote of the Oireachtas.  If a Minister wants to make profound changes to planning law and to significantly restrict the scope of action of local authorities in their city and county development plans, he or she should, of course, have the right to do so but it should be voted on.  In fact, I suspect if the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines had had to go to a vote of the Oireachtas in 2018 we would not necessarily be in the mess that we are in today because there would have been far greater scrutiny of those guidelines, particularly with respect not only to co-living but also to the inferior design standards for built-to-rent.  In fact, this is crucial.</p> <p>  I also want to agree with Deputy McAuliffe.  Something that frustrates me about the debate about heights is that those of us who opposed former Minister Eoghan Murphy's mandatory ministerial guidelines on the issue are wrongly described as being against height.  The Dublin City Council development plan identified 11 separate locations where high-rise buildings were permitted.  The issue, however, is that where high-rise buildings are built should be subject to a deliberative, consultative process and a democratic agreement in the city and county development plan.  Deputy Higgins knows well, for example, from some of the challenges in the Clonburris strategic development zone, SDZ , that issue of what was the most appropriate height in proximity to the train stations was a very significant matter of public concern.  Ultimately, a democratic process by the local authority, and then finally decided by the board, was the way that was done.  That is much better than a ministerial guideline and it is important to stress that.</p> <p>  I would also say that much of the debate around heights is misplaced because the real debate is about density.  If we want to increase the density of our city, we have to decide the best way to do that.  In fact, high-rise buildings are not the optimum way to achieve density.  Mid-rise, mixed-use developments achieve far greater levels of density.  In fact, you can even get density at low rise.  It is concerning that the local authorities still do not have the guidance on densities despite the fact that they are at an advanced stage in the development plan.  I do not accept the Minister's responses to the amendments.</p> <p>  I also think Deputy McAuliffe is a little mistaken.</p><p>There is nothing in these amendments that would have prevented, or could prevent in the future, the Minister issuing the kind of circular he issued recently about the change of use for student accommodation.  That would still be permissible.  This is about profound changes to planning law being made by a Minister without a democratic mandate.  That should be removed, as should the two sets of guidelines.  I will be pressing the amendments.</p></speech>

I know the Minister cannot tell us exactly but it would be useful to have an indication.</p> <p>  Some good points have been made about how to achieve better density and that is not all about the height of buildings.  I have been flagging the point that some of the heights and density that have been achieved through planning applications for strategic housing developments have led to unviable planning permissions and areas not being built out.  An issue related to that has occurred in many of the larger areas zoned for development that have been earmarked to produce more housing and higher density, and which have been partially developed.  I am talking about areas that were zoned and on which development started before the crash of the Celtic tiger.  As a way to kick-start development after the crash, many planning authorities indicated they would allow lower density, two-storey development on part of these lands which initially had been earmarked for duplexes and three-storey, four-storey or five-storey buildings.  To compensate for that lower density and lower rise in some areas, the planning authorities stated they would allow for much higher rise and higher density in other, more concentrated areas.  The easier areas to build out have been built out at this stage.  The remaining lands that were earmarked for higher rise and higher density development are now these strategic housing development applications, which are effectively unviable and for which there is not demand.  That issue needs to be grasped and dealt with.  The best place for that to be tackled is at a local authority level, both for the reasons Deputy &Oacute; Broin was talking about in terms of the democratic process required but also because each area is different.  Each area needs to use local knowledge and involve planners in that.  The more we can involve the forward-planning sections in local authorities on this and the less that is done centrally, the better the outcomes will be.  Those matters go hand in hand.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister in terms of timelines.</p></speech>

Many points have been made and I disagree with some.  It is the wrong place to be making drastic decisions such as those suggested.</p> <p>  The planning review is under way.  A significant review of all aspects of planning is being undertaken and we intend to conclude that by next September.  It is a sizeable piece of work that would usually take three to five years.  It is an extensive review.  I expect the work to be concluded by the end of September and the report will probably be published by the end of next year.  It is an extensive review.  The committee will have an important role in that regard.</p> <p>  The whole thing is about having a plan-led approach.  That is what we want and one of the issues with a lot of residences is that plans have not been abided by.  When we are setting zonings, development plans and master plans, we have, in some instances, not been prescriptive or descriptive enough about what is due to happen in each area, what heights and density are required.  Much of the time, residents will only find out when there is a planning application and it comes as a big surprise.  That should not happen.  We must change the way we are doing things so it is master plan-led and communities understand what is planned to happen.  I will add nothing further.  We have had a good discussion.  I will not be accepting these amendments.  I hope I have answered Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's question.</p></speech>

While I appreciate that aim, we have consulted with the Office of the Attorney General on the amendments and it advises that the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; are both plural form, so their inclusion in the text of the Bill as proposed would have an impact on the interpretation of the legislation.</p><p>I have a suggestion, though.  The Interpretation Act 2005 guarantees that any reference importing the feminine gender also imports the masculine gender, and <i>vice versa</i>.  I have approached the Attorney General about this matter specifically.  In the circumstances, the correct approach would be to amend the Interpretation Act.  That does not fall under my remit but we could get the Deputy some advice on the matter.  It is unquestionably an important issue, but &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; are plural form in this Bill and if we were to include them as the Deputy has requested, it would create an issue for the Bill's interpretation.  To change that interpretation, we would need to amend the 2005 Act, which would then be reflected in the legislation.  Due to this technical interpretation, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

We need more disability accessible housing.  We have a similar logic in a number of our amendments and in some we intend to add.  The developers here are getting a special pass.  We are sceptical about whether we need a special process for them at all, now that we are getting rid of the strategic housing developments, SHDs.  They should just have to go through the normal planning process.  We do not really see why they should get a special process of their own.  Given that a special process is being established for these large-scale residential developments, there should be a <i>quid pro quo</i>, one of which being that the housing delivered under it will be universally accessible to people with disabilities and that it will be to the highest environmental standards.  We have not submitted an amendment on this at this stage, but will be saying there should be a higher proportion of social and affordable housing.  There needs to be strings attached to getting a special process, which are about meeting social and environmental objectives, the first of which is around universal design.</p></speech>

These were discussed in great detail in the Seanad.  There is no question but that all of us want to ensure we have adapted housing and universal design in housing for those with disabilities and we are certainly moving towards it.  I have a different point of view from the Deputy.  This is not a special planning process.  It is the normal planning process with strict timelines around delivery, because we need homes.  It is bringing them back to the local authorities.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 11 relates to the considerations around universal design obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I explained this at length.  These matters are more appropriate to building control and standards legislation, rather than planning legislation.  It is important we have good and exacting standards in the local authorities and we are getting much better, but we need to produce much more.  People with disabilities spend much more time on the social housing waiting list than those on housing lists without special needs and that is why we are bringing forward a special plan for disability housing.  Amendment No. 11 is really around building regulations and standards and is not appropriate to this legislation.</p> <p>  The same argument goes for amendment No. 12.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 contains a number of actions aimed at promoting low-carbon construction.  We have the climate budget as well, so we are obliged to do that by law and will do so.  Amendment No. 12 is more relevant to building regulations and construction waste standards than to planning legislation.  It is already being addressed within the climate action plan.  That is not taking away from the reason, thrust or meaning in putting forward these amendments.  I fully understand that.  We all want to go to the same place on this and we are doing that.  However, these two amendments are not appropriate to this legislation and I cannot accept them.</p></speech>

I dispute that this is not a special planning process.  There is access for the planners to meetings in advance of large-scale developments.  We will be discussing later how they consume significant resources, about which local authorities are concerned.  Staffing resources and so on that the local authorities do not have will be consumed to facilitate large-scale developments.  I do not see any reason they should not just go through the process under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  It is a special process and they will have access to the planners in advance, to try to get their development through in a contracted timeframe.  Given that, I want strings attached.  Frankly, I want strings attached to all development to ensure it is meeting social and environmental objectives.  We need more of that.</p><p>If there is a new process being established, it should guarantee equality for people with disabilities that we are required to deliver under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  It should guarantee that it will significantly contribute to meeting our climate objectives and energy efficiency targets that will benefit the inhabitants of these residences with lower energy bills and so on.  This should be tied to any planning process but in particular to large-scale planning and development proposals and especially where they get a bespoke process for the large-scale developments.</p><p> I need to get something on the record in case I have to fly to the debate on the Finance Bill and try to bilocate.  There should be a greater obligation for social and affordable housing and student affordability in accommodation.  Why else would we give them special treatment?</p></speech>

The Minister has made his position on the amendment clear but I ask him to progress the upcoming review of Part M of the building guidelines as a matter of urgency to improve the level of universal design within our building system overall.  He might pay particular attention to the very strong advocacy of the Irish Wheelchair Association, which rightly highlights that current universal design under Part M does not include wheelchair livability within properties and they only deal with accessibility.  Therefore, Part M must be reformed to ensure people who are residing in a house with a wheelchair would have full access to all basic amenities in the house.  That is key, so will the Minister give an undertaking to look at this with his officials, particularly with the upcoming revised disability housing strategy that is due for publication later this month?</p></speech>

It is a sensible suggestion from the Deputy but the disability housing strategy is due to be published and much work has gone into it.  It is something we are all serious about.  There have been improvements over the years but we must go further and step it up, looking at areas for specific targets for different local authorities.  There is a disability housing group set up in each local authority and it is right that they are in place.  I can give a commitment that this is happening.  With regard to where amendments Nos. 11 and 12 would sit in the legislation, I have not changed my position.  I cannot accept them.</p></speech>

This is not to dump on the Deputy's amendment but the provision means a statement must indicate how the project is consistent with the development plan and any measures within that plan.  I think we are covered so on that basis I will not include the amendment.  I accepted two Opposition amendments in the Seanad.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 15 seeks that information on pre-planning should be published online not when an application goes in but within a number of days of the local authority receiving it.  That is important for the pre-planning stage to work well, and there must be some engagement with the local community.  Some of the information and knowledge from the local community that is important in larger planning applications should be brought into the process at that stage.  Often with a large site or development, the local community has knowledge of it that the planners in the council may not.  The developer or its consultants may not have the knowledge either.  Sometimes this relates to water courses or potential landslides, for example.  There are many issues on which a local community may have knowledge and the developer or the local authority may not.  These are not matters of detailed design, as would be dealt with in the main process, but they are overarching questions that should be addressed at a pre-planning stage.  If there is no ability for a local community to know pre-planning is ongoing, how on Earth would it be able to raise any big, overarching or strategic matters at that point if, effectively, it is a secret or non-public process?  That is amendment No. 15.</p><p>Other amendments are in a similar vein.  Amendment No. 18 allows for public and not just community organisations to make submissions at a pre-planning stage.  Amendment No. 22 would make sure the minutes of pre-planning were online within a number of days of the process being concluded and not just when the application goes in.  Again, that is for reasons of transparency.</p><p>Amendment No. 26 states that the LRD opinion should be published online within five days of it being issued.  I have even provided an alternative solution to that in amendment No. 27 in case the Minister does not like my suggestion of the wording around five days.  Amendment No. 27 is a direct alternative to amendment No. 26.  </p><p> Amendment No. 17 should be particularly easy for the Minister to agree to.  It simply specifies that a planning authority or local authority may consult with community organisations as well as people, who are specified but not mandated in the amendment.  That is a particularly easy one to agree with.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin has tabled amendment No. 30.  Does he wish to speak to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#T00500"><p>Yes.  I also support Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments.  On a number of occasions, the Minister has said that he wants to move towards a plan-led approach to planning.  I completely agree with him on that.  However, there is not a wild lot of plan-making in this Bill beyond what is already available.  That is not a criticism of the Bill.  It is just not what this Bill does and, therefore, there will be occasions when large-scale planning applications come in without a plan, bar the city or county development plan, and the community will have, especially at the pre-planning stage, no involvement whatsoever.  I have not been in any way prescriptive in this amendment.  It is trying to establish the principle that some form of public participation in the pre-planning process is required and that the Minister and his officials will, by way of regulation, set out how that would operate.</p> <p>  The key principle is that the earlier we involve third parties in the wider community in the process, the better the planning outcomes will be for everybody because people will have a sense of ownership.  The Minister knows as well as I do that even in the best-case scenario, the two-stage planning process that is being reintroduced here, which I support, will still have an adversarial element to it.  An applicant puts in a planning application and third parties put in opinions, sometimes to amend and sometimes to object, but it often becomes a zero-sum game.  When planning becomes a zero-sum game everybody ultimately loses, whereas if there are occasions where communities are brought in before the formal application and statutory process, interesting things can happen.  We have seen that, for example, in aspects of the strategic development zone process and Part 8.  I urge the Minister not to say "No" to public participation during pre-planning.</p> <p>  I know he will not accept the amendment but I ask him to consider, between now and Report Stage, whether there are some mechanisms for involvement, particularly when a pre-planning process is clearly moving in the direction of a full plan.  That might identify some issues or problems through third party observations from environmental NGOs, other interested groups, such as heritage groups, or residents, which could alert the applicant and local authority at the pre-planning stage of something that could be ironed out then, rather becoming a matter of dispute or contention in a formal planning process.  There is merit in public participation at the pre-planning stage.</p> <p>  I have deliberately not been prescriptive.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment, I urge him to at least consider the proposition and come back on Report Stage with some thoughts on it.  This is not only about improving the process but removing the conflict and contention, and improving the level of dialogue and consensus, so we get better quality outcomes and less likelihood of appeals or judicial reviews because of potentially poor planning decisions that simply did not have full visibility of all the issues, which third-party participation might resolve.</p></speech>

If it is accepted, it will delete the lines that prohibit a local authority from only making records available at the point a planning application goes in.  It allows local authorities to do that.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point Deputy &Oacute; Broin made.  Some of my amendments are prescriptive.  If the Minister wants to look at the issue separate to that, it is perfectly fine with me.  It is about the principle of seeing whether there is a practical way to get some input in at that early stage.  That could be useful.  In particular, at the very least, allowing a local authority to seek those opinions by specifically mentioning community organisations, not just people, is a minimal approach to it.  We should go further than that.</p></speech>

They are not just an individual house or small development but will comprise 100 or 200 units, depending on whether they are residential or student, and will have a big impact on areas.  If they are going to work and not negatively impact on a community or get a hostile reaction, and be a good development that will add to any area, we need to consult with all the people who are likely to be impacted to get their input and expertise.  We need to give people advance notice so we get the best development we possibly can that will meet the objectives not just of developers but of the locality and its need for quality, affordable and accessible housing, which meets the best environmental standards and so on and so forth.  It is critically important, at the earliest possible stage, to engage with people.  It is against the backdrop of the public always feeling they are last to know about developments and that stuff is hatched behind the scenes and then unleashed on them.  This amendment outlines a way of preventing and pre-empting that and involving all the relevant stakeholders at the earliest stage.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 19 specifically refers to student accommodation and the need, in addition to generally consulting with stakeholders, community groups, residents' groups, councillors and so on, to engage with student unions and third-level educational institutions in an area, in order to get input from them as to whether a development will meet the needs of students.</p> <p>  We also believe the LRD opinion should be published on a website so everybody can see it and interrogate it.  That is what we are proposing.  I am confident the Minister will take all that on board.</p></speech>

I broadly agree with the other Deputies on these amendments.  To ensure an inclusive and transparent planning process, we believe that the LRD opinion, and the application documents, should be made available to the public on the planning authority's website within three days of the provision of the LRD opinion.  I am not sure where that is going at the moment, but in the interests of transparency those documents should already be live.  I do not see why they could not be made public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#T01600"><p>I will respond to all the amendments together as they are related.  Again, the context of this is that planning is being brought back to local authorities.  We know that.  On the pre-planning stage, section 32B(4), which is in section 3 of the Bill, provides that: "The planning authority may, prior to the LRD meeting taking place, consult with any person who may, in the opinion of the planning authority, have information that is relevant for the purposes of the LRD meeting in relation to a proposed development".</p><p>In broad terms, that gives the planning authority the power to seek other inputs at pre-application stage.  The important thing is that we want transparency.  How will we make sure there is transparency in the pre-application?  All pre-application notes, opinions and what is being sought, once an application is made, have to be published.  I made that change in the Seanad.  The information will be published, but only when the application is made.  Why is that?  Many people want to know what is happening in their areas, and I do too.  I will give the example of the strategic housing development, SHD, because it is the best data that we have.  There are 553 pre-application consultations under the SHD.  Of those, only 374 applications came about so 179 did not proceed.  By doing what I understand people are looking for, we would potentially publish much information about applications that will never happen.  It is best that when an application is lodged, the pre-application information must be published online, because it is live and we want to make sure people do not mix up the pre-application stage up with the application stage.</p><p> What I do not want to happen - and I genuinely mean this - is that people see the pre-application as important for dealing with issues.  At the pre-application, the council can seek stakeholders to come in if they so wish.  This is to try to make sure that we have good applications or to act as a filter and say, &ldquo;That is not appropriate, we do not agree, go away&rdquo;.  In those instances, subject to these types of amendments being as broad as they are, we would have to publish all of that information.  There could be numerous pre-application meetings on the same application that will never go anywhere.  It is most important to get the process right, so that when a development gets to application stage, people will know what will happen and what has been discussed at pre-application stage.</p><p> We should also remember, and this goes to the point about the involvement of the elected representatives, that every councillor in the area will automatically be told about every LRD application that is lodged by the local authority.  They will not just be told by way of planning lists, which can be sporadic insofar as some local authorities are better at issuing them than others.  Some do not issue them.  This will be tied into the legislation and it must happen.  We will publish it and I believe we should.  There should be transparency.  I also believe we should publish the right information when it is relevant.  We should make sure that the general public does not mistake the pre-application stage for the application stage and say, &ldquo;Well I've already had my say there and I'm not putting in my observations&rdquo;.</p><p> I understand what the members are getting at.  We have greatly improved the transparency piece.  Based on the data that I have, and it is probably the most comparable, 553 pre-application consultations were made, there were 374 applications and 179 did not go anywhere.  In some of the bigger local authorities, there would many people having pre-application meetings and publishing data that is not relevant to anyone.  The data becomes relevant when it goes in for application.  It is then that the information will have to be published.</p><p> Section 32B(4) allows for a consultation with stakeholders at a pre-application stage.  We have to remember why we are trying to do this.  We want a transparent, streamlined and efficient planning process.  We need good homes for people and members all know that.  Much of what is being looked for in that group of amendments is in this legislation already.  I cannot accept any of these amendments.</p></speech>

I know I am not going to convince him to change his mind.  I would like to just press the value of involvement in pre-planning for him to consider.  A site in Clondalkin many years ago had been subject to controversial Celtic tiger-era planning applications.  The site was eventually sold to a new developer.  That developer wanted to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent before they went to formal planning application, they listened the views of the local community to see if they could incorporate them into the plan.  An informal pre-planning consultation took place.  It was not statutory.  It was by the developer in the community centre who met with local residents to say, &ldquo;Look folks, this is what I am thinking" and asking for their views.  There was an interesting exchange.  All of the councillors from the area attended without holding a prejudiced view towards the development.  Significantly, the developer listened to the opinions of the local community and incorporated their opinions to the best of their ability in the formal planning application.  That dramatically reduced the level concern and hostility from residents in the immediate vicinity towards development.  There were virtually no third-party opinions in an area where there had been a controversial planning history.  Planning was approved and there was virtually no conflict.  That is a good principle.</p> <p>  Again, I know the Minister will not accept the amendments.  All I would ask him to do is, in the same way as with the strategic development zone on that macro scale, that we have significant consultation, well before the formal planning process.  There is a merit in trying to do something not too dissimilar with large-scale residential developments.  I urge the Minister to have a think about it.  There is value when communities are involved early, before the zero-sum game on whether they are for or against a planning application.  That can create interesting outcomes that improve the application, reduce the conflict and ensure everybody gets a better outcome.  I know we will not convince the Minister today, but I ask him to please consider the issue, engage with the Irish Planning Institute and other officials, as well as with his Department.  This could greatly enhance the process and reduce a level of conflict that causes great difficulty for applicants, third parties and for the planning authorities themselves.  There are ways of resolving some of that in the pre-planning stage.</p></speech>

I can think of one where there was much knowledge in the local community about landslides in the area and about watercourses.  The developer and the planning authority did not pick up on these.  They were not in the pre-planning process that took place.  It all resulted in the developer not getting a successful planning application through.  To date, homes have not been delivered on that site.  However, if there had been good engagement with the local community at a pre-planning stage, it could have been a much better outcome for all involved, for the local community, for the developer and for the people who could be living in those homes now.  There is a huge value to this.</p> <p>  There is also the element that pre-planning takes up public resources.  Given that it takes up public resources, why then should there not be a wider benefit of those public resources?  The information and the lessons from the pre-planning stage should be made available and published online, whether or not this goes to a formal planning process thereafter.  Indeed, that information in terms of learning in a local community would be useful.  It would also be useful for other potential applicants in that area in that they would be able to see some of the key infrastructure issues that came up at pre-planning stage.  For somebody making an application themselves, it will be for a site that they own.  Information specific to that site will not be much use to anyone else.  However, having that information more widely available is a good that could come from this.</p> <p>  A mistake is being made in the approach.  The Bill is effectively deciding what the public wants to know about and when.  We have been getting clear feedback from the public and from community groups that they want to know about what is happening in the pre-planning stage.  The Bill decides for them that this information is not relevant to them and they are not to know it.  It is no one&rsquo;s intention to imply this, but there is the kind of narrative that people might not understand the difference between pre-planning and actual planning.  People will understand the different processes around it.  Certainly, people are interested.  Rather than making the decision for people that information will not be relevant to them or that they do not need to know, the Minister should let people have the access to information they want and are looking for.  That would give them more confidence in the planning system.  It would help capture the issues early on and have them ironed out.  I would just ask that that is looked at.</p> <p>  On section 32B(4), my amendment No. 17 specifies any "person" or "relevant community organisations".  It is not explicitly clear from the current wording that local authorities can go to community organisations.  Why not at least specify that local authorities can go to any person or community organisation and write them into that wording, if a local authority wants to go to them for information?</p><p>That makes complete sense in many areas where the local authority will know that there is a community or heritage organisation which has expertise or knowledge that could be relevant.  We should specify that in the Bill, rather than just using the term "any person", which is more limited.</p></speech>

I am divided on this.  From working in my area of the city in the past 20 years, I have seen multiple planning applications .  They contain layer upon layer.  I have experience in this so I can read through these things and organise them, but if you are going to get blank planning applications that are not going through, it will seriously confuse people.  If you look at the area in south Dublin that I live in, so many applications have gone in over the past 20 years.  If five, six, seven or eight applications are added in that do not go anywhere, that will make matters more complicated in a development area of large scale where applications are amended and where stuff gets changed.  I will withdraw my amendments.  I would err on the side of where the Bill is.</p></speech>

Earlier, I said that I cannot accept the amendments as they are and that I want public participation.  We will see when we come back on Report Stage if there is a way, as has been suggested by a number of Deputies, whereby, maybe by way of regulation, we could issue circulars to local authorities.  I have seen the issues that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has described in my area.  There is a lot of good <i>ad hoc</i>pre-planning where a decent developer wants to find out what is going on, for example.  That should still happen.  However, Deputy Duffy is right in what he is saying, namely, that we cannot publish everything for every pre-planning application in areas of high development when you are trying to go through different iterations of applications.  A balance has to be found.  Everyone will know what happened at pre-planning stage in every application because that measure has been brought in.  Let me see if I can come back with something to address this.  I am not promising an amendment but I will try to come back with a method that we could use for those groups.  The term &quot;any person&quot; that Deputy Cian O'Callaghan mentioned is covered by the word &quot;groups&quot;.  I have clarified that with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in respect of amendment No. 17.  I will come back specifically on this matter on Report Stage.  We greatly improve the transparency and the consultation if people know what happens at pre-planning but I take the points that have been made and I will come back to see if there is another mechanism to address this.  There is merit in what has been said by members.</p></speech>

I want to amplify Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point in the context of big developments in particular.  There are hundreds if not thousands of small-scale developments so to have public consultation on every small development proposal would not be practical or workable.  We are talking about relatively small numbers of big developments that will have big impacts.  If you are talking about a big development that will have serious impacts but that could be beneficial and if you get people involved in the consultation on the ground floor rather than when the process is further advanced, you will get better development proposals.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, this could potentially even benefit the developers.  It will lead to a more bottom-up and participative planning and development process, which is what we need.</p></speech>

I take the Minister at his word that he will look at what he can do on this issue, perhaps on Report Stage.  If that allows us to progress to the next section and in the meantime reserve judgment to see what comes back on Report Stage then I would look forward to that.</p></speech>

It is correct that certain planning regulations require approval of both Houses under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 before they are signed into law but this requirement is generally applied for matters such as exempted development regulations, which removes the need for certain development works to seek planning permission or fees regulations whereby the Minister sets fees to be applied by planning authorities.  If we were to do this, requiring the approval of regulations which set out matters of administration would be overly burdensome both for my Department, given that it is not being done for others and regulations are a secondary part of the legislative system, and for Members of the D&aacute;il.  It is long established that secondary legislation can be prepared and signed by Ministers as long as the principles and policies of the regulations are set out in the legislation.  For that reason, I oppose the three amendments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#W01200"><p>I am trying to get over to the Finance Bill shortly so I will not be here to move any further amendments.  I am not being rude.</p> <p>  I will say two things on this section.  First, we had an amendment ruled out of order but the Minister should take it on board because his colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are concerned and there was a vote at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in relation to the staff resources that would be necessary in order to deal with large-scale residential development.  They will write to the Minister about this.  To put it starkly, the officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown said there could be cuts in other services because of the staff resources that would be necessary to deal with large-scale residential developments.  That is pretty serious stuff.  As a consequence, the councillors, including the Minister's Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, unanimously approved a motion to request that the additional staff resources be provided to local authorities to deal with large-scale residential developments.  Otherwise, this could have serious knock-on effects for other services.  The Minister should take that seriously.  It is not just me but everybody in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Minister will probably find the same elsewhere.</p> <p>  The second point links to some of my earlier amendments.  I do not see why we need anything that is not affordable at the moment.  At the very least, there should be a higher requirement for public and affordable housing in any large-scale development than 20%.  We are in a bad state and are limited in the construction resources that we have, including construction workers.  There is only so many people to build stuff at the moment.  Everything has to be thrown at upping the amount of affordable and public housing we deliver, given the place we are in.  There should be no LRD process where there is not a requirement for an additional minimum of, I would say, 50% social and affordable to try to address the housing crisis.  I do not have an amendment in on that but I will put one in on Report Stage to the effect that there should be a higher obligation for social and affordable housing linked to any consideration of a large-scale residential development.</p></speech>

Local government resources will be provided to deal with this.  Next week or in the coming days I will make a significant announcement on that.  The Government has committed under Housing for All to provide resources to local government, has done so already in relation to housing delivery teams and will be doing more of that.  We need to resource them where needed.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  My colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown through Deputy Devlin and others have been on to me also.  It will be addressed.  The amendment is out of order but it was raised by a number of Deputies on Second Stage and I had no time to respond so am formally doing so now.  I assure the Deputy that will be done.</p> <p>  On the other point, affordable housing is central to everything the Government and I, as Minister, are doing at every opportunity.  There is the LDA Bill, which refers to population centres of over 150,000, that is, Dublin and Cork.  Great work has been done by Deputy Duffy, who is a member of this committee, on that.  We have 100% affordable and social in those areas.  We are increasing the Part V provision.  The Affordable Housing Act has been passed and was supported by most of the Opposition.  We will lead with our local authorities delivering affordable homes.  The Deputy is right that we want to see more affordable housing.  We want to see affordability permeate the housing market.  That is where we need to get to.  We are not there but are making changes in that regard.  </p> <p>  We are acutely aware of local government resources and I will make an announcement in the coming days on that.</p></speech>

It was raised with the Minister in the Seanad as well.  One of the few benefits of the SHD process was the presentation councillors received detailing the application process.  As part of that, their views were composited in a report submitted alongside the report of the manager.  Many councillors felt it was one of the few benefits of the SHD process.  I appreciate the new process does not allow that sort of combined submission by members of the local authority but that presentation was incredibly useful for local councillors.</p><p>In Dublin City Council, even in advance of SHD presentations, a presentation was made at the area committee meeting on significant planning applications.  I had not realised that was unique in that this process did not exist in other local authorities around the country.  The proposal made in the Seanad and by Deputy Nash today, which fell, was that this would happen at area committee meetings.  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s concern that it could inadvertently delay the LSRD application.  Since this is not my intention, my amendment does not specify that the information should be presented at an area committee meeting or municipal district meeting but, rather, at a meeting.  It could be an online meeting or a physical meeting that is already scheduled.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  It is important that local councillors be briefed by their councils on applications for developments of the scale in question.  It would benefit local democracy.</p></speech>

I believed the amendment might entitle me to speak first.  It outlines exactly what the Minister refers to in respect of restoring the power to local authorities.  It proposes a small cosmetic change.</p></speech>

I thought it was a retrograde step when it got to a stage where councillors could not receive a briefing.  A circular was issued some time ago, although not by me, whereby councillors could not call up files.  They did not wish to get involved in the planning decision but to put forward their views.  It used to work well in my local authority, for which I can speak.  I am considering what we can do.  The Deputy referred to Dublin City Council.  There is nothing to stop a local authority from briefing councillors when there is a significant application.  Some do and it makes a lot of sense.  The passage of this legislation will mean that every councillor will know about every LRD application in his or her area.  They will have to be informed about it.  They will be able to make a submission.</p> <p>  A good thing about the SHDs that the Deputy mentioned was the group submission by the council that went to the board.  The issue is whether any regard was paid to it.  Many councillors I spoke to felt they put a lot of work into their submission but that it got lost when grouped with the submission of the local authority, be it Final County Council, Dublin City Council or Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council.  It is different now because one is dealing with one&rsquo;s own local authority.  I am going to consider the question of how a local area committee or councillor might be able to engage.  I believed the planning meetings at local authority level were useful, if used properly. Maybe they needed to be changed a bit.  Councillors are not planners, and we do not want to muddy that line.  We know where the reserve function associated with the development plan sits.  We know where the executive function sits regarding planning but I am going to examine the matter.  When the legislation is enacted, every local elected member will have to be advised when there is an application.</p></speech>

Mr. Paul Hogan from the Department told us a new circular would be issued to clarify the original document, or whatever you want to call it.  In South Dublin County Council, we were not allowed to look at applications.  I am not sure what other councils that happens in.  It would be great if a circular could be issued indicating applications can be called for and requiring the planners to come in to discuss large applications, because they are very informative.</p></speech>

I was not Minister in 2018 but believe the document was misinterpreted by some local authorities and taken to the extreme.  Input from local elected members can be very good.

My concern is that this part of the Bill will have the effect of tying the hands of the local authority, or planning authority, regarding decisions that have already been made through the SHD process.  I am referring to where there have been mistakes made regarding permissions granted, difficulties with unviable planning permissions, or densities and heights that are simply not viable but that may confer a speculative value on land.  The relevant sections of the Bill will tie the hands of local authorities and they will be prevented from making substantial differences if they have a good rationale for doing so where someone comes in for modifications regarding existing planning permissions or whatever.  If the change I am looking for were made, it would not mean a planning authority could simply, for no reason, seek significant changes.  The language of the Bill, as it stands, would tie the hands of a local authority where it has a good planning rationale, where it is conceded that there has been a lack in certain respects, where a permission has not resulted in building out over several years, where a permission is not viable although housing is needed in the relevant area, and where significant changes may be needed.  My fear is that the legislation ties the hands of the local authority, the planning authority.  I am trying to prevent this.</p></speech>

Could the Minister add his response to his response to Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments?  The Minister has been given power to make regulations that could restrict the types or frequency of further information requests at the latter end of the formal planning decision process of the local authority.</p><p>Will the Minister give an indication on the record of those regulations?  I am sure he does not want to prevent local authorities from asking for information that, in their view, is necessary to make a decision.  I know, for example, in the official briefing we got from the Department, they were concerned about consecutive further information requests that could delay a decision.  My worry is whether certain categories of further information requests will be excluded in the regulations.  How much information can he give us about that at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#Y00200"><p>I will take the last question first.  I covered this on Second Stage and in the Seanad as well, but I am happy to go through it for members here.  First, we will publish the regulations this month in relation to further information.  I want to give members an idea of the limitations I am considering.  The limitations on further information would purely relate to matters that would reasonably have been expected to have been included in planning applications generally or as a result of issues raised or discussed as part of the pre-application consultation stage.  It is not my intention to limit further information altogether.</p> <p>  It will be possible to address matters raised by third parties during the five-week public consultation stage of a planning application, material issues which could not have been foreseen or raised at a pre-application stage, material errors in documentation and faults or deficiencies in environmental impact assessment reports or Natura impact statements, or other relevant environmental documentation, among other things, by means of further information requests as deemed appropriate.  They are the parameters of what I am considering.</p> <p>  On Deputy O'Callaghan's amendments, the inclusion of provisions for the modification of previously permitted developments under the Bill seeks to provide legal clarity in respect of such applications.  Under the strategic housing development process, which is to cease, applications for modification are submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To avoid any type of gap in the legislation in respect of strategic housing development permission, given the proposal to reinstate the role of the planning authorities as the consenting authorities for large-scale residential developments through the Bill, it is deemed appropriate that applications for modifications to strategic housing developments as well as large-scale residential developments would be made directly to the relevant planning authority in the first instance, which is the correct way to do it.  Where modifications proposed to a previously permitted development are deemed by the planning authority to be very minor in nature, there is a provision in the Bill for the planning authority to determine that pre-application consultation is not required and that the planning authority need only consider the proposed alterations in determining the modification application.  This reflects the minor nature of some modifications that may be proposed and the fact that the large-scale residential developments proposals will have previously been subject to detailed pre-application consultation, thereby allowing for the most efficient use of local authority resources.  That is our view on the matter, and I cannot accept amendments Nos. 34, 35 or 42.</p></speech>

How will "reasonable" be defined in that context and how will it be policed or enforced?  If, for example, a matter arises about which a local authority considers it reasonable to request further information, a decision which the regulation seems to conflict with, how will that be managed or adjudicated?  There are likely to be circumstances - we have not seen the regulations so we are speculating blindly on this - where a departmental interpretation of the regulations could determine that a planning authority's request for further information is not reasonable because it should have been asked at pre-planning stage.  The planning authority might disagree and say that this was not something it reasonably could have considered.  How will that be managed?  There could potentially be tension, which we would all obviously like to avoid.</p></speech>

We have seen many applications go through a series of requests for additional information, clarification of additional information, further additional information and on and on.  We want a better pre-application stage that takes an effective procedure from the strategic housing development process, which is a clear pre-application process.  For argument's sake - we will publish the regulations this month - if a standard document or something like that is requested at pre-application stage that was not included in the planning application, it was not included and that is it.  That would be an error if something has not been included in it.</p> <p>  What I have outlined is the areas we consider to be reasonable.  We need to allow each local authority and planner to have some element of discretion or decision making around this, as they have already.  Differently within this, we are setting statutory timelines around this.  We will streamline situations whereby additional information or "further information", as we are calling it, is looked for to stop the situation where there is delay upon delay, which is caused by continual requests for further information.  It should make the information at pre-application stage much better and clearer, if those matters are dealt with at that stage within a statutory timeframe.  We will publish the regulations this month.  They are being worked through.  I assure members that the committee will be briefed on them because it is important.  It is not to try to remove any rights from the local authorities.  It is to try to improve the process, to be honest.</p></speech>

I am concerned that this wording means a local authority cannot take into consideration other issues such as if it considers planning permission already granted not to be viable and is not getting built.  Local authorities may not be allowed to take that into consideration in this regard.  That is my concern so I will be pressing this amendment.</p></speech>

I listened carefully to the Minister's response to my colleague, Senator Warfield, in the Seanad debate.  I was very unconvinced by the Minister's explanation.</p></speech>

Senators Wall and Moynihan raised them in the Seanad.  They would be exceptionally onerous <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the new process.  One of the amendments refers to the beginning of a large-scale development from grant of permission at 24 months and the other one refers to six months.  Amendment No. 38 proposes permission should be granted for six months only and removes the right for it to be varied.  I strongly oppose these amendments.  I discussed this with Senator Wall and while I do not want to take away from the amendment's worthiness, the potential impact of it was not fully understood.  I get where the proposers were coming from.  They were concerned that lots of SHD applications were submitted and permission was granted but they never effected.  That is something about which we all share a frustration.  The LRD will be much better because the process is back with the local authorities and there is a good, robust pre-planning stage.  I would be very concerned about setting arbitrary timelines like this.  A 24-month or six-month timeframe, as detailed in the amendments, would not be attainable and we would end up with good planning permission grants falling and having to go back into the process again.  We had a good discussion on this in the Seanad and to be fair to Senator Wall, he understood where I was coming from.  On that basis, there is a use it or lose it piece that we need to look at.  SHDs had a really poor conversion rate but LRDs will be different.  That is why we are giving the planning element back to the local authorities, which is where it should be.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 36 and 38.</p></speech>

It was, as he correctly pointed out, an attempt by Senators Wall and Moynihan to ensure that lessons that have been drawn from the SHD process could be applied to this process.  It is deeply frustrating, in all our communities and constituencies, when we see developers using the SHD process to have significant developments fast-tracked through the planning process and then sitting on the sites or flipping them and making considerable gains on them while they go undeveloped.  The intention of the amendment was to address the use it or lose it issue that the Minister, along with the Minister for Finance, appears to be confident will be addressed through the zoned land tax.  The truth will be told when that is brought forward and we see what impact it has on developer behaviour.  I reserve the right to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.</p> <p>  I must apologise for not formally moving amendment No. 32.  I was of the assumption that this would be a hybrid meeting and I attended the committee room a few minute's ago in an attempt to do that but was a little late.

It does not belong in this legislation at all.  I do not accept, and have yet to hear a convincing argument, that it is in any way related to LRDs.  My understanding is it is what is often called a leapfrog provision whereby on foot of a judicial review, where one party seeks appeal to the Court of Appeal, the other party can attempt to leapfrog the Court of Appeal and essentially fast-track a decision of the Supreme Court.  I heard the Minister's explanation of this in the Seanad, namely that it was designed to speed up the process and while I do not dispute that this is the purpose, he has not explained what process is being speeded up.  Only a tiny number of SHDs ever went to the Court of Appeal.  As we know, a large number were judicially reviewed and they stopped there.</p> <p>  I suspect this was not meant to be in this Bill originally.  I suspect it did not originate from the officials working on the replacement for the SHDs and the Minister needs to explain to us the origin of this section and why it is in this Bill.  Members will be aware that we are due to debate significant and potentially controversial legislation next year on the reform of the judicial review process.  Many of us are very concerned that this legislation will seek to limit people's access to justice but that is a debate we can have at a later stage.  My suspicion - and it is only a suspicion - is that somebody else, somewhere else in the infrastructure of government, wanted this provision in place in advance of the judicial review reform legislation because they anticipate this provision may be needed, potentially for large infrastructural developments, for example.  If that is the case, there might be a good reason for it and I would be open to listening to the Minister's arguments but in the absence of him credibly explaining why something that is not to do with residential developments is in a Bill on residential developments, I am left with no option but to oppose it.  </p> <p>  My colleague, Senator Warfield, raised the very same questions with the Minister and neither I nor he was satisfied with the response.  I urge him to tell us why this is here and what he is expecting it to be used for because if he did not expect it to be used between now and the passage of the judicial review reform Bill in the first half of next year, then it would not be here in the first instance.  A little more transparency around this provision would be better for everybody.  The Minister may surprise himself and actually convince some of us who are opposed to this section that it has merit.  He did not do that on the floor of the Seanad and I urge him to do it here at this committee.</p></speech>

It stood out for me too.  I wondered why it was included in the Bill.  I would like to hear from the Minister the rationale for this section and why it is in this particular Bill.  How is it related to the rest of the Bill?  Is this specifically needed in this Bill or could it have sat in other legislation?  What is the origin of this section?  Where did the suggestion for its inclusion come from?  Was there lobbying involved?  If the Minister could clarify all of those issues, that would be very useful.  It would be useful to know where this has come from and what he hopes to achieve with this section.  What would be the outcome of this and why is it necessary?  I ask him to provide as much information as possible, starting with the origins of this section.</p></speech>

Maybe the Minister can outline the reasons for including this section and why he feels there is a need for it in this Bill.  Sometimes we deal with legislation containing add-ons where the Government tries to put in additional provisions that would not necessarily have been there at the beginning.</p><p>That is what it looks like to me.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#AA00200"><p>The reality is that this legislation is forward-looking.  No one lobbied in respect of it.  I am not sure to what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is necessarily referring.  There was no lobbying on this.  Let us be clear on that.  Obviously, there is a lobbying register and members should feel free to check it.  The reality is that this is a streamlining provision.  As I stated, we are carrying out a full planning review.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the judicial review reform legislation that actually predates this Government and goes back to the previous Oireachtas.  It is moving through slowly.  This provision is absolutely needed as a streamlining provision for any potential challenges taken against the State or a local authority or in instances where there would be a leapfrogging arrangement.  It is appropriate.  It is important that it is in place when we are trying to make the planning system more effective.</p> <p>  We are grounding this back with local authorities too.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but the whole purpose of this is to bring planning for these large-scale developments back to local authorities.  I believe this is appropriate to the Bill.  It is important that it is done and that we do not have to wait for the conclusion of the full review of the planning code of which we are in the middle.  I responded to Deputy O'Callaghan earlier on the timeframe in that regard.  I will be bringing other planning legislation through in advance of the planning review being completed.  Although members may disagree with different parts of the planning system, I think we all agree that we had to improve its efficiency while making sure the right to make observations or objections in support of or in opposition to applications is retained.  That is a right I firmly believe in.  This provision is relevant, valid and important and it is urgent that it is done.  Hence its inclusion as section 6 of the legislation</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#AA00300"><p>As this is a significant legal change, it is important that we tease it out.  Let us be clear that when this large-scale residential development process is in place, people will enter the pre-planning process and then the formal planning process and may then decide to appeal that to the board.  There may then be judicial reviews.  All of that will take the guts of nine to 12 months.  There will be no large-scale residential development that will need to access this leapfrog provision in 2022.  That is a reasonable assessment.  That means this leapfrog provision is for one of two other things.  It may be that somebody in the architecture of government wants to have this leapfrog provision in case it is required in the context of strategic infrastructure developments that are somewhere in the planning process at this point.  That could be entirely reasonable.  I am not suggesting there is anything untoward going on, but I think we should be told what that is.</p> <p>  Alternatively, it could be that somebody in the architecture of government and the Department is anticipating post-judicial review appeals to the Court of Appeal for strategic housing developments, including some of the most controversial such developments.  Again, that is anticipated before the judicial review reform legislation is in place.  My speculation - it is purely speculation and I am not casting aspersions on anyone because this is a completely legitimate thing for the Government to do - is that we have a very proactive Attorney General and this particular provision has all the fingerprints of the Attorney General, with his fulsome knowledge of the courts.  There probably is an appetite within the Supreme Court for such a leapfrog provision.  It would probably have a little bit more capacity to deal with such complex cases.</p> <p>  However, the question I genuinely asked of the Minister because I am open to being convinced on this - he has not answered it so I will ask it again - is what kind of development he expects this leapfrog provision to be used for between now and when his judicial review legislation, which I understand should come for pre-legislative scrutiny early in the new year and be passed within the first half of next year according to the timeline for it set out by the Department, comes into being.  This provision is not for large-scale residential developments.  None of those will even get to judicial review, let alone an appeal to the Court of Appeal, by the end of next year.  Is it for certain strategic infrastructure developments?  The Minister must know the answer.  Why can he not just be straight with us and let us know so that we can judge whether it is a good and worthwhile provision?  Thus far, he has not given any explanation as to why it is in this Bill in respect of large-scale residential developments.</p></speech>

The Minister can correct me if I am reading this incorrectly.  Is it that the planning review is being undertaken now and that some things are coming out of it that the Minister is already advancing into legislation, this is one of those things and we can expect more of them before the planning review is completed?  Do I have that totally wrong?  If so, the Minister might explain that again and explain from where the idea behind this came and what are its origins.  Am I to take it from his comments that we should expect more provisions such as this in legislation in the coming year before the planning review is completed?  What is the process that is happening here?  It would be useful to understand that.</p></speech>

By the way, I assure Deputies that this has not been brought forward with any particular project, development or strategic piece of State infrastructure in mind.  That is not the case.  Governments rightly use legislation and legislative vehicles to advance changes.  That is what we are about.  That is the reason we are legislators.  This is a streamlining provision.  I am not being smart, but I do not have a crystal ball that would tell me for what this provision will be used.  It is a useful and necessary provision to streamline the process.  I bring forward the legislation and amendments as Minister.  In the context of the legislative process, these provisions are initiated by me with Government approval.  That is the provision and those are its origins and the rationale for it.  Obviously, members will make their own minds up on it.  It is a forward-looking and streamlining provision in respect of planning.  I cannot say whether it will be used this year, next year or the year after that for a residential development, or whether it will ever be used.  However, in my view, it is required.</p></speech>

The Minster stated this is a useful and forward-looking provision that is about advancing change and streamlining and has Government approval.  He then stated that he does not know when, if ever, it will be used.  If that is the case, why is it being included in the Bill?  I made a point earlier regarding how we see parts coming into legislation.  In my two short years in the D&aacute;il, I have had concerns regarding some legislation that has been adopted.  We are here to discuss large-scale residential development but the Minister has not explained why this section is needed.</p></speech>

It has come out of nowhere, whereas we have a general sense of what the previous Government and the officials were working towards in terms of the judicial review process.  I ask the Minister to explain why this reform is suddenly more important than the others and why it has to be introduced more quickly than the others.</p><p> The Minister might also explain the following point.  My understanding is that the Government does not introduce any kind of legislation unless it has a reason for doing so, and it does not just introduce legislation speculatively.  Therefore, the real question is what is the reason for this, and, again, the Minister has not asked it.  For the third and final time, I will press him.  I presume somebody somewhere thinks this is going to be necessary and, therefore, that is why it is here, not in the appropriate place, which is the judicial review Bill we are going to deal with early next year.</p></speech>

I was asking what where the origins and where the idea for this originated from.  Perhaps it originated with the Minister but, if it originated elsewhere, we are none the wiser on that.  It is a legitimate issue to ask and I want to make that point.</p> <p>  Has any analysis been done on how this will affect people's access to justice, given this could have cost implications for people?  Has that analysis been done and, if so, what did that analysis show us or what are the results of that analysis?  If that analysis has not been done, should it be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#BB00400"><p>I do not want to drag this out but I want to give some additional rationale, should it be required.  At present, if a planning authority, including the board, or, where relevant, the State, succeeds in defending a judicial review challenge and the High Court certifies that it may be appealed, the appeal then goes to the Court of Appeal.  If the planning authority or the State succeeds again in the Court of Appeal, the applicant or the objector can then apply to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal.  There are all of those different stages, all the way up.  Given the criteria for allowing an appeal from the High Court in the first place are very similar, although not identical, to the criteria that must be met for an appeal to the Supreme Court, leave to appeal is normally granted by the Supreme Court in these cases and would only be refused in exceptional ones.  This means that, notwithstanding having succeeded at High Court level in defeating a judicial review application, the ultimate resolution of the case could take another two or three years in the Court of Appeal and subsequently in the Supreme Court.</p> <p>  That is the reality of it.  It is obvious to most of us that this has adverse delay consequences for the proposed developments in question, hence the streamlining.  The amendment to section 50A makes provision for the planning authority and the State, or any party to the appeal, to apply directly to the Supreme Court in the event that the High Court gives an applicant leave to appeal, so they are then leapfrogged.  This would mean the Supreme Court would then hear the appeal, directly bypassing the Court of Appeal.</p> <p>  The introduction of these changes proposed in the Bill would have the effect of significantly reducing the time for the ultimate disposal of the litigation, although, obviously, it does not say what the judgment would be.  If the judicial case is refused, it would enable relevant projects to proceed earlier than otherwise would have been the case.  In my view, to repeat, this is a very important streamlining provision because court delays can impose significant costs or, in some instances, even inhibit viability.  Some objectors to developments can be very conscious of these delays as well, and if we are all honest with each other, we know that too.</p> <p>  It is appropriate in this legislation.  The judicial review reform Bill to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin refers will go to pre-legislative scrutiny and its general scheme was approved by the previous Government as well.  This Bill is the right place for this measure.  It needs to be done, hence this section is included in the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are related and will be discussed together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#CC00300"><p>I move amendment No. 39:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 11, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;in particular houses and duplexes&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;including houses, duplexes and apartments&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>This amendment very simply extends the definition of homeownership to include apartments.  For many people apartments are their forever home and many choose to downsize as they get older by purchasing apartments.  I will leave it at that.  I think there is another amendment there so I will wait for the Minister to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#DD00100"><p>My amendment No. 40 is near identical to that of Deputy Duffy and seeks to ensure that apartments are included.  This part of the Bill specifically mentions housing need in terms of owner-occupiers and references, in particular, houses and duplexes.  Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that apartments are named as well.</p> <p>  As Deputy Duffy has said, there are lots of people for home ownership and people who want to be owner-occupiers.  Apartments are as much a valid choice as a traditional house or duplex so it is entirely appropriate that apartments are specifically listed here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#DD00200"><p>I fully support the two amendments.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to clarify the following in his response.  My understanding, having listened to his comments previous to the introduction of these amendments, was that this was part of the attempt to ensure that at least 50% of the residential development of houses and duplexes would be made available for owner-occupation.  I do not see how the sections of the Bill, which obviously were amended in the Seanad at the Minister's request, achieved that objective.  Have I misunderstood that this is the legislative provision to achieve that end or does it have some other purpose?  I ask because not only do we need to ensure that apartments are included in this section, as the two amendments propose, but that this would empower local authorities to make decisions to ensure a percentage is for owner occupation.  The rate of 50% is arbitrary and the local authority should be able to make that decision based on the local planning need.  I do not see how any per cent is achieved in this but maybe the Minister could explain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#DD00300"><p>Section 2 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, set outs the interpretation and "house" includes apartments thus negating the need for the word "apartment" to be inserted in the amendment.  That is the actual interpretation of "house" under the Planning and Development Act 2000 so the apartment aspect is covered.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Broin, this is part of the owner-occupier guarantee.  This is the first time that owner-occupier and home ownership have been recognised as a form of housing tenure.  It has been a really important objective of this Government and of myself to be able to help people, should they so wish, to own their own home so it is really important that this provision is in this legislation.  </p> <p>  When one looks further down through the section what it actually asks each local authority to do is that when they develop their housing strategy, and as part of their housing strategy, they would estimate the need for owner-occupier.  Indeed, having a reference to first-time buyer will lead into, on top of a Part V provision, which is now increased to 20%, for them to designate an additional percentage for owner-occupier only, which I think it is a good thing.</p> <p>  As members will know, we have had issues with bulk purchasing.   This is not just a reaction.  This is something that we want by way of promoting home ownership and levelling the playing pitch.  The remainder of the section will allow each local area to estimate so it may state the different requirements for housing in different areas within the area of the development plan.  Once it is in the development plan then that underpins the decisions that each local authority can make at the planning application stage.  Such estimate shall be deemed to be included in the housing strategy concerned, which will flow into the development plan and then flow into the planning permissions that are granted.</p> <p>  In response to Deputies O'Callaghan and Duffy, section 2 of the Planning and Development Act sets out the interpretation of a house and that does include an apartment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#DD00400"><p>I support the intention behind the amendment.  I would like to understand how the text of the amendment relates to a previous commitment of around 50%.  It seems to me that the wording of this section gives the local authority much more flexibility, which in my view is a good thing.  So a local authority, in its development plan, on foot of a recommendation by a chief executive, if I read this right, could say the following.  In this part of the functional area of the local authority we have a very high concentration of private rentals so we would like the balance shifted to owner-occupation or <i>vice versa</i>.  Therefore, it is not about setting a percentage centrally but giving the local authority the flexibility to set those percentages and then for planning applications to be judged against that.  Is my interpretation correct?  Would a local authority be able to say in its housing plan, on foot of these, that there may be certain areas where there might be an even higher percentage of owner-occupation than 50% or a higher percentage of rental than 50%, if that is what is required?  Have I interpreted this correctly, in that respect?</p></speech>

We have underpinned this in the Affordable Housing Act as well so the provisions will allow the local authorities, as part of their housing strategies, to identify where the gaps are and it is important that that is done.  In the housing delivery plans that are being submitted to me, and must be with me by later this month, they will include affordable, social and private housing.  We want them to go further than that and outline where they need owner-occupier.  We have issues with a certain concentration or location of designated build-to-rent apartments and build-to-rent developments that there is no owner-occupiers within it and we need local authorities to be able to do that so this is part of the owner-occupier guarantee.  We have strengthened it in the Affordable Housing Act as well.  It has been further put into the Planning Act and is the first time that owner-occupier is recognised as a form of housing tenure.  As Members will know, in the Land Development Agency Act, we have made provision for a base of 50% on State-owned land that will be developed for affordable and at population centres of over 150,000 such as Cork and Dublin there will be 100% social and affordable.</p></speech>

I got specific advice based on the amendments that were tabled by Deputies Duffy and O'Callaghan.  The specific advice that I have, which we can reconfirm to the Deputy in writing, is that the Planning and Development Act, as amended, regarding the interpretation of  house, does include apartment and, therefore, negates the need to stipulate apartment in an amendment.  The Deputy can press his amendment or come back on Report Stage but I will supply him with additional information.</p></speech>

If duplexes do fall within the definition yet state houses and duplexes but not apartments, then that is unhelpful to say the least.  I appreciate that this is in the definition in section 2 of the Planning and Development Act but good legislation should be clear and unambiguous as much as possible.  Good legislation should not have to involve wording like this that requires people to go back to a previous definition in order for people to understand that apartments are included.  Good wording here would explicitly include apartments, especially if duplexes are part of this.  If we are relying on the definition contained in the Act then referencing it would make things that bit easier.  If we gave the list of "houses, duplexes and apartments" then we would all know and anyone who read this legislation would be very clear.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 46 seeks to reduce the timeframe from 16 weeks, or four months, to five weeks.  The intention is to limit the further damage that can be done through the strategic housing development process and the interim measures that will potentially drag the strategic housing development process well into next year.  I do not believe that this is something anyone wants to see.  I am concerned there could be a flood of applications towards the end of the process that would create resource problems in terms of dealing with the decisions.  If the resources are constrained at planning decision level during the process it could lead to more pressure and more mistakes being made.  Amendment No. 48 proposes removing the provisions altogether.  These amendments seek to limit the further damage that can be done by the strategic housing development process.</p></speech>

I want to spend a little bit of time going through why in support of the amendments.  A small section of amendment No. 49 is missing.  It is probably my fault at the submitting end rather than the Bills Office.  I might come back to it on Report Stage.</p> <p>  The original legislation Eoghan Murphy amended during the lifetime of the previous Government set the expiration date for the strategic housing development as December this year.  It was something that was going to happen irrespective of who was in government.  The current Government made a bad decision in accepting that the pause to the planning process in 2020 required a two-year extension.  The Government did so and it created a reasonable expectation among applicants that the strategic housing development process would come to an end in February.  Pretty much everybody understood that to be the case.  This is not what is in this transitional mechanism.</p> <p>  There are two transitional mechanisms.  It is important people fully understand their import.  The first is for those people who have already been in the pre-planning strategic housing development process for some time and who receive pre-planning approval to move to the formal strategic housing development application process by the end of December.  They are allowed move to full application.  This is a reasonable expectation because they expected to have until February to make a planning application.  What I do not understand with respect to this group of people is why the Minister is giving 16 weeks when for a year and a half we have all been told February would be the end date for strategic housing development applications.  Therefore, an eight-week period rather than a 16-week period would have been reasonable and legally sound.  It would have meant strategic housing development applications for this category of applicants would be made in and around August.  It is one of the things we would have had to live with.</p> <p>  My first amendment proposes shortening the period for the formal application to the board for a strategic housing development for someone who already has pre-planning approval.</p><p> The second category of transitionary arrangements the Minister made is excessive in the extreme.  It allows an applicant to put in a pre-planning application to the board for an SHD by 16 December, if 17 December is the enactment date, and the board will have nine weeks to make a decision, which takes us up to February.  It will then have 16 weeks to make the application, which takes us up to June, and there will be a further 16 weeks for the board to make its decision, which takes us up to October.  Conceivably, therefore, SHD applications could be submitted in the middle of next year, with decisions made in the autumn of next year, and some of them potentially judicially reviewed and having legal challenges running into 2023.  I do not understand why that mechanism has been put in place.</p><p> The full wording of the amendment, which should be in front of us today, although I will return to it on Report Stage, would not just have shortened the eight-week period but would have meant that in the case of anybody who only applies for pre-planning SHD approval at this point, the board would make that pre-planning assessment.  Instead of allowing the application to go into SHD next year, if the board gave approval, it would go into the LSRD process.  That would be much more sensible and it would do exactly what Deputy O'Callaghan is trying to do, namely, dramatically reduce the potential for controversial and unviable SHD applications to be made throughout next year.  I find it difficult to understand why we would be so generous.</p><p> I think the Minister is guilty here of making the same mistake he made with co-living, which was giving applicants too long a period from the announcement of a review, to the receipt of the report, to the announcement of the action, to the enactment of the action.  It is the same here.  People are getting an additional year for SHDs when they should have ended in February.  While I can live with a transition arrangement that takes us up to April for those people who have got pre-application approval, I cannot live with somebody just lobbing in a pre-planning application later this month and then getting a six-month grace period to make a full application, with a decision to be made in October.  There is no logic to that and I do not think it is necessary, which is why I will certainly press my amendments and why I also support the spirit of the amendments tabled by Deputies O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>

This is a loophole.  When the Government is just about to do something correct, all of a sudden there is another avenue or loophole.  Why we are adding another year?  It does not make sense.  Obviously, something had to be done, but I cannot understand why we would allow people to come into this process at this stage.  Perhaps the Minister can explain it.  To me, it seems like a back-door loophole and an extension that is not needed . As Deputies &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett outlined, we should have a more concise period and get rid of the SHDs.  Let us put them behind us.  I was not a Deputy when they were introduced but Deputy &Oacute; Broin and many other Deputies said they were not going to work, and they have not worked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#FF00300"><p>Let us put a few myths to bed.  We need transitional arrangements and they have to be there, as most people recognise.  To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the process cannot be just cut off.  In the Seanad, the main Opposition party originally argued there should not be any transition but now it is proposing eight weeks.  We have to provide a transition.  If someone is engaging with a formal pre-planning process, applications cannot just be flipped over to the board.  We would be open to legal challenge and we cannot do it.</p> <p>  In order that Deputies are aware, as the Act that provides for SHDs stands and until we bring in this legislation with the provisions I am making, if someone has received a pre-application opinion from the board, he or she could lodge an SHD application in five years.  If anything, I am shortening that provision substantially.  That is what is happening.  It is not a loophole.  We are ending SHDs.  The idea that the planning pause during the first wave of Covid would not apply to one aspect of planning just does not stand up to fair scrutiny.  The Government committed not to extending SHDs, which we are not doing, and we are going further by putting in a better process that is more democratic and transparent and that will restore planning to local authorities.  We cannot accept amendments that would provide for no transition because that would not work and we would leave ourselves open to challenge left, right and centre.</p> <p>  The idea that anybody who has not even engaged will rock up before 17 December, lodge an SHD application and off they go is not the case.  There would have to be a section 247 application to the local authority and much of the work would have to have been already done.  In light of the number of judicial reviews taken against the SHD process, I do not see how it is an attractive process for anybody who has not engaged with it heretofore to come into the system.  A line is often peddled about co-living being extended for a period, but we banned co-living.  We had to send it out for screening.  Everybody knows that is the case.  It went out for 30 days of screening, which had to happen, but that was it and they are gone.  SHDs will be gone too because of this legislation, and that is a commitment both the Government and I have made.</p> <p>  I cannot accept the amendments.  We need transitional arrangements.  It will not mean a glut of new SHD applications will come in during the final week, in advance of their termination.  Applicants will have to have engaged with the process.  In the case of anyone who has not engaged with the process, new applications from 17 December will go back to the local authorities.  That is important.  It is being done in a very short space of time.  It is relatively complex legislation that, thankfully, has heretofore received the support of virtually all Members of both Houses, but transition arrangements are required.  What I have proposed are appropriate and realistic timeframes to allow for some potentially good applications we want to see through to fruition.  If they were flipped out into another process, it could very well end up further delaying the provision of more homes.  I am tired of seeing delays for many different reasons, some of them good reasons, in respect of the delivery of homes.</p> <p>  We need homes to be built.  The Bill will restore planning powers to the local authorities, which is what we all want to do.  I respect the Deputies for the amendments they tabled but I cannot accept any of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021120100002#FF00400"><p>I return to the second transitionary mechanism, for those people who do not have pre-planning approval from the board to make their SHD application, because that is the one I think the Minister has got wrong.  I say this in all sincerity.  My main worry is that applications could come in at a late stage.  They have only to enter the pre-planning application process for SHDs by 16 December.  While preparatory work will have to have been done beforehand, they will still be able to enter at that point.  The reason I think the Minister should seriously consider the proposition I am making, namely, that while that pre-planning application can be assessed by the board, it should be redirected into the LSRD process, relates to the fact that is a better process.  The Minister and I agree the LSRD process is far superior to the SHD process.</p> <p>  Moreover, a significant number of SHDs end up being judicially reviewed and delayed.  I would have thought, therefore, it would be much better to redirect those applicants that have yet to get pre-planning application approval into the LSRD process.  The reason some may not want that relates to the fact they might fancy their chances with the board.  The board - in my opinion, and I say this with the greatest respect to the individuals there - continues to make questionable planning decisions.  I say they are questionable because when they are challenged in the courts, the courts tend to uphold the challenge.  I see no reason anybody should be allowed to put in an SHD application as late as the latter end of June of next year, with a decision to be made in October of next year.</p><p>That is just far too generous.  It was never the expectation.  The Minister himself will know that there was a kerfuffle when a circular was mistakenly issued giving the impression that April would be the deadline for everybody, which would have been bad enough.  That was then withdrawn.  Then another circular was formally issued and it did not provide any clarity.  It was only when we saw the text of the Bill that we realised that the transitional mechanisms for those people only entering into the pre-application process would go throughout the course of next year.  I appeal to the Minister.  He is getting this bit of the Bill wrong.  Whatever about an argument over four weeks, I still think 16 weeks is too long for the first group of people in the transitionary mechanism.  Eight weeks would have been fine and we could have been done and dusted with all new applications by the end of February, which was everybody's assumption.  The Minister is getting this secondary bit absolutely wrong.</p><p> I wish to challenge the Minister on the pause because it is a very important point.  When the planning process was paused during the first lockdown, everybody knew that anything that was in the process at that point in time and that was affected by the pause would get an extra two months.  That was very clear.  None of the SHD applications that will benefit from the additional months into 2022 were affected at that point in time.  That was not the legal issue, as far as I understand; it was the timelines in the legislation Eoghan Murphy had passed to extend SHDs to the end of this year.  That could have easily been fixed by primary legislation.  We could have easily stuck to the original deadline.  If legislation had been introduced earlier this year, we could have had transitional mechanisms that dealt with that.  That is not my primary concern.  The Minister is giving new entrants to the system an extra year.  That is a mistake.  He does not need to do it.  I know he will not support the amendment, but I urge him to rethink some of this between now and Report Stage.  The Minister cannot say to people that SHDs are ending in February 2022 but that applications will continue to come in in June 2022, with decisions made in October and potential battles in the court into 2023.  That is not what people were promised and it is not what should be provided for in this section of the Bill.</p></speech>

The point has been well made that if this legislation goes through, there will be a new system for people to be able to go into for large-scale planning applications, so it is not that there is not somewhere for new entrants to go and it is not as if they are being blocked or anything like that.  I think there are ample cases and ample evidence of not necessarily all applicants but some applicants availing of SHDs as a form of speculative planning application to result in increased land values and not in actually delivering homes that are needed.  That is what has gone on, albeit not in every case, so the sooner that is ended the better - certainly the better for housing delivery, good planning and people who are actually interested in providing homes.  The people who will lose out on this, however, are those looking for the speculative permissions, which some of them have got.  I have no doubt in my mind but that some of the decisions that have been made which effectively increase land prices and, arguably, because of the heights and densities, make development less viable and less likely to happen in the coming years, are actually blocking housing delivery.  Some of those decisions have been made as a result of this system and would not have been made if the original decision was with local authorities.</p></speech>

The Minister is saying that if we just repeal and do not have these transitionary arrangements, as the SHD legislation is currently framed, you could be open to legal action because the applicants are already in a pre-planning process or because they have indicated that they want to get into a pre-planning process.

We cannot just tell them to get out of that and go into something else.  They have to operate under the legislation that is applicable and effective at the time they make the application.  The Deputy is fully entitled to his opinion.  Obviously, I have to act within the law and based on the advice I have.  We also have to have an element of fairness.  We cannot tell people, "You have engaged with this process right the way up, but forget about that now and go into a new process and start all over again."  That in itself could have the effect of delaying.  I think most people understand that we need transitionary arrangements.

That is just how it works.  There is a 13-week process for planning applications.  That is if further information is not sought.  If it is, it takes up to six months to go back in.  An appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la can take anything up to six months.  At the moment there is the pre-planning process, which, statutorily, is meant to be eight weeks.  At the moment it is 16 weeks.  The way it is at the moment is nuts.  The system is there.  If it is shut down and you get in before it is shut down, I think there is a legal entitlement for you to execute or follow through on what you have started.  That is my understanding of the matter anyway.</p></speech>

Idir M&aacute;rta 2015 agus Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair 2021, d&eacute;anadh 126 iarratas plean&aacute;la i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne.

T&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh ar Ghaeltacht na nD&eacute;ise toisc gur f&eacute;idir le 75% den daonra Gaeilge a labhairt.  Luaigh 45.6% den daonra go labhra&iacute;onn siad Gaeilge ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il i ndaon&aacute;ireamh 2016.  T&aacute; m&eacute;ad&uacute; seasta tar &eacute;is teacht ar dhaonra Ghaeltacht na nD&eacute;ise le 25 bliain anuas.  C&eacute; gur thit c&eacute;atad&aacute;n an daonra a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge ar bhonn laeth&uacute;il idir 1996 agus 2002, cuireadh stop leis an meath seo agus l&eacute;irigh an daon&aacute;ireamh is d&eacute;ana&iacute; go raibh m&eacute;ad&uacute; suntasach tar &eacute;is teacht ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge le 20 bliain anuas, staitistic a th&eacute;ann in aghaidh na treochta n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.</p> <p>  Ar n&oacute;s na bpobal Gaeltachta eile ar fud na t&iacute;re, t&aacute; br&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r ar an gceantar seo maidir le sl&aacute;ine phobal labhartha na Gaeilge, br&uacute; a mbaineann ceithre phr&iacute;omhfh&oacute;rsa leis: tionchar na ndaoine nach cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge iad ar mian leo tithe a th&oacute;g&aacute;il agus a cheannach i gceantair Ghaeltachta; easpa tithe ar phraghas r&eacute;as&uacute;nta sna ceantair; easpa seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; chun forbairt&iacute; ar sc&aacute;la n&iacute;os m&oacute; a &eacute;asc&uacute;; agus f&aacute;il ar shu&iacute;mh agus srianta ar thith&iacute;ocht tuaithe.</p><p> Is d&uacute;shl&aacute;n suntasach don phobal &aacute;iti&uacute;il inacmhainneacht tith&iacute;ochta de bharr su&iacute;omh c&oacute;sta, ardchaighde&aacute;n comhshaoil, &eacute;ileamh ard ar &aacute;iteanna c&oacute;naithe t&aacute;naisteacha, ar thithe saoire agus ar ligean gearrth&eacute;armach, chomh maith le ganntanas coibhneasta d&rsquo;fhorbairt fhiontrach tith&iacute;ochta.  Ina theannta sin, n&iacute;l tuilleadh suntasach breise sa l&iacute;onra seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; uisce sa cheantar tuaithe seo.  Cuireann s&eacute; seo srian sa bhreis ar roghanna f&eacute;ideartha chun na fadhbanna a bhaineann le hinacmhainneacht a r&eacute;iteach. Ina ainneoin sin, i go leor c&aacute;sanna t&aacute; forbairt&iacute; ar sc&aacute;la n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag teacht salach ar charachtar riachtanach an phobail Ghaeltachta seo.

Go ginear&aacute;lta b&iacute;onn cl&aacute;sal feidhme teanga ar cheann de na coinn&iacute;ollacha.

Is cuideachta forbartha teoranta faoi sti&uacute;ir an phobail Comhlucht Forbartha na nD&eacute;ise, a buna&iacute;odh in 2005 ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge a bhuan&uacute; agus a neart&uacute; i nGaeltacht Phort L&aacute;irge.

Within Cork County Council, there are two distinct Gaeltacht areas, namely, M&uacute;scra&iacute; and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire.  The county development plan is currently under review and has been prepared having regard to other national regional guidelines, including the Gaeltacht Act 2012 and the national planning framework and regional planning guidelines.<br/><br/>Regarding our current county development plan from 2014, the planning policy framework for the protection of the Irish language is currently contained in chapter 12, on heritage, and section 12.5 on cultural heritage.  The plan acknowledges that Cork county has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, which is a significant asset to the county economically, environmentally, socially and culturally.  The current plan aims to encourage the further development of those cultural assets to increase local awareness of our heritage and the cultural identity and promote the cultural tourism industry.  A dedicated section is attributed to Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage under paragraphs 12.5.9 and 12.5.10.  Specifically, they state:</p> <blockquote> 	Cork County Council recognises the importance of our linguistic heritage to the people of the County and to the cultural heritage of the County.  Parts of Cork County lie within the Gaeltacht.  These are Oilean Chl&eacute;ire, and an area to the west of Macroom and adjoining the Kerry boundary including Baile Bhuirne &hellip; and B&eacute;al Atha an Ghaorthaidh &hellip; commonly known as the Muscrai &hellip; Gaeltacht.  These areas require special treatment to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage without hindering development and with an appropriate response to opportunities and challenges.  The challenge is to promote these areas as a focus for development, whilst ensuring that the development, which does occur, supports or complements the linguistic and cultural heritage.<br /><br />The Development Plan policy approach for the Gaeltacht areas is based on the following principles:  	- The cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht areas, including the use of the Irish language, deserves fostering;<br /><br />- An economically and socially vibrant community is a pre­condition for sustaining Irish as the community language of these areas;<br /><br />- Recognition that the relationship between development and Irish language and culture is a complex one not amenable to simplistic measures, and also that planning powers have significant, though indirect and not unlimited, influence on the protection and promotion of culture;<br /><br />- The [Cork Gaeltacht areas] are interdependent with the wider areas in which they are located.  They cannot function, or be properly understood, in geographic isolation.  The Gaeltachta&iacute; should play their full part in the life and well being of the County, Region and Country, and likewise should benefit from the resources of the territory around them; <br /><br />- An isolationist approach, or one, which puts unnecessary obstacles in the path of development generally, would, in the current context, be damaging to the long-term sustenance of Irish language and culture in these areas.  </blockquote> <p>The specific policy objectives are listed under HE 5-3 in our submission.<br/><br/>I turn to what is proposed in the review of the current county development plan for 2022 to 2028.  As part of our current review, submissions were invited at pre-draft stage in March 2020 on planning policy matters, including linguistic heritage and Gaeltacht areas.  The framing of the new text and objectives in the draft plans has been informed by those submissions, in collaboration with the Irish officer and heritage officer.  Appendix 2 of our statement provides more detail on that.  The draft plan will also include a dedicated section within chapter 16, which relates to heritage, on cultural heritage.  Specific details relating to the Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage are contained in a dedicated subsection under paragraphs 16.4.12 to 16.4.17.  These include additional text on the Gaeltachta&iacute; in County Cork and the specific settlements that are part of these two distinct language planning areas, namely, Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire in the west Cork municipal district and M&uacute;scra&iacute; in the Macroom municipal district.  Recognition is also given to the Gaeltacht service towns of Macroom and Cork city, and Irish language networks as designated under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  The draft plan from 2021 now considers the requirement for use of demanding linguistic impact analyses with planning applications for particular major developments.  Under draft objective HE 16-22, as suggested by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at the pre-draft consultation stage, this will apply in cases where the potential impact of the development on the use of Irish as a community language is not immediately apparent and pivotal in the determination of the application.</p><p>The expanded text and objectives in the draft 2021 plan are outlined as follows:</p><blockquote>	The Gaeltacht Act (2012) provides a statutory footing to the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language, 2010-2030 and also recognises Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas (LPT), Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks.  Within Cork County, the Gaeltacht is divided into two Language Planning Areas: Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire LPT off the coast of Baltimore, and M&uacute;scra&iacute; LPT which includes an area to the west of Macroom and adjoining the Kerry boundary including Baile Bhuirne, Baile Mhic &Iacute;re, C&uacute;il Aodha, R&eacute; na nDoir&iacute;, Cill na Martra, Guag&aacute;n Barra, and B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh.  These areas require special treatment to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage.  The challenge is to promote these areas as a focus for development, whilst ensuring that the development, which does occur, supports or complements the linguistic and cultural heritage.<br /><br />Cork County Council recognises the importance of our linguistic heritage to the people and cultural heritage of the County.  It also has an important role in the implementation of the LPT (Language Planning Areas) language plans, particularly as it relates to signage, service provision, and physical planning and development.  In 2019 Cork County Council produced the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Conservation, Management and Interpretation Plan, which provides a holistic view of the heritage of this culturally unique area.<br /><br />As a stakeholder in the development and preservation of the Irish Language, Cork County Council supports the vision of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to &ldquo;develop a vibrant, thriving, sustainable Gaeltacht community and economy and to strengthen and sustain Irish as the primary community language of the Gaeltacht so that the Gaeltacht is a world-class region.&rdquo; [and] &ldquo;To foster a sustainable Gaeltacht community where the Irish language is the primary language, with a strong economy utilising all available resources sustainably and with a first-class standard of living.&rdquo;<br /><br />The Plan recognises the narrow employment base of the Gaeltacht areas and the unique challenges they face. It is acknowledged that tourism can play an important role in the employment profile of the Gaeltacht communities focussed on its unique heritage including its linguistic tradition, musical and traditional craft industries within a spectacular landscape setting. There are opportunities to create greater linkages and synergies between the Irish speaking population of the County (44.9%) outside the Gaeltacht areas and the immersive Gaeltacht experience. Within the Gaeltacht areas there are also notable artisan food and craft producers which can also contribute to overall experience and package of cultural offer within both Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire and M&uacute;scra&iacute;.<br /><br />Gaeltacht Walks such as the Sl&iacute; Gaeltacht Mh&uacute;scra&iacute;, have provided important tourism infrastructure within Gaeltacht Mh&uacute;scra&iacute; and the Plan supports the further expansion of walking and cycling routes within both Gaeltacht areas, including &lsquo;hard&rsquo; and &lsquo;soft&rsquo; infrastructure for outdoor adventure, sports, recreation, etc., that can enhance the tourist experience of the area.<br /><br />The Development Plan policy approach for the Gaeltacht areas is based on the following principles: <br /><br />The cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht areas, including the use of the Irish language, deserves fostering; <br /><br />An economically and socially vibrant community with a high standard of living is a pre-condition for sustaining Irish as the community language of these areas; <br /><br />Recognition that the relationship between development and Irish language and culture is a complex one not amenable to simplistic measures, and also that planning powers have significant, though indirect and not unlimited, influence on the protection and promotion of culture; <br /><br />The Gaeltachta&iacute; are interdependent with the wider areas in which they are located. They cannot function, or be properly understood, in geographic isolation. The Gaeltachta&iacute; should play their full part in the life and well being of the County, Region and Country, and likewise should benefit from the resources of the territory around them; <br /><br />Cork County Council will co-ordinate with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the implementation of the LPT (Language Planning Areas) language plans, particularly as it relates to signage, service provision, and physical planning and development; <br /><br />An isolationist approach, or one, which puts unnecessary obstacles in the path of development generally, would, in the current context, be damaging to the long-term sustenance of Irish language and culture in these areas. </blockquote><p>There are specific policy objectives in our draft plans to support those.<br/><br/>I will talk about zoning approach in the Gaeltacht areas.  At a settlement level, the key villages of B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, Baile Bhuirne and the village of Cill na Martra have been allocated growth targets under the core strategy and additional text has been included in the draft plan, arising from submissions at a pre-draft consultation stage.<br/><br/>Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire is dealt with specifically under section 226 in volume 2, part 2, of the west Cork municipal district plan.  Additional text now reflects the completion of works on the development of a digital hub on the island, as per the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta submission.  Updated text is also included to reflect the fact there are supports in place to maintain the island as a functioning Gaeltacht.  Reference is also made to the fact Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire's language plan has been submitted for approval to An Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n and has since been improved.<br/><br/>Further proposed amendments, which are now under consideration, arising from my chief executive's report of 24 September 2021, are as follows.  A further round of public consultation on the draft plan resulted in a series of further proposed text updates to strengthen the policy framework on the Gaeltacht areas via amendments which are contained in the chief executive's report and are due to be considered by members as part of the statutory planning making progress.  The submissions received are outlined in appendix 1, which was submitted to the committee, and the proposed amendments arising from those are outlined in appendix B of the longer statement submitted.<br/><br/>The current county development plan provides a dedicated section on the importance of placenames to the cultural heritage of Ireland.  This is supported by reference to the council's leaflet, preserving our placenames heritage in the naming of new developments.  The existing text and objective are outlined as follows:</p><blockquote>	Irish placenames are an integral [though often forgotten] part of the cultural heritage of Ireland. They are a valuable source of knowledge [of the past, giving meaning to the landscape and defining the relationship between communities and their physical environment]. Much of the thought, folklore, genealogy, religion, daily life and work of those living in and interacting with their landscape can be appreciated through [the study of placenames] ... There are over 5,600 townlands in the County and over 100,000 references to [Cork placenames collected by the Cork placenames survey or the Cork placenames archive]. </blockquote><p>Cork County Council has also produced a leaflet, preserving our placenames heritage in the naming of new developments.  The purpose of this document is to encourage the use of existing placenames in the naming of new residential and other developments and there is a specific objective, from a planning perspective, which supports that.  The draft plan 2021 continues to include this text and has expanded the section to include townland boundaries.  I will not read through specific details of that.  It is effectively a slight change to the referenced townland boundaries.<br/><br/>From a procedural perspective within Cork County Council, we have the following development management procedures in place: the Irish officer is available for translation of policy documents and development management applications, translators from the translators framework are used for larger translation projects and clear guidance documentation is also provided for all staff.  Statutory bodies and agencies, as well as internal consultees, would be referred to as required on applications within the Gaeltacht areas.  No specific conditions have been attached to permissions issued on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire or within M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht in the last decade.  Generally, an area planner assessing the planning application would have a degree of fluency in Irish.<br/><br/>There are no formal procedures in place for the assessment and processing of applications within the Gaeltacht areas of County Cork.  While preservation of the Irish language within Gaeltacht areas does not form part of the council's scheme of letting priorities for social housing, it is an issue the council would have regard to in the planning and acquisition of schemes and a member of the development management planning team has to attend the Gaeltacht planning working group organised by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in May 2021.<br/><br/>The housing department works closely with the two local approved housing bodies on nominations for both the capital assistance scheme, CAS, in B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh and Baile Bhuirne, but the ten units at Cluain R&eacute;idh, Baile Bhuirne, were allocated as normal via the choice-based letting system.  When the Cluain R&eacute;idh development was advertised, an extra line was added on choice-based lettings advising applicants that this development was within Cork's Gaeltacht area, if approved applicants wished to apply to live there.<br/><br/>Details of the scheme would also have been shared informally with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta which supports a number of local industries in the Gaeltacht area via the local authority's Irish officer and local councillors were also advised.  Efforts were made to encourage approved applicants who had an interest in living in the Gaeltacht area to apply.<br/><br/>It was thought that this might attract people who might not necessarily be fluent, but who had an interest in learning the language or in educating their children through Irish in the local schools.  However, interest was limited and all of the houses were allocated, but the majority of tenants came from outside Baile Bhuirne and were neither fluent nor interested in learning or speaking Irish.<br/><br/>There are three recent approved housing body developments in the Gaeltacht areas.  Cl&uacute;id has a ten-house scheme at Cluain R&eacute;idh completed in 2020.  Comhlacht Tithe S&oacute;isialta agus Forbairt an tSul&aacute;in has three houses in Baile Bhuirne under a CAS scheme under construction and Coiste Tithe Uibh Laoire Teoranta has three houses in B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, under the capital assistance scheme, completed in 2019.<br/><br/>This council also has a site in Baile Bhuirne that could accommodate 14 to 15 houses.  Some preliminary design was done for an initial phase of ten, but it was decided to put the project on hold as there was limited interest in the Cl&uacute;id development and the council was unsuccessful in attracting Irish language speakers to the scheme.  With regard to Baile Mhic &Iacute;re, Baile Bhuirne, there are 30 families on the housing list, of which only one person has given an interest in the Irish language as the reason of his or her choice.</p><p>Demand under recent schemes has been low.  There are 11 families on the housing list for B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh and, apart from units for older people, only three units have been provided in the last five years.  There is a table in our submission showing the offers made and refusals received in respect of social houses in the M&uacute;scra&iacute; area.  These figures are not out of line with the rest of the county.  Cork County Council has two properties on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire in its ownership.  We currently have nine applicants seeking housing on Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, eight of whom are living on the mainland and one of whom is living on the island.</p><p> Moving on to planning permissions granted for housing, the summary in our submissions shows that, within the Cork Gaeltacht areas of M&uacute;scra&iacute; and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, there were 148 grants of planning permission for individual housing units and developments of multiple units.</p><p> With regard to complaints in respect of the county development plan, the council acknowledges that a number of complaints about the plan and how the Gaeltacht areas are dealt with in different municipal districts were made in the media.  Chapter 16 deals with the overarching policy in respect of the Gaeltacht areas and includes a dedicated section on Gaeltacht and linguistic heritage.  The land use only approach for the lower order settlements of the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht villages and Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire are included in the appropriate municipal district volumes.  This council recognises the discontent expressed by people from the Gaeltacht in respect of State and local authority support, especially with regard to planning, houses and services, as shown through movements such as Todhcha&iacute; na Tuaithe.  Cork County Council is involved with the wider working group and liaises with the Irish officers, planners and relevant practitioners in other local authorities.  We continue to engage with stakeholders on how best to support the Gaeltacht communities.  This includes collaboration with local Gaeltacht groups such as comharchumainn and Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta and with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and local language planners.  Cork County Council has also worked with the local group Acadamh F&oacute;dhla in M&uacute;scra&iacute; to produce the award-winning M&uacute;scra&iacute; heritage plan, which was approved by the Minister.</p></speech>

D&uacute;irt daoine liom go raibh s&eacute; ar f&aacute;il i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in.  Is ar &eacute;igean a rinneadh aon tagairt do Ch&uacute;il Aodha sa phlean agus n&iacute; raibh tagairt ar bith do Chill na Martra ann.  C&eacute;n coinn&iacute;ollacha at&aacute; ann, n&oacute; c&eacute;n mhonat&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; ar bun ar thith&iacute;ocht, chun a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil tithe ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; nuair nach bhfuil seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge?  The development plan was apparently only available in English and made barely any reference to C&uacute;il Aodha and none to Cill na Martra.  What conditions are in place to make sure that Irish speakers have houses?  Cad at&aacute; ar bun chun a chinnti&uacute; gur f&eacute;idir le Gaeilgeoir&iacute; tithe a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht chun na gl&uacute;ine at&aacute; amach romhainn a choime&aacute;d san &aacute;it?

Cad at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an gcomhairle mar gheall air sin?  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil praghsanna tithe lasmuigh den bhaile ag dul in airde.  An bhfuil plean ann rud a dh&eacute;anamh mar gheall ar Airbnb agus cead plean&aacute;la?  Chomh maith leis sin, an bhfuil aon tith&iacute;ocht sh&oacute;isialta &aacute; cruth&uacute; ag Comhairle Contae Chiarra&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht in U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach n&oacute; i gCorca Dhuibhne?</p> <p>  Ina r&aacute;iteas, d&uacute;irt Moira Murrell go bhfuil coiste um polasa&iacute; strait&eacute;iseach na Gaeltachta ann agus go bhfuil pleananna, tionscadail agus polasa&iacute; eacnama&iacute;ochta &aacute; bhforbairt faoi phlean forbartha an chontae.

D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; iarracht gach ceist a fhreagairt ach freagr&oacute;idh m&eacute; as B&eacute;arla.  For the purposes of clarity and explaining our position properly, I would be comfortable answering in English.  The Deputy raised the bot&uacute;n made in respect of Pairceanna na Glas.  While this is a fine scheme that is housing quite a high number of Irish-speaking people in a Gaeltacht area, there was quite a lot of coverage over the name, Pairceanna na Glas.  Like any organisation, we learned from this.  In my opening statement, I outlined that we have done quite a number of things to strengthen our approach in respect of the Irish language.  A very important structure we have put in place is the three-person independent committee chaired by &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; hArg&aacute;in and including representatives from the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach and Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is Gaeltachts.  This committee will advise us in respect of specific matters in future.</p><p>One of the matters that comes under its remit is the naming of estates.  That has been a very important intervention.</p><p> Deputy Daly raised the issue of Airbnb.  I said in my opening statement that the level of short-term lets in a county like Kerry generally, and in Gaeltacht areas, comes into competition with the local community who are trying to acquire houses and raise their families.  They are the primary residents.  Killarney is an identified rent pressure zone in the county, so we have targeted it and we have seen the benefits of looking at the market and balancing around short-term lets.  It is our intention as a council to begin the same process as I have outlined in the west Kerry Gaeltacht.  We have done quite a lot of analysis on this and we can see there are a substantial number of properties and a very high number of short-term lets.  We believe those require further examination because they are being brought into direct conflict with local people trying to acquire and set up homes for themselves.</p><p> On some of the measures in the county development plan, as I set out, an awful lot of work is being done to try to support the Gaeltacht areas.  Deputy Daly will be aware we have multimillion euro schemes in development with regard to rural regeneration and Slea Head traffic management.  That project relates to tourism and we are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the tourism development plan, which includes the two Gaeltacht areas.  We are working with the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach task force, and a Gteic is being established there with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  There is also funding of &euro;40 million, with &euro;20 million for regeneration and another &euro;20 million in amenities for the broader Cahersiveen area.  All of that will support the Gaeltacht areas.  There is a huge volume of work being done there, along with the sean-n&oacute;s sa Daingean project, which is an-t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn and do gach duine sa Daingean.  There is an awful lot of work happening generally.</p><p> Looking specifically at the county development plan, we have put in a measure holding 66% of multi-unit developments for the Irish-speaking community.  That is a very important move.  We have moved from 31% in the current plan and there is no percentage in the current plan for U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach.  We are hoping that is another measure that will lead to support.  While we do not have infrastructure and we do not really have hope of infrastructure coming, either across the county or in the Gaeltacht areas in particular, it is important we try to facilitate some limited type of development and accommodation for local people.  We have identified four settlements, two in the U&iacute;bh R&aacute;thach Gaeltacht and two in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, that would facilitate small housing cluster developments with their own water and wastewater services.  We will try to encourage that and allow that within our county development plan in these four areas.  We are constantly trying to move and think of new ways of supporting our Gaeltacht areas.  In addition to the Irish officer, we have employed an Irish development officer for the county, who is looking at the Gaeltacht service town of Cahersiveen.  We have taken on this officer at a more senior grade because we need advice on how to develop and move.  We as a council need to keep moving to support the Gaeltacht and Gaeltacht communities.  That is the remit of the Irish development officer as well.</p><p> This has been an especially strong year for the development of Irish.  We are all aware that, during Covid, our communications and supports to communities have to be particularly strong.  We have been very focused on providing those supports and ensuring all that messaging is being provided through the medium of Irish.  We are very much focused on that.</p><p> The level of Irish was mentioned.  It currently stands at TEG leibh&eacute;al B2.  I hope that answers the ceist.</p></speech>

For the services being delivered at the local area office, we have staff who speak fluent Irish and are native speakers.  The obair laeth&uacute;il can be done in the area offices.  At this time, anybody who has submitted any part of their planning application to the council in Irish will receive all parts of the planning decision and everything that goes with that in Irish.  That is a very strong message we are sending as a council.  Was the Deputy&rsquo;s question about the social housing anomaly?</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the joint statement we received from the various councils was that clarity be sought from the Office of the Attorney General on the legal enforceability of conditions relating to the ability of occupants to speak the Irish language.  That probably relates to the Belgian decision.  My view is that extra flexibility can be given to Irish speakers from a cultural point of view when they are seeking planning permission sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.</p></speech>

In our case in Kerry at this time, it is a requirement under our county development plan that a person be local to receive planning permission.</p><p>You would hope that would support the language as there would be a reasonable expectation that the majority of people applying would be from the Gaeltacht.  In Kerry a seven-year occupancy clause applies and it is not specifically tied to the language because we are taking the view that if people are local and tied to the area that would suffice.  It is no different to any occupancy clause anywhere else in the county.  That is as far as we feel that the seven-year occupancy clause can apply.</p></speech>

On the issue of persons from the Gaeltacht obtaining planning permission in the Gaeltacht, we would point out that our policies support local members of the community receiving planning permission within their communities.  There is no disadvantage to being from the Gaeltacht when applying for permission there; it is to the contrary.  When we made our development plan and rural housing policies our line Department referred to them as being exemplary in giving effect to rural housing policies.  In that regard we have sought to bring those forward into our draft development plan, which will be completed in 2022, until such time as rural housing policy guidelines are updated, which we believe is imminent.  Within settlements there is no impediment on people from the Gaeltacht receiving planning permission and again our policies are based on supporting people living in their local communities, be that in a rural area or within settlements generally.</p> <p>  C&uacute;il Aodha was specifically mentioned.  In broad terms we are rationalising our settlement structure within the county, which has resulted in a number of settlements, not just in the Gaeltacht but countywide, having their development boundaries removed and C&uacute;il Aodha was one of those.  We have had discussions with our elected members about including a list of communities that have had their development boundaries removed, recognising that they continue to be communities and an important part of our county and they will still be recognised by the county council and eligible for supports where appropriate.  The advantage in the delivery of housing in the Gaeltacht for people from the Gaeltacht will be that the removal of the boundary will mean that only people from that local community could obtain planning permission there.  That is significant in terms of sustaining the local community and there could be a benefit there.  We worked with the local community when we commissioned the M&uacute;scra&iacute; heritage plan and there is significant discussion of each individual community and the overall issues of heritage and linguistics within the M&uacute;scra&iacute; Gaeltacht in that heritage plan.  If there are any holes in the countywide development plan we have sought to address those by commissioning this plan, which is the first of its kind.</p></speech>

Within both of the cases of areas of Meath, R&aacute;th Chairn and Baile Ghib, the majority of applications are from locals.  They must first meet local need and the planning requirements attached.  We also attach the linguistic impact study and the assessment of that for the candidate.  In both cases that is predominantly with support from Comharchumann na Gaeilge in R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib.  As the Deputy will see from some of the details given in the opening statement, the majority of our planning applications are one-off houses and we have a very high percentage of grants within that area.</p></speech>

The policy is there and we apply planning conditions in respect of same.  On wind power and strategic infrastructure development, we have not had any of such of that scale in the Gaeltacht so it is not something we would address, but there is a provision for community contribution and we would certainly consider it going towards language development or the development of Irish generally.</p> <p>  On social housing and the weighting for same, one of the comments we made in the common statement was that there is not a clear policy platform that allows us to give that weighting.  There is an issue on the national regulations governing the scheme of letting priorities which constrains us in many respects in doing that.  It would be our collective wish, to be honest, that that is changed and that, ultimately, there would be a national policy platform specifically to work for that.</p></speech>

That is the constant conflict between the social housing policy and the planning policy when it comes to Gaeltacht areas.  There is an issue there which we have jointly put before the committee today.<br/><br/>On wind farms, we contribute 20% to the national grid in Kerry and that is primarily based in the north of the county.  We do not have the grid in our Gaeltacht areas but there are very significant works being done on the Dingle Peninsula with communities around energy generation.  In our draft plan we have made very strong commitments to micro energy generation which is, of course, community led and is the type of development we want to encourage.  We see that very much playing a part of the plan into the future.  I would strongly say that will be community led.  This will also help with language and in keeping some of the community funds as they are generated so that they will go back to the community.<br/><br/>On the Gaeltacht areas, I outlined previously to Deputy Moynihan that, similar to Cork, our Gaeltacht policy is around planning in the rural area.  It is a rural policy, pertains to the Gaeltacht area, and is very much about local people being facilitated to build a house in their local area.  It is strongly tied, therefore, to being local to the area.  While this is not specific to the Gaeltacht area <i>per se</i>, it is linked very much to the local people so that the impact is the same for both areas with a similar outcome.<br/><br/>On the multi-unit question, our draft plan is make a 66% allocation across the two Gaeltacht areas specifically for Irish speakers.<br/><br/>On the mapping question, we have identified this mapping on our county development plan and in our draft county development plan and have mapped these areas.  Is &eacute; sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

These are people with an intrinsic connection with the language, a social and economic connection with the local area, whether it is a townland or a parish, or with the catchment area of the local school that one attended.  This applies in particular to the sons and daughters of farmers in the first instance and to those who are living for more than seven years in the area, returning emigrants or people who have a real and direct link to the social and economic life of rural areas.</p><p>That is what strengthens the opportunity for anybody who is from those areas and is a native Irish speaker or is from the area and may not be a fluent speaker but who has an interest in Irish language, culture and heritage.  All of our development policies in terms of rural housing support those who are local and can sustain the Gaeltacht areas in that way.  There is no question of our policies in that regard lacking in that way.  When one looks at the planning permissions granted that were mentioned, 148 of which were new dwellings and 165 of which included demolitions, rebuilds and some change of uses into houses, and one links that to three refusals over the period we have shown the committee, it clearly shows there is a very supportive planning policy in place.  Those refusals were on specific issues.  One could have been potentially in relation to wastewater treatment, which I will come to.</p><p> There are significant challenges, not just in Ballingeary but outside of the Gaeltacht area and through a range of villages that are deficient, to some or a very significant degree, in water and wastewater infrastructure.  It is not all of them but quite a few of them.  That is certainly a challenge to sustaining rural communities, not just Gaeltacht communities.  It is a challenge to Ballingeary, in particular.</p><p> It does not come directly within the remit of local government.  We clearly run the water services, in conjunction with Irish Water, but the capital investment programme that drives the improvement of water and wastewater facilities in those types of areas is driven by the availability of the funding at a national level to Irish Water and how it carves that up to meet its criteria for where investment should go for water services.</p><p> That is the particular issue there.  If one looks at our development plan, we have gone through every individual settlement, including those in the Gaeltacht, and we can show clearly where there is capacity or some capacity or where capacity is to be delivered in the next six years, within the lifetime of our next development plan.  I suggest that Ballingeary is one that is challenged in that way.</p><p> Where there is a community fund or a contribution from a wind farm developer who has received planning permission and is developing out, generally they are administered through the establishment of a local community group.  This group works and determines, in conjunction with the wind farm operator or developer, its priorities for the area.  We do not have a role in that.  I do not know the particulars and we should not discuss them here, but certainly, if there are particular ones Deputy Moynihan wishes to take up with us after the meeting to get a deeper understanding, we are happy to do so.  However, the community funds are there for the purpose of ensuring it is the community who influences how that spend is allocated and on what programmes, etc.  There should be opportunity there, subject to the appropriate consultation by the developers with the community and in the right framework.</p></speech>

My understanding is the question was why Gaeltachta&iacute; were not similarly mapped and decisions did not reflect the fact persons were from the Gaeltacht.  The Deputy will find from the long statement that our new development plan, with the amendments, would put a significant emphasis on the Gaeltacht and Gaeltacht communities in response both to submissions we have received and to our own council members and their views.  That is more from a cultural heritage perspective.  In terms of the decision-making process and mapping, our rural housing policy decision-making process, reflected by the mapping, is very much faithful and reflects the regulatory system provided for in the section 28 ministerial guidelines.  We have sought to focus on delivering housing to members of the local rural community, be they in the Gaeltacht or otherwise.  It has the positive effect in the Gaeltacht of local persons benefiting from grants and planning permission, which is reflected in our statistics.  We are very much reflecting the section 28 guidelines in that regard.</p></speech>

We recognise we have an obligation to try to attract Irish speakers to any schemes that are available.  Demand is low and social housing developments have been limited over recent times in Gaeltacht areas.  We have set out our experience with the most recent scheme of ten houses in Baile Bhuirne.  We try to attract Irish speakers, either local speakers or those coming into the area who might have had an interest in being housed in that scheme.  However, interest has been limited and that will certainly impact on future plans for social housing in the Gaeltacht area.</p></speech>

I referred to B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh in terms of water and wastewater capacity in the village, for which we have an objective.  In Baile Mhic &Iacute;re and Baile Bhuirne, we have an objective to grow both of those settlements in the order of approximately 30 dwellings each in the next six years, but the fact is we have identified there is no wastewater capacity in B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh and no drinking water capacity in Baile Mhic &Iacute;re and Baile Bhuirne.  That is the challenge that is faced, which is common to quite a few villages and settlements throughout the county and the country.

I suppose that is easy to say.  Some are more easily delivered than others.  We would certainly welcome the standardisation of the Irish tests.  I do not that should be beyond the wit of man.  It should also not be beyond the wit of man to make some provision for social housing.  One point we are trying to make through the common statement is that there are a number of anomalies we have to operate with.  A member previously raised the question of preference or priority being given to Gaeilgeoir&iacute;.  The Planning and Development Acts do not make provision for such preference to be given.  The reality is that the more oppressive force here is rural housing policy because of the inherently rural character of the majority of our Gaeltachta&iacute;.  With regard to affordability issues, with the exception of M&uacute;scra&iacute; and R&aacute;th Chairn, the majority of Gaeltacht areas are coastal communities, which brings pressure in respect of affordability, demand and so on.  There are also limitations with regard to the planning regulations.  It is frustrating that, while we can apply language conditions, the enforcement of them is dubious at best.  I certainly would not like to sit in front of a High Court judge arguing that somebody should be thrown out of a house because they were not in compliance with the condition, whether at the time of sale or afterwards.  We operate them reasonable effectively but they operate in a sort of lacuna.</p> <p>  It is more about that overall consideration.  That is why we welcome the working group and this engagement with the committee for this high-level strategic view of the issues.  The biggest problems in the Gaeltacht areas, as in gach ceantar tuaithe eile, are fosta&iacute;ocht agus tith&iacute;ocht.  The simple reality is that housing has become a problem.  In our case, affordability has become a particular problem.  We welcome this engagement and would welcome a common approach being taken at national level.</p></speech>

Of the eight joint recommendations, are there any in particular to which the witnesses would like to draw the attention of the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Lucey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021120100002#O00200"><p>Seeing as we are in public session I think we should read the recommendations into the record.  I will come back to what I view as the three more important ones that underpin everything.</p> <p>  The first recommendation is formalisation of membership and terms of reference for the working group on Gaeltacht planning matters, which was referred to earlier and was established earlier this year by the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Further work is needed on that.  As Mr. Walsh said, having that in place would be of significant value to local government and national Departments in order to work through these matters.</p> <p>  Second is the introduction of statutory guidelines by the Minister under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to specifically address housing and physical planning policy in Gaeltacht areas, as well as mechanisms for the implementation and enforcement of such policies.  That is critical because it is the basis upon which we can then take those guidelines at a local level and structure them in a manner that reflects the issues that are facing the various Gaeltacht areas, both commonly across the country and at a local level.  Without those, we do not have a basis for either a common approach of any nature or for an individual approach to the matters that are most particular to our two Gaeltacht areas here in Cork, or specific Gaeltacht areas in other counties.</p> <p>  Third, consideration should be given to the preparation of statutory local area plans for all Gaeltacht areas by local authorities, in consultation with the local communities and the relevant national agencies, such as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That would certainly be of benefit.  It is a further manifestation of the local importance and local expression at a deeper level of what is important or intrinsic to a Gaeltacht area in a local area plan.</p> <p>  The fourth recommendation, which has been referred to, is for the use by all local authorities of a national certified method to assess linguistic competency.</p> <p>  Fifth is the introduction of national standards and guidelines regarding linguistic impact statements.</p> <p>  The sixth and seventh recommendations, in conjunction with the second, are critical.  One could argue that there is no point in having a national certified method to assist linguistic competency, or national standards and guidelines regarding linguistic impact statements, unless the legality of applying them in some way is assured.  We recommend the introduction of specific provisions in the social housing legislation that would allow for the prioritisation of Irish speakers in the allocation of social housing in Gaeltacht areas.  On the planning side of things, we recommend that clarity be sought from the Office of the Attorney General on the constitutionality and legal enforceability of conditions of that nature relating to the ability of occupants of certain properties to speak the Irish language.  Without those two critical things being clarified in legal terms, we will have difficulty in applying things that are not enforceable.  A non-enforceable condition is a worthless one.</p> <p>  The final recommendation relates to affordability issues, to which Mr. Walsh has referred.  We recommend the introduction of specific affordability measures in Gaeltacht areas.  We recognise that there is an affordable housing scheme and a strong commitment from Government to affordable housing but perhaps there could be a further definition of that for Gaeltacht areas.  Recommendations 2, 6 and 7 are the key ones that can enable local government to assist, in a more structured way, the sustainability of our Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  I would like to clarify one thing regarding the matters Deputy Moynihan raised.  There is no question of any disadvantage in any way for native Irish speakers or those from Gaeltacht areas in getting planning permission in those areas.  In fact, it is of benefit to have rural planning policies that recognise intrinsic cultural, language and social links to a local rural area.  That is of advantage to those who are in the area, as opposed to being a disadvantage.</p> <p>  On the mapping issue, we are on our final amendments to our draft development plan and we will be publishing that in early January.  As stated in the appendix to our submission, we will be mapping the two Gaeltacht areas in Cork county.  It is important to note that while they might not be mapped in the hard copy of the development plan at the moment, the mapping of all the Gaeltacht areas appears in our geographic information system, GIS, which is what we use for development management purposes and assessing planning applications.</p></speech>

It is hard to differentiate the eight recommendations but from our perspective here in Meath, if we were to rank them in order, we would see recommendations 2, 4 and 5 as the most specific to us.  The section 28 guidelines speak for themselves across the board.  On recommendations 4 and 5, having an independent authority that can assess the linguistic assessments for applicants would be extremely beneficial for the future development of both the language and the culture in both the very small Gaeltachta&iacute; we have.  If we were to rank them in order those would be our three preferences to be dealt with first.  We welcome the establishment by the Department of the working group.  We hope that work would continue into next year in order to take these recommendations further and bring them to a conclusion.  I thank the members for their time.</p></speech>

All the recommendations are interlinked.  The important thing is that there is a working group in place.  If anything, some of the considerations show that the county development plan is not the place to solve all issues.  Support is needed through changes to national legislation, clarification and regulation, as well as through support and implementation, be that with regard to the level required for the Irish language competency or the linguistic impact statement.  In delivering those services on the ground, it is very important that we have standards that we can all stand over.  For the validity of any process, it is good to have standards and guidelines in place.</p></speech>

We will possibly look at some form of social and affordable housing in An Rinn but as of now there is no clear scheme in place, other than the general provision of planning permission for a scheme; in other words that 10% of the housing be affordable.  Beyond that there is no scheme in place and we will not have too much development that would deliver significant numbers of units in An Rinn under that category where 10% of the units have to be affordable.</p> <p>  I refer to the tithe samhraidh.  We would see the vacancies as predominantly being summer houses.  We can put the language conditions on a property but as houses become older they are sold on the open market and it is generally first come first served in terms of price.  The second house market in An Rinn is being ruled out for first-time buyers and many locals because of price.  We would look at the local need requirements for somebody applying for planning permission for a summer house.  We would include the Irish language competency in that.  We do not allow new summer houses to be built in that context.</p></speech>

We are probably three quarters of the way through our draft development plan and we have had 1,400 submissions to it.  The development plan period is about 99 weeks and we have had 64 direct meetings with our councillors during that time.  That would reflect what every local authority does but there is a significant benefit to having public submissions come in because the plans shape matters for a period of six to eight years.</p> <p>  On B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, the sooner there is a resolution to the wastewater and water service facilities there, the better from our point of view and from the point of view of those who wish to live in an Ghaeltacht.  It is not something that I or the county council have control of; it is a matter that would need to be put to Irish Water in terms of its capital investment programme.  I cannot answer for that directly.  That is not avoiding the question but I have no legal authority to deliver water services; investment decisions are made elsewhere.</p> <p>  On planning policy and rural housing guidelines, we understand that the publication of new rural housing guidelines is imminent.  Maybe members of the committee will have more information on whether the specific issues we are raising here, including an Ghaeltacht and more supportive and definitive rural policy guidelines that support Gaeltacht areas, would be incorporated into that.  I am uncertain on that and I do not expect that there will be.  Let us wait and see what emerges.</p> <p>  We are aware of the R&aacute;th Chairn issue and our recommendations underpin that matter.  Michael Walsh said mentioned holiday homes and our Gaeltachta&iacute; are in rural areas that are either under strong urban influence or that could be classified as going through a period of rural diversification in tourism.  Even in those areas we would not grant planning permission for one-off houses or holiday homes.  Our policies do not provide for that.  </p></speech>

The local authority is pursuing that.  It is primarily once-off housing in the Gaeltacht.  That is reflective of the lack of infrastructure and water and wastewater infrastructure throughout our Gaeltacht area, which is reflected in many other rural areas in the county.  Our rural policy in those areas is that one has to be intrinsically linked to the area, such as being a son, daughter or landholder.  Our plans do not support or countenance speculative development or non-family-home second home development.</p> <p>  We are drafting the development plan review and we are out for public consideration.  Similar to what Mr. Lucey was saying, we have had numerous meetings.  Public engagement is hugely important.  I spoke earlier about the small cluster development we have included in the draft county development plan which is in some way to address the housing need we note is there and allow some form of development where we know we do not have water or wastewater provision.</p> <p>  With regard to the affordable housing scheme, outside of An Daingean itself we do not have multi-unit developments.  The water and wastewater is the inhibitor in that.  The affordable template would only apply in that context.  Outside of that category, a development would not qualify under the current scheme of affordability.</p></speech>

With reference to the most recent court case in R&aacute;th Chairn, because both of our Gaeltachts are very rural areas, its predominantly one-off, local applicants who apply.  That was the first multiple application we received in R&aacute;th Chairn.  Meath County Council refused that planning application and it was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which granted the application subsequently, the outcome of which is known.  There has been no further engagement as yet with the applicant on the site.  Obviously, if the applicant can address some issues, the applicant can return with the application.  I made a point earlier on recommendations four and five.  Our desire has always been to have a third-party independent assessment of the linguistic testing and the resulting case proves our point to a certain extent.  If the working group was to continue and take those things on board and that was to develop, it certainly would aid our ability to decide planning applications more favourably disposed towards promoting Irish language and culture within our Gaeltachts.  We will have to wait and see the further advancement of that application, or not.</p></speech>

I welcome all of them and thank them for the massive amount of work they have put into the county development plan, on which they are still working.  I appreciate all the work the councillors in Kerry are doing in that regard.  It is a very busy time.  I was involved in it at least three times.  I understand what goes on and the long hours.</p> <p>  Planning is a big issue in many parts of our county and it is a big issue in the Gaeltacht areas, because of the considerable scenery and views to be had.  While some people may not want any houses in areas like that, along the Gaeltacht in Cahersiveen or Dingle, people must put a roof over their heads.  The one ambition that every young fella and young girl has is to put a roof over their heads, to start a family and to rear their family in the area in which they were brought up.</p> <p>  Recognition has to be given to that and I welcome what Ms Murrell said about people looking for planning permission.  The one place I hope the objective is adhered to that they have to have family links, because sites and planning are in demand in those areas because of the reason I outlined.  However, we must see after young locals to ensure our culture, heritage and language in those areas is continued.  As it has been handed down to the present generation, we want to hand it on to the generations to come.</p> <p>  The big worry that I have is objectors.  When Kerry County Council finally grants permission and they go through the further information process and all that is satisfied, lo and behold, someone from outside the area objects to someone getting planning to put a roof over his or her head.  It is wrong and I worry about that.</p> <p>  I have no problem with people who have genuine reasons or are local and a new house would be impeding them in some way.  However, I take someone from outside of the parish or the county objecting to young people getting planning permission like this to be criminal.  I abhor that kind of action.  It is usually by people who are not working, have plenty of time on their hands and are on the dole and getting money for nothing, without doing any work for it.  That is the kind of person who usually objects.</p> <p>  There is a problem with short-term letting in some parts of the country.  However, in many parts of Kerry, a house close to or on a farm is being rented out for a short time to make up the yearly income and help a family along the way when it is not making the income it should from farming.  This is a help.</p><p>Those people should be left alone and allowed to carry on because many of these houses, if they were not being let or having some such use, would become derelict in a very short time.  They could not be maintained or their doors kept open if they were not allowed to do that.</p><p> I welcome and appreciate all of our guests who have attended here or on Zoom and I hope that they will continue the great work in the future that they have all been doing.</p></speech>

Certainly, I have probably addressed these issues already and I outlined in my opening statement that, taking the Gaeltacht area, we have granted 80% of all the applications that have been made to us on the once-off rural housing.  The Deputy also mentioned that these are very sensitive and fragile areas with many environmental and archaeological designations within them.  We try very much to find a balance between sustainable planning development and being aware and very much trying to facilitate local people who are trying to provide homes for themselves.  In the opening statement I also showed where quite a high number of these particular planning applications would appear to have been transitioning into permanent houses and homes in the Gaeltacht areas for people which is the objective which we are all trying to reach.</p> <p>  On the short-term lettings, I totally take the point that it is not something that is across the board.  It is targeted in those areas where it is competing with permanent homes, is driving prices up and is taking homes away from the local population.  I mentioned in this context the west Kerry Gaeltacht, where we are going in and examining the position.  There will be cases which will be fine and will be perfectly acceptable to the planning authority but it certainly warrants an examination where it is going into direct competition with the local property market.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the chairperson designate of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, Mr. Gareth Llewellyn, to the meeting.  You are most welcome, Mr. Llewellyn.  Thank you for agreeing to attend at such short notice.  It is good that you are coming before us so early after your appointment.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House campus to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  </p> <p>  I invite Mr. Llewellyn to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank both the Chair and the members of the committee for the kind invitation to join them today.  I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to engage with them on the important role TII plays in delivering sustainable transport infrastructure and services across Ireland.<br/><br/>I was both delighted and honoured to be offered the role of chair designate of TII by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on 23 November last.  I was invited to attend the TII board meeting on that day and I extend my thanks and gratitude to my predecessor, Mr. Cormac O&rsquo;Rourke, for his outstanding stewardship of the organisation.<br/><br/>I thought it may be helpful to start by outlining my background and experience, particularly as it relates to the role of the chair of TII.  As members will have no doubt deduced from my surname, I am Welsh.  I studied at Swansea University, following which I undertook research at Southampton University.  I have leadership training through Harvard Business School, with more recent training in digital transformation from the University of Cambridge Judge Business School and corporate finance training from Columbia University in the United States. <br/><br/>I spent my early career in the public sector with the UK&rsquo;s Environment Agency and its predecessor, the National Rivers Authority.  In 2000, I joined the global energy business, National Grid plc, where, among other roles, I was group director responsible for safety, health and sustainability for operations across the US, Latin America, Australia, Africa and the UK.  I undertook the same role for the global mining business, Anglo American plc, following which I became executive director for safety, technical and engineering for Network Rail, the owner of the rail infrastructure in Britain.</p></speech>

In March 2016, I became the chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, a government trading fund delivering services to over 40 million customers.  I retired from that role in December of last year.</p> <p>  I have also been fortunate to have a parallel non-executive career.  I floated the waste management company, Biffa plc, where I chaired the board HSE committee and I set up the UK&rsquo;s Renewable Fuels Agency where I chaired the audit and risk committee.  I am currently a non-executive director and chair of the remuneration and nominations committee at Harwich Haven Authority, where we provide the pilots for the world&rsquo;s largest container ships arriving at the Port of Felixstowe.  I fulfil the same role at Sage Housing, a private equity-backed provider of high-quality, affordable and social housing in England.  For the past 16 years, I have been a fellow at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, providing training for businesses on issues such as net zero carbon, human rights and commercialising sustainable development.</p> <p>  My infrastructure experience has been reasonably extensive, ranging from overhead power lines in the UK, undersea power cables in Australia, a new port in Brazil, rail infrastructure in the UK to deepening the channel in the North Sea to accommodate future growth in container ships.</p> <p>  With regard to corporate governance, my experience ranges from establishing a new government agency, chairing board committees in both the private and the private equity sectors, chairing a government trading fund until I appointed an independent chair and as a member of governance committees for two global listed companies.  I hope my experience on safety, standards and sustainability will be of benefit to TII as takes its next step on its journey.</p> <p>  I was told previous to the meeting that the committee is interested in hearing my views on the strategic priorities while in the role.  I need to preface any views I may offer by informing the committee I was appointed nine days ago.  As such, I am very early on in my assessment of the expectations placed on TII and the overall governance arrangements needed to ensure TII is successful.  Therefore, please take the following statements as my very early views.</p><p>The first area is the national development plan, NDP.  As this committee knows better than anybody, the NDP was published in October 2021 and sets out the development activities for national roads and public transport projects that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, will address between 2021 and 2030.  It should be recognised that, of course, TII is first and foremost a delivery organisation working in collaboration with local authorities while taking its lead from both the Department of Transport on national roads and national greenways, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, in regard to both the Luas and MetroLink. </p><p> In an ideal world, funding would be made available to support all projects irrespective of their stage of development.  However, TII must operate within the funding made available and will take its lead from the Department of Transport and the NTA in determining where investment should be best made to achieve value for money and to deliver more sustainable transport infrastructure and services. </p><p> Against this backdrop, however, maintaining the assets we already have across the road and Luas rail network is essential for the safety of users, maintaining the value of those assets and ensuring continuity of service delivery.  TII&rsquo;s knowledge of the condition of assets, being proactive in their maintenance and, where needed, renewal, will reduce the risk as well as the inconvenience to the travelling public and the risk of significant additional investment associated with asset failure; that is the one thing one needs to avoid.  Maintaining existing assets is both common sense and good value.  Unfortunately, it does not result in too many photo opportunities, which is some of the downside.  </p><p> When it comes to new infrastructure, whether it be a new road or light rail, such as MetroLink, for example, I am very conscious that external factors can often result in delays adding cost to the project and leaving the public waiting longer than expected before they see improvements in travel.  TII has a proven history of delivering projects and the skills and capability to deliver the new infrastructure.  It will need to work closely with stakeholders to ensure any potential delays at all stages in the process are minimised.  </p><p> The second area is the carbon action plan.  The conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, recently reinforced at COP26, serve to highlight the importance of a transition to net zero carbon by 2050 if we are to keep global temperature increases to below 1.5&deg;C.  In keeping with the EU&rsquo;s Fit for 55, the Government has set a target for a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030.  Road transport is, at present, responsible for around 18% of Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  In playing its role in reducing this impact, TII will work closely with the Department of Transport and others. </p><p> For example, modal shift from personal vehicles to public transport and active travel, demand management interventions and changes to infrastructure design.  Accommodating growth in electric, hybrid and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles require policy interventions, investment in infrastructure and new services.  All represent a sizeable challenge and TII will need to assess how its obligations in the NDP can deliver the required change.  With its highly professional and capable workforce, TII will play an important role in facilitating the change and delivering the carbon reduction targets.  </p><p> The third area is road safety strategy.  As the committee knows, TII has a duty to deliver a safe and efficient national road network and a strategic goal to improve the safety of light rail.  The safety of transport users, of our colleagues and of our contractors and partners is of paramount importance.  Everyone has a right to get home safe at the end of every day.  That is very simple.  In addition to its maintenance, renewal and enhancement of infrastructure and its management of the road and light rail network, TII will deliver projects and programmes to support the soon to be published road safety strategy. </p><p> As we seek to encourage active travel, embedding the safe systems approach into TII&rsquo;s design standards and guidance documents will be important for enhancing safety for vulnerable road users. </p><p>One safety enhancement currently being implemented is the dynamic traffic management system on the M50.  I understand that the Chair and members of this committee visited the motor operations control centre to gain an understanding of the project to inform its scrutiny of the legislation that will make the variable speed limits and lane closures enforceable.  I hope members found that visit useful and, of course, members are more than welcome to visit again should they need to. </p><p> From a finance perspective, in the annual report in 2020, TII acknowledged the support from both the outgoing Minister and the current Minister, Deputy Ryan, given the impact Covid-19 had on income, particularly in relation to tolling and light rail operations.  With the reintroduction of some restrictions, income is again likely to be affected during 2021 and into 2022.  TII will continue to ensure its activities are delivered as efficiently as it can, thereby keeping any further recourse to public funds to a minimum.  </p><p> The precise timing of expenditure for multi-year capital programmes can be uncertain.  Projects can be subject to delays in the planning process as well as unexpected factors which arise during construction.  TII will continue to engage with stakeholders to reduce any such delays and will continually improve programme planning to optimise the allocation of resources. </p><p> I will turn to my final area which is around governance for success.  As I mentioned to the board when they met on 23 November, my primary goal as chair is to ensure TII is successful in delivering its statutory responsibilities and its obligations under the NDP.  In this regard, I see the board as having three critical roles: to ensure the organisation&rsquo;s strategy aligns with TII&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities and Government priorities and is deliverable within the funding envelope; to ensure the executive benefit from access to the counsel, guidance and advice of the talented non-executive directors on the TII board; and to ensure TII efficiently delivers infrastructure and services which stand the test of time, contribute to reducing carbon and keep the travelling public safe whether they travel by light rail or road.  </p><p> Through discussions prior to my appointment, I have the sense that existing governance arrangement and capability of colleagues at TII are both held in high regard.  That said, of course, the future always involves an element of change, and ensuring the governance model is set up for success will be a key focus for me. </p><p> I thank the committee for its time and I am, of course, very happy to answer any questions as best I can.</p></speech>

It is clear he has much experience in both the public and private sectors, both in executive and non-executive roles, in particular, chairing, and they are all skills he can bring to the role he has.  If it is not too rude to ask, why TII?  How did Mr. Llewellyn - a person who does not appear to have any Irish connections, either in his CV or otherwise - end up here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#C00400"><p>I was once told that the Welsh were Irish with wet feet, so there are some common connections.  I have been asked the question that the Senator just asked numerous times over the last couple of weeks.  I will give him the same answer I have been giving, that there are three reasons.  One reason is the commonality of purpose.  Having a sustainable transport network has such an impact on all of the priorities within the NDP.  It improves access for people to get education, healthcare, access to public services and for employment reasons.  If it is delivered sustainably, it has a better impact on the environment and it has a huge impact on the economy.  My view of sustainable transport aligns with where TII is heading, which is important to me.  The second reason is that there is enough challenge here.  I have always worked in businesses where, in many cases, the organisation has been in distress.  That is not the case with TII, but there is a challenge here with MetroLink and some of the investments that we have coming.  There is a sufficient challenge for me to feel as though it is a good organisation to join.  The third bit is if I can add value, and if I cannot, then the Senator is probably talking to the wrong person.  However, from the experience I have had working around the world with some very big companies, but also working in the public sector, I can add some value to both the board and in mentoring the executive as well.  With those things in mind, I looked at TII and thought that it was something worth applying for.</p></speech>

I wish to bring to bear all his experience, the mix of public and private both in the UK and abroad, on a few of the points I wish to raise, in particular what he thinks he might bring to the role in trying to speed up the never-ending saga that is the Luas extension and MetroLink.  Parts of north Dublin, the airport and so on are crying out for that and it seems it is disappearing further into the future every week or every month.  When does Mr. Llewellyn see the first passenger on MetroLink, and is there anything he can do to speed up that process or any interventions he can make that may help speed it up?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00400"><p>Yes, I know, but I simply do not know.  Let me start in a slightly different place.  The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge was the largest of its type anywhere in the world.  Yes, there were a few issues with it, but there normally are when something new of that type and at that scale is built.  TII has won international awards for that delivery.  That tells me that the management there knows how to deliver complex projects, and we know that MetroLink will be a very big, complex project.  When it is clear in the national development plan, NDP, that there is a 2:1 investment in favour of public transport, it means MetroLink is very important, not just for Dublin but for Ireland more generally.  People who live elsewhere in Ireland will come in through Dublin Airport, and access onto other forms of transport is needed.</p> <p>  The one thing I would reflect on, given the scale of these projects, is that the more that can be done early during the scheme design with experts sitting around the table, the better placed you will be to put the right contracts out for procurement and to manage those contracts going forward.  I will give the Senator a good example.  If you are standing on a platform and there is a metro train coming in two minutes' time, that information needs to be connected into the central control room, which then needs to be connected into the signalling system and the trains themselves.  That type of interface and the overall system integration needs to be defined right at the start, because if it is not got right, you end up with inevitable delays and cost overruns as the programme is implemented.  My advice to TII, therefore, and my stance is to make sure it gets in place experts on this in the organisation now, not in two years' time, in order that it will have the right scheme design and that, when the contracts go out, it will be clear to the people bidding what those interfaces need to be in order that they can be managed successfully from day one.  If that is not done, I think there will be, as I said, cost overruns and the projects will be delayed further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1696" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00500"><p>It is very important that MetroLink is prioritised.  Not only is it very important for the entire region involved and the airport, but it also touches on what Mr. Llewellyn is talking about: sustainability, modal shift, reducing emissions and so on.  The number of people driving to Dublin Airport and parking there and the number of people who are not able to use public transport to get there is phenomenal.  Post pandemic, MetroLink will be very important.</p> <p>  I will make a final point, if I may.  As for metro safety, Mr. Llewellyn talked about the safety of light rail.  Did he mean interaction with cars or the passenger experience on board of thuggish or antisocial behaviour?</p> <p>  As for road safety, Mr. Llewellyn talked about demand management interventions, not just on the M50 but generally.  I know that in the UK there are average speeds on many motorways over long distances, which I do not think we have here.</p> <p>  I also wish to touch on the issue of the N20.  I am sure many other members will touch on it.  There was a large article in a newspaper at the weekend about it being the most dangerous road, that is, the road with the highest number of fatalities in recent years.  What does Mr. Llewellyn think he might be able to do to improve not only light rail safety on the carriages and in its interaction with everything else but also road safety generally?  It has improved a lot but there is room for further improvement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00600"><p>There is quite a lot in those questions.  I will do my best to answer them.</p> <p>  When I was at Network Rail, I was as much concerned with the passenger on the train as I was with anybody interacting with the train.  It does not really matter who you are; the whole purpose is to make sure those people are safe.  That extended not only to understanding at what point in the year we would see broken or buckled rails or signals passed at danger, SPADs, in certain parts, but also to people's behaviour around level crossings, for example.  We would have a significant number of serious incidents in which cars would deliberately circumvent the barriers at level crossings and come into contact with trains or have near misses.  There is a lot of behavioural change involved there.  It is very similar to being on a tram system.  How do you persuade a cyclist not to cycle across or in front of a tram, for example?  I have worked with those sorts of safety interventions for a chunk of my career at Network Rail.  I do not make a distinction between the passenger and the people outside.  They are all just as valuable.</p> <p>  The Senator's second question was, I think, about the N20-M20.  Is that right?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1696" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00700"><p>Yes.  There was a large article in a weekend newspaper about how dangerous that road is and how many fatalities have taken place on it.  What can TII do to improve that?  Obviously, the M20 is a bigger project, but even in the short term, what can be done to the N20 to reduce the number of fatalities on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00800"><p>Nine days into my role, the Senator will be surprised to know that I do not know an inordinate amount about the N20.  I know that the road from Limerick to Cork, as he rightly says, has some serious safety issues.  TII has a duty to provide a safe and efficient road network, so road safety is a core part of what it does.  As I understand it, the upgrade from the N20 to the M20 is in the NDP, so it is a project that will go ahead.  I understand that the preferred route will be known in the early part of next year and the business case will follow thereafter.  Clearly, if there is anything TII believes needs to happen in the short term to improve serious safety issues, no doubt it will look at that, but I have not investigated that so far.</p></speech>

Mr. Llewellyn also referred to demand management.  Does that mean tolling or not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D00950"><p>I have been very liberal with the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#D01000"><p>Demand management can involve a mixture of things.  I am thinking specifically about the M50.  If there are nearly 1,200 incidents per year on that motorway, about 22 per week, and the average time for which traffic is disrupted is nearly half an hour, with some incidents lasting more than three hours, there is serious work to do there.  At the moment TII can only put up advisory signs, as the Senator will probably know, and people's general view of advisory signs is that their advice is optional and that there is no enforcement behind them.  You need to put power behind that because if there is a broken-down car in a particular lane, you need to be able to get services to that car very quickly to guarantee the safety of those people and get the traffic flowing again.  It is the same when it comes to adverse weather.  Then demand management at peak times is important because, otherwise, you effectively just create a bottleneck for people and delay them getting to their destinations.</p> <p>  If something is not done about demand management, it is worthwhile thinking about what the consequences will be.  You will see more safety issues so, effectively, you are saying you are prepared to tolerate people being injured or killed.  That is not a good thing.  If you want to avoid that congestion, the only other option is to build more motorways.  It seems to me that building more motorways in that context would represent poor value for money because all you would be doing is trying to build a new motorway to increase capacity at peak times.  It would not be needed at any other time of the day.  That form of demand management through enforceable, variable speed limits and dynamic management is very important.  The dynamic bit is important, of course, because you do not know when it will be required, where it will be required or for how long.  That could take you across jurisdictional boundaries, so it is important to understand the role TII has there in the context of being a road traffic organisation.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

We do not have any role in stopping his appointment.  There are a number of challenges.  Mr. Llewellyn appeared before the UK Parliament's transport committee on 25 November 2020, almost a year ago to this day, and spoke about the issues of the merger of government organisations and road safety.</p> <p>  I will begin with the issue of road safety and the Cork-Limerick motorway, to which Senator Horkan referred.  Will that be a priority for TII to develop?</p></speech>

The aim is to have a preferred route identified early next year and the business case will follow thereafter.  I could not conclude what that business case will say and whether the board will be prepared to support it.  It would not be a priority if it was not in the national development plan.</p></speech>

That is the case for a number of reasons.</p> <p>  The TII's record on road safety is very good.  Mr. Llewellyn spoke about a parliamentary committee meeting in his opening remarks.  People did not notice how they arrived safely at that meeting.  That is the case when people arrive at other people's houses.  The M20, the Cork-Limerick motorway, has become a source of many accidents.  There have, tragically, been deaths on the road as a consequence of the camber of the road being poor and the road design being less than adequate for a modern traffic network and connectivity.  I hope Mr. Llewellyn will prioritise that.</p> <p>  In the context of road safety, how does Mr. Llewellyn see the TII working with the Road Safety Authority in promoting and ensuring we have safety on our roads?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#E00500"><p>I made those remarks to the committee because, for the majority of us, virtually every time we arrive somewhere, it has been a safe journey.  It is easy to forget the amount of effort that lies behind that to ensure road users arrive safely at their destinations.  The Road Safety Authority will play a critical role in that regard.  It is, effectively, mirroring what I did in my previous executive role, that is, making sure vehicles are safe to drive, people have the right skills to be able to drive properly, and there is enforcement for anybody who wishes to circumvent the rules.  We also need a safe road network because road conditions matter.  The road speed limit also matters and we need people to comply with those limits.  There is quite a strong interaction with the Road Safety Authority.  From everything I hear when talking to my colleagues in TII, there is a good working relationship between the two bodies.  I am keen for that to continue because there is not one single organisation in Ireland or the UK that has a total impact on safety.  It is a collective effort.</p></speech>

As Mr. Llewellyn has said, there are situations where speed limits are set.  Would he be in favour of a moving speed limit on roads other than the M50?</p></speech>

We would need to see whether that initiative will achieve the objectives we think it will, that is, to improve road safety but also to reduce congestion by keeping the traffic moving at peak hours.  It is one of the things in our locker we could deploy if we felt it would be beneficial elsewhere.  That would have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

The chief executive and other members of TII have been before the committee recently.  Mr. Llewellyn has a good CV, qualifications and all the rest of it.  This is the first time I have heard of somebody from Wales almost claiming to be from Ireland.  I believe it was well put together, in fairness, so full marks in that regard.</p> <p>  I hope I do not repeat some of the points that have already been made.  I was trying to maintain an interest in another meeting as this one was ongoing.  Such is the reality of the online world in which we live.  You think you can do it all and fail miserably on all counts.</p> <p>  Mr. Peter Walsh was before the committee recently and spoke about the difficulties from the point of view of TII.  We accept there needs to be a requirement for engagement with communities and all the rest of it on major infrastructural projects.  That is fundamental.  Mr. Walsh spoke about the difficulties from the point of view of TII.  We know there are wider issues.  There is an Attorney General review now about the whole planning process.  I will ask about Mr. Llewellyn's strategy for the future.  What are his plans in that regard?  What engagement has the organisation had with the review process that is ongoing?</p> <p>  Mr. Llewellyn spoke about roads.  In some cases, there may be bad economics if one is only talking about dealing with peak times.  We have all seen the solutions that TII is talking about around the M50, and it would be hoped that could be delivered in other places.  That is where technology would kick in to reduce congestion, make things safer and all the rest of it.  Does Mr. Llewellyn have plans for that sort of technological focus that could be brought to bear?  I accept we must ensure we have a better public transport system that can remove the need for people to be using cars, ourselves included, on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  He would have got a very short answer had he asked such questions.  When it comes to dynamic traffic management on the M50, as I said, there are a number of issues.  One is about road safety.  We must make sure road users can get access to assistance if their vehicles break down to protect those vehicles and to move them off the road quickly so traffic will keep moving.  When it comes to adverse weather, one needs everybody to stay safe and, therefore, being able to manage the flow at a sensible speed when there is particularly bad weather is important.  The technology enables one to do that but only if there is one thing in place, and I will come back to that in a moment.</p> <p>  If peak times are between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., a big chunk of the traffic includes people who are being delayed unnecessarily because of the acceleration and braking ahead of them.  Keeping that traffic flow moving in a constant way is important.  Dynamic traffic management will allow that.  However, it only works if people know they must comply through their behaviour.  If it is advisory, we know that most people will ignore that and do what they need to because, to them, their route home is the most important.  Being able to have some enforcement around that is important.</p> <p>  I want to make it clear, and I know the committee understands this point, that there is no financial benefit to TII from that because whatever enforcement penalties arrive do not come back to TII.  This is all about improving the efficient use of that network and road safety, which is what TII is there to do.  Whether that model can be applied elsewhere is something to consider at some point.  We need the technology in place to prove it works, and if it shows the benefits we think it will, the same approach could be rolled out elsewhere.</p></speech>

As much as we know this has worked in other places, we need to see it will work here and wider plans will then follow.  That is welcome.  It is a sensible way to approach the matter.</p> <p>  Would Mr. Llewellyn be able to give any comment about the difficulties I mentioned?  Has he had any conversations around the planning process and the difficulties TII and others have?  I doubt very much he has had any engagement relating to the review of that matter which is ongoing.</p></speech>

With all capital projects around the world, there is a balance between wanting to deliver them as quickly as possible because of the benefits they bring to society while at the same time ensuring the stakeholders on the route have sufficient engagement to voice their concerns.  The key thing is making sure those two concerns are in balance.  There is a lot more to be done in the upfront engagement once there is a scheme design to explain to people how projects might work and the benefits they will bring.  It is hoped that will reduce the delays in the planning process.</p></speech>

It is a requirement to deliver on certain projects that are absolutely necessary within the national development plan, even if we are talking about the road network.  That needs to be combined with trying to deal with climate change, carbon budgets and all the rest of it.</p><p>The difficulty on one level was highlighted to me by the references to TII's plans for the next ten years in regard to roads.  I understand &euro;1.5 billion is allocated for this purpose, with &euro;1 billion to be spent in the first half of the decade.  The problem with this is it leaves the heavy lifting in the building sense to be done in the second part of the decade, which is when we also will need to do the heavy lifting on reducing emissions and all of that.  It is a question of how to wed the two.  This difficulty is probably why some people believe that while the NDP may be an impressive-looking document, delivering it might be another matter.  It is something of a difficult sell to a couple of different constituencies.</p></speech>

The bulk of emissions from transport do not come from the road itself.  Clearly, there is embodied carbon in the construction and maintenance of roads.  TII is looking at different ways of installing and managing roads to the extent that their carbon footprint is reduced.  The bigger issue, however, is what goes on those roads.  If what goes on the roads are electric and hydrogen vehicles, then we are in a really good place.  That is outside TII's bailiwick other than if there are policy interventions and a drive, if the Deputy will excuse the pun, to get to that position, in which case we will have to look at what infrastructure we have in place to ensure people can charge their vehicles or fill them up with hydrogen.</p></speech>

At the moment, it is at a fairly basic level of saying to TII what is happening with scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, what we can do as a business to reduce our own emissions and in terms of the construction of the road network, and then the third part, which is how we can help the whole of society to move to a low-carbon way of transport.  All countries in the world are facing that at the moment.  Ireland is no different from anywhere else.</p></speech>

I realise he has just come into the job and some of the questions I put to him were unfair, but that is the nature of the business.  It would be very useful if we could have him and other members of TII before the committee on future occasions to talk about not only the short-term issues and some of the local issues on which we all become engaged but also the long-term strategy for delivering the infrastructure we require, combined with dealing with the realities of the climate change mitigations that are necessary.</p></speech>

He knows the priorities of the Government, particularly the shift in spending based on the 2:1 initiative that is now in place.  Does that put an undue burden on Mr. Llewellyn and TII in its role in meeting what are the obvious needs from a transport infrastructure point of view in terms of vehicular transport spending on roads versus active travel?  That is my first question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#F00900"><p>I do not think TII sees that as a pressure.  There is definitely an opportunity in it.  As I said, TII has an obligation to provide a safe and efficient road transport network.  We have to do that under law unless we are told by the Minister to have a derogation for a period.  When we are building changes to the roads, there is an opportunity to put cycle paths or greenways alongside them, which is something TII already is doing.  Part of the challenge in this regard is that we could end up with a greenway that is very busy because it is being built as part of an ongoing change to a road network.  It is important that whatever infrastructure is put in place, there is an awareness of how a greenway is connected up with existing cycle paths and so on to encourage active travel.  I know TII is thinking about that because it was a specific question I had.</p> <p>  The other aspect is making sure that when roads are designed, there are very clear views as to what elements will be public transport and which will be personal transport.  At the moment, personal transport is based on the internal combustion engine but it will, at some point, be based around electricity or hydrogen fuel.  The roads will still be needed.  It is about having enough view of what the long term is to make sure we are making decisions now that will make provision for 20, 30 or 40 years.  We are very focused on the 2:1 aspect.  MetroLink, obviously, will be a big chunk of that, particularly in terms of moving people around the Dublin area.</p></speech>

Regarding inter-urban motorways, concern has been raised about the design style of some of the access and egress points to and from the main thoroughfares.  Mr. Llewellyn may not be familiar with this issue, in which case it may be a takeaway for him.  I know of a number of such junctions that I can identify for him.  The ones closest to us in Clare are the Tulla Road, Barefield and Crusheen exits.  Deputy Lowry will be familiar with another one, on the M7, which I pass every week entering Moneygall.  Coming off at that exit is particularly difficult because one is coming down an incline and pulling into a rest area and truck stop at the Barack Obama Plaza.  We have had some debate about this in the past.  Are there any discussions internally in TII about looking at and addressing those particular junctions?  I will not say they are hazardous but they certainly are suboptimal considering the volumes of traffic entering and exiting motorways.  Getting off the motorway, in particular, is the major issue.</p></speech>

I go back to the point that TII's remit is to provide a safe and efficient transport network.  If something is clearly unsafe and poses a risk to the travelling public, TII will no doubt look at it and will have to prioritise it within the investment budget provided for the development of transport.  I have some sympathy with the point the Deputy is raising.  Many years ago, I remember driving down a dual carriageway to find a vehicle coming the wrong way around a roundabout and straight towards me.  The driver was able to do that because the approach road to the roundabout was straight on rather than to the side and, in effect, he made the wrong decision.  It was exceptionally hazardous.  I understand the point the Deputy is raising but I do not know the extent to which TII has looked at the particular issues to which he referred.</p></speech>

His CV is very impressive and he has the knowledge and experience across a range of transport-related disciplines that should allow him to give strong leadership to TII.  I wish him well in his role.</p> <p>  He is only nine days into it but I am sure he has been briefed by his staff.  He said in his opening statement that "in an ideal world", funding would be available to support all projects that are included in the national development plan.  In the briefing he would have had from executives of TII, did they establish what the likely shortfall will be?</p> <p>  In regard to the budget that is available to TII, Mr. Llewellyn placed a lot of emphasis on maintaining existing assets across the country, on both road and Luas.</p><p>What is the ratio of spend on capital and maintenance in that area?</p><p> I will raise one other issue, which is that many people in Ireland feel very disgruntled, and at times suffer huge inconvenience, when there is an incident on one of our motorways.  There is a serious question mark over our response times.  If there is any kind of incident on a motorway at present, the tailbacks and delays last many hours.  The synchronisation and co-ordination between members of the Garda leaves a lot to be desired at times.  I can understand that when there is a major incident and a fatality, but I have seen a couple of cases in recent times where a road has been closed from 12 a.m. until 8 p.m.  Even by 8 p.m. members of the Garda still have not got their act together to direct traffic.  I ask Mr. Llewellyn to take that up with his officials in TII and ask them what procedures and practices can be put in place to improve our response time to reopening roadways following incidents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I am halfway through my briefing.  The second half of it was due right now but has been postponed.  There is lots that I still do not understand.</p> <p>  As I understand it, however, the inherent asset value of the road network that the TII looks after is &euro;32 billion.  We would be stupid not to maintain that value because letting it degrade and having to rebuild it would just load a significant amount of capital cost onto the Irish taxpayer at some point in the future.  It is very important to me that we maintain what we have in good order.  To do that, it is necessary to know a lot about the condition of the asset at all times.  That is sometimes tricky, so understanding the condition of a tunnel, embankment or road requires investment, skills to interpret the data and good decision-making.  None of those are generally what I would term sexy projects; they are basic things that have to be done.  They are worthwhile doing because of the inherent value of the asset we have in Ireland.  TII will continue to do that.</p> <p>  I do not know the split between maintenance and enhancement, which I think is the question the Deputy asked, because I have not yet been briefed on that, but no doubt it will become clearer when we publish our annual business plan.  I think that is going before the board next month.</p> <p>  I will take up the Deputy's point on response times to delays and congestion on roads with management.  The official part of the statutory duty of TII refers to that.  It is about making sure those roads are operated efficiently and that people can use them efficiently.  If people are experiencing delays for very long periods, they will probably feel anything other than that.  If the obligation does not fit with TII, that will be part of the stakeholder engagement we will need to go on. </p></speech>

Mr. Llewellyn will probably not have this information to hand, but he might be able to help me out.  A long-standing project is being worked on by Clare County Council and the TII.  It involves a roundabout off the N85 on the approach to Ennis and Clarecastle.  It also has linkage to the N67 and the Kilrush road.  It is a notorious and very busy roundabout.  It is the busiest roundabout in County Clare and is very dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.  Work has nearly been completed on a greenway that runs along the banks of the River Fergus past the monument at Clareabbey.  It is a very good project that will encourage more pedestrian traffic and cyclists in the area.  Students travelling from Clarecastle to Ennis have to traverse this roundabout on a daily basis.  They are taking their lives in their hands by doing so.  This issue has been ongoing for many years.  Ideally, it should have been resolved at the design stage of the Ennis bypass and N85 link road.  I would like Mr. Llewellyn to raise this matter with the TII and have it brought to a conclusion.  A number of submissions have been made by Clare County Council, which has identified a preferred option to rectify the situation.  I ask Mr. Llewellyn, as chairperson designate, to take this issue up and bring it to a conclusion.</p> <p>  The other long-standing issue is that of Blake's Corner in a place called Ennistimon in north Clare.  Again, it is a very busy junction.  An inner relief road on the N67-N85 is proposed, which means a new bridge and new inner relief road will be built in Ennistimon.  Two American tourists recently crashed at Blake's Corner.  Luckily, they escaped without being hurt, but it demonstrates the problems that are there, including massive traffic congestion throughout the summer because people are going back to attractive tourist resorts, such as Liscannor, Lahinch and, in north Clare, Doolin and the Cliffs of Moher.  It is a very busy junction.  I would like Mr. Llewellyn to provide an update on that scheme too.  I understand that an oral hearing was heard last June at An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the inspector has to come back with a report.  It is important that that project is driven on, we see it realised and the congestion issues that have been experienced are dealt with.</p> <p>  Deputy Lowry touched on this final issue.  Over the past six weeks, there have been a number of road traffic incidents and, sadly, one fatality, on the N18 road that runs from Ennis to Limerick, in particular the section from Bunratty into Limerick.  All these accidents involved heavy goods vehicles and massive delays were caused as a result.  A person passed away, which is obviously tragic for that individual and his or her family.  The delay in trying to get the road reopened, people not knowing what is happening and trying to communicate that to commuters are areas that TII will have to improve upon.  Given that there have been a number of these incidents on the N18, has Mr. Llewellyn concerns about this section of road?  Why are so many of these accidents happening?  Has the TII given any consideration to putting in some remedy to this?  I get that Mr. Llewellyn will not be familiar with these projects, but I will be happy if he would come back to me in writing regarding them.</p></speech>

As he rightly pointed out, I cannot answer on the detail of what he just said.</p> <p>  As a more general point, the TII works very closely with local authorities because they are the roads authorities for the national, regional and local roads within their boundaries.  TII is not a roads authority, which may be something that we will need to address at some point in the future.  As I understand it, the relationship between TII and the local authorities is pretty good because there is a network of 11 local authority national roads offices throughout the country, which work remarkably well.  That probably does not answer the Deputy's specific questions, but I am sure somebody from TII is watching this and taking notes on letters that will need to be written in response to Deputies, etc.</p><p>I will ensure that somebody from TII comes back to the Deputy with the detail.  I think I have already addressed the point about what we can do when something happens to reduce the delays.  Whether that is through dynamic traffic management or through actions by the Garda, I am not entirely sure, but I will pick it up with TII.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Llewellyn well in his new role.  I am interested in his perspective on the role of TII.  Does he think the role of roads, as we have understood them for so long in terms of carrying cars, lorries and buses, is changing, in light of the sustainable future with climate targets, a transition to increasing use of public transport, an electric car fleet and increasing the use of electrified or alternative fuels for HGVs, but particularly given the significant move towards active travel, including cycling and walking?  What does Mr. Llewellyn see as TII's role being in delivering on that type of change?  Does he think the organisation is prepared and has an important role in relation to that?  How will it ready itself for that?  Will it require, for example, different skill sets, mindsets and changes in approach to align an important organisation such as TII?  In his opening statement, Mr. Llewellyn mentioned that it is about delivering.  I am conscious that TII has taken on a new role in the delivery of greenways, which I think aligns very well with the piece on active travel.  How is the organisation going to deliver roads that serve a purpose that is more closely aligned to the climate obligations and the changes in road user, the changes in road space and the types of vehicles that are on roads?  I hope that is a clear question and Mr. Llewellyn has a sense of what I am asking.</p></speech>

One thing we know about the future is that it will be different from where we are at the moment.  Preparing for that sometimes needs different structures, skills and thinking.  The most important statement is that there is always a view that roads are bad in relation to climate change, but they are not really.  It is what is on the roads that matters, because that is where most - not all - of the emissions come from.  At some point in the future, we will still need roads.  We will need them for electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles.  A new hydrogen HGV is being launched by a company called Tevva.  These vehicles are coming, and that it is a good thing, except from a congestion perspective.  Obviously, we still need to deal with congestion and the impact it has on the economy.</p> <p>  TII still has an important role in ensuring that the road network, in particular, supports the NDP.  Looking at the priorities, transport supports virtually all of them.  Whether it is strengthening rural communities, regional accessibility or sustainable mobility, transport is part of all of those.  Making sure that at any one point in time, one designs infrastructure to achieve the future outcomes as well as to tackle today's problems will be a factor for TII, without a doubt.</p> <p>  I think I mentioned in one of my previous answers that even today, TII has a preference that when it is planning new infrastructure, a greenway is part of it already.  A big challenge there is making sure that whatever greenway is introduced as part of a change to the road network is linked up with existing greenways.  There is no point in it being isolated from everything else.  It needs that joined-up approach, as part of the national cycle network, etc.  That is really important.  When planning new infrastructure, TII looks at what proportion of that infrastructure should be for personal vehicles and what should be for public transport.  Again, that is part of the overall planning process that TII will go through.</p> <p>  I cannot say that the organisation will not need new skills, because it probably will, because the future will be different.  It is part of the board's role in evaluating the strategy or the organisation, to take a view about whether the organisation is set up for success.  That is part of my role.</p></speech>

What is the most efficient way to deliver?</p></speech>

It must deliver on that.  Over and above that, it has to deliver the Government's objectives, which are set out in the NDP.  The organisation works within a framework.  It does not determine behind closed doors what happens; it takes its lead from the Department of Transport and the NTA.  That is the framework within which it works.</p> <p>  I have not come with a mindset that this organisation needs to be 15 times bigger in ten years' time.  MetroLink is going to be one of the biggest challenges that Ireland, more generally, will face, and TII, specifically, will face.  We need to get that right.  The organisation does need to skill itself up quickly to be able to deliver MetroLink within a sensible time period and to ensure that when it goes through the implementation, there are not hold-ups and the costs do not escalate.  The best way of doing that is to get people in TII's business and experts who know what they are doing on the ground now - not in two years' time.  That will give us confidence that when the preferred route goes out, all the contracts are linked together.</p></speech>

Obviously, Mr. Llewellyn has international experience and can make comparisons.  From initial discussions with colleagues in TII, does he believe that our planning system is fit for purpose?  What types of changes does he think might be needed to ensure that major transport projects like MetroLink can proceed efficiently?</p></speech>

I have worked in most parts of the world.  I have worked in some parts of the world where, quite frankly, the planning process came after the project had been delivered.  That is certainly not good practice.  As I said earlier, it is about achieving the optimum balance between making sure that the projects are delivered in a sensible timescale so that the benefits, more broadly, are delivered when one needs them, and at the same time, making sure that those people who are impacted on the route have a sufficient voice through that process.  If any one of those two are out of kilter, one will end up with problems.  It is about achieving that optimum balance.  Part of the role for TII is working with other organisations to see how we can improve the overall process to achieve objectives from both parties' perspectives.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Llewellyn have a concern in relation to that?  Does that affect, in a real way, TII's bottom line?  Is the organisation compensated in an way in relation to it?  Does Mr. Llewellyn have a comment on the business model that operates in that way?  Obviously, there has been criticism from some quarters of the public private partnership, PPP, models.  We are moving into a period where we will see big investment in projects.  I presume consideration will be given to the type of model is used to deliver them.  Perhaps Mr. Llewellyn could comment on the funding position of TII and the impact of Covid.</p></speech>

It was reported in last year's annual report.  We are still in the process of tackling this pandemic, and restrictions are coming in again, in my country as well as in Ireland.</p><p>It is likely to have an impact on income into 2022.  We are very fortunate that, like his predecessor, the Minister is very supportive of what TII does and that he wants to see TII there for the long term.  That is right because transport is essential to all the principles that sit within the NDP.  I do not have a particular concern there.  Part of my oversight will be to ensure the organisation is operating as efficiently as possible so that if it needs funding from Government it is not unreasonable.  We are trying to minimise our recourse to public funds as far as possible.</p><p> Regarding other projects, it is too early to tell.</p></speech>

I join previous speakers in welcoming Mr. Llewellyn.  I have read his opening statement.  I wish him the very best.  What is required of us today is a bit of a rubber-stamping exercise.  We endorse him as chair designate of TII.</p> <p>  The Shannon tunnel, the fantastic under-river link between Clare and Limerick, was built about 15 years ago.  Has it been utilised enough in taking HGV traffic off the orbital route network in the southern part of County Clare and Limerick city?  Mr. Llewellyn may not have an answer to my second question but perhaps he or some of his colleagues who are following this meeting might come back to me on it.  Two figures circulating in the ether relating to the Shannon tunnel are at great variance.  If phase 2 of the Limerick northern distributor road is constructed, the figure being put forward by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would suggest a significant financial hit to the Shannon tunnel and yet the figure suggested by local authorities in the mid-west is far less.  I would appreciate if TII, not today but some day, could calculate its estimate of the penalty if phase 2 were developed.  What financial hit would the Shannon tunnel suffer?</p> <p>  My next question relates to TII and the naming of infrastructure.  Prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il, I was a member of Clare County Council.  Along with other councillors, I suggested naming roundabouts and flyover bridges after key figures, one of them being a lady from Cratloe in County Clare who died on hunger strike during the War of Independence.  She was the only member of Cumann na mBan to suffer that fate.  The country has many monuments and other memorials to men from that period but we have fewer for women.  This proposal had cross-party agreement but it fizzled out to nothing.  Does TII have a policy on that?  If it does not, I believe it needs to have one because in some places there is a desire to have bridges and other pieces of infrastructure named rather than having a series of anonymous numbers and letters behind them.</p> <p>  Does TII have a database of all lands that are part of future road plans?  It is important to have a database available.  Many good, layered GIS mapping systems are available.  It has become a constant theme in County Clare and elsewhere where future transport initiatives are planned in TII offices and indeed in the local authority there may well be maps giving details of future plans but many landowners may not be privy to those.  There is not a one-stop shop to get that information.  People need to know what kind of infrastructure is intended in their locality and how that interfaces with their landholdings.</p> <p>  For a long time, I have been asking Clare County Council to salt and grit the roads leading to Clonmoney National School.  I am glad that is now in the winter maintenance programme.  TII has a major competency in salting and gritting.  Some of its main salt barns on the Clare to Galway motorway are located just outside Ennis.  At times, when we get a hard freeze, the resources of TII could be made available beyond the national road network.  I believe it needs to play a role in making salt and grit resources available to local authorities.</p> <p>  I know I am throwing out several questions.  I do not expect Mr. Llewellyn to have all the answers today.  There was a fabulous project in County Clare last year, but it could not proceed even though there was funding available.  It involved a series of looped walks, but it needed sanction from TII to progress.  That has become a recurring theme.  Many projects that councils heretofore would have led, now require the higher sanction of TII.  Perhaps in his tenure, Mr. Llewellyn might be able to address this matter.  TII should have a unit that engages with groups and local authorities to ensure that these kinds of projects receive the rubber-stamp and seal of approval so that they can progress.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Llewellyn very well in the future.  He may be able to respond to some of those issues in a general sense now and can come back to me with some of the specifics at a later date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#J00400"><p>I will do my best to answer some of those questions.  I will not be able to answer them all.  I have not been briefed on the issues relating to the Shannon tunnel that the Deputy flagged.  That may be coming.  I will ask somebody within TII to address that issue.</p> <p>  I am neutral on the naming of infrastructure.  However, TII is a non-political organisation and sometimes names can engender different feelings, which is not something that TII should be exposed to.  As I understand it, there is no policy at the moment.  Clearly, the board will need to look at that at some point in the future.  Different countries around the world take different views on it.  There are plenty of names in the US, whereas in the UK there is probably not a single name anywhere - other than those put up by graffiti.</p> <p>  TII is carrying out considerable work on technology on the mapping of lands to help it manage the network better and help it understand the impact of land use on roads and also to ensure that as much information as possible is accessible in the planning process.  I do not know about the status of that nor its availability.  One of the challenges in releasing information about future road networks is that it runs the risk of infrastructure being put in place that subsequently causes a problem in respect of a particular route.  We need to think about that very carefully.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a very interesting point about working with local authorities.  As I mentioned earlier, the local authorities are the roads authority for national, regional and local roads within their boundaries.  It has come as a bit of a surprise to me that TII is not a roads authority.  It may be a matter we need to address in the future.  That said, the relationship with local authorities seems to work rather well through the 11 national roads offices we have throughout the country.  If there is any sense that that is not working, clearly we would be interested in hearing those experiences so that TII can make the process work better.</p> <p>  The Deputy had many questions and I am not sure if I answered them all.  He should feel free to come back to me with any specific issues if he wishes.</p></speech>

I mentioned local authorities.  Too often, local authorities and TII seem to exist quite separately.  However, TII will occasionally send a memo to a local authority asking its road design office to progress a project.  The road design office in County Clare is staffed by two or three people.  It is over-resourced for what it needs be able to achieve.  At times, we need a better alignment between the hierarchy in TII and what is happening at county level.  Mr. Llewellyn may be able to champion that.  I would appreciate if some of his colleagues in-house might be able to come back to me, perhaps by email, on some of those matters in the coming days.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Llewellyn the best of luck with TII.  We will not wish Wales as much luck with the Six Nations but we all love watching the Welsh team perform.</p></speech>

I have to say, to be totally honest, it is generally limited to the Dublin area but enough to go on the Luas system, the bus network and the DART.  Covid permitting, I am planning to be over in the next two weeks again to improve my understanding of the whole system.  I only have more to learn.</p></speech>

I am a Deputy for Limerick city and my colleagues have already made reference to the N20-M20 project.  Mr. Llewellyn is probably aware there are no motorways or dual carriageways between Cork and Limerick as there are between Cork and Dublin, Limerick and Dublin, Limerick and Galway and Galway and Dublin.  Limerick and Cork are the two largest cities outside of Dublin but they are not linked by motorway.  The distance is roughly 90 km and there is no hard shoulder on 42% of it.  I would encourage Mr. Llewellyn to read <i>The Irish Times</i>article, which we might send on to him, which suggests that 60 people have been killed on that route in the past 25 years and it is four times more likely to have fatalities than the average road in Ireland.  There are a huge number of access points along the route, with something like 625 access points.  I welcome that Mr. Llewellyn has already made reference to the fact it is continuing to go through a process through TII.  I welcome that he sees a role for motorways and roads in addition to rail and other forms of transport, as there will always be need for that.</p><p>If Mr. Llewellyn gets the opportunity to come to Ireland, I ask him to drive the route and see at first hand what it entails.  From Limerick city, there is dual carriageway for about 10 km and that is already motorway.  The road then goes into Patrickswell as far as Croom and there it is a normal national road with a hard shoulder.  From Croom to Charleville, the road has no hard shoulder for roughly 12 to 15 km.  From Charleville to Buttevant, it is an ordinary road with a hard shoulder, although there is a difficulty with Buttevant as there is a quarry there and it needs a major bypass.  The road then continues on to Mallow and then to Cork.  I am a great believer in seeing it in person rather than just in the abstract.  I would encourage Mr. Llewellyn to drive it when he is in Ireland next.  I assume he will be looking to do that as part of his role.</p><p>It is the biggest single project in Ireland.  It is something I passionately believe in given the fatalities as well as the issue of connecting the two cities.  Does Mr. Llewellyn think he will get the opportunity to drive the route?</p></speech>

It also means that when we get back to the boardroom, our decisions are more based in reality than they are when they are just on paper.  The Chairman can take it from me that I will be driving and taking public transport in Ireland as part of my role.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, we know there are serious safety concerns on that route.  It is in the NDP and the preferred route will hopefully be available in the early part of next year.  There is probably a more general principle here.  TII is a delivery agency and the decisions about the investment should be for the Department of Transport and for the National Transport Authority.  While TII can make proposals as to what could be done, and safety is a particular issue, it has to work closely with those two organisations to make sure the right infrastructure is developed within that funding envelope.  Sometimes it is easy for TII to take a bit of grief with regard to roads that have not been changed but, quite often, those decisions are not for TII to take.</p></speech>

However, it is a good economic corridor.  We are trying to get an Atlantic corridor running from Cork to Limerick to Galway and beyond as a counter-pole to Dublin.</p> <p>  Mr. Llewellyn made an interesting point on the whole area around electric vehicles and he might expand on that.  When roads are being built, it is what is on the roads at that time that will determine the emissions.  Obviously, fossil fuel emissions from cars are very heavy on carbon whereas that is not the case for electric cars.  That is one question.  What would be involved?  We are looking to have 1 million electric vehicles in Ireland by 2030, which is nine years away.  From Mr. Llewellyn's experience, what is required to meet that target?</p> <p>  Second, Mr. Llewellyn made reference to TII looking at more environmentally-friendly ways of building the roads.  When the roads are being built, they bring risks in terms of carbon.  Will Mr. Llewellyn expand on that?  They are two sides of the same coin in one sense.  We want to get to a point where roads are not seen as a total enemy of the environment.  We need to evolve over time to electric cars and look at ways of using components that are not as carbon emitting as other areas.  Mr. Llewellyn might elaborate on both of those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#K00600"><p>I do not think it will be in huge detail but these are some of the things I have learned over the years.  Moving from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles is hugely important as part of our journey to net zero but it does require the electricity system to be decarbonised as well, of course, because otherwise we are just shifting the emissions somewhere else.</p> <p>  One of the feelings, particularly in the UK, is that for any lengthy journey, people are nervous around electric vehicles because of the range and an innate knowledge about where they may recharge their vehicle and whether the charging process is going to take too long.  All of those issues are in the hands of the manufacturers, such as battery technology and range extent.  People need to know they can get from where they are to their destination without a recharge and if they do need a recharge, that the recharge is rather quick.  I am not sure there is a huge amount that TII could do or should do.  Clearly, at the point at which we have significant numbers of electric vehicles, making sure that those recharging stations are in the right place to ensure smooth travel is hugely important.  The issues will be more about range and battery technology than it will be about charging stations necessarily.</p> <p>  Another issue is whether the next development is around hydrogen fuel cells and, if hydrogen fuel cells do take over from electric vehicles, whether existing fuel stations can be converted into hydrogen providing stations.  If that is the case, the way in which we drive will not be too dissimilar from where we are today.  All of those are driven more by policy than they will be by TII, although TII will have to respond to any policy change and any change in purchasing practice.</p> <p>  When it comes to construction more generally, there is a lot of work going on in various sectors around decarbonising construction.  I was fortunate to work for the chief executive of the organisation that built the London Olympic Games infrastructure and a huge amount of work was done there on decarbonising the construction process.  It is something TII is looking at and the more work we can do in that space, the more we will reduce our own emissions with regard to construction and the management and maintenance of the infrastructure we have.</p></speech>

It will require some interesting innovations.  It will require us to look around the world for examples of where we can adopt new technology and new materials to construct and maintain roads.  All I can say is that TII is up for that challenge, and that is the most important thing.</p></speech>

If you do not do that, you must either accept that people are going to be consistently delayed - and delayed even further in future because of the potential growth in car numbers - or you must build more roads.  That is the only other option.  If you do that, it seems you will only be building roads to accommodate the congestion at peak times.  That does not feel like a good investment.  Dynamic traffic management will help with that.  It will avert any future expansion of the motorway to tackle that particular issue.  That was the comment I was making.</p></speech>

I am agnostic as to whether this connectivity is achieved by means of road, rail or light rail.  It is important to recognise something.  I have been fortunate in my time.  I actually live in the city so I can pretty much walk or cycle anywhere I want to go.  I do not actually need the car.  I live ten minutes from the main railway station.  However, prior to living here, I lived in the country.  If you wanted to get a pint of milk, it was a 40-minute round trip.  There was only one bus a week.  I see the issues affecting rural transport and city transport.  There is a big difference between the two.  Again, within the context of TII's statutory responsibilities, there is not a massive amount that we can do but I am trying to understand the broader picture as to where the future of transport may be.  The TII can talk about the Department of Transport and the NTA about that.</p></speech>

I do not think we are likely to be on the Enterprise from "Star Trek", being zapped from one part of the world to another, or at least not in my lifetime.  It is about striking a balance between the bulk transport of people through public transport, something which MetroLink will deliver, and making sure that people can access the road network safely with any congestion kept to a minimum.  We also need to look at the future of roads to see whether they can enhance public transport and active travel in a way they may not have in the past.</p></speech>

There would obviously still be buses on major routes.  Where does he see that enhancement coming?</p></speech>

The benefit of public transport is quite high but those buses still need infrastructure to run on.  TII will play an important role in facilitating that change.  The point I made regarding modal shift was that the shift will probably be a policy decision.  TII plays an important role in making sure that the infrastructure is in place and ready for a shift in modes.</p></speech>

I look forward to Mr. Llewellyn coming back before the committee with TII.  We will get an update on how he views the existing N20 route from Cork to Limerick.  He is always welcome to call in if he is in Limerick.  We will now move to a second round of questions from members.  I call on Senator Horkan, who has five minutes.</p></speech>

Like everybody else, I have been hearing almost all of his contributions.  I have had to dip in and out slightly, but I have been here for almost all of it.</p> <p>  I will touch on Mr. Llewellyn's background.  He will be chairman of TII shortly.  He is now the chair designate.  He is also on the boards of Harwich Haven Authority and Sage Housing.  Does he have a lot of other things going on?  Does he feel he will have enough time for TII?  I am conscious that sometimes busy individuals are the best people to ask to do things because they are very good at managing their time, but Mr. Llewellyn has quite a number of irons in the fire.  Is that an unfair comment?</p></speech>

I am involved with a range of organisations.  My term at Harwich Haven Authority comes to an end at the end of this month.  I will have completed my second three-year term and, by the rules of that organisation, I must step down.  That will release a little bit of time.  I believe I will have more than enough time to get involved in TII.  As the Senator will know, whenever you take on a new role, it is more onerous in the first few months as you try to get up to speed with what the organisation is capable of, what its priorities are and so on.  As the Chairman identified, I will also have to get up to speed with the geography of the country in this case.  It will be onerous in the first few months but, after that, I believe it will be more than manageable.</p></speech>

Does he see himself working three or four days a month or more?  Perhaps he will be working an hour a day here and there.  We know and appreciate that it is not a full-time position, but how much time does Mr. Llewellyn envisage spending on it in the coming months?</p></speech>

That is just the way it is.  In part, that is down to how a non-executive normally operates.  You want to make the biggest contribution you can.  The original expectation was a day a week.  I have spent the past three days on TII, so that is three weeks in one go.  It will, of course, vary.  Sometimes I will be working remotely and sometimes in person.  At the moment, I am frustrated that the Covid restrictions on both sides will constrain my ability to get out on-site and do the travelling the Chairman referred to, which is a core part of learning the business early on.  If we can get out of the pandemic quickly, I will be spending more time over there learning about the business.</p></speech>

I hope Mr. Llewellyn will get to look at our network sooner rather than later, while remaining compliant with Covid restrictions.</p> <p>  TII's predecessor, the National Roads Authority, which merged with the Railway Procurement Agency to become TII, completed the inter-urban motorway project from Dublin to the cities of Waterford, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Belfast very effectively up until 2010.  Road safety has improved greatly.  Those roads are far safer than the roads we are talking about, that is, the N20 and other roads on which people are making unsafe passes because they get stuck behind a heavy goods vehicle, tractor or milk tanker and get frustrated.  They have nowhere to pass so they take risks they do not have to take on motorways.  Mr. Llewellyn's background in road safety is very important.  His background in sustainability and leadership is a very interesting part of his CV.  Even though he does not overly labour the point, that experience will be very useful in the future.</p> <p>  Mr. Llewellyn has said that the more planning you do in advance and the earlier you do it, the less likely you are to have problems in the end.  Are there any other points he would like to make with regard to working closely to minimise delays?  MetroLink has been an aspiration for a long time.  Is there anything else TII can do in that regard?  Mr. Llewellyn referenced the legislation required to make the dynamic traffic management measures obligatory rather than advisory.  We took that on board when we visited the operations centre.  We had a very useful meeting there.  Does he have any other asks of us, as legislators?  Is there anything we can do to speed up the job he is trying to do in delivering for the people of Ireland?</p></speech>

I have not been through it in detail because I only received it yesterday.  It would be a bit unfair to brief the committee on it.</p></speech>

If, in facing challenges, he feels things need to be speeded up or that a little bit of pressure needs to be put on, Mr. Llewellyn should contact the Chairman or all of us and let us know what we need to do to help.</p></speech>

There are normally interfaces where contractors will play off one another.  That is where delays, arguments and cost increases arise.  The other thing is that there are, of course, metros around the world.  I have been on many of them.  It is important that TII makes contact with the organisations behind them to understand the processes they went through, what they learned, what they would do better next time and what would they not do in order that practice from all around the world can be considered before finishing the design.</p><p>To be fair to TII, it is doing that.  It is talking to its equivalent organisation in Australia, because there is a transit system in Melbourne and elsewhere.  Gathering that information from around the world will help to define what TII wants to do.  I think it is in that mode, but the important aspect is ensuring that the right people are in place to interpret all the data being gathered.</p></speech>

On road safety, in respect of the average speed concept, I once had to drive from Bristol to Cardiff and Swansea, and there are average speed roads in the UK where there are signs notifying people get that if they get from one place to another too quickly, the authorities will know they have been speeding somewhere along the route.  I do not believe we have a similar system in Ireland.  Is there scope here for something like that?  Do those systems work, do they have benefits and could we use them on some of our motorways?  We do not need or want speed traps and speed vans everywhere, but if drivers are getting from A to B in less than two or three hours or whatever, would there be a case for using this system?  I know it is possible to circumvent that kind of system by stopping at various places along the way, but these mechanisms exist in other countries.  Is there scope to use one of those systems here and do they provide benefits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-01a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gareth Llewellyn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021120100002#M00300"><p>I do not recognise the specific instance of which the Senator spoke.  To my knowledge, there is nothing in the UK where a system will know whether people have got from A to B too quickly.  Having driven in France a lot, such a system does exist there.  If people move from one toll booth to another and arrive there outside of what is expected within normal speed limits, then the gendarmerie will be waiting for those drivers.  That system operates in France.</p> <p>  Over here, we have two issues in this regard.  We have information which tells people how long it should take to get from one junction to another, particularly for important junctions.  That information just provides a guide regarding there being no congestion and that traffic is heading in the right direction.  In certain parts of the country, there are variable speed limits to manage the flow of traffic.  Speed cameras are positioned along those stretches of road and drivers will get a fine if they breach the area speed limit.  That is the function of that system.  In addition, there are also variable speed limits relating to construction activity.  They tend to be average speed cameras over a longer distance.  Again, in that case, if a driver's average speed from the start to the end of such a section of road is greater than would normally be expected, which would normally be about 50 mph, or probably 80 km/h, then those drivers would be fined.  It is variable, depending on the use of those particular aspects.</p></speech>

The fact that people know they are going to get a fairly hefty financial penalty for breaching speed limits does condition their behaviour when driving.  Everybody can be seen slowing down when a sign specifies 60 mph because people know that there are cameras ahead.</p></speech>

Every life saved and every injury prevented, however, is a positive and therefore I ask Mr. Llewellyn to encourage that aspect.</p> <p>  Transdev Ireland operates the Luas on behalf of TII, which absorbed the Railway Procurement Agency.  Does TII have much interaction with Transdev to address antisocial behaviour on Luas carriages?  It is relatively limited, but it attracts much attention when it happens and tends to frighten people.  When we are asking people to make a modal shift to public transport, we want it to be safe.  In the context of Mr. Llewellyn&rsquo;s role, what scope is there for him to ensure that antisocial behaviour on the trains can be eliminated or at least reduced as much as possible?</p></speech>

I saw some information at the last board meeting which was just examining the patterns of antisocial behaviour, such as where they occurred and at what time, etc.  Discussions are ongoing between TII and Transdev concerning what can be done in that space.  From memory, it seemed that there was a bit of a spike when fares were reintroduced at the end of certain Covid-19 restrictions last year.  That was when antisocial behaviour started to go up.  Equally, from memory, that has now started to decrease again.  From what I understand, however, discussions are ongoing in this regard.</p></speech>

That may have been the case.  The compliance enforcement levels may have gone back up since and more inspectors are back on the carriages.</p> <p>  I am conscious of time, so I thank Mr. Llewellyn again for putting his name forward for this post.  I wish him the very best of luck in his new role.  I ask him to please keep in touch with the committee and to let us know what we can do to help to deliver a decent public transport structure, in respect of the Luas and MetroLink, and also a safe national roads network.  I thank Mr. Llewellyn for his participation.</p></speech>

Mr. Llewellyn has given a good and insightful presentation.  This question-and-answer session has been equally helpful.  As I said, I wish him well in his new position.  Several others have mentioned the importance of the M20.  From the speech given by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in the Seanad last night and Mr. Llewellyn&rsquo;s remarks today, I note that everything we do now is being couched in the context of sustainability from the perspective of climate action.  Equally, though, there is a need for connectivity.  I invite Mr. Llewellyn to visit Cork and Limerick, and to drive that motorway with the Chair and me in order that he can see first-hand, if he has not already done so, the absolute importance of connectivity and road safety.</p> <p>  We will work with Mr. Llewellyn, and I will work with him personally, to deliver in tangible ways the key infrastructural projects.  I refer to what is involved to enable this modal shift away from the use of cars, in many cases.  However, we still require the M20 motorway be built, and I make no apologies for being an advocate for that project.  I am not being parochial or trying to be clientelist, but this project is important in the context of the NDP and the economic development of regions outside Dublin.  Mr. Llewellyn has my full support.  I wish him well, and I hope we will see delivery in this area.  I keep saying that the delivery of projects such as BusConnects and light rail for Cork and other areas will signify the success of Mr. Llewellyn's tenure as the chair of TII and of the organisation itself.  I wish him every success.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Llewellyn for his time and his interaction with us.  In fairness, regarding what he said about TII having several requests for the Department of Transport and the Minister to fulfil, we should also probably put our requests in following our previous meeting with TII.  I refer to issues with planning and similar aspects.  We should probably get those aspects set out in some kind of written form for them.  We could then have a further engagement regarding many of the issues we discussed today.</p> <p>  Briefly, regarding best practice in this regard around the world, Mr. Llewellyn went into some of that information.  I wonder what he might see as being an applicable system that we could use from the perspective of where we go in the future with our transport system.  I would be interested to hear if he is aware of anything like that, but perhaps he does not want to be as definitive as that just yet.  In fairness, we could talk about it at a later stage if Mr. Llewellyn cannot go into it now.</p></speech>

All these systems are slightly different.  There are many comparisons over here to the Irish context, such as with Crossrail, for example, but that system is also very different.  This is a matter of understanding those differences, picking up on the aspects that are likely to be similar and then copying those.  There is a requirement, therefore, to look more broadly at metro systems that work and also those that work less well to try to ensure we synthesise the best parts of those examples.</p></speech>

Mr. Llewellyn will find that it is one of the last key major infrastructure projects outstanding.  It is about connectivity, safety, to a great degree, and reducing journey times.  We look forward to Mr. Llewellyn coming back to the committee.  We wish him well, and we will be interacting with him and his colleagues in TII on an ongoing basis because this committee deals with transport and communications issues.</p><p> I thank Mr. Llewellyn for attending.  I wish him a happy Christmas and I wish him well in his new role.  A letter and the transcript of this meeting will issue to the Minister notifying him that the committee has met with Mr. Llewellyn.</p></speech>
