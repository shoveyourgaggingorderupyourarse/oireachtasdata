He is joined today by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Connolly.  Before we commence our main business, there are several matters to be discussed in private session, which we will do after we have dealt with correspondence.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 30 May, which I propose to hold over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received since our last meeting two weeks ago, some of which will be of immense interest to members.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first, category A, comprises Nos. 2225A, 2226A and 2230A, from Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.  The first item of correspondence in this category is No. 2161B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing a report undertaken by Mazars into its review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  At our last meeting we agreed to note and publish this report and hold it over for further consideration.  We had some discussion on it, with particular reference to situations where people are employed by the institute of technology and also receive some payments from companies in which the institute has a shareholding.  The report makes several serious recommendations, including that there be proper agreements in place for such persons, that those arrangements be officially recorded and that assurances be given that their main work with the institute of technology will not be compromised by their additional duties.  Our discussion is on the public record and members are free to raise the matter any time we deal with related topics.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the report and move on, or would members like to hold it over?</p></speech>

Deputies Connolly and Kelly have a particular interest in this matter and we could have a useful discussion about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019061300002#B00400"><p>I am happy to hold it over.  We had a preliminary discussion the last day, but there is no problem with having a more detailed discussion at a future date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2193B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 27 May 2019, responding to recommendation No. A17 of this committee's fifth periodic report regarding the threshold for inclusion in the category of high-wealth individuals.  It is a very important and detailed letter in which there will be significant interest from journalists and others.  The Comptroller and Auditor General included a chapter on this issue in his last report, in which he suggested that the threshold be reduced from &euro;50 million.  In our periodic report, we likewise made a detailed recommendation to lower the threshold.  The report of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners vindicates the work this committee has done on the issue in recent months.  He acknowledges the recommendation in our fifth periodic report and states that Revenue has completed its review, as requested by us, with a recommendation of lowering the threshold for high-wealth individuals to persons having wealth greater than &euro;20 million.</p><p>This was agreed by the board of the Revenue Commissioners on 16 May 2019.  The implementation of this recommendation will result in an additional 475 cases being managed by the high wealth individual division.  This important improvement is a result of our work and recommendations.  I thank the Revenue Commissioners for responding in such a forthright manner.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners have produced a case base review document attached to this letter which we will publish but I want to highlight the significance and relevance of this.  Up to this point, the threshold for net assets was &euro;50 million and there were 200 high wealth individuals on the books and 278 associated cases.  Lowering the threshold to &euro;20 million will add 475 primary cases.  There will be close to 700 on the list where there were previously 200 and that has to be a good result.  These people may not all be resident here for income tax purposes.  They may have property here or investment income.  The Revenue Commissioners use three sources of data for this study: their own data, third party data and external sources.  In their own data they considered disposal of assets or acquisitions over &euro;5 million, gifts of inheritance, stamp duty, trusts, local property tax, which they considered for one year, income and ownership of property.  That led them to compile a significant list.  They then examined third party data for people with accounts of greater than &euro;20 million, which showed up in the deposit interest earned, investment from undertakings and people who had income from directors' fees, rents, pensions and other categories.  The external sources data was the 2018 rich list that we see published in <i>The Sunday Independent</i>and <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  The Revenue Commissioners compared those lists with their own lists and made sure that anybody on both lists was examined.  That does not mean that everybody examined was necessarily included in the final list.<br/><br/>The Revenue Commissioners said that there were 68 taxpayers identified, 35 of whom were also identified from the above criteria but they did not come into the division because they fell into other categories, they might have been beneficial owners or resident taxpayers appeared to have large shareholdings in high wealth non-resident companies, and a combination of shareholdings.  They examined them very closely.  In addition to the 475 individuals, 68 were examined in further detail who did not meet the criteria.  All in all, it was a good day for the Irish taxpayer, the public, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Revenue Commissioners and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are seeing the value of the work being done here.  I compliment everybody from the Revenue side especially on their willingness to take on board in an open way the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and on coming back to say they were being implemented forthwith.</p></speech>

The Chairman has covered much of it.  When the Revenue Commissioners were here, there was a question about recruitment of staff.  They did not have their full complement.  They say in this correspondence that they have an increasing number of specialist experienced staff for the high net worth individuals.  We need to keep an eye on that because we want to deliver the return.  Does this capture people who are non-resident for tax purposes?</p></speech>

This is a focused assessment of such individuals rather than a self-assessment without any checking.  There is a high concentration on these.  The committee and taxpayers can expect that they pay what taxes they are due to pay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019061300002#C00600"><p>It also means that when they show up in the Revenue list they will be caught for double taxation.  The Revenue may have some arrangements in place to make sure they pay the tax in the country where they are resident for tax purposes and paying tax somewhere.  It might not always be in Ireland but they pay appropriate tax in the appropriate jurisdiction.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019061300002#C00900"><p>There was not a suggestion but there was a concern in the interests of transparency and general taxpayer feeling that everybody who should be in the tax net is in it.  It is about fairness and transparency as well as collecting tax.  Overall it has been good from that point of view.  We note and publish that and we acknowledge the good work of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.</p> <p>  No. 2195B is from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 28 May 2019, providing follow-up information regarding the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which we requested at our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 16 May 2019.  We will note and publish this and it will feed into our consideration of the matter in our next periodic report.  </p> <p>  The key issue here was that we asked about the Construction Contracts Act 2013 which was a side issue to the discussion with the board of the paediatric hospital but it dealt with the question of subcontractors being paid for work.  In this document Mr. Quinn points out that the Construction Contracts Act 2013 does provide, irrespective of the provisions of a subcontract, that the subcontractors are entitled to be paid the full value of work completed every 30 days.  I am putting this on record because subcontractors get concerned that they may be left waiting.  Paying parties must respond within 21 days and if they fail to respond, they can be caught for the full bill submitted in the event that they do not contest it.  Any dispute has to be adjudicated and can go for adjudication where that arises.  We asked for that to be put on record.</p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Quinn to clarify a question that has arisen in respect of the children's hospital.  Where the main contractor makes a submission for extra work carried out, which could take quite a long time to adjudicate, where stands the subcontractor in the meantime?  I do not know the answer.  This document states the subcontractor is entitled to be paid for the full value of work within 30 days but if it is for extra work that has not been accepted by the contracting party, where does the subcontractor stand? </p></speech>

Whatever about the main contractors, subcontractors could be put out of business.  It would also be useful for us to know how the finance for this is drawn down.  Is the main contractor drawing down money monthly?  How is that managed?</p></speech>

Once the work has been done and it is certified as having been done to the satisfactory standard, the public sector body is under an obligation to make a payment.  This deals with the on-payment or stage payment, if that is the issue, in the meantime.  Does the third bullet point not address the Chairman's question about dispute?</p></speech>

I stress again for people who have an interest in this that the Construction Contracts Act applies to contracts in the private sector.  It is not just the public sector.  This applies across the board in the entire State and is not confined.  People who are working in the private sector in building etc. have the same rights.  It is not just for public sector contracts.  It is important for people to understand this.</p></speech>

How does that fit into that legislation?</p> <p>  No. 2196B is from Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 29 May, in response to our request for an unredacted version of the memo regarding the national broadband plan from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

It may be useful as it came up with Deputy MacSharry in a different context last week in relation to KPMG.  The reply stated that KPMG is an adviser appointed by the Department to give specialist advice on the national broadband plan and it continues to do so.  The Department is aware that KPMG performs the statutory audit and provides tax advice to Granahan McCourt.  We should nearly have another Department called KPMG at this point.</p></speech>

Even a perceived conflict of interest is problematic.  I have serious concerns that we need to be looking at.  I do not know where one frames this but there is most definitely a perceived conflict of interest when the only remaining bidder is audited by KPMG.  KPMG are providing advice to the Department on specialist, commercial and financial areas.  It just does not sit with me as not being in the territory of conflict of interest.</p></speech>

We note and publish this letter from Robert Watt.</p> <p>  No. 2199B is from Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works providing information, including costs incurred, requested by the committee regarding public infrastructure at Bellurgan, Dundalk, County Louth.  We note and publish this and we will send the response to the correspondent who raised the particular matter.</p> <p>  No. 2201B is from Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, enclosing a minute from the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform on our periodic report No. 5, September-November 2018.  I welcome the prompt response to our last periodic report and I want to hold over the publication of this until we discuss it at our next meeting.  There is quite a bit in it and we could take quite a bit of time to deal with it this morning.  We have a few other things we want to do.  We will ensure that we deal with it next week.  The one item I might refer to as we go along relates to other correspondence relating to that, but I will hold over the publication of that until the next meeting.</p> <p>  No. 2206B is again from Robert Watt, dated 4 June, providing a further update to information requested by the committee previously regarding the single public service pension scheme.  We will note and publish this.  When the new single public service pension scheme was introduced, the Department responsible for the public sector and which sponsored the legislation did not know what public bodies were going to be covered by this.  It took it several years after the passage of the legislation to work out which public bodies were included in this.  We had a detailed discussion on this and I believe we referred to it in a previous report or perhaps it was to be included in our next report.  We received a report in February 2019, when we were dealing with this, showing that the Department was still not quite sure about quite a number of bodies some three years after the passage of legislation.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt has given us an update now as to where the Department stands on this issue.  At this stage, there are four issues in respect of all the public bodies that the Department believes should be included in this.  One issue is that three organisations, namely, the Residential Tenancies Board, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland, submitted cases to the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform explaining the difficulties they would face in meeting the arrears.  When this legislation came in, which was effective from three years ago, those organisations which had not provided the employer contribution in respect of the public service pension scheme were going to be asked to pay the arrears for the three years that they did not cover.  These three organisations said that they would operate the scheme from now on but that they did not have the resources to pay the arrears.  The Minister has accepted the case.  Accordingly, a ministerial direction was given quite recently to the three bodies under the 2012 Act to enable the bodies to retain the moneys owed in respect of the single pension employer contributions for the prior years.</p><p>The three public service bodies have started to remit the single scheme employer contributions due from 1 January 2019 onwards.  Essentially, the argument was the funding provided by the Department to them did not allow them to cover for arrears in previous years.  It will not affect the employees' scheme when they come to retire.  It is a pity it came to this.</p><p> There is one other issue.  We also mentioned the Dental Council.  It has arrears of &euro;7,000.  That figure has now been agreed but has not yet been paid.  It is the only organisation that has not paid its arrears where the Department is insisting the arrears be paid.  The Department of Health, which was engaging with the Dental Council, has confirmed the Dental Council's agreement to remit the required contribution in the near term.  We take it this will be wrapped up and paid by the Dental Council.  At the end of the day, three organisations did not pay the arrears.  This was because the Department did not have its house in order when the Oireachtas passed the legislation and it took three years to get on top of the legislation the House had passed.  The lesson is that, in future, any Department asking the Oireachtas to pass legislation must have arrangements in place to implement the legislation on the due date.  We will note and publish this.  At least we have now concluded this matter.</p><p> No. 2222B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, providing information requested by the committee regarding the costs, oversight and procurement process of the Kevin Street Garda station project.  This matter arose at our recent meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May 2019.  The OPW came back with a letter.  We will note and publish this.  It seems to have dealt with the issues with regard to control of the project.</p></speech>

It is our job to tie this one down.  We will ask for that.</p> <p>  No. 2227B is from Ms Rhonda Evans from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 7 June.  We received this a week ago but we are only having our meeting now.  It provides a response to matters raised.  Some of these issues may been mentioned at yesterday's meeting but I will highlight the points we raised.  We will note and publish this.  We asked for details on the procurement subcontract committee meetings in 2016 and confirmation that trilocation in terms of the maternity hospital is a key objective.  We also asked for a note on consultancy fees in 2018 to include the name of the PR company and the length and total cost of the contract.  Q4 Public Relations was appointed in April 2015 and the contract runs until March 2021.  In the years from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, it was paid &euro;1,003,593 plus VAT.  That might have been mentioned yesterday at another meeting.  There is also a note on the decision examined by the board as to whether it would lease or purchase various high-tech hospital equipment.  There is a case to be made for both choices.  In February 2019, the board recommended reverting to the traditional capital funding approach of purchasing it rather than leasing it for an extended period.  We can discuss the merits or otherwise of this.  I am sure the board has gone into it in ten times more detail than we could do here.  We will just have to accept that it made the best decision it could.</p> <p>  We also asked about the cost certainty.  We asked for a note on the design costs of the hospital, including details of the 95% cost certainty of the preliminary design and the difference in the final design costs.  We were told the design team gave 95% certainty.  The board confirms the main mechanical and electrical construction contracts were received in October 2017 and the adjusted tender was &euro;636 million.  In November, the adjusted contract sum was &euro;890 million, which was an increase of &euro;254 million or 40% of the adjusted tender amount.  We asked the board to talk to us about how it is dealing with the design team with regard to the certainty it gave, which clearly has not stood up.  This issue has not been addressed.  We have been given the figure but the hard question has been avoided.  We asked whether it was following the company.  Certainty of 95% was given but now it is being shown that it did not hold up.  I believe the letter states the board is dealing with it but we want a more comprehensive note on what that means at this stage.</p></speech>

There may be perfectly good grounds for the contractor to be suing the State.  I am not saying there are not.  However, if it is doing it nine times, it looks like there is a little bit of form and consistency.  As the people writing the cheque, we should have some element of discretion.  There is no doubt the State is defending these nine actions and spending money doing so.  I find it bizarre that the law provides for somebody to win a contract.  I suggest that perhaps our interpretation of European law and the practice is sometimes a bit too literal and lacks an element of common sense.</p></speech>

The difference is a sizeable amount of money.  I remember some discussion about there being a gigantic underestimate with regard to cabling.  That would not account for the amount of money involved here.</p><p>This will tell us something about the flaws in the tendering process.  It would be useful to explore this because that is where there is a degree of learning to be had.  We have to interrogate that particular aspect and we must do so forensically.</p><p> On the pattern of tendering, let us take the example of a company that goes in low and adds extras.  That appears to be a criticism of the contractor in this instance but it also applies in respect of other contracts for which that contractor tendered.  Is the European tendering process interpreted the same way in every member state?  Would that be the case for a Dutch company tendering in Holland?</p></speech>

It all went wrong from the point at which the assurance was given that it was 95% certain.  The latter was not the case.  The problems started to arise at the very beginning.  The company went on site before the design was completed and the taxpayer has been playing catch-up ever since.  The risk was not transferred to the contractor.  It was a case of "Start work and we will talk about the design as we go along".  It was a fundamentally crazy mistake and the Irish people are going to pay for it for decades.  Those involved got it wrong from the very beginning in order to get on site early and we are paying the penalty now.  It would have been better to take a few extra months, as necessary, to get all this done in advance and know where matters stood with the company involved before it was allowed on site.</p></speech>

However, the second point I would make is that this is about European countries competing for contracts above a certain value.  There is one company which seems to be winning a large number of public contracts.  The criticism is that it comes in low and then adds extras.  Are we handling the tendering process differently in this country and is that then being exploited?</p></speech>

It depends on the nature of the contract and the level of certainty and risk.  We have had road projects where parameters were set as regards design and the companies involved had to work within those.  Any risks within those parameters were the main contractor's problem.  This has shown up two possible alternatives.  I am more concerned about the second of those alternatives than I am about the first.  The first is that the contractor goes in low, knowing that it will be able to add extras.  That is the general presumption.  My concern is that the contractor in this instance has much of knowledge and experience of dealing with the public sector in Ireland and other countries.  It habitually gets the design wrong.  It covers precisely what it is asked to cover in the full knowledge that it has more experience than the people with whom it is dealing on behalf of the Irish public and that they will have to come back and correct their earlier mistakes and ask for work that they should have asked for upfront to be done.  The contractor is very good at spotting where it knows it is getting designs submitted for tender.</p> <p>  I will provide an example.  One guy in the industry told me that if one goes through some of these designs, one could find that a contractor designed a room without including a door.  The guy putting in the tender has spotted that knowing full well that those requesting the work will have to come back to him to put in the door and he will charge a hefty amount for doing so.  Much of this is down to the fact the design work done on behalf of the contracting body may not have been up to scratch at the beginning.  The fault could lie as much with those on the public sector side not getting their house in order.</p></speech>

Essentially, each college is approaching one or two projects over a ten or 15-year period.  In such circumstances, it is difficult for them to have the full spectrum of skills and experience when they come to commission projects.  Undoubtedly, there is an element of that kind of exposure.  What is the solution?  An OPW for the third-level sector involving specialisation might be worth considering.  However, it might not be the answer either.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to larger economies not having this problem.

The issues on which we need to try to crystallise our thoughts are being well ventilated.  We may not have the answer but we may have some useful suggestions.  We will move on.  This will be in our next periodic report on the national paediatric hospital.</p> <p>  No. 2228B is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 10 June 2019, providing information requested on behalf of the committee.  I want to highlight several items in this letter about which some members will be concerned and disappointed regarding the factual position as to how the country operates when it comes to certain issues.  We asked for an information note for the cost that will be incurred by the State for not meeting the 2020 climate action targets and when such costs will be due.  When one reads the letter, one can see that the State response, our collective response at Oireachtas and Government level, is entirely hypocritical.  The letter indicates that the arrangement at European level requires member states to meet their targets using unused emissions credit from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other member states via international markets.  In simple English, if we do not meet our targets, we can buy our way out of the problem by purchasing unused emissions from somewhere else.  This is the biggest act of gross hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.  We are stating that if we do not meet our targets, we will buy unused emission credits from somebody else before the deadline and pay the price.  This means that when the 2020 deadline arrives, we will be below our target because we will have unused credits in the system.</p><p>The NTMA is the body that purchases these on behalf of the State.  An important point is that to date the NTMA has already spent &euro;86.8 million of Irish taxpayers' money purchasing these credits, which is horrific.  This is to avoid a fine.  I know some of them may have been released in the meantime.  We asked about the 2020 climate action targets.  The letter goes on to state the Department estimates the additional cost of the requirement to be in the region of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million between now and then if we do not meet the additional cost.</p><p> We also asked about renewable energy targets.  People will find this equally upsetting.  The letter states Ireland has a target of 16% of renewable energy by 2020 and that we have increased it by a lot since 2005 when we were just at 3%.  The letter states the Department expects Ireland to achieve something in the order of 13% by 2020.  The letter also states that some years ago the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimated we could buy our way out of the problem at a cost of anywhere between &euro;65 million and &euro;130 million, depending on the price range of the trade.  This was carried out before any market activity emerged in the public domain.  In 2017, trades between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggested a cost in the order of &euro;22.5 million per percentage point below our 16% target.  If we are 3% below our target based on those prices it could cost us another &euro;60 million to buy our way out of pretending we are meeting environmental targets.</p><p> I want to put this on the public record.  I want everyone who has an interest in the environment to know that what we are doing in this country is a charade . We buy unused credits, targets and emissions from other countries just to balance our books and pretend we are coming in under target.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We should not have to spend taxpayers' money to buy our way out of these problems.  We should do the right thing in the first place.  I want to put this on the record and I hope people with an interest in the environment will take up the issue.</p><p> There is more in the correspondence from the Department with regard to broadband and we will discuss it in private session.  When the Department with responsibility for communications came before the committee we asked for details on bidder membership of the Granahan McCourt bid.  We wanted details on it because it has changed.  In the correspondence, the Department tells us that in March 2016 there were five bidders and that was the position at the time.  There was a process for making changes to a bidder.  Approval was granted in September 2017 following assessment of a further change in the make-up of the bidder.  This resulted in changes.  A further change to the bidder membership was approved in September 2018 and following approval the bidder membership is now set out as Granahan McCourt Dublin Ireland Limited, with reliance on the resources of McCourt Global LLC and Tetrad Corporation, as lead bidder and provider of equity; Enet as key subcontractor and not an equity holder; Kelly Group, with reliance on resources of Kelly Communications Group Limited and Kelly Integrated Limited, as a key subcontractor with nothing to do with the ownership; and Actavo Ireland Limited and KN Networks as key subcontractors.  The fact they are subcontractors is not the issue.  We are talking about ownership of the group, which has changed at least three times.</p><p> The final tender submitted by Granahan McCourt reflects the bidder membership as approved in September 2018.  We would like to know the current status of all of the companies involved and that have been in and out of the process since 2016.  They may have fallen out but are they still trading?  Did they ever trade?  What is their status and the link between them and the new companies?  The committee will not get to the bottom of it now because it is a bigger issue than what we will be able to conclude looking backwards.  They are all events that happened during years when accounts were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is an issue we will highlight.  It is a matter of great concern.  I acknowledge Mr. Mark Griffin for being upfront and forthright with information when we ask a question.  I must accept that.  We will note and publish it.</p></speech>

Knowing who the entity is will tell us this.  If a firm goes in for a tender to build schools it has to say what its turnover was in the past three years and what its form is.  This seems to be absent.  It is critical that we know who the bidders are.  The inclusion of subcontractors is a real curve ball.  Are they beneficial interests?  Can those subcontractors change?  Why are they even included if that is at the case except to say the firm cannot deliver it itself but these people might be able to do it.  This really exposes a huge flaw in the prospect of delivering and the longevity of the entity here.  I have something in my head but I had better not say it.</p></speech>

The committee will have to finalise a report on where we are up to this point on the broadband issue because it is ongoing.  Another committee is looking at it and we will not unnecessarily duplicate each other's work.  We will bring our work to a conclusion at a particular point as soon as practicable and hand it over to the other committee.  No doubt it will come before members of this committee in years to come.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will have had a look at it in the meantime.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We are highlighting the issues.  There is good information in the letter.  I have touched on only two particular topics.  We will move on.</p> <p>  Category C is correspondence from private individuals and not necessarily for publication.

We have previously received inquiries from the same correspondent on this matter and forwarded a response from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which provided a background to the foal levy.  The Department advised that Horse Racing Ireland administers the levy and it is not practical to base the levy on the actual amount paid by the breeder for the nomination due to the variety of deals and shares available in the industry.  That is what the Department states; we do not necessarily endorse it.  It is just what it says.  Just because we repeat what it states does not mean we agree with it.  We are just acknowledging that is what it states.  I propose to advise the correspondent that the committee will not be taking the matter any further because ultimately it is a policy matter for the Department if it wants to change how the scheme is managed.  That is a policy decision for the Minister and it is not for the committee.  We will note it and inform the correspondent accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2194C, from an individual, is dated 27 May and people will be interested in it.  It requests an explanation for payments to Deputies for sitting on committees.  We are well used to people making allegations against Deputies.  Some of them are based on false information and some are just done for the sake of doing it.  The correspondent asked for someone to explain whether Deputies who already receive a salary for being a politician are paid extra for sitting on a committee.  The answer is "No".  Members sit here as part of their work in the Oireachtas.  The correspondent wants to know whether there is extra money for sitting on a committee and, if so, this individual wants the job.  For the record, and this is important, there is an allowance for chairpersons of Oireachtas committees only but not other members.  I propose we refer the correspondence to the Oireachtas website, where there is detailed information on Oireachtas salaries and allowances for specified positions.</p></speech>

This item has been referred to and we will deal with it in private session in a few minutes.</p> <p>  No. 2200C, from an individual, is dated 31 May 2019 and requests an independent review of the technological, roll-out and investment options for the national broadband plan.</p><p>He highlights the importance of emerging technologies, such as satellite and 5G.  We will take that matter into consideration when we are drafting our report.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item, No. 2204C, dated 3 June 2019, is from an individual responding to correspondence from the committee regarding the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the use of precedent test cases.  The individual believes that legislation is being breached.  Basically, there is legislation on the operation of the various schemes operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and by the appeals office.  Not everything is covered in the legislation.  Obviously, they have their own procedures to deal with similar-type cases.  The correspondent wants to know if there is any legislative provision for this and he is saying it is illegal that they have procedures in place that are secret and that are not covered in legislation.  If somebody thinks it is illegal, he or she can take it up legally but it is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will note the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item is No. 2205C, dated 3 June, from an individual regarding Kerry County Council and costs associated with the Tralee and Listowel bypasses.  Matters related to the local authorities are not within the remit of the committee and I propose to advise the correspondent that she may wish to bring the matter to the attention of the local authority audit service.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Nos. 2207C to 2216C, inclusive, are correspondence received from a glazing company, dated 4 and 5 June, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding what the individual sees as procurement failures by the OPW of anti-ligature glazing in Garda stations.  I must be upfront on this one, without revealing the person's name.  This is a company which has a commercial interest in tendering for all these projects and which did not get any of the jobs and is dissatisfied with how the OPW has done it.  It is an issue between himself and the relevant body which we are not getting into.  The anti-ligature issue he raises is that the window, the window frames and the window openers are not designed in such a way that somebody could try to hang himself or herself in a Garda station and that the glass in the windows should be free from anything that could assist that process.  This is a company that is involved in the industry.  It is not our business.  That is all I would say.</p></speech>

What is such a person's recourse?  Whoever this individual is, he took that effort.  I agree with the Chairman's summation, but is there some other avenue we can send this person back to that is the correct avenue?</p></speech>

He says he provides all the information on the type of windows but he did not get the job.</p></speech>

However, I think the complaint he is making is that the specification was incorrect and there is not a remedy for that through the remedies directive.  That is an issue for quality that is sought by OPW and it is really down to the performance of the thing.</p> <p>  There is also a reference to glass blocks having been used and then having to be replaced.  Obviously, if there is a pattern of that coming through, it is a matter of waste.  That would be unsatisfactory, and that would be within the remit of the committee.</p></speech>

People who have had to tender for something have quite a forensic knowledge, because it is not a minor deal to put together a tender for a large project, and would likely have a great deal more detail than the average person.  I would be cautious about dismissing - we are not doing that - something because somebody is upset that he or she did not get a contract.  Sometimes they have a valid point to make.  If, for example, something ends up being an add-on later on, they certainly would have a serious issue that they might be bringing to our attention.  Let us see what the OPW has to say.</p></speech>

It might be worth referring it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well for its view, and whether it has issued a minimum requirement specification to be put into a contract by OPW.</p></speech>

I read through that correspondence and was confused as to why we had it.  The problem I foresee in the Committee of Public Accounts dealing with this by writing to both OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that we then confirm our unintentional catch-all status.  We should refer it back to the sender and ask him or her to refer it back to the OPW, which was the first point of contact, and perhaps note that the OPW should consult with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the points raised.  The difficulty is that if we start filtering these issues that have nothing to do with the Committee of Public Accounts, we will be doing it for hours every Thursday morning.  There is more and more of this happening, as the Chairman and the clerk to the committee will be aware.</p></speech>

This is in relation to contracts in previous years that have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We just want to know, and I will wait for the confirmation of the OPW that it and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are satisfied with the standards.  If they are, they are.  We are not getting into the individual contract.</p></speech>

He is saying there are procurement failures by the OPW that have cost the taxpayer money.  We cannot ignore the opening sentence.  We will write to the Garda and the OPW for a response to the issues highlighted without getting into the specifics of the contract - the safety measures - and ask if they are satisfied that it was appropriate.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2217C from the Irish Road Haulage Association, dated 5 June 2019, regarding concerns about how the road safety authority, RSA, performs its functions.  It refers to what it sees as systemic shortcomings in governance.  I propose to forward this item to the RSA for a response.  Is that agreed?

We will now deal with statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  There are five statements and accounts for review, as listed on members' screens.  The first is the Public Trustee Account which administers 148 trusts related to activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, including former Land Commission Trust balances.  The trustee account balances and there is only a small turnover.  The trust has received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Next is the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which has been given a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority has received a qualified audit opinion to the effect that its statement gives a true and fair view, except that the authority accounts for the costs of retirement benefits entitlements only when they become payable, rather than when they are earned.  All health bodies in the State have received a direction from the Minister for Health to do it this way, which is out of sync with international accounting standards.  Historically, the Minister does not want these costs showing up as an annual cost; therefore, they are buried until people retire in 20, 30 or 40 years.  This is not in order with international accounting standards, but all Ministers have done it, not just the Minister.  It was a regular feature of past practice.  We will note that the Health Information and Quality Authority is not accounting for pensions, as is usually the case for other organisations.</p> <p>  Next is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which is given a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the payment by the agency of &euro;1.9 million to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2018 in respect of an underpayment of VAT on certain services received from abroad.  The payment included &euro;600,000 in interest and penalties.  The amount of VAT involved was &euro;1.3 million, with the interest and penalties of &euro;600,000 bringing the total owed to &euro;1.9 million.  It is noted that there was a lapse in internal control in 2017 which resulted in non-compliant procurement in respect of four services contracts not being notified to NAMA's audit committee or other auditors and not being disclosed in its financial statements.  The related non-compliant expenditure total was &euro;4.35 million in 2017 and 2018.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on the VAT issue, whether it was a genuine error and so on?</p></speech>

Somebody did not understand that given the scale of the contracts, they should have been advertised in the EU Journal and should have been disclosed in last year's financial statements.  When they were assessed, it was regarded as a technical issue, but they should still have been brought to the attention of NAMA's audit committee, my office and the other commercial auditors.</p></speech>

Our periodic report includes several recommendations in respect of NAMA which I do not think we have time to get into today.  As I am not at all satisfied with the response from NAMA, I will hold over the response from the Minister for Finance to the periodic report.  However, if members wish, we can deal with it now in five minutes.  I have one or two sharp observations to make about NAMA's response.</p></speech>

It records an after-tax profit of &euro;795 million for the year.  NAMA is now stating that, subject to market conditions, its projected lifetime surplus is up from &euro;3.3 billion to &euro;4 billion.  I had a quick look at the summary and it shows that the agency has disposed of 93% of its loans.  It is nearly there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is producing a special report on Project Nantes which, I understand, is expected to be completed in the autumn.  We will schedule a meeting with NAMA to discuss its financial statements and Project Nantes at that stage.  Will Mr. McCarthy confirm the expected timescale for completion of the report?</p></speech>

Do we have any way of finding out where it is in the system?  It was a complaint submitted by an individual three years ago that an asset had been sold back to the connected person.  NAMA did not accept that there was an issue.  I am surprised that there has been only one complaint to the Garda under the relevant legislative provision.  I believe I know who it is from.  This is an important section of the NAMA Act and, given that there has only been one complaint, we should have some idea of where it is at, particularly as it was submitted three years ago.  May the committee ask the Garda about it?</p></speech>

I have tabled parliamentary questions about it, but the responses have been a bit evasive.  It has been indicated that there will be a register showing the beneficial owner, but that does not address the issue which arises from the complaints procedure set out in this important section of the legislation.

They are nearly there, which is fine.  However, I am not satisfied and we will hold our ground.  NAMA included some wholly unnecessary and gratuitous remarks in its response to the committee, which remarks I reject.  I wish to discuss the matter next week.  NAMA stated the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019 and the central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies were in the course of being finalised and would be in operation by November this year.

I am holding over the noting of the National Asset Management Agency 2018 accounts.  We are not noting them today; we are holding over noting and discussing them until next week.</p> <p>  The next item is the Health Service Executive accounts.  They received a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to the fact that, on the direction of the Minister, the HSE has not recognised in the financial statements the liability, estimated at &euro;198 million, arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants which was agreed and adjudicated on by the High Court in June 2018.  There is also recurrent non-compliant procurement by the HSE, including 30% by value of a sample of payments, totalling &euro;66 million, examined in the course of the audit.   Representatives of the HSE are scheduled to appear before the committee, but I wish to raise certain issues with the accounts.  I want people to listen because the financing of the HSE is an important issue in the public arena.</p> <p>  These are the financial statements that were signed off on by the chairperson and chief financial officer on Monday, 13 May 2019.  The Comptroller and Auditor General completed his report on that day.  On the Friday before, there was a development that I, or any member of a Committee of Public Accounts, would find unacceptable.  It involves what the Minister or the Department on his instructions did before the board signed off on its accounts.  The net operating deficit shown in the financial statements is &euro;85.174 million for last year.  That is the audited figure.  However, it masks an issue referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, that a High Court settlement on consultants' pay was adjudicated on in mid-June 2018.  In the normal course, the accounts should include a provision for that liability of &euro;198 million in the financial statements.  That would be the case for every organisation which produces accounts to international financial standards.  On the Friday before the accounts were signed off on, the Department, on the instructions of the Minister, issued a direction to the HSE not to include that liability.  However, it is a liability for the HSE.  Had the Minister not interfered with the final preparation of the accounts on the weekend before they were signed off on and audited, the deficit for the HSE last year would have been noted as being &euro;283 million.  This gross interference by the Minister or the Department is an attempt to massage the figures, fool the people and present unacceptable figures to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the weekend the accounts were being finalised, the Department issued a letter to state the settlement of &euro;198 million was outstanding and the HSE was formally directed to exclude it from the financial statements.  That is outrageous.</p> <p>  When I referred to the Minister, I meant the Department.  We know that the Minister is the political head of the Department, but the committee deals with the Accounting Officer.  We will write to the Accounting Officer to seek a detailed explanation of the rationale for a direction issued to the HSE to exclude the liability of &euro;198 million from its annual audited financial statements.  If it had not been issued, the HSE accounts being presented today would show a deficit of &euro;283 million, but it produced accounts which showed a deficit of &euro;85 million.  I have made my point.  I want people to listen to what is going on.  Accounting Officers need to control expenditure, but presenting accounts that do not present a true and fair view in accordance with international accounting standards is not acceptable to the committee.  We may end up rejecting the accounts.  It is probably a new issue of which people are not aware.  It has only come to light because we are looking at it today.</p></speech>

I would be slow to use the word "fiddled" because it has certain connotations, but it certainly involves massaging the figures and sleight of hand.  I would like to contribute on the audit opinion, but I will allow other members to comment on this issue first.</p></speech>

There are several issues on which we have shone a light in terms of the presentation of accounts.  The Chairman gave the example of one aspect of the HSE accounts and how the Department or the Minister presents them.  The committee has been quite good on the issue of the late presentation of accounts and organisations have stepped up their game in that respect.  However, non-compliant procurement has been an issued since I joined the committee.  Members have raised it repeatedly, but there seems to be no sanction, other than it appearing as a footnote in the audit opinion.  At what point do we say that is not good enough?  Our periodic report must deal strongly with this issue.  We previously considered dealing with it as a single issue.  I do not know whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or another Department sets the guidelines for procurement.  How is it that 30% of the sample came back as non-compliant?  That is an extremely high figure, considering the amount of money the HSE spends on procurement.  I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General does his job in citing this issue each time it arises, but at what point does the committee state enough is enough and that better controls are needed?  It is coming up time and again and we are not seeing any improvement.</p></speech>

For the purposes of clarification, I withdraw my usage of the word "fiddled".  I want to clarify what I meant when I referred to "fiddled accounts".  I will choose my wording more precisely.  Speaking as a chartered accountant and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the accounts, as presented by the HSE, do not present a true and fair view of its financial position at 31 December 2018 in accordance with international accounting standards.</p></speech>

I echo the outrage expressed by the Chairman on this issue because it goes beyond being an issue of concern.  All members know that there is a separation between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the interrogation of accounts by the committee.  There is respect for the independence of his office.  With that independence comes public trust which is incredibly important in being assured that the figures are accurate and a true and fair account of the state of play.</p><p>Is the Accounting Officer from the Department of Health not the person we need to have before us?  That is where the buck stops.  Who signed the letter that came to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

My understanding always was that there was an administrative side and a political side.  There is an interference here that is highly unusual.  I do not know if it is unprecedented but it is very unusual that it should happen.  I have serious concerns on this issue.</p></speech>

Several of the health bodies that are audited in the health sector are subject to presenting their accounts in the format directed by the Minister.  The Minister has the legal authority to make a direction.  Normally, it is not to include the costs of pensions and pension provision.  That is not correct but at least we know from year to year that is always there.  This, however, is a new directive.  The Minister had the legal authority to issue it and the board of the HSE was obliged to follow the legal directive from the Department.  There is statutory authority to do this.</p></speech>

What I found very unusual was that this was done on the last working day before the accounts were sent.  It was obviously known that the accounts would present figures showing a deficit of &euro;283 million and a decision was taken to issue that directive to take that figure out of the accounts.  It is within the law but bad practice.</p></speech>

A provision was put into the financial statement in 2008 for the sum of &euro;168 million.  That was maintained while the case was ongoing.  In the event, because it persisted for so long, the final bill is going to be significantly higher than that figure.  It is now estimated at being &euro;198 million.

I want to clarify this matter because we are going to move on.  In the HSE annual financial statements, note 1, on accounting policies, states:</p><blockquote>Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation<br /><br />The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis, in accordance with the historical cost convention.  Under Section 36(3) of the Health Act 2004, the Minister specifies the accounting standards to be followed by the HSE.</blockquote> <p>That legislation governing the HSE trumps normal accounting standards used by all other public bodies.  This is only happening in the health area; it does not happen in NAMA or any of the other bodies.  We are conscious of the fact it has always excluded the liability for matters with the State Claims Agency until they are settled and, although that would not be normal, at least we are all aware of it.  I highlighted this &euro;198 million because this happened on the last working day before the accounts were signed off.  This is a new departure that had never happened before.  It is referred to on page 188 of the accounts in regard to the consultant contract settlement.  It is not in accordance with normal practice.  It was an exceptional issue brought in by the Department on the last working day.</p><p>I take this very seriously.  I propose that we write to the Secretary General of the Department of Health to ask him to appear before us as quickly as possible on this issue.  I want to explain the background to this issue. </p></speech>

We might now try to bring forward our meeting with the HSE on its annual financial statements, which is on our work programme for about five weeks' time.  We will try to bring that forward as urgently as possible.  If we have to swap something around next week, we will try to do that.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is due in next week.  In my view, and I am saying this publicly to the HSE, it has now signed off its accounts and it has to be fully familiar with them.  They have been approved by the Cabinet and presented to the Oireachtas, so HSE officials must be up to date and up to speed, and they do not need to do any further preparation as it is fresh in their heads.  I am saying that we want to see them here, possibly next Thursday, and we will try to swap around our schedule and have the Secretary General of the Department of Health with the HSE for a full discussion on the HSE accounts on that day.</p> <p>  We will also discuss note 2 on page 194 of the financial statements, which deals with expenditure.  It states: "The Director General (1 January 2018 to 11 May 2018) received total payments of &euro;238,207 during 2018, comprising basic salary payments of &euro;139,649 and severance pay of &euro;98,558."  Therefore, the outgoing director general got a severance payment of &euro;98,558.  I want people to be aware of that as well because it might have been in some people's minds.</p> <p>  We will bring forward the meeting with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Health and the HSE as urgently as possible to deal with this issue, rather than leaving it hanging there for the next five weeks.  On that basis, we will not discuss the work programme other than to ask the secretariat to try to make those arrangements.  We will move on without further discussion on our programme.  We are running late as we have had to deal with quite a lot of significant issues this morning.  I apologise to the witnesses waiting outside.  However, there are one or two items that we have to discuss in private session and we will try to do that as quickly as possible. </p></speech>

I have one issue for the clerk and we can deal with it on another day.  I was going through old files to do with protected disclosures and the rules around them.  A letter came to the Committee of Public Accounts from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, dated 12 June 2018.  The references is No. 1386 B and would have been raised at the meeting on 21 June 2018.  We can discuss this matter on another day but perhaps we could circulate it to members and have a chat about it.  In the last paragraph of the letter, the Secretary General seems to indicate that protected disclosures in certain instances cannot be retrospective whereas that would not be my understanding of the law.  I have three questions I would like the Committee of Public Accounts to write to him on.  First, was the response in the letter a direct legal opinion?  If it was a legal opinion, would he be prepared to give us a copy of that legal opinion?  It does not sit with my understanding of protected disclosures.  When we brought in the Act in 2014, it was most unusual in that it was designed to be specifically retrospective, whereas most legislation could not be retrospective, as I understand it.  I am looking for those clarifications based on that letter.  As I said, I was doing some work on protected disclosures and I came across this.  I would like that clarified, if possible.</p></speech>

This represented an increase of almost 15% on the 2016 expenditure level of &euro;1.09 billion.  The account is presented under three output programmes, as indicated in the diagram which is now on screen for Deputies to see.  The largest area of spending is the child and family support programme, at &euro;740 million in 2017.  The bulk of this expenditure is accounted for by funding of &euro;713 million provided for Tusla and just under &euro;24 million in respect of Oberstown Children Detention Campus.</p> <p>  A range of sectoral programmes for children and young people make up programme B, where most of the increase in voted spending was concentrated.  The accounts record programme spending of &euro;488 million in 2017, with the early childhood care and education preschool scheme accounting for just under &euro;300 million of that expenditure.  Much of the spending under programme B is channelled to the beneficiaries through Pobal which acts as paying agent for the Department under a service level agreement.  Note 6.2 records the amounts paid through Pobal under each subhead.</p> <p>  The final Vote programme, comprising policy and legislation related spending, is much smaller in scale, at a cost of just over &euro;22 million or less than 2% of the total spend in 2017.  It included recurrent funding for the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and the ongoing Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.</p> <p>  The surplus for surrender at the end of the year was &euro;58.7 million.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.</p></speech>

In my opening statement I will give a brief overview of the main features of the Vote.  I hope the more detailed briefing material supplied in advance of the meeting was of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<br/><br/>The total gross provision for the Vote in 2017 was &euro;1.311 billion, representing an increase of &euro;173 million, or 15%, on the provision for the previous year.  Nearly all of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure is related to current funding for programmes and services.  Capital funding makes up just under 2% of the total Vote.  <br/><br/>Our central mission as a Department is to work to achieve better outcomes and brighter futures for all children and young people in Ireland.  Among our key objectives are to ensure an effective child welfare and protection system; a high quality childcare system that is affordable and accessible; and an evidence-based approach to policy that helps children and young people to participate in decisions that affect their lives.  We support both preventive and early intervention services, as well as direct involvement in the lives of children, young people and families, where necessary.  We aim to collaborate with Departments, agencies and sectors to place children and young people at the heart of what we do.  We place great emphasis on consulting widely and using available evidence to inform the development of policy.  This involves the participation and collaboration of children, young people and other stakeholders.  We also stress value for money and evaluation from the early stages in planning projects.  Increasingly, our work involves dealing with significant legacy issues spanning many decades, while also trying to strengthen services for the children of today and planning the services of the future.  <br/><br/>In terms of the overall composition of the Vote, 54% of gross expenditure in 2017 was allocated to the work and services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, while 35% was accounted for by childcare supports, which we now describe as early learning and care, and school age childcare.  The remaining 11% of the Vote encompassed a variety of other programmes, including three other agencies - the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Vote also includes the funding for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  <br/><br/>The Department has had an extensive agenda of work.  In 2017 the major actions included commencing mandatory reporting as a legal requirement under the Children First Act 2015; implementing significant improvements to childcare supports in advance of the statutory national childcare scheme, which is due to commence later this year; ending the detention of children in adult prisons; commencing the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which gave effect to the constitutional amendment on children's rights; publishing legislative proposals for the reform of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system, the Bill for which will be published soon; introducing a new bail supervision scheme, which has helped to reduce the number of children being detained; and working closely with Tusla on a range of child protection and welfare measures.  <br/><br/>We continued this work into 2018 and up to the present day.  Among the major actions are building on our work with Tusla on child welfare and protection measures, including a co-ordinated response to the special HIQA report commissioned by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and supporting the full roll-out of the national childcare information system; working closely with other Departments on child protection issues, particularly on policy and operations involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla; sponsoring the passage of the Childcare Support Act 2018 and continuing a major programme of work for the forthcoming national childcare scheme; continuing implementation of the access and inclusion model to help children with special needs to take part in the ECCE programme; increasing the ECCE scheme to two years, doubling the number of children accessing subsidies and doubling the number of childcare places across all age ranges; publishing a major strategy for early childhood entitled, First 5 - a Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families; publishing the first ever LGBTI+ youth strategy; completing the transition of the ABC programme to Tusla's prevention, partnership and family support services; developing a programme of action to deal sensitively with the burial of human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam; working to deal with the emergence of evidence of illegal registration of births; and continuing a programme for streamlining the system of funding for youth services.</p><p>These actions are just part of the major programme of work that the Department engaged in during 2017 and since then.</p><p> We are very aware that we face a number of serious challenges which we have been working to address in conjunction with relevant agencies.  In the case of Tusla we are engaging closely on issues such as recruitment of sufficient social workers and addressing unallocated cases.  We have also had a close involvement in the expert advisory group to support implementation of recent recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We have been working intensively with Pobal on a major reform of governance and compliance procedures to ensure that childcare schemes meet today's requirements.  This is part of the major task of making early learning and care and school age childcare services affordable, accessible and of high quality.  The Department continues to work on a number of other important issues including reform of our youth funding schemes, which is under way.  We are in the process of replacing the current targeted schemes, which are the product of many years' history, with a single scheme aimed at best meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.</p><p> I believe that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has made a positive impact since its establishment in 2011, particularly in the areas of child welfare and protection, affordable and quality child care supports and collaboration across sectors to advance the well-being of children and young people, but of course much more remains to be done.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I welcome him and his team.  As attested by the opening statement, the Department has a huge scope, with many areas that could be examined.  I will keep my focus tight this morning.  Primarily, I wish to focus on the fact that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs advances a huge amount of money to an organisation called Pobal to administer its early years childcare programme; some &euro;500 million in fact.  Around a decade ago I remember the journalist Mr. Kevin Myers writing an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Independent</i>in which he tried to dig down into the world of quangos in this country.  The one that confused him the most was Pobal.  I will never forget his opening paragraph.  A journalist's opening paragraph should always capture the imagination and attention of the reader.  He asked the readers of <i>The Irish Independent</i>if they had ever heard of Pobal.  He followed up by saying that they probably had not, but they should have because the organisation had a very significant budget.  He then asked what exactly it did.  Perhaps the only person reading back then who would have known the answer was the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>Prior to coming here this morning I have been contacted by many community childcare providers.  They know what Pobal is.  Following the so-called forensic audit, these hard-pressed childcare providers are being told by the watchdog that they owe money due to supposedly having received overpayments.  I would like to have something explained to me.  Why did the watchdog, that is, Pobal, which is in receipt of &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, only really start to do these so-called forensic audits of community childcare services in the last year of the programme?  The programme has been in existence since 2008.  What monitoring practices have actually existed for the last decade?  Second, what is the estimated total loss to the Exchequer in the last decade as a result of this lack of adequate checks on payments by Pobal?  What is the process for recoupment? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019061300002#S00400"><p>First, I will add some context.  Pobal is a registered charity and operates under the aegis of the Department of Community and Rural Development.  It organises a range of services.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is Pobal's biggest customer, with &euro;500 million of childcare funding routed through it as the Deputy noted.  Pobal organises all of the schemes for us and it also carries out compliance work.  It has done compliance visits for many years.  The Deputy referred to 2008.  The compliance components Pobal was looking at in the early years concerned ensuring that parents were getting a service, the money from the public purse was being allocated to them and fees were not being raised.</p> <p>  Expenditure on childcare schemes has increased very significantly over the past several years.  Our concern has always been to ensure good value for money for the Exchequer.  However in the earlier years, up to 2015 or 2016, the money was granted on the basis of enrolments and registration.  Once enrolments and registration were demonstrated, that was it.  In later years the rules changed to be based on attendances.  Therefore in more recent years Pobal has rightly been asking questions about the actual attendance numbers of children at these centres as opposed to enrolments and registrations.  </p> <p>  With respect, I do not agree that Pobal has only started forensic audits in the last year.  We have certainly asked Pobal to engage in a good deal of work in this space during the last several years, and it has done so.  Pobal has identified excessive claims or overpayments in various years.  However, because the rules of the scheme changed in the last few years to become much more specifically focused on attendance requirements, it is only in the last two years that we have been able to either recover money where it has been overpaid or make sure it is not paid in the first place.  This has been made clear to the agencies involved.  The role of Pobal has changed somewhat over the years.  I can say more abut it if the committee wishes, but-----</p></speech>

I will come back to what Dr. Lynch has said.  I appreciate his answer.  Pobal has been asleep at the wheel.  Dr. Lynch referred to what was done in previous years.  Many different types of checks were going on.  There were checks on headcounts, audits and checks on childcare.  Meanwhile there were different checks on social economy and never the twain did meet.  That was part of the problem.  What does Dr. Lynch think has been lost to the Exchequer during the past decade?  I contend that Pobal was asleep at the wheel.</p></speech>

The rules of the scheme were based on registrations and enrolments in earlier years.  This is an important point.  When we started examining whether there a case for recouping money, as recently as 2015 and 2016, we got legal advice on several cases.  The advice was that there was no such case because the rules were not sufficiently clear on attendance requirements.  These payments could not be recouped.  I can give the Deputy very specific figures on what Pobal has sought to recoup over the last few years.  In 2017 and 2018 Pobal's compliance visits produced an estimate of approximately &euro;937,000.  There are caveats here because of the type of data involved.  In the current year, 2018 and 2019, Pobal has identified potential excess claims of &euro;4.7 million.  I stress the word "potential".</p><p>In each of these cases, the money is not lost to the Exchequer.  It is either recouped through subsequent reductions or required to be submitted before the over-claim payment is made.  In some instances, providers were entitled to claim under a different scheme, that is, the community childcare subvention private, CCSP, scheme as opposed to the community childcare subvention, CCS, scheme, so it would not be payable.  The amounts identified in more recent years were recoupable or were not overpaid in the first instance.</p></speech>

Its members are being penalised for &euro;10,000 on average and they cannot afford it.  If the practices had not been allowed to develop over that period, they would not be hit in this way.  Has the Department penalised Pobal in any way for the fact that the practices were allowed to go undetected for a decade?  Can this committee be satisfied that the reporting between Pobal and the Department is now sufficiently robust?</p></speech>

We have regular conversations with Pobal as to how it implements its compliance requirement.  Pobal can only assess against the agreed rules and I believe it has done that.  The Deputy stated that individual small providers had suffered a loss of around &euro;10,000 as a result of this.  I appreciate that this would make a difference to them.  Pobal is very careful not to grab the money from them and it has a very good case management and sustainability system.  Instead of just asking a provider for the money back, it works with providers, particularly if it is clear that they will run into financial difficulty or will have sustainability issues as a result of being required to repay, or not being allowed to reclaim, money.</p></speech>

The average cost to parents in a commuter county such as my own are &euro;1,000 per month, which is the cost of a mortgage.  A surplus of &euro;48 million was surrendered in 2016 and it was &euro;59 million in 2017.  This sector has been on the front pages of the newspapers recently.  For example, a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>a couple of weeks ago referred to a projected &euro;50 million black hole in the Government's new childcare scheme.  As the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, stated, &quot;To cut to the chase an additional &euro;50 million would be needed to deliver the first full year of our new scheme in 2020.  This is just the bottom line.&quot;  How are we squaring the circle here?  There were returns of surpluses of &euro;59 million in 2017 but the Minister is looking at a &euro;50 million black hole for 2020.  Has that &euro;50 million been secured?</p></speech>

There were good reasons for it, though.  The concentration of the underspend was in the early years sector, with &euro;52.8 million of the total in that area.  We have been building ECCE to a second year and we have introduced a new access and inclusion model, AIM.  We tried to increase the uptake of some of the targeted schemes and, while we were unsuccessful at first, we were ultimately successful.  The result was that, at the beginning of 2017, we made provision for what we believed would be the requirement for that year.  In the event, ECCE funding was not required to the extent we had envisaged.  This was because we were expanding the scheme and offered, for the first time, three payment points, in January, April and September.  The September uptake was good but the April uptake was about half of what we had expected.  When one is expanding a scheme, it is difficult to accurately predict the uptake and in may cases parents decided not to start their children in childcare schemes in April.</p></speech>

The <i>Irish Independent</i>, on its front page on 20 May, referred to a new crisis in childcare because cr&egrave;ches are turning babies away.  There is a severe shortage of cr&egrave;che places for babies and toddlers because of the success of the free preschool programme for three to five year olds but Teresa Heaney, the chief executive of Early Childhood Ireland, stated, &quot;The second preschool year cannibalised places for younger children&quot;.  The Department has acknowledged the pressures and the capacity problems but mums and dads cannot find places for children, which is having an impact on mums and dads returning to the workplace.  This is a hugely significant issue and it is kicked around at election time by people who do not understand the nuances of what is happening.  It is having a detrimental effect, which feeds into the exorbitant costs which people are facing.  It is almost a premium thing to get a child into an available place, before we even get into the issue of quality.</p></speech>

We are encouraging this by including capital grants to support it and the private sector is also involved.  Availability in different regions and for different age groups is a factor too and we are working hard with providers and Pobal to assist as much as we can.  The underspends in 2017, while unsatisfactory and frustrating for everybody, were completely reversed in 2018 when we had a full outturn of expenditure and a full uptake of the schemes throughout the system.  We expect the same in 2019.</p></speech>

There have been numerous protests outside the doors of the D&aacute;il by the many thousands of people who work in the early years sector.  The stock answer is that the childcare providers are private entities but they are implementing State programmes, something which is not stated in the D&aacute;il.  The entire system would collapse without their co-operation and collaboration with the Department but the staff are grossly underpaid.  What is Dr. Lynch's assessment of that point?  These people work amazingly long hours.  Teachers in private school enterprises are paid by the Department of Education and Skills.  Should the people working in the early years sector not similarly come under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  The Big Start campaign is on behalf of these people, who are not being paid anywhere near what they deserve, considering the qualifications they need and the expectations of parents for the delivery of a quality education in the sector.</p></speech>

Since we are not the direct employers, we cannot directly influence pay but we increased the capitation rate paid to providers by 7% last September.  We have tried to make the sector overall as sustainable as possible.  We took the relatively unusual step of what we call non-contact time or programme support payments for the sector.  We paid &euro;19.4 million in the current year to assist providers because, as they will always say, this is not an area in which it is easy to cover costs and make any sort of return.  The Minister has said a couple of times that she would support a sectoral employment order which the providers could organise.  I understand that a number of the workforce are organising in that direction.  In the longer term, I am very conscious that because we are not the employer, we cannot do the sort of thing that we might do if we were the employer.  In the long term, we are developing a workforce development plan for the future of the sector.</p> <p>  Another important thing that we put into First 5, which was the strategy for children and young babies, is a new funding model.  We are seeking to develop a new funding model which will create the right incentives for the sector as a whole, including paying the workforce more.  I am not saying for a moment that there is a quick fix for this or that we can do something overnight.  We also have to be careful that increasing capitation payments does not simply get passed on in increased charges to parents.  We are treading a fine line.  We are doing as much as we can and we are working with the sector.</p></speech>

This is all part of the knock-on effect of that.  When we had the Department of Health here, I asked about a matter, and I want to ask the Department of Children and Youth Affairs too since it is also a part of this.  Money was lost when moving the offices from Mespil Road to Miesian Plaza.  There was a delay in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs occupying the premises, with an extension to the lease at Mespil Road that cost &euro;1.5 million instead of moving to Miesian Plaza.  The move was delayed, as noted in the report, because the move of assistant principal officers to the pod-style system was deemed a significant cultural change.  I asked the Department of Health that question and want to ask Dr. Lynch too.  Does he think that the &euro;1.5 million that was effectively lost to the taxpayer because there was a cultural change experienced by Department officials, moving up the road from Mespil Road to Miesian Plaza, is acceptable?</p></speech>

With regard to staffing, there has been some criticism in the school-age childcare area of the new ratio of 12:1.  I stress that the ratio was recommended by an expert group of stakeholders in the area.  As I recall, they argued for 11:1 rather than 12:1.  Some 85% of the 400 services that have registered already reach that requirement.  In other words, while people said that we would never be able to afford it or achieve this, 85% of the school-age childcare services are already meeting that.  The other 15% do not.  I have some questions in my mind about claims that this will substantially increase their cost, which I will put to them.  The Deputy quite rightly referred to pay for workers in the sector being at an average of &euro;11.93 an hour.  If one requires one member of staff per 12 children, even if the charge per hour is &euro;5, that would be &euro;60 compared to a &euro;12 cost for employment.  I think a ratio of 12:1 is good for children and for the system but I do not see how that would create the sort of financial difficulties described.</p></speech>

I want to address the Miesian Plaza matter.  There are a myriad things that are balanced on a fine line.  It is not one matter in isolation.  Another issue is that providers are subjected to rates.  I have consistently argued with the Minister about that.  It is about trying to bring down the cost base for many providers, because their margins are so tight, which Dr. Lynch knows very well.  There are a myriad things.</p></speech>

The Minister's view on rates is on record.  The move to Miesian Plaza was difficult.  There is no doubt about that.  We all worked very hard to move as quickly as we could.  It is no consolation to the Deputy to say that the &euro;1.5 million did not come from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' Vote but from the Office of Public Works' Vote.  I am not saying that makes it okay.</p></speech>

I think it was a difficult situation where people were being moved.  I was disappointed to see some of the public coverage where there was a claim that assistant principal officers in either Department were in some way delaying this.  The practical realities related to logistics, designs, availability of the fit-out and so on, rather than assistant principal officers or any other grade deliberately delaying the move.  We were ready to move.  We were the first to move, on 21 May, over the space of a single weekend.  We did not lose a day or even an hour's worth of our work.  We did a lift and shift over the weekend and were back up and running on the Monday morning.</p></speech>

They will be glad to hear that despite their loitering outside the door, they will be taking a break soon enough because of divisions in the D&aacute;il.  The Department has been given a clear audit opinion although there are a few queries that I would like to highlight.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am Chair of the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, so much of this is known to me, given that I took over the role in July 2016.  Deputy Cassells has covered much of the ground relating to Pobal.  I have raised issues about Pobal in the past with regard to its role, the integration into the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and why it is an advantageous arrangement to use it in the first instance.  That being said, Deputy Cassells has covered overpayments and recoupments but Dr. Lynch may wish to make an observation with regard to my comment.</p> <p>  With regard to a disclosure by the Accounting Officer about an internal financial control issue relating to education and training boards, ETBs, I appreciate that somebody pressed a button and inadvertently transferred five times the value of what should have been passed across to an ETB.  I appreciate that it was caught and returned but the process and manner in which &euro;2.47 million was paid in error instead of &euro;600,000 is a bit alarming, to say the least.  I appreciate that it was caught and the improvements that were made to ensure that it does not happen again.  Will Dr. Lynch refer to those improvements?</p> <p>  Dr. Lynch mentioned the Department's building, which is a fine facility.</p><p>Is the Department renting or leasing it?  I have asked this question before.  If the Department is renting or leasing, does it result in more value for taxpayers' money than an outright purchase?</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Smyth on an issue that dates back a few years and that I have raised in the past.  It relates to petty cash.  Has there been a conclusion, be it a prosecution or otherwise, in terms of the petty cash that was highlighted in the audit?</p></speech>

With regard to Pobal, we have regularly questioned the most appropriate way of delivering the services.  Ours is a relatively small Department, even though it has grown.  We had a major policy decision to make as to how to run the schemes.  In recent years, for the moment at least, we have decided that the best way to do so is through Pobal, which provides a good service.  We have a strong governance arrangement with it.  In the context of administration costs relative to others, we have looked into the matter and are clear that the administration costs are good.  Pobal is a non-profit organisation.  We believe the administrative costs that it incurs are reasonable.  Obviously, we push very strongly each year in terms of the amount of money we would pay the organisation to operate the schemes for us.</p> <p>  We are planning, in the next year or less, to have a major review and analysis of our schemes and how we run and deliver the early-years schemes.  As has been pointed out, the expenditure in this area now accounts for nearly 40% of the Department's Vote, certainly 35%.  There are questions to be asked in this regard.  For example, should the work be done by another State agency?  Should it all be run by Tusla?  Should there be a separate entity altogether?  Should the work be taken into the Department, and so on?  We will be considering this and of the role of the community childcare schemes and of anyone involved in delivery in that regard.  We would like to get it right.  Obviously, we are focused on other things at the moment, particularly the national childcare scheme.</p></speech>

It is a question of making absolutely sure that our systems are right.</p> <p>  The Deputy inquired about the building.  The OPW rents the building.  It is under that organisation.</p> <p>  The petty cash issue was of concern to us because it revealed that we failed to keep good records.  It was extremely unsatisfactory.  It meant that, while we are satisfied there is no suggestion of fraud in this particular case, there was a situation in which we did not have sufficiently good records to confidently state that this amount of money was accounted for, even though we believe that it has and have no reason to believe otherwise.  We have radically reduced the amount of cash we use.  In those days, it was to do with youth payments.  In the early days, there would have been perhaps &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 on hand.  We now have virtually nothing.  We have reduced what we would have had on hand by something like 97%.  We use almost no cash at this stage.</p></speech>

From my experience, I have no doubt that every single Department and body that has appeared before this committee over many years has had procurement issues, overruns, underestimations, instances of non-compliance with procurement rules, instances of not advertising in the appropriate journals, etc.  I am not going to refer specifically to any issues that are highlighted.  As a new Department only in existence since 2011, with its wealth of collective knowledge and examples of other Departments repeatedly not having proper information trails concerning the procurement of goods and services, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs should take a really deep look at how it and its agencies operate and procure goods and services.  I highlighted this last year at a meeting of the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  It is really important, particularly for a new Department, to be able to stand up and say there are issues pertaining only to small contracts, as in forgetting to put the cleaning contract out to tender, rather than something bigger.  It is a matter of credibility at meetings of this committee and the Select Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.</p> <p>  I wish to move on to the subject of Oberstown.  In fairness to Deputy Cassells, he covered a lot of the ground highlighted to us, and did so very well.  When I took over the chairmanship of the children's committee, I visited Oberstown.  This, of course, goes to the capital-----</p></speech>

The town has a population of 10,000.  It is a large town by the Chairman's standards.  It is approximately 10 km north of Swords, so it is perhaps 12 km or 13 km north of Dublin Airport.  It is a very rural location, although it is very well served by a former national road that would get one there pretty quickly.</p> <p>  One of the issues I experienced when I went to Oberstown was that there was a requirement to rethink the entire building because none of the doors was of the same size.  The frames were all of different sizes.  The locks were all different.  It was the most bizarre experience.  I had served on the justice committee for six years and visited prisons as a member of that committee.  I appreciate Oberstown is not a prison but if a judge sends an individual to Oberstown and he or she does not want to go there, the door needs to be locked.  Therefore, it seems pretty logical that the Prison Service should be talked to about how to proceed.  Clearly, that did not happen and the Department then had to cough up to retrofit and make uniform the doors, locks and many other things.  To my shock and horror, I was passing a door on a secure corridor and I looked outside to discover a long, thick chunk of wood jammed between a wall and a door.</p><p>That was the security.  It has been repaired since but the point is that this basic error of judgement was made in the plan, which takes me back to the expenditure.  There was an underspend on the overall project, which I would like Dr. Lynch to explain.</p><p> On the uniformity of locks and doors and the security for the personnel working in Oberstown Children Detention Campus, which should be of paramount importance to all of us, what improvements will be made in the long term?</p></speech>

On the issue of Oberstown Children Detention Campus, it was an extremely unsatisfactory experience.  However, I know that a huge amount of planning and testing went into it because I spoke to the people involved.  Mock-ups of rooms were tested, including the particular doors the Deputy referred to, by people who believed they met the required specification.  Our adviser travelled to similar facilities for children in other countries to look at the most recent designs and that influenced the type of fit-out that was accorded to the Oberstown campus.  Everybody who knew anything about this on the technical side signed up to it.  The request for tender, RFT, was agreed for the specifications for the doors, etc., yet I agree with the Deputy - I was there on a number of occasions - that at the end, it could be seen that if they so wished, the young people there were able to severely damage the doors from the inside, causing serious potential harm to themselves, let alone the issue of security.  It was extremely unsatisfactory.</p> <p>  Another issue that the Deputy has referred to is that for reasons I do not entirely understand, the door frames were not built on a uniform basis.  When doors had to be changed, therefore, they had to be custom made, etc.</p></speech>

I again agree with him that it is an area where Departments fall into difficulty.  One of our internal audit reports, which is a good and valuable report for us, gave us a limited assurance rather than a reasonable assurance, which is the full extent, and that was last June.  The criticisms were entirely valid and they were related to failing in certain circumstances to ensure that our contracts were on file or, in some of the earlier cases, and I stress that they were earlier, failing to have clear end dates or start dates.  We now have a procurement unit to attend to all of this.  We established a specific procurement unit within the Department, which has a centralised contract register that keeps all the supporting documentation and advises all of the units around the Department on procurement issues.  I expect that the chances of fairly basic and small errors, which should not happen, happening now are greatly reduced since the establishment of a small but focused procurement unit within the Department.</p></speech>

I will move on because I am sure my time is limited at this stage.  I refer to community childcare subvention, CCS, and community education training supports, CETS.  I fully understand, appreciate and value what is being done and how it is being done.  I wish we could treble it or quadruple the subvention and supports.  The Department seems to be underestimating the numbers and Dr. Lynch referenced them in response to a number of questions from Deputy Cassells.  It issue an issue and I am wondering about the shortfall in the registration of children in a variety of schemes.  Did the Department improve this process following the audit?  Is it not doing right with those estimations?  Is it that the Department is not putting enough money in or is the mechanism for generating those estimations is incorrect?  Is there an effect on the public purse as a result?</p></speech>

It goes back to the factors leading to the underspend in 2017.  There was a lower uptake than we projected for both CCS and CETS.  One of the major reasons for that was practical.  The subsidies we were paying at the time were relatively low, relative to the cost of childcare.  For example, we were paying up to a maximum of &euro;95 for one of the payments.  We increased that to &euro;145 for 2018 because we recognised the gap was not bridgeable.  Similarly, we had a rate of &euro;50 that we increased to &euro;95.  We recognised that the difficulty was a trap whereby the subsidy that we were pitching was not sufficient to provide support for people seeking to use the scheme.  We addressed that and, by 2018, coverage had increased significantly and we were at the level that we predicted.  If my memory serves me, in a relatively short number of years we have gone from approximately 25,000 to approximately 60,000 people being covered by those schemes.  I would need to check the exact figures but it is of that order of magnitude.</p> <p>  We got there by 2018 but I fully accept that in 2017, we did not, and that was primarily for the reason I have described.  We also engaged in a major communications campaign as part of what we called the September measures.  These schemes will be amalgamated or abolished when we set up the national childcare scheme.  They will form part of that in the future.</p></speech>

Good quality care for children comes from a valued workforce, as we know from international evidence.  The European Commission has told us that as well.  That is why the Minister has been very vocal about a sectoral employment order.  We work with the profession a lot and the Minister established a forum attended by representatives of different groups.  Only the other day the Minister met representatives of SIPTU, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, etc. and matters like this are always discussed.</p> <p>  As the Secretary General mentioned - it may sound like a clich&eacute; - we are not the employer and we would not be a direct party at the Labour Court for discussions on a sectoral employment order, although we would be asked to make a contribution.  If we were asked to make a contribution, we would say it is not good for children when there is 25% turnover in the sector because staff cannot be retained.  We know from international evidence that it is not good for early childhood outcomes.  We need to find a position where staff can be paid a reasonable amount and they can be retained and provide proper early education for children.</p> <p>  There is only so much we can do and the Minister and the Government have put much extra investment into the sector.  All of this is not going to staff wages but we hope that measures like the extra 7% in early childhood care and education, ECCE, capitation last September will lead to an increase becoming evident this year.  Everything the Department can do to support the sector is being done.  We are hoping the new funding model mentioned by the Secretary General will allow us leverage the employers to pay their staff more.  We are hoping this wonderful model that is to be built will lead to services perhaps opting in to extra funding on the condition they pay their staff a certain amount.  That is in development but it will take a couple of years.</p></speech>

It seemed to take policymakers by surprise that it was such a big issue.  There was a grant of &euro;1,000 given as a budget response and the late Mr. Brian Lenihan, as Minister of State with responsibility for children at the time, introduced the early childhood care and education scheme.</p> <p>  It was a challenge in its own right to get that up and running.  It is still reasonably new but we can already see the value.  For example, we do not see as many pictures of screaming children on their first day of school in September because there is a much easier evolution into the education system.  There is a definite educational value that has already become evident.  The people working in the sector do not feel valued and they are not being retained, despite many of them being educated to a very high standard.  I will not labour the point but there would be budgetary implications if there is to be a sizable shift.</p> <p>  We focus on how money is being spent and the Department has less than it needs.  Children and youth affairs are really important and there is a major underprovision in the youth area.  Is the surplus that was surrendered a cause of concern?  I would have expected that every shilling would be spent.  That should be as much of a concern as overspends or procurement matters.  Why was there a surrender of funding in 2016 and 2017?  Was it a feature last year again and why does it happen?</p></speech>

I had started but perhaps had not completed the explanation as to how that surplus arose.  The examples arose across the ECCE, the access and inclusion model-----</p></speech>

Each year, the most important month for knowing how much money is to be spent is September; it is a September start date for most people.  We did not have time to reallocate it as a result.  We cannot simply vire or move money from one area to another without permission.  It would have been a temporary understanding rather than being permanent.</p></speech>

That is not just the ECCE scheme and I can dig out the separate ECCE figures.  That figure increased to 230,000 places.  The access and inclusion model, AIM, coverage is for children with a disability and the proportion of services, for example, that could offer an ECCE place to a child with a disability moved from 44% of services to 81% in three years between 2014 and 2017.  That is an indication of the increase in availability of the service specifically for children with a disability.</p></speech>

The services I was referring to in the increased levels were specifically the access and inclusion model which was new from 2016.  We doubled the ECCE provision by ultimately providing two years of a service.  We started with 38 weeks.  In the second year, as we were expanding, we went to an average of 61 weeks.  In the third year, which was the full year, we had the full two-year provision.  They were funded in each case.</p></speech>

The major purpose was early years provision.  For each of the years that I am looking back on from 2014 onwards, there was increased funding for Tusla for specific programmes.

Is there an objective resource allocation model in place based on factors such as socio-economic circumstances, age and rural or urban location or is funding dependent on Pobal and which organisations are in a position to make an application for funding?  How is this done?  Is there any prospect of moving towards an objective resource allocation model?  It strikes me that what we spend may not be spent in the right areas.</p></speech>

As to the Deputy's question on better or clearer resource allocation, the answer to that now is "Yes".  Under our targeted youth funding scheme, which involves amalgamating four existing schemes, we are pulling them all together into a single scheme.  We have introduced what is called an area profile, needs assessment and service requirement tool, which is a bit of a mouthful.  In layperson's language this means that the educational and training boards, ETBs, carry out an assessment of need in their area.  They identify where services are falling short, where services are reasonably well provided and where the actual needs are.  In the future, from next year onwards, each ETB will be asked to draw up the service level requirement for its area based on this tool and organisations will then be entitled to apply for funding on the basis of this model.  We did not have this model in place before.</p></speech>

The Government obviously makes decisions about what to allocate and where to allocate it.  When the decision is made as to how much money is going to be allocated to each particular area, including youth, then the proposals are drawn up within that.  Otherwise there is a danger that there would be almost infinite applications and demands for services.  This will be a step forward, however, because I have to acknowledge that the existing system, under which it is more or less a case of getting what one got last year plus or minus a few percent, is hardly scientific.  It has the distinct disadvantage that if one was in a part of the country that does not happen to have a well developed youth service, one does not get any money.</p></speech>

This meant that records, which were mostly manual because this was pre-electronic or computer-based records, were taken for a period of time - a month.  When we went back to see what proportion of time children were actually using of the time they were recorded as using, there were differences.  That is where the difficulty arose.  Under the new system, both the national childcare scheme and ECCE where we are much better at this now, there is a much more specific system for recording attendances and funding childcare providers on that basis.</p></speech>

I would argue that electronic records started much earlier than two years ago.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Lynch believe Pobal did that job?  If Pobal could not organise the scheme, and if it did not have either small or large providers using anything other than a pen and paper - which, by the looks of things, was completely inadequate - and if compliance was its other role, which I imagine was adhering to the rules and not committing fraud, then it did not do its job right until two years ago.  During the entire period it was in receipt of &euro;500 million in public money.  I am a big supporter of the ECCE scheme.  I have had the benefit of it and I still have one child in it.  As a believer in the scheme, I am very concerned that a system was set up whereby companies - be they small or large - could get payments on the basis of children being enrolled, with no checks as to whether those children ever spent even a day in the cr&egrave;ches or facilities involved.  This appears to have been going on for eight to ten years.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is the body in charge of Pobal.  It is almost similar to the relationship between the Department of Health and the HSE.  What happened was just reckless, particularly in the context of &euro;500 million in public money being involved.</p></speech>

The attendance records were better for ECCE than those for the other schemes.  The CCS, which was provided by the community-based, not-for-profit sector was a lot less well developed and had difficulties in that regard.  At the beginning, when the money was being given by Pobal  for this purpose, the focus was on making sure that parents could afford the service, as much as possible, rather than asking questions about attendance.  I stress that the rules of the game at that stage-----</p></speech>

It is my experience that where there is an opportunity to commit fraud, people will always avail of it.  The Department left itself wide open.  As I understand it, a childcare provider could register 20, 40, 50 or 100 children and could claim payment per child, but the children might never have spent a day in the facility.  Surely that is just a glaring lack of governance when it comes to public money.  This was not going on for just one year, such as when one sets up a new scheme and there may be teething problems, it was happening on for eight years.</p></speech>

The focus was on the cost of staff in not-for-profit entities.  It was much lower amounts of money in those years.  We are going back a number of years.  I am trying to describe a situation whereby the support for childcare began with staffing grants and basic supports for not-for-profit childcare providers.  Over time, and only in recent years, we moved to a subsidy system based on funding a child for a number of hours in a specific centre.  There is quite a difference between those two models.  With regard to what Pobal was able to do or was being asked to do in the earlier years, it was being asked to check that the system was operating satisfactorily-----</p></speech>

The number of instances where there were allegations of fraud have been low indeed.  I would distinguish very clearly between a failure to comply with over-claims or claiming for more hours than the children attended, and a fraud that involved people taking the money for their own use, which is in a very different space.  I am not justifying the system but it was a very belt and braces and basic system that operated for a number of years.</p></speech>

The rules, as set out by Dr. Lynch's Department and transferred to Pobal, allowed for this to happen.  The Department changed the rules two years ago and the role of Pobal changed.  Reference was made to the recouping of &euro;937,000 in the year 2017-2018 and &euro;4.7 million in the year 2018-2019, which, nicely, is five times the amount from the previous year and seems to be a worrying trajectory in fairness but maybe it is not going to continue to &euro;25 million next year.  Hopefully, we are not going there.  Dr. Lynch has just said the incidence of fraud was very low, but low in what terms?  A sum of &euro;4.7 million is not low.  The Department has been able to recoup &euro;4.7 million from over-claims since the rules were changed.  Will Dr. Lynch explain how that figure has increased by five in a 12 month period?  Has the Department just become better at catching people or at claiming back?  Who is guilty?  Was everybody at it?  Was it the case that large providers copped on to the lack of governance and the availability of money?  Was it the CCS groups?  Who was doing it without knowing?  It is my view that small childcare providers would have known that if they did not have the child in front of them they could not get the payment for the child.</p></speech>

In most cases where over-claims were identified, they occurred in instances where children did not attend for the same numbers of hours.  It was not that they were not attending at all, but that they did not attend the full number of hours.</p></speech>

The compliance visits were focused on the larger providers to which we were paying out more money, and specifically on the schemes where most of this difficulty arose, which were the CCS and related schemes.  It is important to stress that we started from a very different perspective, which was to try to assist childcare providers to provide a reasonable level of service with a certain level of State money that was relatively modest at the time.  That has grown significantly since then.  The system has become more sophisticated, even to the extent - at last - of a proper computer-based system to capture everything.  The sector we were dealing with, especially the CCS where the difficulty arose, would have involved small, not-for-profit providers.</p></speech>

On uptake, the ECCE scheme had an uptake of over 95% when it first started.  When the Department gave us uptake figures for childcare, were those figures, which we have used for ten years, based on registration but not attendance?</p></speech>

It is really only since 2017 that we have had a more robust process in place.  That includes a three-year compliance framework.  We very much work with the providers.  Where a provider has made an overclaim, we give it the opportunity to dispute that and then we start to introduce penalties.  Currently, the penalty is that in year 2, if we find non-compliance on a second visit, we can withdraw its programme support payment or refuse to offer it to the provider.  That is the payment that amounts to &euro;19.4 million annually.  It is built into the compliance framework, contracts, etc. that we can refuse the provider access to that payment.  That is a lot of money for small services.  We can also refuse capital.  We have fairly good capital available annually, and not being able to access that is certainly a sanction.  The biggest sanction is that we are recouping it.  If a provider has overclaimed, we go in and change the PIP registration so that if the provider is expecting to receive a couple of thousand euro the following week, it will not receive that due to having overclaimed.  That is the biggest sanction.  The programme support payments and the refusal of capital is the current provision.  If at the end of the third year a provider remains non-compliant, we can withdraw its contract.</p></speech>

Regarding the pay of childcare workers, it is very concerning that there is a 25% turnover of staff, as referred to by Ms McNally.  The person who looks after one's children is the most important person in the child's life after oneself.  Perhaps one's husband might be ahead, but the childcare provider is second after him.  It is because it is a caring, feminised profession that the pay is so low.  The Secretary General expressed his sympathy for the workers' situation, acknowledged their low pay and indicated his high regard for them.  However, sympathy, acknowledgement and high regard do not pay bills.  It is a matter of great concern that the pay for the mostly female workers in this sector is so low.  The Department has a role in regard to pay in the context of the focus on quality.  If staff are not adequately paid, we will not attract quality people and, as a consequence, children will suffer.  Although the Department does not actually employ the staff, it does have a function in this regard.  People are being paid &euro;11.93 per hour.</p></speech>

It was in place from 2007 until 2010.  It was then replaced by subsequent schemes.  Basically, it operated capital grants for childcare facilities throughout the country.  It followed an earlier EU scheme called the equal opportunities capital programme, EOCP, which operated between 2000 and 2006.  That was partly EU funded.</p></speech>

In its time, between 2000 and 2006, it provided 39,580 places.  It was replaced by the national childcare investment programme which operated between 2007 and 2010.  The figure I have for that was &euro;178 million in funding with 24,347 places.</p></speech>

We can come back to the Deputy on it.  The current number of providers has gone up to about 4,600.  Out of that 80% would be private.

The response was &ldquo;it is not possible to provide an accurate number of services that received funding under the NCIP, both community and private, that remain in operation to this day&rdquo;.  Why is that?  Is it because it is information the Department has not sought or because it is difficult to get it?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is independent and must do its work.  However, there is much public concern about the commission&rsquo;s refusal to release information to affected family members on where their relatives are buried.  I have spoken to some family members who say it is painful and shocking that this is the case.  Has the Department expressed a view privately on this matter?</p></speech>

Its most recent report, the fifth interim, was on burials and included a comprehensive analysis of the information it had on hand.  The commission encountered difficulty trying to identify individuals buried in individual sites, depending on the level of information and records, which go back 60 or 70 years and more.  I am not trying to speak in any way for the commission but my understanding is that it tries to be as helpful as it can with the information it has.  It will finalise its final report next February and will deal more with the issue of burials.  My impression, although I do not speak for the commission, is that it would be anxious to give any information it can give at that stage.  Most of its focus has been on burials, including trying to identify where exactly the sites are and how many people were buried there, and trying to match birth certificates with death certificates.  Short of doing excavations, DNA analysis and so on, it cannot always confidently say who is buried where.</p></speech>

Nobody has been given any indication as to the rationale behind it.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, while I again stress I do not purport to speak for it, I know the commission was anxious to keep the information it had within the bounds of its investigation until it issued its final report, which is normal.  I see the commission, essentially, as a form of a court, so anymore than I would not go to a court of law asking for information of that kind, the Department and I have not asked the commission to issue information of that kind.</p> <p>  We try, however, to keep the lines of communication as open as possible.  A monthly bulletin, for example, on what the commission is doing and any developments in that regard is published on our website, although I accept that it does not go into the type of information the Deputy described.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with that but there seems to be a fundamental issue for the families involved.  If there are lines of communication between the Department and the commission, perhaps there could be an avenue to reflect some of the concerns of those family members.  Ms Maeve O'Rourke, a human rights lawyer and lecturer at the National University of Ireland Galway, stated, "[A]s a State body under our ECHR Act 2003, the commission of investigation is obliged under Irish law to give effect to people&rsquo;s European Convention rights".  She went on to state that the rights include the right of family members of a deceased to information about the fate of their loved one, including burial location.</p> <p>  We are coming from a period when society was closed and insular.  It is a throwback to that type of Ireland.  People want a much more open and less insular approach to such tragedies and sensitive issues.  Will the Department bear that in mind?  While I do not advocate that it should directly intervene in the work of an independent commission, if there are lines of communication where those concerns could be expressed, it would be appropriate at least to communicate those concerns if they have not yet been communicated.  Has the Department been contacted about the matter, or has any organisation raised such concerns with it?</p></speech>

Many other issues have been raised but I am not directly aware of the specific issue the Deputy described.  As he noted, we maintain lines of communication with the commission in respect of its work.  I can bring his concerns to the commission's attention but it would be on the basis of communicating information rather than asking it to take a particular course of action.  I can certainly communicate with the commission.</p></speech>

What engagement and interaction is there between the Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the issue?  The figures have increased steadily.  There was a marginal decrease in the rate of child homelessness in the most recent figures but, over the past five or six years, there has been an upward trend in the number of children in emergency accommodation and children who are homeless.  It can have a deep impact on them.  A recent episode of "Prime Time" highlighted the human side of the matter, where children told their stories and experiences of emergency accommodation.  There is a stigma and a lack of certainty, and the fact that the accommodation is not a home has an impact on them.  While I accept it is not the Department's direct responsibility, it is clear this has an impact on many children.  Will Dr. Lynch comment on the interaction the Department with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?</p></speech>

We are anxious to help in any way we can.  We have taken a number of steps.  We sit on the interdepartmental group on Rebuilding Ireland.   Through a sponsors' group, we engage on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, where we examine the overall provision of services in various Departments including that of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We engage through Tusla contacts and, for example, through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, which has a joint protocol with Tusla on interagency co-operation in respect of homelessness.  We try to support children in the context of a specific childcare scheme for those who are homeless.  There is a specially constructed part of a childcare scheme, which covers children who are homeless.  While the issue is not our direct responsibility, we take it seriously in respect of the types of supports we offer for children and families who are homeless.</p></speech>

Children who are homeless are counted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but, in addition, other services are provided by Tusla.  Money is provided, for example, to Focus Ireland to fund a project worker who provides services through Focus Ireland, and to family resource centres, FRCs, to provide services such as rooms suitable for children to do homework, washing and laundry facilities and so on.  Children do not live in those facilities, however, but instead live in accommodation counted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Other supports wrap around the supports of that Department.  There are FRCs in Mulhuddart, Ballyfermot and Ballymun, with homeless services where people can receive food, laundry facilities, Wi-Fi, family support and other support services.</p><p>It is proposed to expand this further in 2019 with a proposal to recruit five project workers to work in family resource centres with homeless families, again wrapping around the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Department has worked very closely with that Department in the extension of the capital assistance scheme for young people leaving State care.  There is a view that some people who are leaving State care may be susceptible to homelessness.  Where that happens, there is a strong element of support and engagement with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure the capital assistance scheme is open to local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Between ten and 20 young people have been accommodated under that scheme and more properties are "sale agreed".</p></speech>

I refer to Mr. Lynch's opening statement which is an example of the difficulty of the job facing the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla.  On the one hand, when we think of children, most concentrate on the good news and the early childhood strategy and everything like it.  There are a lot of positives within the opening statement, but much of it referred to ending the detention of children in adult prisons, something on which the Department has been working.  The opening statement also mentioned trying to publish a legislative proposal for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and a new bail supervision scheme.  Mr. Lynch went on to talk about child protection issues, in particular, the policies and operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  We are talking about children and much of the opening statement was about the criminal justice system and engagement with it.  That is only an observation; I do not have a question.  For those who just scan over these things, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has a lot of dealings with the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  I have noted what is in the opening statement and have no question about it.</p><p>I do not see any mention in the opening statement of juvenile liaison officers and probation services.  What systems and procedures are in place?  Will Mr. Smyth respond because Tusla seems to have a lot of dealings with the criminal justice system?</p></speech>

Effectively, none of them is caught within the system; 92% or 93% are in permanent foster care arrangements.  There is a cohort of children, approximately 500 to 600, who are in residential services that go right up to the heavyweight, special care spaces which at any time contain approximately 14 children with very high needs.  It is relatively short-term accommodation.</p></speech>

The facility in Oberstown was part of the move away from the justice system.  My colleagues will give more detail in that regard.  Tusla's challenge is that we find an increasing number of older children, 16 and 17 year olds, with very high needs, cases in which criminality is an element of what they are dealing with and what we are trying to protect them from.  That certainly has an impact on the resources we have available to deal with it.  There can be very challenging cases.</p></speech>

Retaining social work staff within child protection services is a problem here, in the United Kingdom and pretty much across the world.  We have a history of recruiting a high number of staff, but, between retirements and staff leaving after a number of years, it has been a pronounced problem.  We were talking about this issue at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs earlier in the year.  Last year we recruited 150 social workers and lost 150; therefore, our numbers were static.  Out of a total whole-time equivalent count of between 1,550 and 1,600, approximately 10% of that number are recruited every year and 10% leave.  That is, in fact, better than some of the figures in the United Kingdom, but it is a problem.  We have put in place-----</p></speech>

We have done a lot of work in terms of trying to understand from people why they leave.  One of our most recent studies, based on 13 exit interviews in a particularly high-need area in Dublin, indicated a mix of work-life balance and people getting promotions into other jobs.  People come into a very high-need area, become quite skilled and then move on to another area.  There are a number of pieces.  There are about 215 social workers trained in the universities every year.  We have recruited around 150 so we are getting a very high percentage of that new intake.  However, we are in competition with the HSE and the voluntary agencies.  The HSE is in a continual space for staff in disability services, elderly services and hospitals.  They have quite a high need as well.  Since our staff have come through the child protection and welfare side, they are seen as quite experienced and it is a fast upskilling so they are in demand in other areas.  A lot of young graduates also travel after a number of years.  We have discovered that staff will work for a period of up to two years and then leave because they can draw their contributions back down at that stage.  It is like a ready-made savings scheme.  Our total head count is around 3,900 as of the end of April.</p></speech>

Since it is a new agency and we have recruited quite a number of people, we have between 150 and 175 people on maternity leave at any point in time.  That creates the other demand.  They are not leavers but vacancies are created in the system for up to a year.  That is a constant churn.  We have developed a workforce strategy which includes the recruitment campaign and getting much more vocal about how a career in child protection and welfare is quite rewarding.  Despite the bad press that our business inevitably gets when something goes wrong, and that is quite serious, the overwhelming story from social workers is that it is a very rewarding workplace and a very rewarding career.  I see all the time that the effort and enthusiasm people put in goes way beyond what one would expect in a public sector organisation.  That has to be acknowledged in respect of staff who work in very difficult circumstances in some cases.</p> <p>  We have introduced a lot of change.  We have talked about this before in terms of services.  We have been training and developing people on a piece called Signs of Safety, a very good system that is trying to establish links for the child who is at risk with their family and local area.  It aims to maintain kids in their own environment, protect them, work with them and their family but also to draw others into that network so that the child is protected and remains in a family environment.  Social workers have made very strong statements about the usefulness of that and we have developed it around the country.  Those kind of initiatives are about changing the culture and the way we do business.  That has had an impact in terms of social workers looking at the business and saying it is a better way to do things.</p> <p>  We have a lot of initiatives looking at why people leave the organisation, better ways of recruiting and retaining staff.  It is not a secret that we have some areas that are very difficult to work in.  They are the areas where we struggle to retain and get people into.  Sometimes it is a circle that reinforces the vacancy problem, in that young newer graduates end up in those areas.  Their managers can often be relatively inexperienced so there is quite a high need to support them.  That is a challenge because it is probably the last place where new graduates should be.  We have tried to address how we support them, and how we can better train them and find better ways.  It has been a challenge in the public sector.  The rules around recruitment are there for very good reasons but we find it difficult sometimes to get the right people to the right place as quickly as we need to within the rules.  We have had to look at ways of trying to create pools of staff that we can use when we run into problems with staffing in particular areas.</p></speech>

Going back to the children, I think longitudinal studies are being done.  I presume there is a lot of learning from the children who go through Tusla.  I refer to the 500 or 600, the less than 10%, who are not just in regular fostering because their parents are not there.  Where do they end up when they are in their 20s?  Is that monitored?  We would hope that an agency like Tusla is meeting children at an early stage.  It has identified 500 or 600 at this stage.  I hope there is a learning process and that institutional knowledge is building up in the system to minimise the difficulties, so that when they come out at 18 they are in a better place than they would have been in previous times.  I hope Tusla is not just dealing with the problem today but also contributing to reducing problems as they continually arise.</p></speech>

One of the points that is really worth getting out there is that when children age out at 18, we place a lot of emphasis on ensuring that there are clear aftercare plans for those young people.  For a large majority of them, we continue to provide both financially and in terms of service, care and assistance.  Many of them are in education.  Kids today are more likely to be 19 doing the leaving certificate.  Although they legally become an adult at 18, they remain effectively in the care of the State.  We have just over 2,000 young people aged over 18 who are in formal aftercare arrangements with us.</p></speech>

It is a big issue.  We hear of taxis having to move children around and of the National Educational Welfare Board.  Keeping some regularity in these children's lives is a big issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Smyth" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019061300002#OO00200"><p>The placements of the vast majority of kids who are in foster care are stable.  When Tusla was established, we were faced with a double challenge, one aspect of which was the availability of resources.  There was no policy in place at that time to ensure that those kids stayed with the families as much as possible, so kids got moved around.  Kids may still be moved around today, possibly because they have not settled in a particular placement or because there is some other issue.  Kids may be moved around in such circumstances, but in as far as it is possible, and this is something on which we are strong, we ensure that kids stay in their placements.  In the regions of north-east Dublin and Dublin-mid-Leinster there are approximately 250 instances of kids who are in foster care under private arrangements.  By and large, those kids remain in those foster care arrangements.  There is difficulty in finding local foster carers for them.  Once a child moves into private foster care, it is challenging to move him or her, purely because of attachments.  If the family support is good, the money aspect is seen as less important as the aspect of care for the child.  Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that the kids have a stable childhood that is as good as possible so that they become adults who can look after themselves.</p></speech>

It is up to us to ensure that the services they need are provided.  Ensuring those children receive the therapies and other supports they need to stabilise their lives and to move them to a less intense environment is what we do.  We depend enormously on the health services with respect to mental health, counsellors, and addiction supports for these children.  Where it is not possible for us to get those services through the health services, we have to buy them independently.</p></speech>

I know we are technically dealing with the 2017 accounts, but I remember that quite a few years ago there was a big issue in Portlaoise or the midlands.  A filing cabinet of unallocated cases showed up.  When Tusla receives a referral, how long does it take for the case to be allocated?  What triage system is in place?  Some calls are light while some are more serious.  In the early stages Tusla relies on the HSE computer system.  Does Tusla have a system of its own?  There is also an issue with regard to weekend cover, about which we often hear.  After Mr. Smyth answers those questions I will call Deputy O'Connell.</p></speech>

Referrals come from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, teachers, or medical professionals.  The volume was approximately 44,000 at that stage.  When we kicked off we had just under 10,000 unallocated cases, which means cases which are waiting to be allocated to a social worker.  Last year we had 57,000 referrals, which represents an increase of approximately 40% on that volume.  There are good reasons behind that.  The number of unallocated cases is down to 6,000.  That number is higher than we want it to be.  These cases are concentrated around five of our service areas.  We have 17 service areas throughout the country.  The unallocated cases are, in the main, in those five areas.  We have gone through the first reason that the number of unallocated cases is high, which relates to staffing.  We have also been doing a lot of work on our understanding.  When Tusla was created we had 17 separate areas.  We have a history going back to the days of the health boards, which is not that long ago.  It was 2005.  The systems remained independent of each other at that time.  We did not have the same way of dealing with referrals in each of those 17 areas.  The feature about which I talked earlier, the signs of safety model, is about ensuring that the same model of care and way of dealing with these cases is used across all areas.</p> <p>  Initial referrals into the system are normally triaged immediately and risk assessments are carried out.  HIQA has consistently found that, even in circumstances in which the number of unallocated cases is very high, Tusla does not leave kids at risk.  That initial process, within the first 24 hours, is about seeing whether the referral is high risk and whether the kid needs to be seen.  We then go into a process of initial assessment and then allocation.  Depending on the complexity of the case, the initial assessment can take a bit of time.</p> <p>  We are quite engaged in the analysis of the actual assessment and working with the people who refer children to us at the moment.  We get a lot of referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have been trying to work with An Garda, as well as with teachers, schools and others, to put in place systems which will give us a lot more information about the referral.  In light of the massive increase in referrals, we are trying to ensure that we get information that makes sense and on which we can make good assessments.</p></speech>

We have a very strong programme called Creative Community Alternatives.  There are two things I would call out.  First, we talked about Signs of Safety, which is about trying to put in place community based structures with some of the grant-aided agencies we work with and also in terms of the way we build family supports around children.  We provide much more money into those placements that are retained at local areas which, as we move forward in the next number of years, will give us an opportunity to take much of that &euro;80 million and put it into local arrangements and placements, where we can, that deliver much more for that area.</p></speech>

When we get it, could it start with the providers receiving the largest amounts first?  For example, if Deputy Aylward was getting an amount, I was getting less than him and another Deputy was getting even less, could we have it in that order?  In the next column, could the table show the amount of money that providers gave back in overclaims in respect of 2017, 2018 and so far this year?  If a company or organisation received &euro;1 million and returned &euro;10, could we have that information in the chart, please?</p> <p>  Deputy Cassells spoke about the uptake.  When we introduced the second free preschool year, it had a negative effect on places for babies.  Did the Department of Children and Youth Affairs not expect that to happen?  The delegates will know more about this than me, but my understanding is that, given the staff bands, a higher staff ratio is required for small babies than big ones.  From my experience and anecdotally, many facilities decided that it was not worth their while minding small babies when there was more money to be made minding bigger ones who needed less staff.  Why was that a surprise?  It would have seemed obvious when introducing the second year.</p></speech>

Rather, they show that, as well as doubling capacity in ECCE, we also doubled the number of places for children aged up to three years old.</p></speech>

We know that many families face major challenges in getting places for their babies, wobblers and toddlers, but that is because of the growing demand for childcare and because more women are working.  It is a success story in some ways, predominantly one about the return of women to work and so on.  Just to be clear, we now have twice as many places for children aged up to three years old as we had four years ago and nearly twice as many places under ECCE.  We managed to do both.</p></speech>

They are a source of support for parents and providers.  Clearly, the Dublin committees are very busy and parents might not get the same level of support, but that service exists.  There is also a website, <i>www.myccc.ie</i>, that parents can visit to get their local committee's contact details.  We appreciate that there are capacity issues, but the amount of investment that has gone into early learning care and school-age childcare in recent years is encouraging growth in the market.  We are seeing that, and we hope to see further expansion.  Deputy Aylward might have asked a question on this matter.  For every service that closed down last year, approximately two and a half opened with five or six times the number of children.  The number of services is increasing constantly, as is their size.  Four years ago, the average service had 33 children.  Now, it has 44 children.</p></speech>

For services to run viable businesses, though, they need a certain critical mass.  A number of years ago, we had 1,000 services with ten children in each.  No one will be able to apply for an income with that type of income.  Since those very small services were not sustainable, it is probably good that we are seeing some growth in the critical mass.  As to the question of whether major centres are good for children, it is important that those services be of a good quality and that we inspect them well and so on to ensure that they are of a high standard.</p></speech>

Can services just keep growing?  I am concerned about the economies of scale being built into the system.  Large providers will be able to operate at a much greater scale, have better buying power when it comes to food, dodies, shampoo, toilet roll and so on, and generally work out as being cheaper, which will knock out the smaller provider.  Will we end up with a monopoly or a few large providers minding our children in massive warehouses?  That is where it will end up if we stay on this trajectory.  Has the Department considered that?</p></speech>

It will also be considered as part of the funding model that we mentioned.  Currently, we do not step into the market and regulate or cap the number of places.  We are examining international experience.  We are conscious of the issue, but Ireland has not moved significantly in that direction yet.  We could move more in that direction, especially with the introduction of the national childcare scheme and if the Government continued to invest in childcare.  That is a matter to which we will continue giving attention.</p></speech>

However, I often hear from constituents that Tusla is called into divorce proceedings when child protection allegations are made against a partner.  In such cases, an accusation is made, generally against the father of the child, of some inappropriate behaviour.  I know this is a sensitive issue and I will tread sensitively here.  Tusla's role is to protect the child.  It cannot wait for the outcome of the divorce proceedings and the judge to rule.  It has to accept what it is told.  I have been told it has been referred to anecdotally in Tusla as the nuclear button where a normal divorce situation goes terribly wrong.  I have also been told this is an increasing phenomenon.  Is that the case?  I am sure it costs money to deal with these cases, meaning it relates to this committee.</p></speech>

As much as &euro;58.7 million in 2017 and &euro;48.5 million in 2016 was returned even though there are waiting lists and there is a demand for the service.  In my own constituency people have approached me to start up services.  Why was this money not utilised instead of being handed back?  Why was it not given to start-ups and new start-ups for childcare?  Returning the money does not sound right with the high demand for childcare and scarcity of money.  There was money available yet it was handed back instead of giving it to new recruits or start-ups.</p></speech>

It was really September after the recruitments and start-offs, from September that year.  So it was very late in the year before one could make a clear judgment that that would be the extent of underspend during the year.  Second, it is not a case-----</p></speech>

The new entry point is September each year so that is the critical point at which one can judge what one is going to need.  Our estimate of money requirements was on the basis of the full year, taking account of the fact that the new term, so to speak, starts in September.  That is why we were in that difficult situation.  In addition to that then, it is not a case of just simply being allowed spend the money on something else.  Money, particularly of that magnitude, would normally have to be surrendered to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Government would have to make a decision on alternative spending rather than us simply saying that we will spend it somewhere else within the Tusla or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' Vote even though it may be the case that we could identify particular areas where it could be spent.</p></speech>

The schemes where we encountered the most difficulty were the community childcare subvention, CCS, and the community childcare subvention plus, CCSP, schemes.  The ECCE scheme presented the least difficulty, with a very small proportion of over-claim.  Pobal carried out 1,700 visits last year.

We are looking at how we can regulate them in a supportive manner such that it is not burdensome and is done in an incremental way.  We want to ensure that there is something in it for the childminders, namely, that we are giving them quality supports and so on.

That seems to be becoming a problem.  Younger children are being left out of the system and parents are finding it difficult to get places for them.</p></speech>

They know in September that they will get 38 weeks of income from the Department and exactly how much they will be paid.  If a provider signs up a certain number of children at the beginning of the year, it broadly knows it will have those children to the end of the year.  However, there are drawbacks to the scheme, such as the fact that we only provide funding for 38 weeks - we do not give funding through the summer.  Although media coverage has represented the ECCE scheme as extremely attractive and other childcare as less attractive, there is something of a question mark over that representation.  As I stated to Deputy O'Connell, in 2014 there were 13,000 places for children aged under three, whereas in 2017-18 there were 31,433 such places.  Those are the cold hard data.  Some services have closed their baby rooms and wobbler rooms and are focusing on ECCE, but many others provide places for children under three.  We need more such places and are working to try to increase their number.</p></speech>

The recent compliance audit and compliance report audit of Pobal is putting pressure on childcare providers, particularly in Carlow-Kilkenny.  I raised this issue with the Minister two weeks ago on the floor of the House.  According to the non-profit community, the cost of the new regulations under the compliance audit will put more financial pressure on providers because the staff-to-child ratio must now be approximately 1:10, whereas it was 1:20.  I do not have the exact figures, but non-profit organisations have stated that more funding must be made available if they are to comply with the new regulations put in place as a result of the Pobal audit.  Representatives of the sector are to meet the Minister and will seek more funding because of the regulations being brought in under the new audit.</p></speech>

The first is the ratio of staff to children.  As the Secretary General stated, we have brought in a ratio of one adult to 12 children.  If parents are paying &euro;5 an hour for after-school care, that is an hourly income of &euro;60 for the service, but the staff member is being paid approximately &euro;12 per hour.

If a provider has 18 children in a room and fees are being charged for those, there is a profit for the provider.  The other factor is that when the national childcare scheme is introduced, some children who have a parent at home will not be entitled to after-school care.  Previously, disadvantaged children availing of the CCS could attend for 40 hours per week even though they had a parent at home.  The national childcare scheme has an in-built anti-poverty policy.  A child with a parent at home will only get 15 hours of subsidised - heavily subsidised for many - childcare.  Some services that were reliant on such children attending for 40 hours per week or for a few hours after school will no longer have that income for those hours.</p></speech>

However, if the parent is working, even for a couple of hours per week, or in training for a few hours per week, we will give them 40 hours of childcare.  It is a labour activation and anti-poverty measure.  It will be a significant change for many services and it creates significant challenges for them.  We could argue that there are more children looking for places and several providers operate a waiting list.  There may be other children who can take those places.  We have done a lot of work on looking at sustainability.  A report on it is nearing completion.  The Secretary General referred to our sustainability budget.  There is &euro;1.7 million in sustainability funding each year and that can be availed of by services which are in crisis because they are losing income and which need to transition to a better and more viable model.  We will work with such services.  We have a case management system to do so and to look at how they can cope with this change.</p></speech>

It is one of agencies that came together to form Tusla.  The 120 or so FRCs that has been established for approximately 15 years prior to that had a genesis in the need that was there.  To be fair, Tusla has worked with that structure.  Other agencies fund FRCs and they are all separate and independent agencies in their own right.  What has happened in recent years is that the CYPSC structure has increasingly been used to define need.  It brings together county councils, our workers and the local agencies that are involved in services.  The funding of FRCs has been increased somewhat in recent years and additional services, which in many cases are more outreach services, are starting to be developed from those family support agencies where they extend the service to another area of a county that is not being served yet.</p> <p>  There is an overall question for us on the services that we provide.

It is about trying to co-ordinate local agencies and areas to understand where the needs are increasing or have increased for services that are provided by family resource centres.  Increasingly the demand around the commuter belt has shown that it is the area where the population of children has increased hugely in the past 20 years and to a very large extent it is where we see an increasing demand for services - the kind of services that are delivered through family resource centres which are about much more than providing or assisting in the provision of supports to children who are not in the care of the State but are maybe trying to help children who are in a more vulnerable perspective with other agencies.  It is getting some agencies like the family resource centres to help co-ordinate those kinds of services.  Increasingly we find demands from the CYPSCs and studies being done in particular areas to identify where there is a need for family resource centres.  We get those requests increasingly and they are really the basis for where new moneys go to creating new family resource centres.</p></speech>

The following is more of a public issue.  There were problems in the past where garda&iacute; felt there were credible reports of issues of concern regarding children in foster care in a family setting where those families had children of their own.  How urgently does Tusla triage those cases now?  Mr. Smyth probably knows the type of cases I am talking about.  Garda&iacute; said there were credible reports and Tusla was accused of leaving a child in the place of concern for a long period of time causing difficulty.  I will not even go into whether there are legal cases or compensation issues.  I am more interested in the children rather than the money end of it.  Did Tusla learn from that?</p></speech>

That goes without saying.  Since its establishment, Tusla has invested heavily in foster care support and foster care arrangements.  All foster carers are Garda vetted and all children over 16.</p></speech>

The most recent case is one that occurred between 2004 and 2007.  It is a specific area.  To provide an example, there were three social workers working across that county at the time who were working in separate teams and not even connected together.  The same area today has a headcount of 20 people working together on one team.  To be honest with the Chairman, issues like that were the reason Tusla was established in the first place.  It was to avoid that.</p></speech>

My next point is in the same space.  What learning can Tusla do from the following?  I have a specific case in mind but will speak generally rather than to get into that.  I refer to circumstances in which a couple with their own children take in a couple of foster children.  It happens all over the place.  Let us say a foster child in the care setting does something inappropriate to a younger family member and Tusla is phoned.  The complaint I get is that because children in foster care are in the Tusla system, Tusla is more concerned about the fostered child than about the child at the receiving end of the mistreatment.  Is that the case?  When Tusla arrives, I am sure the thinking of the social worker on the ground is that Tusla has a child in foster care and that child is the organisation's priority.  However, it might be leaving a problem in the house.  Does Mr. Smyth get the point?  How does Tusla handle that?</p></speech>

Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 11 June 2019, the committee must consider the matter and having done so report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 25 June 2019.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee and her official to today's meeting.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the Minister of State and then take questions from the members.  I call the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to make her opening address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.980" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019061300002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the select committee for this opportunity to discuss the motion referred to the select committee for consideration:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part, signed at Brussels, Belgium, on 12 December 2016, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 31 May 2019. </blockquote> <p>This agreement is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba and signals an important step in developing EU-Cuba relations and, in turn, Ireland-Cuba relations. Cuba&rsquo;s relations with the EU have improved significantly in recent years, forming part of a general pattern of increased openness on the part of Cuba to re-engage with international partners. </p><p>This agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely political dialogue, co-operation and sectoral policy dialogue, and trade and trade co-operation.  The core aim of the political dialogue and co-operation agreement, PDCA, is to open channels of dialogue and co-operation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the sustainable development goals.  The agreement  provides for a comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Cuba on a range of policy areas, including human rights; small arms and light weapons; disarmament and non-proliferation; sustainable development; terrorism; serious crimes of international concern; unilateral coercive measures; combating illicit drugs; and combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  The agreement also provides for the development of co-operation, including on political and legal issues such as democracy, human rights, good governance, justice, citizens&rsquo; security and migration, as well as on social, environmental, economic and developmental issues.  Most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 November 2017.  However, its full application requires ratification by all the EU member states once they have completed their own internal legal procedures. </p><p>Since establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1999, Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Cuba has grown significantly.  The visit of President Higgins to the island in 2017 was a high point in our relations and facilitated the further strengthening of ties between our two countries.  This visit also highlighted the interesting shared history between the two countries, with Irish emigrants having contributed to the economic, cultural and political evolution of Cuba over the years, and Cuban leaders having been influenced by the leaders of the Irish revolutionary and independence movements. </p><p>Cuba opened an embassy in Dublin in 2001 and Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to Mexico is accredited to Cuba.  I welcome the ambassador here today.  The recent opening of two new missions in Latin America, in Colombia and Chile, has significantly increased our footprint in the region and has allowed our embassy in Mexico to dedicate greater resources to developing our relationship with Cuba.  The year 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of relations between the two countries and is being celebrated with a series of cultural events organised by our respective ambassadors. </p><p>Ireland and Cuba are like-minded on a number of multilateral issues such as disarmament, non-proliferation, gender equality and climate change.  We signed a memorandum of understanding on political dialogue with Cuba in 2015, and have since engaged in three rounds of bilateral political consultations, where such issues of mutual concern were discussed.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge concerns about the challenging human rights situation in Cuba.  Ireland is keenly aware of the difficult situation that exists for human rights defenders and civil society actors in Cuba.  Ireland, together with the EU and our fellow member states, continues to encourage reform within Cuba, particularly in the areas of freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the protection of open civil society space and a free, fair and open judicial system. The EU and Cuba have an annual dialogue in the area of human rights and this agreement provides for further engagement in this extremely important area.  Encouraging steps have been taken by Cuba, including in the reform of the constitution, approved by referendum after a process of public consultation.  Among other reforms, the new constitution establishes the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings and the right to<i>habeas corpus</i>, and extends a ban on discrimination, including on the basis of sexuality.  The PDCA recognises the potential contribution of civil society and specifically provides for further co-operation between the EU and Cuba in this area and encourages the active participation of civil society in the formulation and execution of development co-operation policies. </p><p>I thank the select committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  My assessment and that of the Department is that the PDCA provides a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen both EU-Cuba and Ireland-Cuba relations, providing for closer economic and political ties, and it also helps to provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on the many human rights issues.  </p><p>I hope the select committee will support the motion, and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may approve the terms of this agreement so that Ireland may proceed to ratify it in the near future.  I am happy to take any questions members may have at this point.</p></speech>

It has been a long time coming.  I acknowledge the presence of the ambassador today and also the work of his predecessors, Teresita de Caridad Trujillo Hern&aacute;ndez  and Hermes Herrera Hern&aacute;ndez, who worked on this for many years.  It is the culmination of all of that work that we are at this particular step today.  This is an important agreement, as is establishment of Ireland-Cuba relations for 20 years and the celebrations there will be to mark that.  The agreement is quite comprehensive in respect of the three pillars on which it will work.</p> <p>  I have been lucky to be able to visit Cuba a number of times and I have seen first hand what life is like there.</p><p>We can learn much from Cuba in particular areas.  One of those areas is sustainable development and its use of eco-villages and eco-towns as well as in the areas of education and the accessibility of the health system regardless of people's means.</p><p> This ratification is needed for full application.  We now need to see the concrete steps as to exactly what this will mean for both Ireland and Cuba.  There is great potential for further engagement between Ireland and Cuba, particularly on trade and I know some small groups are working on that.  However, the elephant in the room is the United States.  I am not sure how much progress can be made while that is not being addressed.  I have asked the T&aacute;naiste many questions on the matter.  I will quote from his reply to the most recent one: "Ireland believes that the embargo serves no constructive purpose and that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people."</p><p> For this agreement to really bring about progress and more positive effects for both Ireland and particularly Cuba, that needs to be addressed.  How can we trade with a country if there is an embargo and if there are also banking issues?  How can we apply pressure to get that blockade lifted?  We know it was lifted for a short time under President Obama and it has now come back again.  It is causing so many difficulties for people in Cuba.  How successful can this agreement be while the blockade is in place?  That is not to take from the significance of the agreement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019061300002#G00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy and I reiterate the T&aacute;naiste's points that we believe this economic embargo serves no constructive purpose.  The embargo seriously hampers our own economic activity as well as that of the European Union and any progress that Cuba itself can make.  We have consistently supported the annual resolution put forward by Cuba, most recently for the 27th consecutive time.  One might argue that obviously has not changed things.  However, as a united European Union, we all need to continue to reiterate and consistently support that position at the UN General Assembly and wherever we have an opportunity to raise this concern.  Obviously there were conversations most recently with the President of the United States of America.  We need to use those channels, our strong relationship with the US, to raise these concerns at every stage we can.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has said, if the embargo is not lifted, there is only so much this overall agreement can do.  I think it still allows us to do a considerable amount and creates opportunities for continued dialogue at every level of the Government in terms of human rights and in terms of their own economic activity.  We need to use the measures we can.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has done so particularly at the foreign affairs committee which he attends regularly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-13a.985" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019061300002#G00300"><p>I know the focus of trade missions is the Asia-Pacific region, but if there is a trade mission going in the other direction across the Atlantic, Cuba should be considered.  If we had a trade mission, including Cuba, would it be able to make progress because of the embargo?  We know of firms that have been fined because they have had engagement with Cuba.  I love the agreement which has been a long time coming, but we need to get onto the next step now.</p></speech>

We are trying to increase our engagement in that region in general.  I was in the Caribbean recently for a meeting of foreign affairs Ministers.  Obviously our focus on opening new embassies and consulates spreads across the globe.  The T&aacute;naiste is keen to focus on that region in opening a new consulate or embassy.  The more engagement we have, the more people we have on the ground, then obviously the more connectivity and communication giving greater opportunity to raise it in terms of the US challenges and in particular the Helms-Burton Act.</p></speech>

This is an important issue for a small country like Ireland that as an independent country we show willingness to help a country like Cuba to develop properly.  Irrespective of the past, we are in the present.  These are people who deserve support and help in developing their economy.  Little is known about Cuba in this country.  There was a time when Cuba was mentioned that people would say we do not have anything to do with that part of the world.</p><p>This is a relatively small independent country that is developing and going its own way.  As can be seen from the figures, it has a small number of unemployed compared with Ireland.  It has a population about three times ours, but its GDP <i>per capita</i>is only one ninth of ours.  For countries like Cuba coming from where it came from in a relatively short period, a country like ours, which is totally independent, should use whatever influence we have to bring and help them along and to support their development.  The average person living in Cuba went through periods of living under a very strict regime.  It is at times like this when it is developing that it needs friends and support.  It is important for an independent country like Ireland with no hard views one way or the other to support it.</p><p>I recommend that a small delegation of maybe a couple of Members of this Parliament should visit these countries at this stage of their development and report back so that we can find out at first hand what is happening.  Nothing but good can come out of this.  An independent country like Ireland can play a significant part in helping the development of Cuba along the lines I would like to see.</p><p>I am delighted to be here to encourage that we take it seriously.  Along with other countries Cuba is coming from a background that was very foreign to us.  Very few of us knew about Cuba up to recently.  We need to show support and encourage it to develop like a true democracy.  We should give any help or advice we can at this stage in its development. </p></speech>

Based on trade between the two countries, Ireland is Cuba's 24th most important trading partner.  While we are not very high in the list, Europe is very high.  We can do much more in increasing that figure.  People-to-people relationships and contacts have increased considerably in recent years with the President visiting in 2017.  The Cuban vice-Minister for foreign affairs visited Dublin last October.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, visited Cuba for St. Patrick's Day.  It is extremely important to continue those visits be it on a trade mission or political engagement.  Obviously the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Cuba this year gives us an opportunity through the embassy and the ambassador to highlight the connection we have and build on it.  This enables us to create greater dialogue between our two countries.  We can also build on the relationship we already have.  They are very warm relations and we want them to continue that way.</p></speech>

Like others, I fully support the motion on Ireland's ratification of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  Unfortunately, the process seems to have taken longer than anticipated and we are one of the last EU countries to ratify the agreement.  The Minister of State might explain the background there.  It is welcome that we are discussing it today and hopefully it will receive broad if not unanimous support in this committee and in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  When people talk about the history of Cuba, I think about what was there before the independent Cuban state that exists now.  I think of the Batista regime when it was a playground for the rich.  The Mafia was involved, people were downtrodden and poor.  Literacy was extremely low in the local population.  That has all been transformed.  For many of us it is a shining beacon in that part of the world to see how a small country, despite all the pressure from a near neighbour, has developed.  Its education and health systems are examples for all of us around the world, no matter how developed our countries are.  The extraordinary thing for Cuba is that for all the tragedies around the world, it has sent its people in, for example in respect of the apartheid regime, and the invasion of Angola, when the Cubans stood with the South African people.  The recent peace process in Colombia probably would not have happened without the facilitation of the Cuban Government.  We have a lot that we can learn.  I refer to hurricanes and so on and to the doctors who are sent into the shanty towns and the poor areas.  There is enormous positivity.  Anyone who travels to Cuba meets the people.  It is friendly and safe.  It ticks all the boxes for a holiday.  Society is free and open and people feel comfortable.  Anyone I know who has travelled to Cuba wants to go back.  That is a great message to be sending out.  </p> <p>  There have been long connections between Ireland and Cuba and I hope they continue.  The  EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement is the first bilateral agreement between Cuba and the EU.  The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner, its biggest external investor and the source of one third of the 3.5 million tourists visiting the island every year.  It is important that we have this agreement to build on and improve these ties.  However, to date, Ireland's trading relationship with Cuba is relatively poor.  This morning we have an opportunity to vastly improve this.  I urge the Government to investigate possible avenues where we can improve our trading ties with Cuba.  As the agreement will soon be ratified by all EU member states and will come into force, does the Minister of State know of any plans to send an Irish trade delegation to Cuba?</p> <p>  I refer to the issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised.  I have talked to some companies that wanted to invest in Cuba and increase those ties but there has been a monetary difficulty.  Has the EU discussed this?  How are they going to get around the US embargo?  It is the biggest difficulty for trade with Cuba.  There is difficulty for ships travelling with goods and so on.  I commend the Irish Government on consistently supporting the Cuban motion at the UN condemning this illegal blockade.  As the Minister of State said, it is the 27th time.  That is something we can be proud of as a country.  We have close ties with the US but, at crucial times, it is important that we stand up and speak up for another small nation.  Under the Obama Administration, some moves were made to loosen the blockade but the measures did not go far enough.  They probably came too late in the term of the Administration as well.  Progress was made towards a broad change, however.  There was a message that change was coming.  The famous handshake at the funeral of Nelson Mandela was the right message, not only in the context of the funeral but also more generally between the US Administration and the Cuban Government.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has tightened the blockade to levels never seen before.  This includes unilaterally imposed measures.  The US national security adviser, John Bolton, was speaking in Miami on the 58th anniversary of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.  Miami is an important swing state and it is part of the difficulty of US Administrations that they are in thrall to this state, particularly to those who left Cuba.  Mr. Bolton confirmed that the US would fully implement Title 3 of the Helms-Burton Act, which allows Cuban-Americans to sue foreign companies if they trade with Cuba.  That is one of the difficult barriers that we will have to overcome.  It completely contravenes the commonly accepted rules of international law.  The US Government must not be allowed to impose extraterritorial measures and should immediately lift its illegal blockade.  That is what we are publicly saying and putting into law by passing this trade agreement.  Has the Minister of State discussed these extraterritorial measures with her European counterparts and is she working with other European governments to challenge the US Administration on these measures?  This is the next challenge that is going to face us.  Most important, trade involves finance.  On measures that penalise or make it more difficult to trade with Cuba, we need to signpost what they are and try to overcome them collectively.  I welcome the fact that it is being discussed.  I am a bit concerned that we were such a long time coming to it and would appreciate if the Minister of State can give us the background on that.  There is strong support in Ireland for this agreement.  Anyone who has travelled to the area is impressed by the quality of life of Cuban people.</p></speech>

We can certainly learn from Cuba and they can learn from us.  That is why it is important not just for Irish-Cuban relations but for EU-Cuban relations as well.  On the timelines, it is true that 20 other member states have ratified this already.  There are still some that have not, so we are not exactly last.  One of the biggest challenges has been Brexit.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  There has been a delay in terms of administration and staff in being able to process this.  At the same time, that has not prevented the actual application of this agreement, which has been in place for some time now.  A number of informal dialogues have been taking place since as far back as 2015 in anticipation of this agreement, particularly in the area of human rights.  The most recent one took place in 2018, in October I think, with the anticipation of this being agreed by all member states.  We have moved it along as quickly as we can.  There were other challenges in front of us; there was no other reason.</p><p>There are no plans that I am aware of at the moment but this is something we can raise with Enterprise Ireland.  The Global Ireland 2025 strategy is focusing on doubling our global footprint across the globe.  This region is of particular significance for us as well so if there are particular companies that have an interest, Enterprise Ireland would be very interested and happy to engage in that regard.  I believe a number of small Irish companies are actively pursuing opportunities in the Cuban market but as mentioned by many Deputies there are many challenges in terms of the embargo and also the Helms-Burton Act.  That is an issue we have raised, and particularly the T&aacute;naiste, at the foreign affairs committee.  The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has raised that also in our discussions at the United Nations.  We have been asking for the US to reinstate the waiver that had previously been in place for six months at a time.  It was then reduced to 45 days and it is no longer in place now.  That is hindering matters and, as far as we are concerned, is contrary to international European law.  We are continually raising that issue to see if the waiver can be reinstated as quickly as possible.</p><p> Overall, relations between the EU, Ireland and Cuba have improved significantly in recent years.  This agreement shows a willingness and an openness for Cuba to re-engage on specific issues and areas of concern.  This gives us the platform to do that.  Also, the 20-year anniversary gives us a particular emphasis this year and an opportunity at home and in Cuba to see how we can strengthen that, not just in terms of trade or economically but culturally and otherwise.</p><p> I thank the Deputies for their support.

My primary focus in this address will be on business insurance.  I am very conscious of the difficulties that the cost and availability of insurance are creating for many businesses and voluntary and community groups.  I can understand the frustration that many people have with the existing position.  I believe that, with the objective evidence provided by the Personal Injuries Commission benchmarking report on the higher than average award levels for soft tissue injuries in the country, we have a solid basis for addressing these difficulties through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill.  I will talk about that in more detail later.</p> <p>  The cost of insurance working group has made it clear from the outset that there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to stem or reverse immediately premium price rises and that some of the necessary reforms will take time to implement.  This was also recognised by this committee in its motor insurance report.  The major constraints faced by any Government are twofold.  Award levels are the prerogative of the courts and therefore, for constitutional reasons, the Judiciary cannot be directed as to the levels that should be applied.  Second, pricing levels are a commercial matter for insurance companies and are determined based on the risks that they are willing to accept.  For legal reasons, the Government cannot interfere in such matters as this is prohibited by the EU Solvency II directive.  It was recognised that there was much the Government could do to improve the general environment within which insurers operate as well as laying the ground for a more long-term transformation of the insurance market through tackling issues such as award levels.  This is the context within which the work of the cost of insurance working group needs to be considered.</p> <p>  There has been significant progress in the implementation of the two cost of insurance working group reports.  Examples include addressing the personal injuries framework in Ireland through the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent two reports, the second of which benchmarked award levels for soft tissue injuries and made recommendations to address gaps that exist between this jurisdiction and others.  Another is the commencement by the Law Reform Commission of the examination of the possibility of capping awards in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries through legislation.  Insurance fraud is being tackled through closer co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry on foot of the fraud round table's work and the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud, which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, which will also train garda&iacute; throughout the country on investigating insurance fraud, as well as the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance related criminality.</p> <p>  The Government has made several legislative changes which are significant in the insurance reform debate and called for by stakeholders.  These include increasing transparency around the cost of private motor insurance through the establishment of the national claims information database, NCID, in the Central Bank as well as the Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its annual reports; increasing the effectiveness of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019; making it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected through amendments to sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004; and providing certainty to policyholders and insurers through the reform of the insurance compensation fund.</p> <p>  The committee should note that I look forward to the finalisation of the work of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on a price index for business insurance as well as the Central Bank's work potentially to extend the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance, which at this point I believe it should.  I will also look at how we can speed up the work related to the development of a functioning fraud database, recognising that data protection concerns must be addressed before other issues such as the governance or location of such a database can be decided.  I believe that the cost of insurance working group actions taken to date have helped to create a much more receptive atmosphere for what we are trying to achieve with the reform of the area of insurance and personal injuries litigation, since there is a much greater understanding of the depth, nature and extent of the underlying problems and much greater support for what needs to be done to address them.</p> <p>  I believe that these actions have had a significant impact on private motor insurance.  CSO figures from May 2019, which is a small change from the script circulated, which indicated April, show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5%, rather than 24.4%, lower than the July 2016 peak, almost three years ago.  My colleagues in Government and I are determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p> <p>  I will address the issue which I believe is key in the next phase of work of the cost of insurance working group.  Bringing the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.  The Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and England and Wales in particular, and has made a number of recommendations to address the issue, including the establishment of a judicial council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.</p> <p>  I believe that this awards gap needs to be closed significantly and I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill, which completed Committee Stage in the Seanad in April.  Since then, the Government has approved the drafting of amendments for Report Stage in the Seanad, which will provide for the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee, the sole purpose of which will be to develop guidelines for various types of personal injury to be adopted by the judicial council.  The amendments are subject to formal legal drafting by our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope that they will be agreed on Report Stage in the Seanad shortly.  I have been informed that the Seanad will take this next Thursday.  The co-operation of all Members of the Oireachtas will be vital in getting the Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I know that I can count already on support from members of this committee.</p> <p>  It is to be hoped that this, along with the work that the Law Reform Commission has commenced, will result in the lowering of award levels.  If this were to happen, I would expect the insurance industry to take account of such reductions in its pricing.  Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, former President of the High Court and the chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission, noted in the foreword of the commission's second report that insurance industry representatives on the Personal Injuries Commission repeatedly stated that because award levels and associated costs accounted for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs were to come down and to be maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums would also reduce accordingly.</p> <p>  I want to address the establishment of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit.  It is important to clarify that the recommendation from the cost of insurance working group was to explore the potential for further co-operation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to insurance fraud investigation.  While the issue, including the UK precedent, was explored in the report and the potential benefits were outlined, no commitment was given on this matter.  It was made clear that it was always subject to further examination and that any decision on this matter was always going to be for the Garda Commissioner.  Since my previous appearance before the committee last year, the Garda Commissioner has decided for operational reasons that a divisional focus is preferable to the establishment of a centralised insurance investigation unit.  I understand that this approach is aligned with a general divisional focused Garda model.  The Commissioner intends that the GNECB will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  It is important to accept the expert view of the Garda Commissioner in this regard, and I am confident that this marks a key turning point in how insurance fraud will be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the future.</p> <p>  Aside from what we as a Government or the Oireachtas can achieve, I will address the legal profession and the insurance sector itself, which also have to play an important role in addressing the issues that some businesses are experiencing.  I have spoken in the D&aacute;il previously about the frustrations that exist among businesses and other groups regarding these two sectors.  In that respect, I met the Law Society and the Bar Council of Ireland and set out to both my belief that it was vital that they continued to give their public support and commitment to the Personal Injuries Commission's recommendations.</p><p>I accept the commitments which both have since made.  On the insurance side, I have put it to the industry that it needs to provide strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained from the recalibration of award levels.  In addition, it will be important for it to widen its risk horizons and to re-enter segments of the market from which it has previously exited as a sign of good faith that the claims environment should begin to stabilise once the Judicial Council Bill has been enacted.  </p><p> In the end, the availability and cost of insurance to some businesses will depend on the consistency and quantum of award levels.  The cost of insurance working group structure remains the best means by which to continue to achieve this objective.  The enactment of the Judicial Council Bill will also be an important step forward in this regard and I hope there will be support in the Houses to enable a speedy conclusion to this process.  In this spirit, I intend to work closely with Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty on considering how to progress their respective insurance related Private Members' Bills, the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill 2017.  Along with the cumulative effects of the completed implementation of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations, this work will include views on increasing stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and developing a more competitive insurance market overall.</p></speech>

As I said, we expect Report Stage of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad next Thursday.  I hope it will conclude the same day.  It will subsequently be moved to the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I apologise for repeating myself but it was understood that the Judicial Council Bill would be completed before the end of 2018.  When it become obvious to me, prior to Christmas, that it would be delayed I targeted its completion for the end of the summer session.  I believe that target can be realised.  We can get it through the Seanad on Thursday and have it back before the D&aacute;il before the end of the summer session.  I have also requested a motion for earlier signature to allow the legislation to be enacted without delay.  The will allow the President to sign the Bill and it will then become law.  I have not done anything beyond that.  At that point, I will liaise with the Attorney General with a view to ensuring that, from the insurance side, the judicial council will be established as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I should note that the Judicial Council Bill is a large Bill, which proposes the most revolutionary reorganisation of the Judiciary for decades.  While the insurance side of the legislation is receiving considerable focus and attention, it is only a small part of the Bill.  Neither I nor members of the committee can control the Bill's progress.  It will go before the Select Committee on Justice and Equality for Committee Stage debate and I expect there will be deep analysis and scrutiny.  I hope, however, that this scrutiny will not delay the passage of the Bill beyond the end of the summer session.  Having said that, if we can get it through both Houses, I will speak with the Attorney General to try to have the council established as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  Under the schedule I have for this initiative, we should be able to form the committee of seven judges, one from each court, and have the analysis concluded and the new guidelines in place towards the end of the year.  That is my schedule but the timeframe is out of my control and that of the committee.  It would be helpful to agree a date by which to have the Bill passed.</p></speech>

The question of Brexit preparations in the area of insurance has come up.  How does the Minister of State see the green insurance card operating after Brexit?  Will people be able to use the insurance cover they have in Ireland when travelling in the North or the UK?  Will the Minister of State give us an update and tell us his views on that issue?</p></speech>

I am of the view that the insurance companies should automatically send out a green card for every car insured here.  It is then a matter for individuals travelling to Northern Ireland or the UK to take that card with them.  The current position is that a person's insurance company will send their policyholders a green card on request.  I am not satisfied with that position as some people may not be aware that this will be a legal requirement and that the card could be requested on the side of the road in Northern Ireland or the UK.  The right thing for the insurance companies to do would be to automatically send a green card to everybody who has insured their cars.  When a person subsequently reinsures a green card should be sent out.  This will only be relevant in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is looking for the insurance companies to automatically issue green insurance cards without the insurance policyholder having to apply.  Post Brexit, companies that export to the UK will be required to have a customs registration number, known as an EORI number.  As it stands, exporters can apply for such numbers online.  From my understanding of the latest figures I have found, which run up to the end of May, approximately 84,000 businesses will need customs registration numbers, of which 46,500 have them in place.  Another 45% of exporters, approximately 37,500, do not have a number in place.  In order to prepare for the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, could the Department of Finance engage with the Revenue Commissioners to automatically issue customs registration or EORI numbers to the remainder of these exporters now?  Could that measure be introduced?  It is in keeping with the Minister of State's view on the green insurance card.  To be ready for Brexit, it is critical that any company that exports - and the Revenue Commissioners indicate that there are approximately 85,000 such businesses - have EORI numbers in place.  Will the Minister of State take that matter up with the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

Just as the meeting started, an email landed in our inboxes from the Alliance for Insurance Reform with the results of a survey of its members.  There were 494 respondents to the survey and the headline result was that the cost of insurance for small businesses and charities has increased by an average of more than 200% in five years.  Some 49% of respondents indicated that rising insurance costs threaten their business or activity.  The Minister of State noted that we still do not have an index of business insurance costs - employer or public liability.  In the absence of official data, does he accept the figures provided by the Alliance for Insurance Reform showing the types of increases that are occurring?</p></speech>

One of the problems with insurance that I noted at an early stage was the lack of data at every level.  We need to address that.  With the help of Deputy Michael McGrath, the other finance spokespersons and the committee, we passed the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 very quickly at the end of last year.  This allowed us to start the process of establishing the database for motor insurance.  We hope and anticipate that we will have the proper datasets analysed correctly and appropriately so that we can shine a spotlight on the levels of increases and the extent to which they are damaging companies around the country.</p></speech>

The position is not sustainable.  It is closing businesses and threatening festivals, voluntary bodies, charities and community groups throughout the country.  The Minister of State has the full backing of the committee to do what is required to address the issue once and for all because those figures are not sustainable.</p></speech>

Senator Kieran O'Donnell teased out the process under way with the Judicial Council Bill.  That legislation will lead to the establishment of a personal injuries guidelines committee.

It would also be helpful to get Deputy Doherty's Bill over the next Stage.  The final pieces for both Bills would be to have Report Stage debates prior to the budget.  We passed three Bills last year, namely, the Act providing for the establishment of a national claims information database, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act and the Insurance (Amendment) Act.  If we could pass the Judicial Council Bill and the Bills proposed by Deputies McGrath and Doherty, respectively, this year, the Oireachtas will have responded very well to the current insurance emergency.</p></speech>

I have met Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the companies, and I will also meet the insurance companies individually.  The position I have taken with Insurance Ireland is that insurance companies must not delay addressing premiums following the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill.  We are on a very clear pathway of reducing awards, which will then reduce premiums.  I do not want to hear from the insurance companies that in two years, when a certain number of cases have been completed, their underwriters will consider the matter.  The industry must show good faith towards the Oireachtas in response to the level of support it has shown in passing legislation to improve the sector.  This must impact on the premiums they are currently charging.</p></speech>

We expect the big companies, once they have received invitations, to appear before the committee to explain their case, give their perspective on the industry at this time and the challenges it faces, make suggestions on what needs to be done and outline the impact on premiums should those suggestions be put into effect.  We hope they will accept our invitation and I look forward to them appearing before us.</p> <p>  It has been very frustrating trying to get information and data on fraud.  The Minister of State referred to two recent cases where people were convicted of insurance fraud.  Can he provide information to the committee on the number of prosecutions and convictions secured under the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004?  Can he get those data because I have tried to get them and cannot do so?</p></speech>

I also welcome his remarks on my Bill which was passed on Second Stage nearly two years ago.  It was agreed at this committee that we would deal with amendments to it on Committee State in the second week of July.  As I know that the Government has issued a money message for it, I look forward to passage of the Bill into law.</p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister of State said he had put it to the industry that it needed to give strong public commitments very soon to reflect savings to be gained in the recalibration of award levels.  Has he received a single commitment from it that this will happen?  We know that in 2002 the Irish Insurance Federation - Insurance Ireland's predecessor - made a very clear commitment when it outlined a list of reforms it believed were required and argued that if they were implementted, there would be a reduction in premiums by a certain percentage.  There was transparency.  I do not know if the Minister of State trusts the insurance industry, but I do not.  It is involved in price gouging and a lot of spin, bluster and distraction on the real reasons premiums are increasing.  I am not saying its issues such as the making of exaggerated claims and fraud are not real and do not need to be dealt with.  There is a need for zero tolerance in the attitude towards them, but when we see that insurance companies have increased their profits by 1,300% in one year and made a profit of nearly &euro;250 million on the backs of hard-pressed motorists and businesses that are seeing their public liability insurance premiums increase, that tells me that it is simply price gouging on the part of the industry.  Has the Minister of State received a commitment from it similar to the one received from the Irish Insurance Federation in 2002 when it stated clearly that if anti-fraud measures were to be implemented, they would result in a reduction of 2%; that if there were to be changes in the book of quantum, they would result in a 1% reduction; and that if the PIAB was to be involved, it would result in a reduction of 7.6%?  That was very clear and verifiable.  My concern is that while we need to do this in respect of the book of quantum and see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking enforcing action on fraudulent claims, there is no guarantee that any of the reductions will be passed on to customers.  Past experience shows that the industry will just pocket the money.</p></speech>

I have made strong statements on the insurance companies.  I do not hold them in high regard.  They always win.  They are the ones who charge premiums and are in charge of the allocation of an award, if one is made.  The sector decides the methodology to be used by which smaller claims remain on an insured person's record.  They remain on an insurance company's books for a significant period of time before being settled.  The most significant issue is the level of award.  The report of the Personal Injuries Commission highlighted the fact that the difference was about four and a half times the amount.  The Department of Finance has produced an analysis that shows that it was five times the amount, while the PIAB carried out an analysis that also showed that it was almost five times the amount.  I am talking about lower awards.  The insurance sector was also represented on the Personal Injuries Commission.  On occasion after occasion, it has stated that if award levels are reduced, premiums will be reduced.  I am the person who has said to the Chairman of the committee that it should bring in representatives of the insurance companies.  This is a public forum and the committee should put that exact question to them also.  I will put it to them company by company, but that will not happen in public.  I will adopt a very hard line to ensure what Deputy Doherty spoke about will not happen, namely, that insurance companies potentially will trouser the money if the level of awards comes down and premiums stay high.  That is not what this is about.  I have met Insurance Ireland and put the same line to it.</p></speech>

He has made the point that he does not hold insurance companies in high regard.  The point is that 17 years ago we were able to get the insurance industry to produce a table that was very clear.  It took into account road safety, the PIAB, a reduction in the incidence of uninsured driving, the promotion of rehabilitation, the abolition of stamp duty of 2%, the reform of the courts, anti-fraud measures, the exclusion of earnings from the black economy, a reduced number of solicitors for plaintiffs, the book of quantum and repeal of the Health Act.  The industry stated that if all of this was done, it would result in a reduction in premiums of 36.35%.  We have been here before and seen motor insurance premiums increase by over 70%, according to the CSO.  The industry tells us that it was all because of Setanta.  We fixed the issues related to Setanta and the risks for insurance companies through legislation, yet we have not seen premiums drop by 70%.  On the other side, we have seen companies increase their profits by 1,300%.</p></speech>

They are the figures.  In 2016 there was a loss year on year of &euro;75 million.  In 2017 there was a profit of &euro;59.7 million.  I know that the figures quoted are correct on the basis of how they are presented, but the fact that the sector was losing &euro;75 million a year was the reason insurance companies were exiting the Irish market.  I remind the Deputy that, year on year, between 70% and 80% of personal injury claims involve whiplash.  As I said, there was a loss of &euro;75 million in 2016.  Make no mistake - I am not here to defend the insurance companies.  They are clever enough and well able to defend themselves, but in the scheme of things, a loss of &euro;75 million in 2016 was converted into a profit of almost &euro;60 million.  That gives a different complexion than what was presented.</p></speech>

Last year the insurance industry made a profit of &euro;227 million.  Some insurance companies did not make a profit in the previous year, but they have since made massive profits totally &euro;250 million.  I am not saying insurance companies should not be profitable.  Of course, we need insurance companies that are profitable, but should they be making profits on the backs of drivers, businesses and those involved in community groups who are trying to run festivals?</p><p>No, they should not.  What they are not willing to give is a commitment that if we introduce reforms, such as those contained in the Judicial Council Bill, they will reduce premiums.  That is the problem.  They are making these profits at a time when they are stating that claims are far too high, that there is fraudulent activity, etc.  Yet, the claims were as high last year, the year before and for several years before that.  Fraudulent activity has been happening forever and a day.  I take a zero-tolerance position in respect of fraudulent activity and the Minister of State knows my position on it.  I believe strongly that we should have a centralised Garda enforcement unit.  This committee has agreed to invite the Garda Commissioner before it in order to tease out how we might look at the model he wants to deploy.  Therefore, I take a zero-tolerance approach to fraudulent claims.  However, what I do not fall for is the spin from the industry that fraudulent claims are the reason premiums are going up, or that it is the level of awards.  A good example is that the industry only reported 50 fraudulent claims in nine months.</p></speech>

I have no doubt there are more than 50 fraudulent claims in the system.  However, the reality is that these companies are price gouging.  If we deal with fraudulent claims, if we enable the Garda enforcement action, if we are far more robust in regard to prosecution and deterring people from making fraudulent claims, I am not convinced the premiums will reduce a penny.  The core of this goes back to the point that these companies where gambling, and it was not gambling with people's premiums.  They were basically investing in the bond market with the premiums and when the returns fell, their profits fell.  They then put up prices to cover that fall.</p> <p>  We need to take a very tough approach.  There has been a kid-glove approach from Government, although perhaps not from the Minister of State.  Some of the Minister of State's colleagues have really let him down in a number of ways recently.  Unless we get clear commitments from the industry, I do not know how we can ensure that a private company which is based on profits for its shareholders is actually going to pass on any of the reductions or that any reforms introduced by the Oireachtas will benefit people.</p></speech>

Fraud, we are told, costs the sector approximately &euro;200 million, although that is an industry figure and I do not have an actual figure.  The Deputy must remember that the vast majority of claims are legitimate and this a concern I have about something that is happening right now.  I applaud the strength with which the Deputy has consistently been opposed to fraudulent and exaggerated claims, as have I and most others also.  However, the big issue we come down to is that over &euro;2 billion was awarded to people in regard to claims, which is a huge quantity of money.  What we are trying to do is put in place a structure whereby people who are affected by a moderate incident get an moderate amount of compensation in damages to compensate them for that incident.  Again, I am talking about the lower levels of claims, not the higher levels of claims, and it is important to put that in context.  That was the nuts and bolts of what the Personal Injuries Commission report is about.</p></speech>

To take a hypothetical situation, if we pass the Judicial Council Bill and if we set up the council - there are a number of ifs - we may reach a position where that panel recommends, for example, that soft tissue injuries, such as whiplash, would be cut by half, given these make up the majority of claims in the first instance.  However, the industry is not indicating that this would result in premium reductions of X%.  There is nothing from the industry side.  Therefore, the industry has forced us into a dealing with a matter which we would deal with in any event.  If the claims are too high, they are too high.  If there are fraudulent claims, they need to be stamped out.  The problem is that the industry is sitting back and looking at its profits increase dramatically,  It then sees these reforms, which are only going to push up its profits unless it decides to pass them back.  If the industry is stating that high claims for soft tissue injuries are affecting the industry, it will be able to do the calculations and it should be able to turn around and say that if the book of quantum said X amount for soft tissue injuries, say, &euro;7,000 as opposed to &euro;15,000, that would result in a premium reduction for motorists of 10% across the board, although these are hypothetical figures.  The industry is not willing to do that and the question is why that is the case.  In my view, it is because it does not want to be held accountable.  We need to get the companies where they were in 2012, when there was an action plan and, although we were in the same type of crisis, there was a commitment from them.  However, Insurance Ireland is a different animal from its predecessor.  I would encourage the Minister of State to deal with that.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the Central Bank.  The Central Bank ceased to publish private motor insurance statistics in 2015.  The statistics published that year told us something very clear - I ask the Minister of State to remember this point - namely, that the average cost per policy, which combines cost per claim and claim frequency, in year one declined for both comprehensive and third-party fire and theft.  The average cost per policy decreased by 4% from 2014 to 2015, from &euro;272 to &euro;261 for comprehensive cover.  Third-party reduced from &euro;288 to &euro;272.  In terms of frequency, comprehensive policies saw a decrease from 5.2 claims per 100 policy years in 2014 when compared with the previous year.  The number of third-party claims decreased from 3.7 claims per 100 policy years.  In 2015, the statistics showed that the costs to insurers appeared to have fallen.</p> <p>  We had transparency when the Central Bank was producing private motor insurance statistics.  The last time it published them, in 2015, we were able to see that the cost to the insurers per policy was reducing for comprehensive insurance, the cost per policy was reducing for third party, the number of claims that were being made was reducing to 5.2 per 100 policies for both comprehensive and third party and the cost to the insurers was falling.  However, what happened to premiums in the same year that all of this was happening?  Premiums from January to December 2015 went up by 30%.  There is only one beneficiary of the Oireachtas or the Central Bank ending the private insurance motor insurance statistics and that is the insurance companies.  They can come in here and feed us bullshit about claims, about premiums and about this, that and the other, and we do not have the statistics to argue.  We have to rely on statistics from back in 2015, when we can see very clearly that everything was going in the other direction yet they decided to increase premiums by 30%.  I would argue strongly that we need to get those data back.  It is one of the big issues in terms of transparency.  We need to have the granular detail.  We need to know exactly what is going on with this industry - an industry that is under investigation both domestically and at European level, rightly so.  This would mean we can make a proper calculation of what is actually happening.</p> <p>  In my view, the CSO also has a role in the context of calculating the real cost of insurance for both motorists and businesses, an issue on which I have spoken to the Minister of State before.  I have huge regard for the CSO.  It is brilliant.  However, there is no point in the CSO telephoning and saying, "Hello, AXA Insurance, this is Mr. so-and-so from the CSO, we are doing our monthly survey on insurance costs and we want to ask what is the price for this, that and the other."  The insurance companies are wise to this.  If I phone up looking for an insurance premium and the Minister of State phones up looking for the same, we can get two different quotes.  It is not that they know it is the CSO; the CSO introduces itself.  Therefore, there is now a question around the credibility of the CSO data.  The insurance industry itself disputed the CSO data when the premiums were increasing by 70%.</p><p>The other advocates and consumers are now questioning the CSO data because they believe it has been manipulated by the industry.  That is not something about which any of us should be shocked.  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the fact that the evidence from the Insurance Reform Alliance, consumer groups and our experience is that what the data is now showing does not reflect the experience of individuals out there.</p></speech>

I want to make that point because it has been said quite a bit.  I was given full authority to deal with this by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  He told me to go and deal with it.  I do not think anyone is questioning my commitment to dealing with the insurance difficulties we have at the moment.  Subsequently, when it looked though as the Judicial Council Bill would be slowed down or delayed, I went to the Taoiseach and he gave me his full support.  The reason we are back on track is because of the support from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  What the Deputy is saying goes back to increases in 2015.  What shocked me most was the lack of data and information when I came into this job two years ago.  The Deputy is asking me to comment on what happened two years before I came into the job and I cannot do that.  I will comment on what will happen in the next two years.  The cost of insurance working group met during the week.  Representatives from the Central Bank were there and I pushed them strongly about the NCID.  Work started on that immediately after the legislation was passed.  That work is ongoing.  I hope we can get the figures from the NCID and have granular analysis in respect of the entire motoring sector first.  We will have that in this calendar year.  I am pushing very strongly for quarter three which is not very far away.  I cannot give a commitment that this will happen in quarter 3 but I have a commitment from the Central Bank that it will happen before the end of the year.  We will have the information analysed.  We will have-----</p></speech>

The information will be collated and we want to move into public liability at that stage.  Public liability and employer's liability insurance is more difficult than motor insurance.  I have highlighted that from day one.  It is much more diverse, there are many more sectors and much more work involved in that.  We want to try and start with the NCID for motoring first because that is where there are the most claims in the largest amounts.</p> <p>  The extension of the NCID to cover employer's liability and public liability insurance will increase transparency for these types of non-life insurance.  The Act has been drafted to allow for the extension of the scope in line with the recommendations.  The Central Bank has initiated a project to study the merits and feasibility of expanding the scope to employer's and public liability.  The bank will engage with external stakeholders, including industry and consumer representative groups to convey the key data requirements for employer's and public liability.  The bank will research the employer's and public liability insurance environment in other jurisdictions, including focusing on data availability.  The bank plans to produce a feasibility report for the cost of insurance working group by quarter four of this year, including recommendations for employer's and public liability data submission requirements.</p> <p>  The work has started on this.  It will not be available for analysis before the end of this year but the thought process has started to try and move into the employer's and public liability space immediately.</p></speech>

I am not questioning that and I do not want to go into that space.  When I stated earlier that the Minister of State had been let down, I was not talking about his Government colleagues, I was talking about his parliamentary colleagues.  We need a commitment from the industry, as was given in 2002, that reforms will result in reductions in the cost of insurance.  That is what consumers want.</p> <p>  There has been much toing and froing, juggling and manoeuvring.  I welcome the Judicial Council Bill.  A filibuster was taking place and it was being delayed.  People need to look at themselves in that regard.  The amendments have taken a long time.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that they are ready and that the Bill will go to the Seanad next week.</p> <p>  There are many ifs involved and there are things we do not know because we are putting this into the hands of judges.  Does the Minister of State have a plan B?  We set up a seven-person panel of judges.  What if the panel comes back and says the level of awards and the book of quantum are fine?  What is plan B?

We must rely on the Judiciary, in line with the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, report which stated that the Court of Appeal decisions and precedents that are in place must be considered by the committee within the judicial council.  It must have regard for the levels of those awards and the levels of awards in England and Wales where analysis was done and independently verified by KPMG.  It must analyse Irish awards with reference to similar awards in England and Wales.  We all believe this is the correct pathway.</p> <p>  Plan B is as follows.  The Law Reform Commission has started the process to see if the Oireachtas has the authority to cap the levels of awards.  It will do its body of work and conclude it as soon as possible.  It has started already which is good and welcome.  I would welcome it being concluded sooner rather than later so that, if a plan B is required, this could be a part of it.  If that is the case, we will know if the Oireachtas has the authority to limit the levels of award.  That said, none of us knows what will happen.  Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined a circumstance wherein the Judiciary says the levels of awards are fine.  In that case, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to decide if we deal with this by referendum to give the Oireachtas the authority to cap the levels of awards.  If the Law Reform Commission comes back and says the Oireachtas does not have the authority to cap awards, that will require plan C.</p></speech>

I would have questions if this body was capping the level of awards.  I take the Minister of State's point and agree that there are thousands of people who make legitimate claims.  Mr. Charlie Weston has brought attention to this issues around exaggerated and fraudulent claims and he should be commended for that but there is a danger that people think everyone is a scammer or chancer.</p></speech>

Others do not make claims because they think it would bring bad luck, or whatever it is.  That is the way it is.  Why would we reduce the level of awards so a private company could benefit from that if we were not satisfied that then savings would be passed on?  I would be reluctant to do that.</p></speech>

However, I will keep a flashlight in the their faces.  The Minister has spoken about the profiteering of insurance companies and none of us wants that.  We want the insurance sector to be put on a stable footing in this country in order that companies can be competitive and profitable, with a stable structure in place for proper competition.  We have eight companies that have had between 89% and 92% of the sector for the past number of years.  We do not have enough companies competing for the business that is here.</p></speech>

This was a threat - a bata m&oacute;r or a big stick - to try to get them to move on the matter.  Is the Department considering options such as this, as opposed to moral suasion, to convince the industry to move?  If we have other tools in a toolbox and the companies continue to rip off their customers, we could say the Oireachtas could act as a result.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he has said he does not know from where the figures have come but I want to draw attention to the Alliance for Insurance Reform survey that was only circulated to us earlier.  There were 494 responses, with the largest sector being motor and transport, followed by hospitality, leisure, retail, not-for-profits, healthcare, arts and entertainment, with "other" accounting for 6%.  There were not that many questions but question No. 3 was answered by all 494 respondents.  It asked how much insurance costs have increased since 2015, and the average answer was 204%.  There is a question on whether an insurer had increased excesses or added new exclusions, and 28% of respondents having increased excesses, with 11% seeing new exclusions, 23% seeing both and 36% seeing neither.  There is a question as to what three phrases best describe the impact that increasing insurance premia has on an organisation.  From the possible responses, 48.5% of respondents indicated it threatened the future of the organisation, 45% stated it inhibited the ability to grow and 32% indicated it was preventing the organisation from providing certain services while 25% stated it made jobs less secure.  Respondents were also asked if the Government is doing enough to address the insurance problem.  Of the 494 respondents, two said "Yes", 23 did not know and 469, or almost 95%, said "No".  That is not a personal attack on the Minister of State.</p> <p>  That is a flavour of the issue.  These are people who took the time to respond to the survey and they are involved with the industry.  We have had people in here who run play centres, events festivals, playgrounds, local authorities, pubs and restaurants.  I do not doubt that every time the Minister of State goes to a public function, people are talking about insurance.  I am the chair of a school board and I know such boards that have seen their premiums go from &euro;27,000 to &euro;34,000 per year with no new claims or incidents.  Once a group package agreement is over, the charge is being increased by significant amounts.  Insurance is necessary for most people and they cannot afford to be without it.  The Minister of State was a member of this committee when we did our work on motor insurance, and 92% of people are not claiming.  This means 8% of people have caused the premium rises.  The legal and insurance industries may be making now but we had figures indicating that at a time they certainly were not making money.</p> <p>  There is a significant frustration and I would be happy to progress  the Judicial Council Bill 2017 as speedily as possible in the Seanad next Thursday.  Report and Final Stages will be taken and the legislation could be passed very quickly.  There may be 30 Government amendments.  I am certainly happy to progress it as fast as possible.  We were ready to take it in the Seanad as soon as it was offered and no other Bill delayed it.  We were happy to process it as soon as it was scheduled for us.  The Minister of State's opening statement lists all the good work being done, and the Bill is a part of that.</p> <p>  I do not wish to portray all insurance companies or legal people as evil.  I have family members who are involved with solicitors, etc.  The awards available to people for what seems to most people to be minor incidents are an attraction.  I have said it previously in the Seanad that if people are caught trying to rob a bank, they would probably go to jail and end up with a sanction but people who make a false insurance claim, by and large, end up with no sanction if they get caught.  They can come back next week to try again.  We are bringing in the Garda Commissioner, which is helpful, as well as insurance company representatives.  It is morally and socially unacceptable to make exaggerated claims and stage accidents.  There is a cost.  There was a social welfare campaign with the line, "Welfare cheats cheat us all", and insurance fraud is costing every one of us.  Most of us with cars will not make a claim but premiums continue to increase.  I acknowledge that I experience a small drop following a large increase over a couple of years in my premium.</p> <p>  I welcome the work done by the Minister of State but when does he think restaurants, pubs and charity events will benefit from meaningful reductions?   We know this is about reducing the volume and value of claims.  With motor insurance, it is also about having fewer accidents and crashes.  When does the Minister of State believe there will be meaningful results?  These businesses are closing and are under pressure.  He knows this as he is doing that work.  Can he give them some hope?</p></speech>

The only insurance one is legally obliged to have is motor insurance.  Motor insurance was where the cost of insurance working group started.  There has been a 24.5% reduction from the peak in 2016 in that sector.  The 2016 increase figure of 69% was from a very low base arising from a price war that turned out to be a catastrophe for the sector.  When the cost of insuring a vehicle was less than the cost of a windscreen, it did not work out well for any of us.  The price war drove people from the sector, as companies went bust and companies exited the market.  As a result, insurance costs started to increase.  If we accept the CSO figures for the increase, we must accept the same CSO methodology pointing to a decrease.  I would be surprised at a 204% increase in motor insurance in the period outlined when the CSO indicates the numbers are going down.</p></speech>

The Central Bank of Ireland regulates it.</p><p>I was at a meeting recently to speak about insurance and I explained the Judicial Council Bill.  A woman responded and said that we should tell the judges what to do now that we have a panel of seven.  We do not have the authority to do that under the separation of powers.  People think the Government should tell judges what to do.  We are putting a structure in place and if it is required, the LRC will make a determination on whether we have the authority to do so.  If not, and there is no change in the amounts, the only way the Oireachtas can acquire the authority is via a referendum.  We are prepared to consider that, depending on the outcome.  I do not wish to have to take that path but if we must do so, it is something we will consider.</p><p> In addition, people have the perception that the Government should price insurance.  A major editorial by a well respected business newspaper stated that the Government should consider entering the insurance market.  We are expressly prohibited from doing so by law.  People have a perception that the Government should do this, that and the other in areas where it is disallowed.  We cannot go there.  If we do, we will end up wrapped up in the courts for years and the reforms we are trying to make will not happen at all.  Nobody wants that.  There is a reason for everything we are doing or have not done.</p><p> With regard to the period I envisage - and I put this strongly to Insurance Ireland - the moment the Judicial Council Bill is passed a show of good faith from the insurance companies should be, first, an improvement in their risk appetite and, second, the premiums to reduce immediately.  Insurance Ireland tells me it does not know if the Bill will be passed.  That is a fair statement.  If it does not pass before the summer recess, will it be passed in 2019?  It probably will be, but it will be at the end of the year.  One is then looking at a decision on the formation of the committee taking longer, the formation of the committee taking longer and the decision within the committee taking longer again.  If we do not get this done before the end of the session, it could be the end of 2020 before it happens.  That would be a catastrophe.  That is why I am pushing so strongly to get the legislation through, for an earlier signature motion for the President, for the council to be formed and for it to get on with its work as quickly as possible.</p><p> However, I have put it to Insurance Ireland and I will put it to the companies directly that they need to start to show good faith to us for the work we have done to try to improve the sector.  We have all done that work, including members of this committee and Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve the sector in its totality.  I am fine with companies making a profit, but I am not fine with companies profiteering.</p></speech>

It was that they took the 2019 renewal, minus the 2015 costs and divided by the 2015 costs.  That was their insurance cost generally.  It was not motor insurance but whatever costs they have.  While they are now only legally obliged to have motor insurance, it would be very unwise of a restaurant, play centre, event space or pub to try to operate in a world without insurance.  Some of them have talked about self-insurance schemes and so forth, but very few business owners want to have personal exposure to a claim that could happen in an event.  I doubt that any of us would expect them to do so.  I accept the points the Minister of State made.</p> <p>  In terms of the visibility, the national claims database and so forth, for a long time we have said we do not know what is happening because we cannot see what is happening.  When will we get decent visibility on figures?</p></speech>

However, we are seeing that this is a far more different and varied sector than the motor sector.

I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their efforts on this.  It is important that the committee gets regular updates from him and, through him, from the cost of insurance working group on what is happening, if things cannot happen why they cannot happen and if they cannot happen whether there is a way of getting around whatever barriers there are to make them happen.  Equally, this committee should return to its motor insurance report and see what has been delivered, what we have been told cannot be delivered and so forth.  It is one of the most important issues.  Recent insurance incidents that have been reported in the media have engaged the public in a way I have not seen many issues engage the public.  There are many issues on which one would like to engage the public but this issue has taken off.  With fraudulent exaggerated claims, everybody feels that money is being given to people who do not deserve it and the rest of us are paying for it.  That situation must be resolved quite speedily.  Otherwise there will be fewer restaurants, play centres, event spaces and festivals, which will be to the detriment of all of us.  I will conclude on that.</p></speech>

We wrote to the committee last February.  The media have done a good job highlighting cases that needed to be highlighted, but I must warn that I have a concern.  The vast majority of claims are legitimate, where people's lives have been impacted by the carelessness, recklessness or negligence of somebody else.</p><p>They are entitled to damages.  Not all cases are fraudulent or exaggerated.</p></speech>

The sooner we go down that road, the better.  Then we will get to a situation where we have fair insurance for our young people, for example, who are completely extorted, our taxi drivers will not be facing a situation where their livelihood will be lost if they have one claim against their insurance, and we will get past the situation where huge numbers of small businesses, festivals and so on in this country literally have their livelihoods and their ability to continue to function viably threatened because of insurance extortion by insurance companies.</p> <p>  I commend the work that has been done on a cross-party basis, including by the Government, the Minister of State and others, in dealing with legitimate issues.  There is no doubt they are legitimate issues.  Insurance fraud is wrong and it has to be dealt with and stamped out.  There should be no excessive awards.  There should be fair rewards for fair and legitimate claims.  We should not have a situation where legal costs are essentially driving up the cost of insurance for people and we should do everything we can to eliminate unnecessary legal costs and all the other matters we have talked about to have some sort of consistency in awards.</p> <p>  There is nothing in any of this update that will prevent the profiteering.  That is the problem.  The insurance companies will continue to profiteer for as long as they can.  Why would they not?  They always have and unless we do something to stop them profiteering, they always will.  I put it to the Minister of State that this is the problem with all of this and the evidence is now starting to come in, because whatever claims they could make that all these sorts of reforms were necessary in order for them to bring them into line, and they were not making money and so on are gone now because they are making money.  They are making a lot of money, they are not dropping the premiums, and I do not believe for one minute that they ever will.  That is why the Minister of State cannot get that assurance from them in writing because they will not ever give it in writing.</p> <p>  To be honest, there is nothing that we are proposing that will force them to reduce premiums to fair and reasonable levels because that is not the business they are in.  They are not in the business of ensuring that people get fair insurance premiums.  They are not even in the business of making sure that everybody who needs insurance gets it because, as we know, they will exit from areas where they cannot make a profit if they feel like it.  They just decide not to provide insurance in that area because they cannot make a profit.  They go where the profits are and they will use every compulsion and pressure on the Minister of State and on us to get us to take measures which will drive up their profits.  What compulsion is there on them to feed those increased profits back into fair premiums?  I put it to the Minister of State that there is none.</p></speech>

However, those companies would be obliged to adhere to the same Solvency II rules as a for-profit company.  They would have to adhere to the same EU directives on insurance and capitalisation as a for-profit company.  While the figures look very rosy, the issue is that they are only profitable for motor insurance.  The employer's liability, EL, and the public liability, PL, side are loss making and have been loss making for five or six years.  I will give the Deputy the figures on this.  The liability insurers made underwritings of loss outside of motor insurance in 2017 of &euro;46.9 million.  That is the liability and what they lost to underwrite the EL and PL side of insurance.  There is not much profit there.</p> <p>  The Deputy is asking to open the State up potentially to making losses in that sector.  It is something that is not the right direction.  We have the right pathway.  The Deputy has commended all of us on the work we are doing on this.  I try to be fair to all Members of both Houses and the help and support on this is total.  Nobody is trying to implement an ideology or to be political.  We are all trying to put in place a better sector so that businesses can get a fair premium, stay trading and employ people for the benefit to society that brings.  There is a profit on motor insurance but there is no profit on the liability side and we cannot just ignore that this is the case.  The &euro;227 million profit from 2017 is broken down into a &euro;126 million overall profit.  Motor profit might be more than that but the public liability is removed out of it because it is in a loss and there is a &euro;100 million profit from investments.  Those are the figures.</p> <p>  The Deputy's line to me is effectively to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies, and I will do that.  The figures we have to date are for almost &euro;200 million in profit from three companies in 2018.  The profits are up again from 2017.  I can only assume that for the other five major companies which have to report, the figures will also be increased.  I do not want profiteering in the insurance sector.  I want companies to be profitable, because if they are profitable, they stay, they underwrite accordingly, they underwrite well, and they treat their clients properly.</p> <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy has heard me make the point that on too many occasions I have had people with me who have been contracted with an insurance company for years or decades and then suddenly, because the risk appetite is not there or it just suits the insurance companies to exit, it leaves.  To me, that is an appalling treatment of somebody that a company has been contracted with for years or decades.  That is wrong, it does it because it suits it, and that is because the insurance company potentially is reducing its risk appetite because it is easier to do so than to stay in the sector.  I will keep the hard line to them, as I know the Deputy will when they come in here.</p></speech>

There is nothing we can do to compel them to give fair premiums and not to profiteer.  There is nothing we can do to stop them just exiting the market whenever it suits them for whatever reasons they decide.</p> <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that there is probably not a lot we can do either to stop them cooking the books for when they are making losses and when they are making profits, because we know they can carry out creative accountancy with their internal operations, their parent companies and their subsidiaries and they can move money around, just as the likes of Google and Facebook do.  I suspect that is what they have been doing to put pressure on us to do certain things which will increase their bottom lines.  That is my belief, but aside from that, my point is that there is nothing we are proposing here that will prevent them from doing that.</p></speech>

That is the logic of what he is saying.  Take taxi drivers as an example.  Society and public transport need taxi drivers.  However, problems with insurance coverage and premiums threaten the livelihoods of taxi drivers if they have one claim against their insurance.  If the insurance companies decide not to cover taxi drivers because they cannot make a profit, does that mean the taxi industry would shut down?  Would we be precluded from stepping in where the market fails and ensuring there is insurance coverage of that sector?</p></speech>

Since the cost of insurance working group was established, we have tried to put in a better sector.  The levels of awards are the most significant issue.  The committee recently met representatives from the child care sector on this issue.  The State does not fix the prices for the kids&rsquo; zones.  We do not tell them what they charge their clients.  We do not fix the price for the taxi driver.  Equally, we do not fix the prices the insurance companies charge their clients.</p></speech>

The State does not do it but a regulator may.  What I meant is that the Government does not do so.  We are trying to ensure we have a proper market which is sustainable like it is in other jurisdictions.  The UK and continental markets are much more stable than ours.  The levels of compensation awards for minor injuries in England and Wales are a fraction of ours.</p> <p>  For example, I received a phone call recently from a young man in his late 20s who plays football.  He was injured playing football and out for six weeks with a bit of damage done to his ankle.  He was back playing sport after this and within two months he was in a car crash.  Again, he was injured and could not play sport again for four weeks.  After listening to discussions about exaggerated and fraudulent claims, he rang me.  He was feeling guilty.  When I asked him if his case was fraudulent, he said it was not.  When I asked him if he exaggerated his injuries, again he said he did not.  When I asked if his award was within the guidelines, he stated it was.  He got &euro;14,500 which was the correct amount of money for an award in the book of quantum.  If we have to pay out every time somebody gets an injury on a football field, the damage is being done with the levels of awards, the period in which they are being settled, the issue being dragged out over years, and inconsistencies.</p></speech>

My point is that there is no mechanism to prevent insurance companies taking advantage of the well-intentioned work of the committee and all parties or of the measures taken by the Minister of State.

They are just taking us for a ride.  There is nothing to stop them doing it.</p></speech>

That is a bigger job, which I have highlighted, and a much more varied sector compared with the motor sector.  That is why we want to see how profitable they are and the extent to which they are profiteering or not.  It may be the case that they are not.</p></speech>

If they had even the slightest prang, it could push their premiums to a point where it was not viable to operate as a taxi driver.  That is still a particular problem and we need taxis.

That is the Minister of State's opinion.  We will differ on that.  The Judicial Council Bill 2017 will come before the Seanad next Wednesday.  We still have not seen the additional amendments that the Minister for Justice and Equality proposes to bring forward.  Will the Minister of State give us a timeframe for when Senators will see these amendments?</p></speech>

They do not have to be adhered to by the Judiciary.  The judicial council may prescribe awards.  The Minister of State indicated that if pathway A for the Judicial Council Bill 2017 does not work, there is pathway B, which the LRC is considering at the moment and which coincides with my Bill on the capping of awards.  The Minister of State has indicated pathway C would be a referendum.  Judges do not have to adhere to guidelines.  There will always be an instance where the legal profession will refer to previous cases and where the awards proposed by the judicial council could be challenged.  I am nervous that the Judiciary will not adhere to the guidelines.</p></speech>

It is a pretty radical reformation of the way the Judiciary operates.  Part of that will be a question of how to upskill members of the Judiciary and how to question a member of the Judiciary who steps outside the guidelines.  There will be peer review of sentencing.  That is a matter for the Judiciary to resolve.</p></speech>

We do not know the figures.</p><p>The implementation of the recommendation is contingent on the establishment of the office of legal cost adjudicators, OLCA, as provided for under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The establishment of the OLCA is on target to take place at the end of the second quarter of 2019, that is, at the end of this quarter.  This requires the passage of several supporting legislative amendments that are of course subject to the Oireachtas.

The Courts Service has indicated to the Department of Justice and Equality that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in injury cases in its 2018 annual report.  The details of awards on medical negligence will be published separately.  We have stripped those out to try to provide a better insight into personal injuries awards.  The publication of more granular information with regard to personal injury awards will provide more clarity around the average amount awarded and any particular trends.  The Courts Service has not published its 2018 report yet, but this information is in line to be published in that report.</p></speech>

I am not sure how much of a positive impact this will have on the cost of insurance for ordinary citizens and businesses.  It will take time, because it will have to go through the Oireachtas.  Then a committee will have to be set up in the Judiciary, which will have a review and will then decide.  We could still be discussing this in two years, with no change having been made to awards.  As far as I am concerned this is one leg of a stool.  The Minister of State indicated in his initial comments that there is no single silver bullet.  As far as I am concerned one of the legs of this stool is the awards being paid out by the Judiciary.  This problem has been caused by the Judiciary because it has increased the awards on an annual basis.  It has been shown that on average, there has been an increase of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per annum in a variety of awards, without any justification.  I hope that we get the Judicial Council Bill 2017 through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il as quickly as possible.  I hope that the Government initiates the necessary legislation as quickly as possible in order that this proposed committee, which I have not yet seen, can be established as quickly as possible.  I hope that we do not need to bring legislation forward to provide for a cap on damages.  The perception is that the Government is dragging its heels on this issue.  I do not believe it is.  This is a complex matter but we need to deal with it quickly because as people have indicated, businesses, farmers, communities, festivals, shows and ordinary citizens driving their motor vehicles are suffering as a result of this.</p></speech>

The Government is absolutely not dragging its heels on this.  The PIC report was published last September.  We anticipated that this would be done by the end of 2018.  That did not happen.  Deputy Pearse Doherty highlighted the filibuster that has taken place.  The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 was originally ahead of the Judicial Council Bill 2017.  It was not unreasonable for the Minister for Justice and Equality to proceed in line with how that legislation had progressed in the Seanad.  However there has been very little comment on the filibuster behind which this legislation got stuck.  Were it not for that filibuster, this would already be completed and the Judiciary would be doing its work right now.</p></speech>

I have listened carefully to what the Minister of State has had to say and I do not question his dedication to the task of fighting to lower insurance costs.  Businesses that have come before this committee and individual voters that have complained to us have not had any satisfaction whatsoever.  I know that employer's liability and public liability are different things, as the Minister of State said.  However a business is a business.  It runs on employer's liability, public liability and motor insurance.  I have yet to meet a business that will openly say that its insurance costs have been cut by 25%.

I ask the Minister of State to bear with me.</p><p>One cannot simply single out motor insurance and state one will deal with public liability insurance later on.  That does not work for business owners dealing in the current marketplace and who are giving employment.  Nothing has happened and there has been no change, in spite of what I read in various media outlets.  There is the odd press release claiming that the cost of insurance has come down but it has not.  It has not come down in the transport business; it has actually significantly increased.  A man sent me a text message this morning because he knew this meeting was coming up.  He told me that in his business, insurance costs have increased during the past three years by 200%.  The mart operators appeared before us.  They simply cannot get insurance.  People outside the Oireachtas who are watching and listening to what we are doing are not interested in the different avenues one must travel to deal with the different headings of insurance.  They are interested in one thing, namely, whether their house insurance, motor insurance and public liability and employer's liability insurance have gone up.  The answer to the question is that they have.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned taxi drivers earlier.  We could take transport companies, farmers or marts.  They are all telling us the same thing: their insurance costs have gone sky-high.</p> <p>  Now, presumably the report Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced is about insurance.  The Minister of State mentioned that it went to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Is that not really the problem?  So many within Government have a finger in the pie of insurance, in terms of legislation or regulation, that this will get dragged on forever.  The insurance companies love it because once they see the Government struggling to get to grips with it, then they are getting away with it.  They are making vast profits.  They are not charities.  They would not be in the business for the sake of charity or without profit.  They are making profits.  They have concealed or kept information from us.  They have been reluctant to deal with the Minister of State and with the working group.  They have had to be dragged to that table.  Business people and individual motorists want to know when their premiums will be reduced.</p></speech>

I am talking about the pathway to how we get the reform done.  I am obliged to be interested.  I am obliged to adhere to the principle of separation of powers.  I am obliged to highlight that the State does not have any role in the pricing of insurance products.  I cannot ignore these points.  I am determined to do the work that I am doing, rather than ending up wrapped up in court for years.  However, if I do not take the correct pathway, that is what will happen and that serves no one.</p><p>The Chairman said marts cannot get insurance.  I was in a mart three weeks ago and that mart has insurance.  On the Chairman's point on whether the cost of insurance is going up, yes the insurance for marts is expensive because the successful marts are putting between 600 and 1,000 large animals into a venue with people.  Some of the work practices in some of the marts are not good.  I have raised this with the main insurer of the marts in the country, which is one particular insurance company.  Many of the health and safety reports done have concluded with the works being carried out, and this has ensured that those marts are insured.  Some of the smaller marts potentially do not have enough business to cover the extra work that must be done to bring up the health and safety standards.</p><p>I have seen the film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; with the Bill Murray character.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray but there is a character in the film call Phil and Bill Murray comes along every day and greets Phil.  I have been here before and I keep pushing our proposals and the work that we are doing.  The cost of insurance working group has been on the go for 30 months.  We have highlighted how all these proposals would take time.  I am unsure whether the Chairman is Bill Murray and I am Phil or <i>vice versa</i>, but we are nearing the end of it.  In particular, we are nearing the end of it for what I consider to be the biggest issue, which is the level of awards.  When we are done and we get the level of awards down or reduce them, my role and that of the Chairman and the committee will be to keep the spotlight on the insurance companies to ensure they do not try to pocket potential windfall amounts because we will have reduced the awards to the point where people who are damaged from a moderate injury receive a moderate payment.  That is what we must do.  We cannot allow the insurance companies to do that.  I am absolutely determined in this regard, as I know is the Chairman.  The Chairman has as great a role as do I because he has a public forum to which he can bring in the insurance companies, one by one, and keep the hard line on them, as I do in private.</p></speech>

That is the point I am making.  You and I are talking about this, and the committee is dealing with it.  Yet, as the working group deals with it, there are businesses operating throughout the economy that are being forced to close or curtail their activities because of the various types of insurance.  That cannot be endured.  One sector cannot hold all of the other sectors to ransom.  One insurance company insures most of the marts.  Most of the marts have experienced significant increases.  I met representatives of the taxi industry some weeks ago.  There is no justification for the increases they have experienced.  I will turn to the report.</p></speech>

Wherever a report, protocol or legislation is mentioned, the action gets done but the hard part is giving information to the consumer.  That does not get done.  It is too intricate according to these recommendations.  Let us consider the first recommendation.  I will bring us through them.  The first states that insurers should set out reasons for large increases in premiums to consumers.  That is ongoing.</p></speech>

It is ongoing.  What is to stop insurance companies from simply giving the information?  If my insurance premium goes up by &euro;1,000 or if it doubles, then surely I am entitled to sit down with my broker or insurance company and ask why the premium has gone up although I have made no claims.  The companies will not even answer people who ask that question.</p></speech>

The report was sent from the working group to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Whatever is required to be done should be done immediately.  That simple example involving information being asked from the service providers does not apply in any other sector.  The question for many is why they are charging so much for a piece of meat or a service and the service providers cannot answer.  As a result people will not pay them, nor should they.</p></speech>

If somebody is injured in a mart and ends up in court, the level of the award causes the damage.  If it is an accident involving a taxi, it could be the same injury, such as a broken arm or leg or whatever the case may be, but the high level of awards is the greatest issue we are addressing.  The Judicial Council Bill will be debated by the Seanad next Thursday.  I hope we can progress it to the D&aacute;il the following week in order that we can move onto Second Stage and conclude Committee and Report Stages by the end of the session.</p> <p>  When all is said and done, if it was as profitable for insurance companies as has been presented, they would not exit the market to the extent they are.  Eight insurance companies in our small jurisdiction control between 89% and 92% of the entire market.</p></speech>

When a claim is being settled, as happens regularly in the case of transport, taxis and wherever a large number of vehicles are involved in the business, all we are asking is that the settlement be disclosed, but that recommendation has been delayed.  The Minister of State stated the Department of Finance failed to reach an agreement with Insurance Ireland.</p></speech>
