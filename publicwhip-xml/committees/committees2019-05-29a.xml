On behalf of the committee I welcome the representatives of the Mental Health Commission: Ms Kate Frowein, senior regulatory manager; Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services; and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality.  I also welcome, from Mental Health Reform, Dr. Shari McDaid, director; and Ms Kate Mitchell, senior policy and research officer.  I thank them all very much for attending.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Finnerty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#F00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to make this submission.  The Mental Health Commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  We are an independent statutory body that was established in April 2001 under the Mental Health Act 2001, under which the role of the inspector is set out.</p> <p>  Some 90% of mental health services are delivered in primary care settings.  A further 10% are delivered within specialist mental health services, including community residences.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services only, which are estimated to make up less than 1% of mental health services in Ireland.</p> <p>  The joint committee has sought information on developments in mental health services in the State.  The basis of this report is taken from recent inspection findings as well as information compiled by the commission as part of our ongoing monitoring of compliance and receipt of quality and safety notifications from services.  While the scope of the commission&rsquo;s regulation is limited, we nevertheless closely monitor developments across the broad range of mental health services in Ireland, including acute adult mental health services, rehabilitation, continuing care, child and adolescent mental health services, forensic mental health services, and community mental health services.  As a general comment, it is evident that the provision of mental health services is inconsistent across the country and lacks proper integration.  For example, a young person in need of mental health services in Galway will be able to access a vastly different range and level of services than a young person in Waterford.  Similarly, a person in Cavan-Monaghan or Sligo-Leitrim will have access to mental health rehabilitation services, while a person in Donegal will not, even though they are in the same community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.</p> <p>  The commission therefore welcomes the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which envisages a system of integrated care provision based on need rather than on location, age, or diagnosis.  We hope that this will finally realise the goals included in A Vision for Change, which set out Government policy 13 years ago in 2006.  We understand A Vision for Change is undergoing a review and refresh, and we look forward to seeing the revised policy.</p> <p>  In regulated services, we have seen a number of positive developments.  We have seen an overall increase in the national average compliance with regulatory requirements, from 74% in 2016, to 76% in 2017, to 79% in 2018.  Progress is slow but is consistently trending in the right direction.  For the most part we have seen good engagement from services in working towards compliance and implementing the judgment support framework, the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s quality framework.  There have been some notable improvements.  For example, the department of psychiatry in Roscommon University Hospital has gone from being 52% compliant with regulatory requirements in 2017 to being 83% compliant in 2018.  Another marked improvement was seen in St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Ardee, which went from 64% in 2017 to 93% in 2018.</p> <p>  We have also seen some improvement in fundamental aspects of care provision such as medication management, individual care planning, and consent procedures for involuntary patients.  These are positive developments but are not consistent throughout the country.  There is work yet to be done to ensure people receive the same consistent high-quality care and treatment no matter where they are located.  There has been ongoing progress towards decommissioning outdated and unsuitable buildings for the provision of inpatient services.  In 2006, 17 approved centres were operating in inappropriate institutional settings.  By 2019, only three remained, with two due to close by 2020.</p> <p>  We do, however, have ongoing concerns.  The commission continues to highlight concerns relating to the physical infrastructure of mental health facilities and premises.  Inspection reports have consistently identified concerns relating to the overall suitability of premises to meet patient needs, concerns relating to the physical safety of premises, and concerns relating to the maintenance of the premises, including basic repair works and cleanliness.  In 2018, 70% of regulated services were found to be non-compliant with the regulatory requirements relating to their premises.  It is unacceptable that in 2019 we still find service users in long-stay units living in dormitory-style accommodation and in units where one shower is shared between 20 people, and to find units which are dirty and in disrepair.  This does not respect the basic privacy and dignity of service users.</p> <p>  It is the position of the commission that there is no therapeutic benefit to the use of restrictive practices such as seclusion or physical restraint.  These practices should only ever be used as a last resort where there is a serious and urgent safety concern.  Despite this, physical restraint was used in 81% of all approved centres in 2018 and 97% of acute adult services.  Seclusion was used in 42% of all approved centres in 2018 and 65% of acute adult services.  We are concerned that there is a lingering complacency in the use of these practices.  In many services, these practices are accepted and commonplace.  Such practices directly affect a person&rsquo;s human rights to liberty, autonomy and bodily integrity.  We have seen little real engagement in the proper scrutiny and reduction of these practices by the mental health services</p> <p>  In a recent report, I highlighted serious concerns regarding the provision of general health services to persons with severe mental illness in continuing care approved centres.  People with a severe mental illness will die, on average, 20 years earlier than the general population for largely preventable reasons unrelated to their mental illness.  Following a review of ten services across the country, I highlighted inadequate and inconsistent monitoring of patients&rsquo; physical health needs and inadequate and inequitable access to essential healthcare services.  The commission has sought a national response from the HSE to address these serious concerns.</p> <p>  I also have concerns about the provision of specialist rehabilitation and recovery services for people with enduring mental illness.  This can be summarised as a lack of appropriate housing for people to move to more independent living; too few rehabilitation teams - we only have 48% of the number recommended by A Vision for Change; existing teams which are poorly staffed; and a lack of localised community and inpatient specialist rehabilitation units.  We have a large number of people who are still residing in institutional care who, with rehabilitation and recovery services, could live more autonomous, satisfying lives as part of their own communities.</p> <p>  While the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services, as inspector I have the statutory power to visit and inspect any premises where a mental health service may be provided.  Over the past three years I have been undertaking a systematic review of all 24-hour nurse-staffed community residences in the State.  There are 118 such community residences across the nine HSE community healthcare organisation areas, accommodating more than 1,200 service users.  The residents of these services are often in long-term accommodation and the community residence is their only home.  They represent a large number of potentially vulnerable adults with enduring mental illness whose voice is rarely heard.</p><p>The community residences are often poorly maintained, too big, institutionalised, restrictive and at times not respectful of service users&rsquo; privacy, dignity and autonomy.  Many residences were in poor physical condition, with 19% of those inspected in 2018 requiring urgent maintenance and refurbishment.  A significant number of people living in these residences should, with appropriate support, move to smaller, less institutionalised accommodation.  These units remain without regulatory oversight or safeguards, despite the number of units and vulnerability of service-users accommodated in such units.  Over a number of years, the Mental Health Commission has called for these residences to be regulated.  Regulation would allow the commission to enforce changes where deficits and risks are found, protect the human rights of people living in these residences and help mental health services to provide care and treatment in accordance with best practice standards. <br/><br/>At the end of 2017, I reviewed the provision of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This review highlighted a number of concerns about the provision of the services nationally.  These include: poorly staffed community teams - overall the staffing in 2017 was 60% of that recommended in A Vision for Change<i>; </i>the number of young people admitted to adult units, which the commission had continued to raise as a concern across a number of years; the variation in funding for CAMHS across the CHOs, which varies from &euro;40 <i>per capita</i>in CHO 5 to &euro;92 <i>per capita</i>in CHO 2; the lack of out of hours emergency CAMHS both for assessment and for inpatient beds; and waiting times of up to 15 months for non-urgent outpatient appointments with CAMHS teams.<br/><br/>The commission recommends national oversight and governance to address the ongoing concerns within regulated mental health services, noting that the ongoing and widespread nature of the concerns points to systemic issues that will not be addressed with a solely local or regional focus.  The commission recommends that the revised national mental health policy, A Vision for Change,<i></i>should reflect the aims set out in Sl&aacute;intecare, in particular a focus on the provision of integrated care based on need, not on location, age or diagnosis.  The commission recommends putting proper regulatory safeguards in place to uphold the human rights and ensure the safety and well-being of persons in specialist community-based residential mental health services, that is, 24-hour nurse supervised community residences.The commission recommends the establishment of an out-of-hours mental health service for young people in crisis, including a clear pathway for their families and loved ones.  The commission recommends the proper provision of funding ensure there are adequate services for persons with severe and enduring mental illness, including appropriate accommodation, general health and rehabilitation services.The commission recommendations the prioritisation of funding to ensure all accommodation in residential mental health services - approved centres and community residences - are safe and fit for purpose.</p></speech>

We welcome the attention that is being given by the committee to the area of mental health.  By way of background, the prevalence and impact of mental health difficulties is significant and growing.  At any time, one in ten adults in this country has a mental health difficulty, while almost 20% of young people aged 19 to 24 and 15% of children aged 11 to 13 have experienced a diagnosable mental health disorder at some point in their young lives.  The number of people disabled by a mental health difficulty is also growing at an alarming rate, with a jump of almost 30% in the numbers reporting a level of mental health difficulty that was disabling between the censuses of 2011 and 2016.  Importantly, such difficulties can be more debilitating than most chronic physical health conditions.  For example, people with mental health disabilities are nine times more likely to be outside the labour force than the general population.  This is the highest proportion for any group of individuals with disabilities.</p> <p>  The cost of mental health difficulties is enormous, with figures suggesting it may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries.  This would equate to approximately &euro;12.4 billion based on Irish figures.  To put this in context, a research study on the cost of childhood overweight and obesity estimated the total lifetime cost in the Republic of Ireland to be &euro;4.6 billion per annum.  Untreated mental health difficulties contribute significantly in terms of cost.  It is imperative that mental health is recognised and afforded appropriate priority within the wider health agenda to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease in Ireland.  This will require a substantial increase in mental health funding, including in budget 2020, both to sustain existing levels of service and to develop new mental health services and supports.</p> <p>  I would like to draw the committee's attention three major issues of concern this morning, namely, governance and accountability in mental health services, protracted delays in reform of Ireland&rsquo;s Mental Health Act 2001 and the implementation of national mental health policy.  It is very important to acknowledge the positive developments that have been achieved across the mental health system at local, regional and national levels.  Mental Health Reform recognises the dedicated work of Government, its agencies, public representatives, direct service providers, and the community and voluntary sector.  These achievements include the development of clinical care programmes in areas such as self-harm, eating disorders and early intervention in psychosis; the introduction of a national framework for recovery in mental health; and the pilot of advocacy services in child and adolescent mental health services.  Some positive developments that have been initiated at the primary care level include the introduction of assistant psychologists, the expansion of Jigsaw services and the piloting of e-mental health supports.  Mental health has also received significant attention in the Oireachtas through Seanad and D&aacute;il debates and, most significantly, the establishment of the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.</p> <p>  While all of this progress is welcome, it has taken place in the context of new challenges.  The mental health system suffers from a severe lack of capacity in the face of increased demand, which has pushed the mental health services to breaking point.  While efforts have been made in recent years to make up for some of the losses, the old adage of mental health as the Cinderella of the health services is clearly evident in the continued under-resourcing of mental health services and supports.  The shortfalls in mental health service delivery are further reflected in the lack of out of hours crisis services for both adults and children.  We are disappointed that despite the recruitment of new staff as part of a planned roll out of seven day services across adult community mental health teams, only four additional areas are reporting a seven day service.  In April, HSE mental health confirmed that there is no planned date for completion of the cost and implementation plan for providing seven day child and adolescent mental health services.  Not only are the child and adolescent mental health services not able to provide 24-7 support around the country; there is not even a date for producing a plan to see how that can happen.  A participant of Mental Health Reform&rsquo;s national My Voice Matters consultation noted that &ldquo;outside of office hours [there is] no professional to turn to when in crisis- at the weekend for example.  [It] makes no sense that people in this day and age still have to go to A&amp;E as [a] first resort. [It] doesn&rsquo;t help the patients&rsquo;&rsquo;  The inspector for mental health services has recently reported &ldquo;appalling standards&rdquo; in certain mental health inpatient units and the Mental Health Commission has recently published a report on the lack of physical health care monitoring of individuals in a number of inpatient services across the country.  There are myriad other gaps in mental health service provision, including a lack of resources in CAMHS, which has a fundamental impact on access and quality of care.  As of September 2018, in the most recent figures we were able to identify, almost 2,500 children were on the waiting list for CAMHS, of whom over 12% were waiting more than 12 months.  Lengthy waiting lists also exist in primary care psychology and there are significant challenges for particular client groups to getting access to mental health services, including those experiencing homelessness and those from ethnic minority communities.</p> <p>  We are also deeply concerned with reports from service users of poor quality in mental health services.</p><p>Our national My Voice Matters surveys found that over 40% of service users indicated that they had a poor experience of HSE mental health services.  Almost 40% indicated that they were not involved as much as they would like in decisions about the medication they take.  Two thirds reported that they did not have a written recovery or care plan developed with their community mental health team.  Among family, friends, carers and supporters, over 70% were dissatisfied with the extent to which HSE mental health services had considered their support needs.  We draw a direct link between the resource issues and the experience of the quality of the services capable of being provided.</p><p> In terms of governance and accountability, we acknowledge that between 2013 and 2018, there was an increase of approximately 20% in the mental health budget and of 28% in mental health spend.  Despite such progress it is important to acknowledge that it still has not brought us to the same level of funding that was being provided in 2008 before any implementation of A Vision for Change had taken place.  Investment in mental health services continues to fall well below international standards.  In 2019, just 6% of the total health budget was allocated to mental health, representing an ongoing trend in recent years of significant underinvestment.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that mental health spending increase to 10% of the overall health spend.</p><p> A report prepared for the Department of Health by the Work Research Centre identified that a comparative positioning of Ireland internationally suggests that the percentage resource allocation to date is lower than in some of the countries with better developed and better performing mental healthcare systems.  The data available indicate levels of allocation of between 10% and 30% in countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK.  Recent developments to invest in Ireland's forensic mental health services and the introduction of the service reform fund in the HSE, including the national roll-out of an evidence-based approach to supported employment for people with severe and enduring mental health difficulties, are welcome.  However, investment in mental health services and supports must continue and must be increased on a much greater scale to effectively improve the mental health outcomes of Ireland's population.  We recommend that public expenditure be increased to 10% of the health budget within ten years to be in line with international standards on mental health funding as a proportion of the overall health budget.</p><p> In addition, there continues to be no national mental health information system to report on the full extent of resources, provision, quality and outcomes for community based mental health service delivery.  For example, there are no data on the number of people in community mental health services who have an individual care plan, the number of individuals offered a talking therapy, the wait times for such therapies within mental health services and the employment and housing outcomes for people using the mental health services.  Mental Health Reform has been calling for such a system in budget submissions since 2013.  It is unacceptable that more than 13 years after publication of A Vision for Change there is no information system to account for the almost &euro;1 billion in public expenditure on mental healthcare each year.  We recommend that an interim system for gathering key performance information on the mental health services be put in place as a matter of urgency.</p><p> We note that the restructuring of HSE governance and accountability structures in 2018 led to the dissolution of the HSE's mental health division and the abolition of the post of national director of mental health.  Despite the appointment of senior management officials responsible for leading on mental health operations and mental health service planning and strategy, it must be considered that the dissolution of these structures within the HSE on mental health may have an adverse effect on driving the reforms necessary to ensure the delivery of a modern, recovery-focused mental health system that adequately protects the human rights of adults and children.  We recommend that the post of national director for mental health and the mental health division be restored to ensure coherent leadership in mental health at national level and clear authority and accountability for a distinct, national mental health budget each year.</p><p> With regard to mental health legislation, we have consistently advocated for reform of the Mental Health Act 2001 in line with the expert group recommendations on review of the 2001 Act, to ensure that people have their rights adequately protected when they go into hospital for mental healthcare.  The Minister has recently announced that the general scheme of the Bill on reform of the 2001 Act will be complete in June 2019 and ready for the Mental Health Commission's consideration.  Given the lengthy delay so far and noting that the expert group's report was published in March 2015, we are asking for a date for publication of the full reforming legislation before the end of 2019.  It is also of fundamental importance that the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, signed into law by the President in May 2018, is commenced as a matter of priority to ensure that those small but significant changes can be made immediately to the 2001 Act.  This includes that people are encouraged and supported to make their own decisions about their mental healthcare.</p><p> Implementation of the national mental health policy is a concern.  Significantly, the oversight group tasked with reviewing Ireland's current national mental health policy is due to complete its work and the publication of its report is imminent.  In accordance with the terms of reference of the group it can be expected that there will be a much greater focus on early intervention and prevention, mental health in primary care, improved access to mental health services, the development of services to appropriately meet the needs of particular groups of people, such as individuals experiencing homelessness, people from ethnic minority groups and those engaged with the criminal justice system, and the social inclusion of people with mental health difficulties.  It is an understatement to say that many stakeholders were disappointed with the pace of implementation of A Vision for Change.  It is imperative that the revised mental health policy is supported by a costed and timelined implementation plan and the establishment of robust monitoring and review mechanisms.</p><p> I will conclude this statement with the comment of one of the participants in the My Voice Matters survey: "It has been seven years since my first contact [with the mental health services] before I have gotten the help I need which I do feel the course of time waiting made a lot of things worse in my life".  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to members' questions and comments.</p></speech>

It is great to see, yet again, a full panel of female witnesses, which is extra welcome.</p> <p>  The Darkness Into Light walk, which was held recently, brought the issue of mental health to the fore.  As a result of that walk, people were sharing their stories more frequently than they normally would have.  I acknowledge everybody who took part in the walk and those who organised it.  What do the witnesses think can be done to decrease the stigma of mental health issues?  Have they any ideas on how something could be included in the education system, particularly in national school, whereby a child growing up to become an adult realises it is okay not to be okay and would never think otherwise?  Obviously, the wheel turns and those young children will become adults, so it is a win-win situation in that people will feel better and it is cost effective because it will not cost the health system as much for treatment and so forth.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  There were many questions in both submissions.  Do the witnesses often meet the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly?  What are his answers to those questions?</p></speech>

My concern is about stigma surrounding serious mental illness.  That has not been tackled as enthusiastically as it might be.</p><p>People who have a serious mental illness and may need inpatient care from time to time, or who need help with vocation and accommodation, experience stigma.  It is to do with a lack of education about mental illness, especially serious mental illness.  People do not realise that those who suffer from a serious mental illness recover and can, and do, live lives in the community the same as any other citizen.  The way to tackle that is through more education and publicity around the fact that it is okay to have a mental illness, they are like other illnesses in that they can be treated and people can live lives the same as the rest of us.  That is my feeling on it.</p></speech>

We do meet him and we have requested to meet him soon particularly about the findings of the My Voice Matters surveys, which give a national picture of people's experiences of mental health services.  We are awaiting a date from the Minister of State in that regard.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Mitchell, to answer the questions about stigmas and schools.</p></speech>

In terms of the broader question around stigma, some fantastic initiatives are happening at national and local levels.  This month sees the green ribbon See Change campaign which has done fantastic work in raising awareness around, and promoting positive attitudes towards, mental health.</p> <p>  Research shows that attitudes towards severe mental health difficulties are still very much lagging behind.  We can see that through research carried out quite recently by the National Disability Authority.  Members of the public are not as comfortable working with, or living beside, people with mental health difficulties in comparison with individuals in other disability groups.  We still have a way to go in challenging attitudes towards more severe mental health difficulties.  Measures need to be taken to better support employers in recruiting and retaining people with mental health difficulties and local authorities in placing individuals in secure housing and so on.</p> <p>  Some wonderful work has been carried out by schools, teachers and principals in promoting the mental health of students and ensuring their mental health needs are addressed.  We need to see that happening at a national level through national protocols and processes.  National guidelines were produced for both primary and post-primary schools in 2013 and 2015, which promoted mental health and well-being.  There have been concerns about the lack of implementation of those and lack of resourcing and training for teachers and so on.  The key point is that schools really need to be adequately resourced and their staff trained and supported to push that forward.</p></speech>

The board and chief executive officer of the commission meet the Minister on at least an annual basis and meet the officials from the mental health division in the Department on a quarterly basis.  We addressed all of the matters we have raised today at our last meeting with the Minister.  He advised of commitments in relation to staffing including putting assistant psychology posts into primary care and looking for consultant psychiatrists because we are finding those posts difficult to fill at the moment.  Those were the Minister's priorities.</p> <p>  We also raised the governance issue with him prior to the appointment of the new director general.  We spoke about the structures and, as Dr. McDaid said, we advocated for a national director for mental health and the national offices to be put back in position.  We found that unit and the national director very helpful from a governance and accountability perspective and it is not as effective in the absence of that office.  We addressed that with the Minister at our most recent meeting and he advised that he will allow the new director general to find his feet before discussions take place about that.</p> <p>  As Dr. McDaid said, we are expecting the legislation in June and very much welcome it.  We have had two welcome legislative changes in recent times.  One removed the unwilling treatment of people who are detained.  People are no longer forced treatment against their will and we welcome that from the perspective of safeguarding and human rights.  The most recent legislative change removed 12-month orders, so people can no longer be detained for that duration.</p> <p>  We table Vision for Change at all our meetings with the Minister.  We have asked to be consulted about the refreshing of the policy and look forward to receiving a draft of that.</p></speech>

Monitoring is really important because somebody can be prevented from developing cardiac problems.  By monitoring things such as waist circumference, body mass index, BMI, or bloods and so on, one can stop the development of cardiac problems if one gets in early enough.  That is the difference between treating somebody proactively and someone ending up in an intensive care unit.</p></speech>

I join with my colleague in saying it is a refreshing and welcome change to have an all-female panel.  People will be jumping onto Twitter now to give out about me saying that.  They had better preface that by showing examples of them giving out on occasions there has been an all-male panel.  People do not give out about that.  I welcome the all-female panel and the witnesses are all very welcome.</p><p> Reference is made in the Mental Health Reform submission to the piloting of e-mental health supports.  Britain is using a crisis text line, Shout, which comes from an American-based model.  I have concerns about e-health in general.  I am not convinced of its merits but I have very particular concerns regarding e-mental health and e-mental health supports.  I would be interested in our guests' views on e-mental health as a back-up when there are other services on offer and, in particular, on abandoning traditional services in favour of online supports.  If we give someone an app, that is not the same as offering him or her real support.  It is not going to where the person is at; it is simply fending off a problem and not actually dealing with it.  I would be interested to hear our guests' views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00200"><p>Mental Health Reform has been looking at e-mental health or digital mental health in recent years because we are the Irish partner for a cross-north-western Europe project to explore this.  Mental Health Reform wanted to be in that role because we are in a position to open up the discussion about digital mental health, to explore the pros and cons involved and to facilitate knowledge sharing so people, in the professions as well as service users and service providers, can be fully informed.  There is a basis for figuring out what that role should be.  What we are seeing in the evidence is that it is effective, particularly in a blended therapy approach.  What we mean by that is that digital mental health support is a complement to the support that is provided by a mental health professional.  Particularly in primary care, one could think of a digital mental health support as being book-ended by an initial consultation with a mental health professional and then follow-up with a mental health professional.  In between, however, we are getting pretty good evidence that the online programme, particularly online cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, is something people can do.  In addition, the mental health professional is always informed as to how he or she is getting on in the programme.  The information is available in order that the mental health professional can see the progress.</p> <p>  What does it do?  First, it makes the mental health support much more accessible to people wherever they are.  This is a significant issue.  For example, I have heard of situations where, for example, mothers with young children find it very helpful to be able to access a mental health professional online because it is very difficult for them to get organised and have the opportunity to go to an appointment on their own.  For people where stigma is an issue, digital mental health can help them to access support whereby they do not have to go onto the high street and into a clinic that says "mental health" on the storefront.  We think there is potential.  We are really interested in exploring that and discovering how to ensure that it is done in a safe way and on the basis of good practice.  We held a joint seminar with the Psychological Society of Ireland last year to make sure that we are all learning about the appropriate way to bring digital mental health into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00300"><p>The difficulty I have is not that there may not be a place for it in a functioning mental health system but that we have a dysfunctional mental health system and the supports do not exist at the moment.  This is something I have recently taken an interest in.  My worry is that this is a cheap way of offering support.  It is, obviously, always going to be less labour-intensive and all of that.  Dr. McDaid stated that a person may not want to walk down the high street and walk into a shop with a sign up advertising "mental health supports".  However, those supports are not there so that option is not there either.  It is not that people are saying that there is a range of supports available to them and that they wish to choose the one that is being offered online.  My concern is that people are saying there is literally nothing available.  They want to talk face to face with a person and to be the one who walks down the street and goes through that door.  They are actively seeking help but all they are getting is an app.</p> <p>  Dr. McDaid makes a very relevant point that this may be appropriate where it is book-ended by professionals, where they are available.  My fear, and my understanding, is that these crisis text lines do not necessarily deliver this type of support.  As the studies go on, there will be evidence that they operate as a complement to services, which is not necessarily a bad idea, but if they are the service itself, they will be wholly inadequate.  In a space where we have difficulty recruiting and retaining staff, this becomes nearly an outsourced way of doing it.  That is where my concerns would lie.</p></speech>

We have to look at what people who might need that help want, whether they are what we call mental health service users or people with low-level mental stress who are looking for early intervention.  We have to look at what they want and their preferred options.  Many people will still want to see someone face to face but some will feel more comfortable with a digital or online option.  It is about creating that choice for people.</p></speech>

It is not to fill a gap without having the full support structures in place.  Second, it is most important that those who are providing the service are regulated either by an oversight body like ourselves or a professional regulator, so there is governance and oversight of such a service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00600"><p>Would it make sense that these services should be put to one side for the moment in favour of developing the more traditional services?  Telemedicine is quite new.  I have to put my cards on the table and state that I do not like it, although that is my personal opinion.  I would prefer to see a doctor or mental health professional.  In the absence of services being developed, I would caution against going down the road of telemedicine.  Every person who has spoken has said it is okay and it might be positive as a complement to existing services.  The difficulty I have is that if we go down that road before we build up the other services, it will become increasingly less likely that we will develop the other services and we will simply have the idea that what was intended to be the complement to the services becomes the only service.  I caution against that.  I ask that we park that for the moment and focus solely on the development of the services that are so lacking.</p> <p>  I live in north County Dublin.  The waiting times there for children to access a person face to face are running up to 30 months.  I would be nervous that families who are in crisis, and getting further into crisis as the wait goes on, would simply be offered an app or some version of telemedicine without the additional support and then, because all the staff are under pressure, the box is ticked to indicate that the supports are in place.  There is a space for the telemedicine service or the e-mental health support to complement existing services but, in the absence of existing services, I do not believe the telemedicine model will work or be effective.  It is not intended to be the service; it is intended to be the complement to the service.</p> <p>  Dr. McDaid makes a very good point that mental health service users should be consulted and their opinions should be sought, and the service they want and need should be delivered for them.  However, my fear is that the service will be developed because it is cost-efficient and is much cheaper than another version of it.  That is where the focus will go and it will no longer be on making up the deficit.</p></speech>

I think we have an estimate that 300,000 adults in Ireland will have a mental health difficulty at some level over the course of a year.  Our counselling and primary care service has capacity to see 11,000, less than 10% so we need both and we need both urgently.  We need to build up the digital mental health supports and the options for using them throughout the mental health system but we need to do it safely and in a way that recognises the integral and vital role of mental health professionals in our mental health system.</p></speech>

I have one very brief question that relates to attendance at accident and emergency units.  I know because there are people in my constituency who have come to my office because they have had to bring a loved one to an accident and emergency department.  The person does not have a physical ailment but he or she literally has nowhere else to go so the only door that is open to him or her is the accident and emergency door.  It is the last place these people want to be.  Could the witnesses talk about the impact of this?  As a former trade union official, I represented nurses, many of whom were in accident and emergency departments, and I know the impact it has on staff.  These are people who want to do their best but might not have the training to cope with a person who is experiencing mental health distress and who finds himself or herself in an accident and emergency unit.  Could the witnesses describe the impact on the individual?  I know the impact on staff members is horrendous but the witnesses might be able to describe the impact on a person who has to go to an accident and emergency unit.  What happens to the person after he or she presents at an accident and emergency department, which we all agree is the last place the person wants to be and the last place he or she should be but in some instances, is the only place where he or she finds an open door?</p></speech>

Mental Health Reform has carried out consultations in different parts of the country for a number of years.  It is one issue where we heard consistently from people who use the services when they experience a mental health difficulty, family members and mental health professionals and what we have heard echoes what Deputy O'Reilly saying, which is that when somebody is in mental distress, he or she is in crisis and an accident and emergency department is the last place he or she wants to be.  It is not an appropriate environment.  It can be quite distressing.  It can be very noisy and chaotic and in many situations, the person is waiting for an extremely long period of time to be seen by a mental health professional.  In some cases, people will leave before they get the support they need, which can lead to tragic consequences.</p> <p>  Mental Health Reform has been advocating for out-of-hours mental health services.  We received a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to roll out seven-day-a-week services in all parts of the country for adult mental health services.  Recruitment has been completed for about 36 of the 48 posts required to deliver on that roll-out, with an additional eight posts accepted but the implementation of this 7-7 provision is slow, so it is important that we see the implementation of that as a matter of priority.  In many areas of the country, there are no 7-7 or 24-7 mental health services for children and young people, who must go to an accident and emergency unit when they are in mental distress and crisis.  Often when they go to an accident and emergency department, they do not get to see a child and adolescent mental health professional but are seen by an adult consultant psychiatrist.  Many families and children have to wait quite a considerable amount of time to get that crisis support.  We would say that there needs to be a roll-out of 24-7 services for children and young people.  It is really important that this is implemented as a matter of priority.  </p></speech>

With regard to after hours, in nearly all places, it is the accident and emergency department people arrive at.  There are some services that do provide an eight-to-eight or seven-to-seven service and there are few that provide a limited seven-day service but it is very limited.  The other difficulty in some places is that when people do come to accident and emergency departments and are seen by the psychiatrist, the units to which they would be admitted are full.  This leads to all kinds of difficulties such as people staying long periods of time in accident and emergency departments and people being discharged from accident and emergency units when it may not be the best thing for them.  During office hours, in most cases, there are day hospitals or areas where people can come and see somebody in an emergency so that they do not have to go to an accident and emergency unit.  In some places, there are home-based treatment teams that will go out and assess somebody in his or her home but it is very patchy and inconsistent across the country.</p></speech>

In a scenario where one can schedule appointments and only hit that crisis between 9 a.m and 5 p.m., even at that, someone is still not guaranteed that he or she will get the service he or she needs.  This is unscheduled care no matter which way one looks at it and having a nine-to-five service is no use to someone at midnight.  It is very regrettable not just for the patient but also for the staff, who can do nothing for the patient, and is something that must be worked on.</p></speech>

Regarding the variation in terms of spending across the CAMH service, particularly the &euro;40 to &euro;92 per capita variation, is that caused by a local need or investment in outdated services or structures?  What is the main cause of that?  There is a significant difference - more than double - that needs to be addressed because if that is a symptom of what is happening across the board, it is a serious problem.</p></speech>

The service in Galway is a particularly proactive service that has developed a number of good practice initiatives such as advocacy.  It has an emergency bed and other beds in that region and has developed the services very well.  That in itself attracts people to come and work in that service.  CHO 5 finds it particularly difficult because it cannot get staff to work in that area, which down the line decreases the chances of getting people - either allied health professionals or consultant psychiatrists - to come and work in the service.  The service in Galway is a very established one going back many years and has attracted funding in order to maintain that whereas the CHO 5 area would be a new service that does not have beds and finds it very difficult to get inpatient beds for CAMHS.  There are a number of factors.</p></speech>

For example, I have an idea as to why staff cannot be found to work in CHO 5 but I would like to hear it more graphically.  There should be no patchiness in the system.  It should be equal across the board.  We need to know what the cause or causes are and if there are particular causes, which I think we know, we must address them.  Can we do that?</p></speech>

The Mental Health Commission does not fund the services.  The decisions on how to fund and provide the services belong to the HSE.</p></speech>

I am not asking Dr. Finnerty to make a comment or criticise the HSE, far from it and I would be the last to do so as the Chairman well knows, but we need to know precisely, starkly and graphically what the issues are.</p></speech>

A considerable number of years ago, the commission conducted a review and the result indicated there were enough inpatient beds within our jurisdiction for CAMHS and that the problem lies in community services, whereby care and treatment that could prevent people warranting admission are not available.  We have spoken about waiting lists and waiting times.  It then comes to the point in time when people do need admission.</p> <p>  The commissioners made the decision on the structures and where to locate the CAMHS units.  They are located in Galway, Cork and Dublin, including in St. Vincent's Hospital in Fairview.  These were decided by the commissioners.  Only three of the units provided by the State take in those aged under 16 years of age.  Again, this is a reduction in the number and capacity.  The commissioners decided on the age groups that would be admitted to these units.  With regard to the lack of provision, the commission has repeatedly requested that the provision of 24-7 out-of-hours services and community services be developed.</p></speech>

Some of these children were admitted more than once and some had a tragic ending.  To what degree does the system as it is now interact with these children, identify them and try to protect them and provide the type of services that they require?  They may be in a difficult home situation.  There may be addiction involved and a variety of issues contributing detrimentally to their particular situations.  In these circumstances, what do the witnesses see as being the most immediate and urgent intervention to address the issues?</p></speech>

The figures on presentations of self-harm continue to be significantly high among our younger population.  A HSE national clinical care programme has been introduced on self-harm presentations to emergency departments.  This has been in operation since 2014.  I believe it has been expanding to each emergency department throughout the country.  My understanding is that 24 emergency departments now have a dedicated self-harm specialised clinical nurse in post, with the aim of expanding this to the three paediatric hospitals.  As far as I am aware, this issue is being addressed to some extent through the self-harm national clinical care programme.  It will be very important to continue to review the programme and monitor it to ensure it is being implemented effectively.</p></speech>

It will be important in the future that there is consistency and standardisation in how it is rolled out throughout the country and how it is implemented in various hospitals throughout the country.  There are certainly other measures that need to be put in place.  It is not the full solution.  For example, there is a requirement for more out-of-hours services and crisis services for children and young people to support that need.</p></speech>

The difficulty, as Ms Mitchell and I have said, is this it is not available in every area.  Obviously this is concerning and we recommend an out-of-hours CAMH service available for accident and emergency departments so children who present, particularly at that age, are picked up by the CAMH services.</p></speech>

To what extent do we have this in place?  From my dealings, and I am sure everybody here can point to similar dealings, I can point to cases where this did not take place, where there was a void and, as a result, there were tragic consequences.</p><p>To what extent do CAMHS identify children through the schools and offer them support, reassurance or whatever is required?  I will ask two further questions before finishing.</p></speech>

Clearly, CAMHS are very under-resourced.  They have approximately 56% of the recommended number of staff.  Inevitably, those services retrench.  They heighten the criteria for admission because they feel that they cannot cope.  There was also a major increase in demand - it is believed to have been 25% - for CAMHS.</p></speech>

In the face of that, staff will increase the threshold at which people can access mental health services.  Ironically, it may be more difficult now for CAMHS to do the kind of outreach and interaction in schools that they should be doing than might have been the case ten years ago.  The Deputy is correct to state that it should be happening.  If a school has a concern about a child, it should find it relatively easy to contact CAMHS and get advice, support and guidance on whether the child should be referred, but we do not get a sense that this is routinely available across the country.  I am just pointing out why that might be the case.  It is not enough simply to blame CAMHS and say that they should be more open.  There must also be adequate mental health support throughout the system - within the school, in primary care and in CAMHS.</p></speech>

Where one has double the funding of an area that is under pressure, there is a gap in the system.  Information exists, and I would like it to be made available to the committee.  Could we have a report on the extent to which CAMHS in areas that are underfunded are meeting, failing to meet or for whatever reason unable to meet targets compared with those areas with different funding chains?</p></speech>

The committee should bear in mind that the HSE used to publish an annual report on CAMHS but, as far as I am aware, it is no longer producing those reports annually.  We would welcome it if the committee requested that the HSE get back into the practice of publishing the annual report on CAMHS.</p></speech>

As a child grows older, a parent - especially a mother - can have a concern about restraints and the child not taking medication or being supervised in that regarding to the extent that he or she should be.  The progression of the child's condition may be a contributory factor.  How do we reassure the parent that the child is safe when seeking treatment or while in respite care?  We need to reassure parents so that the State is seen as a helping, supportive and fair instrument for dealing with their children's conditions.</p> <p>  My final question is on housing and a matter that we have all encountered.  Adults, including young adults, may have been sleeping rough before being referred to what used to be called sheltered housing, although it is no longer sheltered to the extent that it should be.  We must try to ensure that the person is in an environment that is supportive and does not undermine his or her self-confidence and self-esteem and where the person and his or her family can feel that they can rely on it for the best possible treatment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Finnerty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#N00800"><p>I will answer the second question first.  As I mentioned in my submission, we have concerns about the residences that are supervised over 24 hours.  We would like to see them respecting the autonomy and dignity of those residing there, both through how they treat the residents and through the environment in which they live.  In 19% of such residences, the environment is unsatisfactory.  Something needs to be done about that as a matter of urgency.  Since the residences are also large, there is a tendency for people to become institutionalised, lose their independence and stop being part of the community.  That is why the commission is anxious that these residences be regulated.  While I can inspect them, we cannot enforce action because the Mental Health Act does not allow us to do so.  We recommend that they be regulated, as that would help us to ensure that those residential places were suitable for people, be they young or elderly.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's first question, it is difficult to reassure people about medication, its effect on someone or how the illness will progress without knowing the circumstances of that particular person.  The clinical team is best placed to do that.  In such cases, every effort should be made for people to communicate with the treating team and for the family and young person to be involved in his or her treatment.</p></speech>

It is important that we acknowledge the work, dedication and commitment of everyone working in the mental health services, which is a very demanding area.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a few issues, some of which have already been touched on.  I will first address CAMHS and my experience from dealing with parents who have come to me about the issue of medical practitioners.  I know of a case where someone would have had access to a consultant within a short time if he had just lived a half mile up the road, but there was no medical consultant in his own area.  I do not understand the geographical boundaries that are being used to determine who a person sees.  If someone is in the wrong area at the wrong time and there is no consultant, that person might have to wait anything up to 18 months to see someone.  I have had to deal with such a situation.  The parents of a 16 year old had to monitor their son non-stop for those 18 months.  CAMHS would not get involved until he was assessed.  If there is not a consultant, I do not understand why some other process is not in place to ensure that a case is handled.  The parents ended up taking their son to an accident and emergency department, but he was sent back home without an additional care plan being put in place.  This issue needs to be addressed.  Why are there geographical boundaries?  We do not have that type of boundary in maternity services.</p><p>Why do we have it with adolescent mental health?</p><p> The second issue is the growing challenge that we will now have to deal with of people who are non-Irish and who have come to Ireland without the kind of traditional family support that one might see in Ireland.  I had a case recently, for example, where a non-Irish girl had been in Ireland for approximately 12 years and had no family in Ireland.  She was in rented accommodation and had serious mental difficulties.  The landlord got her GP to see the girl because she would not go to the GP herself.  The GP's response was to contact me as a public representative for the area but four weeks later she was still not getting help.  I got on to the public health nurse, who told me she could not attend the girl unless she is requested to do so by the GP or somebody else in the HSE.  There were four weeks during which there was no action but eventually the landlord took a recording of the person because she was going downhill very fast.  Only when played the recording did the GP go to see the person.  The person in question was admitted to psychiatric services for eight weeks but is now back in the community and in the same residential accommodation.  The landlord has told me the person must leave by 30 June but I cannot source a back-up service.  This is one of many problems where we have many non-Irish people who, unfortunately, will end up in a position without backup from a family.  We will end up with people like this on the street.  What do we need to bring about forward planning with this matter?</p><p> The third issue relates to balancing of cost.  I had a case of mid-30s person and, in fairness, the HSE was doing its best.  It had to apply two care assistants to the person in question because assistants working on their own had been assaulted.  A package was done to provide care for the person in the community and the cost was &euro;130,000 per annum.  There must be a way of dealing with a case like that, where a person has good and bad days but the assessment is the person should be out in the community as opposed to being in a more definitive care position.</p><p> The fourth issue concerns the lack of information.  I know a guy for a long number of years and I spoke to his family recently as I received ten or 20 emails per day from the person.  The person is now under the care of mental health services.  The family has distanced itself from the person because of difficulties, and the family is convinced that the use of illegal drugs over a long period caused a long-term mental health problem.  We are not getting the information out there that the use of illegal drugs can lead to mental health issues.  There is not enough information out there for young people in particular.  I have come across a number of cases where people have been in perfect health before getting into drugs and they now have long-term mental health problems, with no road back.  How is it proposed to deal with this?  Must we put much more information out there?  Where do we start with such a process?</p></speech>

There have been some difficulties over the past few years filling posts for CAMHS consultants, and there have been occasions when in certain areas there has not been a consultant available to provide a service.  Sometimes they will cross over from another area or community healthcare organisation to try to pick up any of the emergency cases.  I know CHO 5 ran into some difficulties with that and the services from other areas went through the waiting list, with urgent cases being seen and so on.  That was not ideal at all and the difficulty was in recruiting a consultant psychiatrist.  The posts had been approved.  Dr. McDaid has done some work on the topic of non-Irish patients.</p></speech>

We have been calling for some time now for the mental health services to develop a programme of cultural competence for staff in bringing about a culturally sensitive service.  This will have to apply to mental health care delivered in primary care as well and it is about ensuring the system is equipped to support people from different ethnic communities and new communities coming to Ireland.  That extends not just to developing a level of staffing competence in providing services to people from diverse cultural backgrounds but also to planning for services that have adequate capacity to support individuals in distress in those circumstances.  That is really where the Senator's story hints at a failure to adequately plan for a new situation in Ireland, which is a more diverse community.  I would welcome it being a priority within the HSE for them to plan for services that can provide support for people from ethnic minority communities coming into the country.  It will probably need to do that in partnership with other services around the country, such as the direct provision system.  There needs to be communication and collaboration between those who organise direct provision and mental health services.</p></speech>

There are a number of people who have very complex psychiatric needs and they require very expensive packages for care.  They are either treated outside this jurisdiction or else the care is provided by a private company with the health care assistants or mental health nurses providing care for them.  It is expensive but there is no facility in Ireland currently where people with such complex needs and high staffing requirements can be treated.</p></speech>

The cost of keeping the person in the community is very high.  A number of years ago, that person would have been kept for a substantial period in more permanent care but that seems to have totally changed.  The argument put to me is the person in question is not suitable to be in the community.  Members of that person's family have suffered injury after being assaulted, as have care workers.  There is a concern as to whether this was the right decision.</p><p>There seems to be a reluctance to keep a person in more clearly defined care.  Referral into the community is the preferred option, but the appropriate support services may not be available.  Even where they are, there can be a difficulty in finding staff and then with the cost of staffing.  <br/><br/>Returning to the CAMHS issue and the geographical divide, I still do not accept that because there is a boundary half a mile up the road from a person's house he or she should have to wait <i>ad infinitum</i>.  <br/><br/>My other question is about the definition of &quot;urgent care&quot;.  I think a 16 year old teenager who is borderline in respect of self-harm, or whatever the issue might be, requires urgent care.  However, the system seems to be telling parents that it is necessary to go on a waiting list to see a consultant and that CAMHS cannot become involved until a full assessment has been made.  Something has to change.  Geographical boundaries should not apply.  If one consultant is not available, some process should be set up immediately to ensure no one will be left in limbo.  The family to whom I am referring were left in such a situation.  Other families in the same area are caught in the same dilemma.  No assistance was being offered for a long time.  That issue has to be dealt with.</p></speech>

Anybody who needs urgent care should be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist or the CAMHS team.  </p> <p>  On the geographical areas, the HSE has divided the country into community health care organisation, CHO, areas, within which there are various sectors.  I am not sure how strong the boundaries are between each team or CHO.   However, anyone who needs urgent treatment and intervention should be seen.  There should be no question of telling someone that is not possible because he or she lives in a certain area.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

This issue highlights the gaps in staffing in the mental health service.  A consultant psychiatrist might be not available in one area, but there may be one available a few miles down the road.  There is a waiting list in the particular catchment area, which highlights the need for enhanced efforts to recruit the required consultant psychiatrists.  There is also a need to focus on the recruitment of allied health and social care professionals.  We need an increase in the numbers of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists in order that children and young people and their families can access services when they require them.</p></speech>

That is the position set out in legislation and policy.  If the committee is to look at the issue, it will need to examine it in the context of the existing legislation.  There are other jurisdictions, the United Kingdom for example, where a consultant psychiatrist is not required to make the assessment and take on the role of clinical lead.  That is not the case here.</p></speech>

No one is taking responsibility.  The question arises as to who is in charge in the area once an adolescent mental health consultant is not available.  Who takes responsibility when such an issue arises?  Mental health consultants do cover the particular geographical area, but they do not deal with adolescent mental health issues.  There is buck passing going on.  No one is taking responsibility, even though the person concerned is living in the area.</p></speech>

I refer to the governance of and accountability for the service.  We cannot see it happening and would like to see the issue being addressed so as to rule out the possibility detailed by the Senator.  There should be an individual who could be held to account for the care and treatment of a child or adolescent in such a situation, but that is not the case.  </p> <p>  Turning to the point made by Ms Mitchell concerning the legislation, it only pertains to children who require involuntary admission.  They must be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist.  A very small proportion of children are admitted under section 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We advocate that an assessment be undertaken by any member of the team whenever a child or an adolescent presents at an emergency ward or elsewhere.   As Dr. Finnerty stated, such a presentation should be regarded as an urgent need and the child or adolescent addressed by a consultant.</p></speech>

It is helpful that the Senator has brought up this broader point about the evidence increasingly showing that certain illegal drugs seem to have an association with severe mental health difficulties.  I refer, in particular, to psychosis, where there seems to be a link with certain drugs.  We need to get out that message.  One of the issues on which we are not focusing enough is the prevention of mental health difficulties.  We may never be able to cope with demand if we do not put more effort into prevention and educating people about how they can prevent mental health difficulties.<br/><br/>The Senator's point is well made.  However, a challenge often arises with people who have a history of addiction or misuse of illegal substances when they present with a mental health difficulty.  Too often in our system they are turned away from one service or another.  They are told that they have to sort out their addiction issues before they can be seen in the mental health service or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is probably more often the case that a person ends up in addiction services when he or she also needs mental health service supports.  Those supports are not being deployed in an integrated way.  I hope that failure will be addressed in the revision of A Vision for Change.  I do not think that policy was very helpful.  It seemed to conceive of addiction issues and services as being separate from mental health difficulties, unless there was a clear mental health difficulty prior to addiction.  I hope the next mental health policy will recognise much more that substance and alcohol misuse often feature among those with mental health difficulties and that holistic support is needed.</p></speech>

I have some generic questions.  Can the witnesses name one or two critical issues, areas or services that are outside the health services and that have a significant impact on the people about whom they are concerned?  On prevention, which Dr. McDaid just mentioned, we have the analogy that it is better to prevent people falling into a river than to be trying to pull them all out in time.  Are we spending too much effort on trying to save people, as it were, and not enough on keeping them well most of the time?  I am not suggesting that resources be taken from one and given to the other.</p><p> I also have a couple of questions for the Mental Health Commission.  It was great to see the executive summary it provided with the bullet points.  The summary states that there are some good things happening.  It also sets out six areas, forensically but briefly, where there are serious issues.  It states that "basic and fundamental aspects of care and treatment in regulated health services continue to be lacking", that there is "lingering complacency around restrictive practices", and that a large number of specialist community health teams remain without regulatory oversight.  It cites a lack of rehabilitation supports for people with enduring mental health services; the whole issue of the physical health needs of people with enduring mental health needs; and the provision of child mental health services in the community.  I want to focus on the second last item.  What is the interaction in respect of general health, disability and other conditions?  How might that be dealt with differently?  The drugs thing was almost a parallel issue in terms of trying to slice and dice people.  </p><p> The Mental Health Commission is the regulator of mental health services.  It is also there to protect the interests of people admitted and detained under the 2001 Act, which is quite a critical and long overdue provision.  It is, dare I say, therefore locked into people who are in services or who are on the cusp of being so.  We have heard it set out eloquently by Senator Colm Burke.  What has the commission to say about people who are not in services and should be?</p><p> Turning to Mental Health Reform, it sets out three major issues in the first page of its presentation, governance, accountability and protracted delays in reform of the 2001 Act.  We hope we do not have to wait as long as from 1945 to 2001 to get the next Act and get things moved on.  Reference was also made to implementation of the national mental health policy.  I refer to the United Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Will the witnesses comment briefly on what it requires, what Ireland has said it is going to do and how this relates to A Vision for Change and the Mental Health Act?  The second page of Mental Health Reform's presentation states "the Irish mental health system suffers from a severe lack of capacity in the face of increased demand which has pushed the mental health services to breaking point".  What is actually meant by that?  When is that going to happen if something does not change?</p></speech>

We touched on it a little earlier.  The main point is that people with a serious mental illness die ten, 15 or even 20 years earlier than those who do not have a serious mental illness.

It is very easy to monitor this and pick up very early if people are showing signs of physical health problems like that.  In the same way that we go to our doctor for our lipids, weight and so on, people who have serious mental illness and are on medication need to have the same.  We found that in a small group of inpatients, this was not happening.  We also found that access to essential healthcare, such as dietetics, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, were not ether either.</p></speech>

The Senator is right that our remit extends only to inpatient services in respect of enforcement and compliance of the services.  We register them.  Our remit does not extend beyond that, although the inspector has the right to visit anywhere a mental health service is delivered.  We have no enforcement or powers beyond that.  We have advocated and have recommended today that our powers be extended.  It would give us more powers in being able to look and to address many of the members' questions, which we are not able to answer because we do not have the full picture of a pathway of a patient through mental health services.  We are only looking at the 10% of people who are inpatients.  We do not have oversight of the rest of the mental health services, where the majority of them are delivered.  This is a deficit.  There is no oversight of a patient's journey through mental health services provision.</p> <p>  The protection element is a very important piece of work.  We see ourselves as safeguarding those who are the most ill and who require involuntary detention.  Through our offices, we establish the tribunals to ensure their rights are upheld.  It has been a very welcome provision for the people who have to go through that process that they are afforded those rights and protections.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked about the critical issues outside of the health remit.

Many people who have a mental health difficulty would identify themselves that if they could just get adequate housing, it would help them to recover.  If they could just get support to help them into the daily routine of employment or participating in the community, for example, as a volunteer or parent, this would be as important for their recovery, if not more so, than some of the medical treatment they will receive.  They are not alone in thinking that because the evidence on the impact of having secure housing and employment is very good.  For instance, when we see in the social welfare system that about 50% of people on disability allowance identify mental health as their primary concern, we know that we do not have a well functioning mental health system.  It should not be the case that people who have a mental health difficulty and want to work do not routinely get the support they need to get back into work.  We welcome the national roll-out, under the service reform fund, of support for people with severe mental health difficulties to get back into work.  That is a pilot programme and needs to be mainstreamed.  In housing, no one should be in an inpatient for the sole reason that he or she cannot get housing.  That is a very inefficient use of resources, yet it is the case in inpatient units around the country.  We have seen evidence of this.</p> <p>  Another area which may not be as closely related to what would help people recover but is nonetheless symptomatic of the weaknesses in our system is the extent of mental health difficulties arising for people who are in the prison system and on remand.  Between 40% and 60% of people on remand have a diagnosable mental health difficulty and between 5% and 10% of people in the prison system have a severe mental health difficulty.  That is not the appropriate place to recover from a mental health difficulty.  It will not help them to recover.  We need to look closely at the supports in the prison system and ensure that people in the prison system who are experiencing mental distress get good quality supports and all the support they need to ensure their mental health difficulty does not reduce their ability to get back into the community.</p> <p>  I would like my colleague, Ms Mitchell, to answer the question on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  While people with a mental health difficulty do not always identify for themselves as having a disability, that convention has many powerful messages and commitments that can positively impact on people with mental health difficulties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Mitchell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#R00500"><p>It is clear that Ireland is currently out of compliance with the UNCRPD in that the Mental Health Act 2001 is not in line with the convention or the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government acknowledged this in its roadmap for ratification of the convention.  This is evident in several parts of the Mental Health Act, for example, voluntary patients do not have basic rights to information on their estimated length of stay in hospital.  People who are inpatients detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 do not have a legal right to an advance directive by which they can, when they are well, set out their wishes and preferences for their treatment.  The advance directive then comes into effect when they become unwell.  People who are detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 are the only group of individuals who are excluded from that right to a legally binding advanced directive.  We are also out of compliance in not having individual care planning on an statutory footing and the lack of statutory rights around advocacy services and supports.  Many provisions in the Mental Health Act 2001 require reform and must be updated urgently to ensure we are in compliance with international human rights standards, including the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  On A Vision for Change, it is clear that many aspects of the policy have not been implemented or implemented to full effect.  This was evident in Mental Health Reform's most recent national consultation of people who use mental health services.  For example, for 13 years, the national mental health policy has stated that all individuals accessing mental health services would have an individual care recovery plan.  More than two thirds of respondents to the survey reported that they were not aware of having a written care recovery plan.  The national mental health policy explicitly states that people should have access to key working but many of the people using the services report that they do not have access to that kind of support.  A similar issue arises with regard to service users being listened to or involved in decisions on medication.  There is a significant gap between what is in the policy and what is happening in practice.  The revised mental health policy offers a very positive opportunity to address some of those issues.  We need to ensure implementation of the revised policy and one way to achieve that is to cost a timelined action plan to ensure there are robust monitoring review mechanisms in order that we do much better this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#R00700"><p>I thought that was the first matter for discussion.  My target is to conclude by 12.30 p.m.</p> <p>  I hope I will not go over ground that has been covered.  Reading the opening statement last night, governance and accountability in the health service stood out.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts which have discussed CervicalCheck and the national children's hospital project.  Key to fixing all this a change in governance structure, which is a magic wand that is waved at us when something goes wrong.  Overspends in hospitals are one issue but if the witnesses have a serious concern about governance and accountability in mental health services, the net effect of poor governance are the catastrophic instances of people dying prematurely.  Will the witnesses outline their experience of how bad governance or weakness in governance can have catastrophic impacts on patient outcomes?</p> <p>  On the devolution of powers to regional bodies, Deputy Durkan, the Chairman, Deputy Harty, and I sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee at which we discussed community health organisations and having proper boundaries among the hospital groups.</p><p>Are the witnesses saying to us that we need a national director of mental health steering this from the top and then filtering down that direction to the organisations?  Coming out of this committee, we want to make it clear what the witnesses want because if bad outcomes have catastrophic impacts on families and on people's lives then we have to act because it is not an accident.  This is an emergency as far as I am concerned.</p><p> For the doctors and the medics present, when there are gaps in funding or staffing, how does it affect their approach to treatment and their approach as professionals?  I cannot outline every permutation of a situation but are consultant psychiatrists and teams ending up in situations where, for example, they see person A at 14 years of age and they want to carry out a considered pathway of care for this particular individual but because the resources are not there, they have to go to the tier 2 or the tier 3 of the treatment where they decide that they do not have cognitive behavioural therapy, social services, clinical nurses or psychiatrists so they will just medicate in a holding situation?  I am a pharmacist by profession although I do not practise anymore.  Is it a case that people, young or old, are getting suboptimum treatment to keep them in a holding position?  To what extent is that happening?</p><p> The increased demand was mentioned and I find that concerning.  In some ways it is good because people are recognising that there is an issue and perhaps openness towards mental health is the reason for that.  Maybe it is just that there are more conditions or there are more presentations but it is very concerning if there is an increased demand.  Although I can see that the budget has increased, it has not increased at the same rate.</p><p> Dr. McDaid or Dr. Finnerty spoke about the threshold and how that makes treating medical professionals feel they literally have to nearly triage the level of emergency.  I do not want to get into the witnesses' personal lives, but in terms of going home and sleeping at night when they are looking at that threshold and that funding, are they lying there in bed wondering if that person should have got over the threshold and if they have made the wrong decision?  Are they being forced to make suboptimum decisions because they just have to prioritise the services to those who are most at risk?</p><p> I refer to the institutionalisation in residential care reference mentioned by Dr. Finnerty in response to Deputy Durkan's question about homelessness.  Trinity College Dublin has a longitudinal study on growing up in Ireland and I read some findings that were brought out at the start of the year.  There were negative effects from the recession on children and families and their mental health.  I cannot remember the detail but I am sure that is the case because it is a well constructed study.  I mention the people living in direct provision; 13 years ago I was working in Athlone with the Lissywollen site as a pharmacist and I cannot believe those people are still there as I was telling them it would be over soon.  Can anyone quantify the long-term effects on those people's mental health?  In this scenario 13 years have been taken out of people's lives  - they have been deskilled, the ability to have a home has been taken from them and there are other issues affecting women with children who are particularly vulnerable.  Is this the inquiry of the future?  That is what I am getting at here.</p><p> I want to finish off my questions and then I will take the answers.  The next bit I want to speak about is the separation of addiction and mental health and international best practice.  I have heard anecdotally in the real world that people cannot see a psychiatrist until they stop taking drugs.  Is it normal in other jurisdictions to stream these two illnesses or conditions?  It does not seem in any way logical.  If a person is taking drugs because he or she is self-medicating for an underlying mental health issue and then he or she comes off the legal or illegal drugs, he or she is in limbo and his or her mental health needs are still not met.  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on that and maybe outline what the best way is of sorting this out.</p><p> Another issue that came to me as I have been sitting here this morning is that I have a bit of legislation going through the D&aacute;il, and we will be looking at it here in the committee, about the regulation of the advertising of fake cures and treatments for people with cancer.  On the influence of social media on vulnerable people who have mental health issues, some people are so bad that they will target people who have stage 4 cancer and tell them that by standing on their head and rubbing cat's urine into their hair, for example, it will cure it.  Is this happening across mental health and psychiatric units?  Is there any market out there that the witnesses know of or that they have come across?  That is just an aside I thought of this morning out of personal interest.  Is there a notable social media influence, a negative impact and a targeting of people with mental health illnesses with rogue treatments or suggestions that big pharma is out to get them?  Is that prevalent these days and is it an issue in providing care?  Do people drop out of the services because somebody on the Internet is going to fix them and not the professionals?</p></speech>

I might answer the question about doctors and how they feel about gaps in funding and treatment.  I am a psychiatrist but like the Deputy I do not practise clinically and have not done so for some time.  On gaps in funding and treatment, consultants have told me about the worries they have about how to provide a service for people when it is basically not there.  An example of that might be to take somebody who has a severe and enduring mental illness, who is in a continuing care unit and who is capable of moving to more independent accommodation.  There may be a small rehabilitation team who want that person to move on and who have provided the best they can but there is no housing for them to move into, no employment or vocational training for them to move on to and not enough support in the community for them to live a more independent lifestyle.  That person stays where he or she is within the continuing care unit despite the fact that the doctors and the team feel that this person could move on.  That person's life is affected by the fact that there are gaps in services and funding.</p> <p>  At the other end of the spectrum the same thing happens in CAMHS services as well.  A person who may be assessed by a consultant or by one of the team may be unwell but there might not be any accessible beds in the system at that time for that young person to be admitted.  That is where the Deputy's point about sleepless nights and worries comes into it because that young person may be unwell and, as was mentioned, the parents have to look after that child because there is no accessible place for that person to go.  Yes, doctors worry, other team members worry and families worry about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#S00400"><p>I will take the questions the Deputy has raised around governance and accountability and link that to the question she asked on the experience of gaps in services.</p><p>We have been clear that we believe the absence of a mental health information system and the dissolution of the post of national director in the office of mental health within the HSE are negative for adequate accountability.  A good example of this is the statement the HSE made in the service plan this year.  The plan stated clearly that the HSE will have to essentially make choices about providing services to some people and not providing services to others because mental health services did not get the full funding that they needed.  The HSE is essentially saying that it has to ration services.  That is how the statement translates.  It means the HSE will have to make choices that some people with get mental health treatment while others will not because the mental health services will not have adequate funding for the year based on what those responsible know the demand will be.  The real tragedy, as has been pointed out, is that when people do not get mental health treatment their mental health deteriorates and they get worse, sometimes with the worst of outcomes.</p><p> Moreover, we do not know, and we have no way of knowing as far as I can tell, how much this is going on or who is being helped and who is not or what those decisions are.  A good example is in emergency departments.  We have a self-harm liaison service and admissions through accident and emergency departments.  We know people who are admitted through accident and emergency departments get help but we do not know how many people are turned away from accident and emergency departments.  That information is not kept, so we have no idea how many people have showed up at accident and emergency in distress but who have not gotten any service.</p><p> That runs throughout the mental health services.  We do not know how many people are helped.  We do not know how many people go into mental health services who feel they need a holistic range of supports but maybe only get one type of support but not the others they need.  We have some indications from our survey of people who have used mental health services.  They say they have got talking therapies.  The findings were encouraging in that more people said they were getting talk therapy than we had expected.  However, it is still the case that many people say they only saw one mental health professional.  Many say that within the mental health services their experience is of medication being the predominant mode of treatment.</p><p> We really do not have robust consistent regular transparent information about what is going on in our mental health services and of course that is concerning.  We have hundreds of people living in high-support accommodation and medium and low-support HSE accommodation but we do not know the quality of the service they are getting apart from the inspection reports that have been done on an informal basis, so to speak.  We do not have those services regulated.</p><p> I will say what I have said to the committee in the past.  It is an urgent priority to get better quality more transparent information about what is happening in the delivery of our mental health services so that we can then attest to whether people are getting the services they need.</p><p> There was a question on the separation of addiction and mental health.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental issue.  We hear consistently of adults and children not getting access to mental health services because they have a dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and addiction.  My understanding is that there are practices in operation in other jurisdictions that focus highly on integration between addiction and mental health services and co-location of addiction counsellors on mental health teams.  I gather that is proving effective.  Within the Irish context there has been a pilot involving integration between addiction, mental health supports and co-location of addiction counsellors on a mental health team.  This is the "no wrong door" approach piloted in north Tipperary.  It proved positive outcomes in terms of people being able to access the services they required as well as showing marked improvements in their mental health and well-being.  We really need to look to these kinds of initiatives in Ireland in terms of what is working.  We need to look at rolling them out at a national level.  However, it requires a multi-pronged approach in addition to co-location of addiction counsellors on teams.  That is happening in certain areas but it is certainly not happening everywhere.  There is also a requirement to increase the capacity within community mental health teams to support people with addictions.  That applies across the disciplines.  We need to increase capacity and adequately resource addiction services so that they can provide low-level mental health support.</p> <p>  We also need formal processes and protocols to ensure collaboration and integration between addiction and mental health services.  It requires significant investment attention and focus to ensure we see progress in this area.</p></speech>

I suppose I am around a long time.  When I started, addiction counsellors were on mental health teams.  There were usually one or two addiction counsellors.  That has continued in some areas to this day.  We believe that addiction, whether it is the cause of the mental illness or because of the mental illness, needs to be addressed in a holistic way of looking at people to try to help them.  There certainly has been a move to silo it.  That ties in with what I was saying about physical health.</p></speech>

It took the view that treatment of addiction problems should be in the community and outside mental health teams.  That approach has continued.  I hope that innovative change, review and refreshed thinking will see that looked at again.  I hope to see more holistic and person-centred treatment.  Ideally, addiction counselling, physical health and other areas would be part of that care pathway.</p></speech>

Their acute need has gone and the idea is to move them on.  They do not have care pathways because there are not enough rehabilitation teams, and the teams that are in place are poorly staffed.  Only 48% of the teams recommended in A Vision for Change are in place.</p></speech>

Since the commencement of the 2001 Act in 2006 we have seen several iterations of governance structure within the public sector.  We do not see similar structures in the private sector, which we also regulate.  We have gone through several people who are responsible.  There have been occasions when we did not know who was responsible and accountable, although the Act provides for a registered provider or proprietor.  In the case of the public sector, this is the director general of the HSE, who devolves down the function.</p><p>That can be devolved down to anybody the director general deems fit to be considered for the role, and it can be at different levels of authority.  The person does not always necessarily have the remit over funding, for example.  Therefore, he or she does not really have the authority to exercise any change within their remit.  I was asked for an example of that.  It can be clearly seen in the inspection reports and the levels of non-compliance within the different CHO areas.  Even within the CHO areas, the disparity of compliance levels within the regions will be seen.  It is one service that is provided by one provider and the question must be asked why in one area a service can be compliant and people can receive a good quality service while down the road people are not receiving the same type of service, despite the fact that it is the one governor and the one commissioner of that service.  This is why we ask and advocate for a national office for mental health with oversight of and responsibility for the delivery of mental health services.</p><p> We would also advocate in the area of regulation.  The Act and the regulations do not provide for us to have oversight of governance arrangements, which would be unlike our sister regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and also unlike other jurisdictions that have such statutory regulatory oversight for governance.</p></speech>

Reference was made to regulatory compliance improving by some small percentage points year on year.  What are the areas with non-compliance?</p></speech>

We have a very comprehensive data set spanning across a number of years that allows us to take a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to identifying concerns.  Across most of the areas there is improvement.  As Dr. Finnerty has said, it is slow and modest improvement.  There are some areas, however, where improvement is lacking.  That would be in areas such as unsuitable or unsafe premises or cleanliness of the premises.  There could be issues around privacy, medication - which is still low - and staffing and staff training in particular.  We continue to have concerns around those areas.  As my colleague Ms Smyth has pointed out, we do see high compliance in some parts of the country and in some sectors.  There is no explanation as to why in some areas or in some CHOs compliance should be so much lower when it is the same provider.</p></speech>

We have very strict regulations around housing in the housing sector, but are there regulations for accommodation in hospitals?</p></speech>

It is very broadly stated and there is a lot of room for interpretation within that.  As Dr. Finnerty has pointed out, we do not believe it is suitable that people continue to be in dormitory-style accommodation, especially for long-term accommodation.  There is, however, no regulatory prohibition on that.</p></speech>

If there is any gap in those 25 steps the approval may be delayed and it could be up to 18 months before a service could recruit a nurse.  Is this an issue given that recruitment is national rather than regional?  Sl&aacute;intecare includes a proposal for regionalisation of services, one aspect being that regions would have autonomy in the recruitment of staff.  Is it an issue that recruitment and retention is too centralised?</p></speech>

This does not just apply to nurses.  It also applies across the board into the allied health professionals.</p></speech>

This leads to a reduction in services, prolonged waiting lists and poor outcomes for patients, unfortunately.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about the lack of consultants making decisions.  Unfortunately, we now have non-consultant hospital doctors who are filling the gaps, and not just acting up to consultant level.  It may be that the non-consultant hospital doctor is the only person who can man an outpatient department.  This is not satisfactory.  How can we overcome that?</p></speech>

The non-consultant hospital doctors are doctors in training to become psychiatrists or to become GPs.  The level of training differs.  One could have a person who has just started his or her training or a person who is finishing the training making those decisions, taking outpatients and so on.</p> <p>  On the recruitment of consultants, it is very difficult to recruit consultants in an area where there are no consultants, if the committee gets what I mean.  In an area where there is an active service, where teams are well staffed and there is good training and continuing professional development then one will tend to attract the consultant psychiatrist.  We can see this around the country.  In areas where teams are poorly staffed or where there is long-term difficulty in recruitment of consultants, one finds that retention is also a difficulty.</p></speech>

That team disintegrates quicker due to the lack of support.  Staff who work in psychiatry, and in other areas of medicine, do not have adequate support from the HSE to allow them to work effectively and efficiently.  They burn out much more quickly.  Are there any moves within the HSE to put in additional supports to support staff?</p><p>A member of staff is a fantastic resource to have.  To allow such people to burn out and leave seems to be very uncaring on the part of the employer.</p></speech>

We are back again to the spiral.  The difficulty is to release the staff for training because they do not have enough staff.  It is a spiral.  As we do not have the critical mass of staff, it is very hard to retain those who are there without introducing motivating factors.  Even when motivating factors such as training are introduced, staff find they cannot be released.  It is a big problem.</p></speech>

However, they do not necessarily need the services of CAMHS.  They do not need a psychiatric service; they need a much more supportive service.  However, CAMHS tends to be the catch-all for everyone in distress, which then blocks appointments and places for people who are in genuine need.  Is there a way to direct people to a more appropriate service other than CAMHS?  Talk therapy is generally what these adolescents need.  Unfortunately, however, talk therapy is very difficult to get.  That also goes into adult psychiatry.  Owing to a lack of talk therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, occupational therapy and all the other therapies to help people with mental illness, the prescription pad is the easy way out.  I believe a considerable amount of unnecessary medication is prescribed because the other support services are not available.  How can we address that?</p></speech>

I am hopeful that the assistant psychologists in primary care will address some of that need, even though there are not many of them.  I mentioned Jigsaw.  Young people can go there to get that kind of support where a serious mental illness is not involved.  I have been told by nearly all the teams in CAMHS that they are absorbing everybody with any mental health difficulties.  They sit on waiting lists, meaning that people with serious mental illness cannot be assessed and treated.  Triage is going on and some areas have managed to get their waiting lists right down, but there are very few community services for the less seriously ill and there they sit on the waiting lists.</p></speech>

It is deeply concerning that people are in HSE-supported accommodation that is unregulated.  I do not think any other residential services within the health service continue to be unregulated.  In light of what we have seen in other parts of the health service in that regard, I believe that would be an urgent priority.  We should ensure people have the right to make decisions about their own mental health treatment.  Removing the exclusion of people with mental health difficulties, who are involuntarily detained, from the provisions under the advance healthcare directive is a priority.  People who lack the capacity to make decisions should have their rights protected and there should be oversight of their circumstances.  People lacking capacity under the current law can still be considered a voluntary patient and therefore there is no tribunal and no requirement for independent oversight as to the reasons they are in hospital.  That is a very significant concern.</p> <p>  In all circumstances there should be the right to advocacy support.  We have the right to a lawyer in the context of a tribunal, but we do not have the right to the kind of representative or peer advocacy to ensure that everyone who is in hospital for mental health care has the support they need to make their voice heard and to be supported to address concerns they have about their treatment.</p> <p>  Those are some of the priorities.  Voluntary patients can also be quite vulnerable when they are in hospital.  I am concerned that there is no legislative requirement to provide voluntary patients with information.  People who are voluntary patients may often not even be sure about their status and whether they are voluntary or involuntary.  They will not necessarily know about the provision of an advocacy service or other rights they may have when they are in services.  Ms Mitchell might point out anything I have missed.</p></speech>

I would also stress the importance of placing individual care and recovery planning on a statutory basis.  People should have a legal right to that kind of care and recovery planning.  The legislation should contain specific children and youth principles, so that there is particular consideration for the voice of the child, with children and young people being involved in decisions about their care and treatment.  We specifically need to address the issue of age of consent when young people go into hospital for mental health care and treatment.  Currently 16 and 17 year olds are not presumed to have capacity to give consent to admission or treatment.  It is really the only area of the health sector where that exists.  In every other area of the health sector, 16 and 17 year olds have a legal right to consent to their healthcare.  That area also needs to be updated urgently.</p></speech>

Given the need to deal with patients with dementia who can no longer live at home, are there plans to develop specific dementia services within our health services?  People with chronic psychiatric illness are often housed or accommodated along with people with dementing illness.  There can often be difficulty in managing those two groups.  Are there any moves to provide specific dementia services within our psychiatric services?</p></speech>

More widely, there is a need to ensure adequate mental health services are integrated in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is relatively light on mental health.  There was a rationale for that insofar as there was an anticipated review of A Vision for Change.  Such a revised framework needs to be fully part of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.  It needs to be perceived as part of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.  The Sl&aacute;intecare reforms will not work if mental health is not integrated into them.</p> <p>  I give the example of the new GP contract.</p><p>The new GP contract, about which I have only read in news reports, refers a lot to support for chronic diseases.  We know, for instance, in the case of diabetes care, that it costs 50% to 75% more to care for someone with diabetes when the mental health aspects of the disease are not being addressed.  I encourage the health community to look out for mental health as an issue in the implementation of all the health service reforms.  Unless mental health is integrated in all of those locations, the system will be far more expensive than it needs to be.</p></speech>

We concur with everything she said and agree that all of those areas need to be addressed.  In addition, as I outlined to Deputy O'Connell, the registration section of the Act needs to be addressed.  Part 5 of the Act is taken from nursing home legislation from the 1990s and needs to be amended in order that it is fit for purpose in the context of a modern mental health service and the registration and regulation of same in the modern era.</p></speech>

In making a decision to decriminalise cannabis, one would have to look at the evidence very carefully and weigh up the risks on a population base.  Certainly on an individual basis, in my past life, I saw people who had major difficulties because of cannabis use.  It needs to be thought about very carefully.</p></speech>

Is anyone looking at the Portuguese model and the impacts on the population?  Do the witnesses have any information on that?  Is it their professional opinion that if there were magical powers within a particular compound that has been around for generations, they would have been noticed before now?  I am concerned by many of the claims being made for cannabis.  I am very much in favour of a compassionate approach to drug use in respect of the links between addiction and mental health but some of the claims being made are such that patients would not need any other tablets if they had access to cannabis.  That is the narrative at the moment but many of us are concerned about the erosion of the good work that professionals such as the witnesses have done over the years.  As with our discussion of the Kardashian effect last week, we are concerned that some celebrity's opinion is considered equal to a body of evidence.  I find that concerning not just in this case but in every case of medical treatment.</p></speech>

From the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, we are joined by Mr. Nick Henderson, chief executive officer, and Ms Rosemary Hennigan, who is the policy and advocacy officer.  They are both very welcome.  Joining us from the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, is Mr. Lucky Khambule, the group co-ordinator, as well as Mr. Bulelani Mfaco, Ms Donnah Vuma, Ms Tina Ndlovu, Ms Rosemary Kunene, Mr. Christopher Sibanda and Ms Babs Leonard, all of whom are members.  I did my best with the pronunciations and I am sure my name will not prove any easier.  All of our guests are very welcome.</p><p>I will shortly invite the nominated witnesses to make their opening statements.  Before doing that, I first have to advise on privilege for witnesses who come before an Oireachtas committee.  I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Before hearing the first opening statement, I again remind people to switch off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  I invite Mr. Henderson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The Irish Refugee Council is a charity that helps people seeking asylum.  We give information, provide early legal advice, help people to access employment and education, help young people and support people to leave direct provision through our housing project.  We also advocate for improvements in the asylum process.</p> <p>  It has been a consistent call of the Irish Refugee Council that direct provision should end.  Moreover, politicians across the spectrum, international bodies, other non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and, most importantly, people living in direct provision have called for it to end.  There are countless articles, reports and testimonies on what is wrong with this system.  The fact that Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection, has called on Ireland to abolish direct provision and that the Ombudsman, as recently as yesterday, has said it is not a suitable long-term accommodation for those waiting on an asylum claim should alone be enough to bring about wholesale and radical change.  Direct provision is already, unfortunately, a chapter in Ireland&rsquo;s long and dark history of institutional living.</p> <p>  We believe the system has worsened in recent months, particularly in the context of emergency centres.  A grave concern we have is that the short-term emergency situation will become entrenched, which will make the implementation of change harder.  If direct provision ends, something will have to take its place.  The bottom lines of a new system should include own-door accommodation and the opportunities to cook for oneself, live in a community and to work.  We believe this model could be agreed upon more easily than others think.  On foot of discussions with the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, I believe it is open to real change.  However, the bigger challenge lies in how the new model could be delivered.  We are very doubtful that existing providers or the current procurement process being rolled out over 2019 can deliver that model.  The system is broken and it is costing too much for too little.  We know that it must change, so how do we get to a new system?</p> <p>  First, we should consider the accommodation of people seeking asylum as a housing issue.  That is not to draw from existing funds for housing but to take a housing policy approach.  The Department of Justice and Equality is not equipped to design that policy and the responsibility should not lie with that Department.</p> <p>  Second, we should use the existing budget more strategically.  The Government has built only three accommodation centres in 18 years.  The majority of existing centres were originally designed for other purposes.  The State should procure fit-for-purpose accommodation to meet particular needs.  We believe this will be a cost saver in the long term.  Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Director General of the Department of Justice and Equality, told this committee a few weeks ago that the spend on direct provision in 2019 will likely reach &euro;95 million to &euro;100 million.  In 18 years, over &euro;1.2 billion has been paid to private providers of accommodation.  Spending money on providing people with asylum is a good thing, but it should be done strategically to the benefit of people in that system and the public.</p> <p>  Third, and linked to this, a fundamental criticism of the system so far has been that it has been reliant on for-profit actors.  Private providers are not social workers or public servants.  They cannot and are not meeting the complex social needs of the people living in their centres.  That is a public obligation on the State.  There are many housing bodies in Ireland that are non-profit, work to a particular mission and have strengths and expertise.  We believe those bodies could be best placed to provide accommodation.  The procurement process has to change for this to happen, with longer lead-in times, longer contracts, funding for capital and conversion costs and a reduction in the number of people a provider must accommodate.  Current procurement models require a provider to accommodate 50 or more people.  The approved housing bodies, AHBs, tell us that this risks perpetuating the model of congregated living and it is difficult to procure buildings of this size.</p> <p>  Fourth, direct provision is not just about the bricks and mortar.  We can reduce delays in the system by giving resources to decision makers and increase legal aid at pre-decision stage so applications are better prepared.  The right to work should be broader and we should allow for integration from day one.  This model has been developed successfully in Scotland.</p> <p>  Fifth, there must be greater engagement on this issue by all Departments.  This was emphasised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, head of office, Enda O'Neill, last week.  Moreover, the Department of Justice and Equality could work better internally.  The International Protection Office, IPO, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, the Legal Aid Board, the Reception and Integration Agency, the ministerial decisions unit, MDU, of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, are all under the remit of the Department but they could work better.  To give an example, the Legal Aid Board is not supported enough to ensure everyone has a well prepared application to the International Protection Office.  This means the International Protection Appeals Tribunal has to deal with more complicated appeals.  If somebody is recognised as a refugee, there are long delays in issuing the declaration of refugee status by the ministerial decisions unit.  This means that people spend longer in the direct provision system and the system becomes more overcrowded, which puts pressure on the Reception and Integration Agency and leads to people being accommodated in emergency centres.  There are not enough appointments issued by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for people to get a residency card.</p> <p>  At each step, there are hurdles requiring intensive interventions and supports.  It does not have to be this difficult, but systemic change is key.  The written submission we will provide to the committee will go into more detail on what I have said.</p></speech>

The Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland is a platform for asylum seekers to join together in unity and purpose.  The group is made up of people who are directly affected by the direct provision system.  As people who are currently undergoing the international protection application process we, unlike experts and NGOs, are uniquely placed to offer direction to the committee on the many issues on which it has asked us to comment.  The content and recommendations in our submission are all directly informed by the experiences of our members, asylum seekers who live every day of their lives under the appalling system of direct provision.  The purpose of our submission is to gather together our collective experiences to inform the committee and to make a series of key proposals that would make the Irish asylum system compatible with minimum human rights standards.</p> <p>  We do not view human rights as gifts that governments bestow on people.  They are rights and entitlements we all possess by virtue of being human.  People cannot be treated as less than others and, indeed, less than human merely because of differences in nationality and citizenship.  In May 2017, the Supreme Court told the Department of Justice and Equality that as asylum seekers, we can rely on constitutional protections that affect us as human beings.  That simply means fundamental human rights are not reserved for Irish, EU or other legally resident nationals in Ireland and that an asylum seeker child does not have to be Irish for the best interest of the child to prevail.  It cannot be in the best interest of the child, therefore, to ban parents from working.</p><p>There are children in direct provision forced to grow up in State-sponsored poverty as their parents are unable to provide for their material needs.  Many of them are too ashamed to tell their friends in school where they live.  In a direct provision centre in Kildare, children dumped their sandwiches underneath their seats on the bus because they were too ashamed of carrying the same sandwich for lunch every day.  A mother once told an Irish court that she had to sell sexual favours while living in direct provision centres to support her child.</p><p> The asylum system must uphold and vindicate the fundamental human rights of all international protection applicants, including family rights, the right to privacy, the right to education and the right to work.  The best interest of the child must prevail.  Vulnerable persons must be looked after.  LGBT+ rights, women&rsquo;s rights and the right to religious freedom must be safeguarded.  We receive so many texts from distressed asylum seekers.  One such text was from a woman who had spent about five years living in direct provision and was ostracised for having HIV.  She had no privacy to take medication, and as soon as room mates found out what the pills were for, people began gossiping about her.  Another text we received was from a queer woman who was told by the International Protection Office that she was not credible, thus her application for asylum rejected.  This means that the IPO believes she is lying about her sexual orientation and wants her to prove it.  She is not the only LGBT+ applicant to be treated in such a manner.  That dehumanising practice of assuming asylum seekers are lying must stop.  The role of the asylum system is to vindicate peoples&rsquo; right to seek asylum and to live in safety in Ireland, not to dehumanise people.  The rights of the child and the protection of children in the international protection system must be a priority of the asylum system.  Undocumented minors who turn 18 before receiving a final decision on their asylum claim must be supported to live independently and not be shipped off to direct provision centres.</p><p> Deportations are brutal and dehumanising and can have no part of an ethical and human rights-centred approach to asylum and migration.  That is why many people commit suicide in direct provision centres.  Some attempt to commit suicide because they fear that they might be deported, especially when they get letters from the Department of Justice and Equality saying their application has been rejected.  Many of the people who are taking sleeping pills in direct provision struggle to sleep for fear that the next letter in the post could be a deportation order.  We also believe that no child born in Ireland, in the asylum system or undocumented should ever be served with a deportation order.  The Minister for Justice and Equality can, should, and must introduce a scheme to regularise undocumented people in Ireland, with long-term residency for all children born in the State to non-EU parents.  That is not asking too much.  We are not asking the Minister to make them all citizens.  It is just regularisation so that people who are already living here can get on with their lives.</p><p> People seeking protection in Ireland are entitled to live an independent life with their families in accommodation that upholds the rights to privacy, dignity, and integrity of the person.  The warehousing of asylum seekers in direct provision centres throughout the country, without certainty of time for stay, amounts to effective incarceration as many asylum seekers are divorced from the social, economic and political life of the country in the same manner as prisoners in Mountjoy Prison.  Among our key recommendations is that the legal process has to be reformed.  The process of seeking asylum is first and foremost a legal process so it is essential that people receive all necessary legal advice and that the system is orientated towards vindicating people's right to seek asylum and safety.  The right to work must be immediate and unrestricted for all people seeking protection in Ireland.  At present, people who are on appeal are excluded from working.  People should be accommodated in reception for no longer than three months before moving into housing in the community.  We do not believe people should be segregated and living in centres.  They should be living in communities along with everybody else in Ireland.  Direct provision should be abolished and people seeking asylum in Ireland should have access to the same housing supports via their local authorities as is the case for others.  Full and tuition fee free access to education and training at all levels must be available to international protection applicants.  If the State keeps a person in direct provision for five years and then gives him or her a letter saying he or she can live in Ireland, where does the State expect the person to start living?  These recommendations are not insurmountable for the Government.  Uganda has more than 1 million refugees and is one of the poorest countries on earth.  We are human beings like all of you.  All we ask is that we be treated as such.  The very fact that people have to ask the Government to treat them humanely should shame all of you.</p></speech>

A model was mentioned for moving from the Department of Justice and Equality to approved housing bodies.  It was said that there was a lack of synchronicity in the strategic approach.  What would be the State oversight of an approved housing body approach?  We have difficulty with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Custom House on a lot of housing policy issues.  Where would the funding stream be delivered or what would the oversight mechanism be to deliver that synchronicity?  I agree with the witnesses.  In excess of &euro;1 billion has been spent over several years and we have nothing to show for it in terms of State spending apart from profit for private providers.  How do we deliver a very well thought-out approach?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00400"><p>We would use the existing budget, which is large.  It may be, and I would suspect, that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government would want nothing to do with this issue.  Therefore it may be necessary to take it away from the Reception and Integration Agency and from the Department of Justice and Equality and create a new, independent entity.  Alternatively, the Government might create a new body and attach it to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but ring-fence the funding so there would be no accusations or suspicion that it was taking anything away from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's resources or those of the local authorities.</p> <p>  On maintaining oversight, we believe that could be done relatively easily.  We are about to produce a piece of work around the public sector duty.  We believe the State can maintain and require of private operators of current and future direct provision centres that they embed in human rights protection via the public sector duty which is contained in the Human Rights and Equality Act.  The idea would be that these approved housing bodies are experts in housing and in providing care and assistance to vulnerable people.  We are already guaranteeing oversight as these organisations would already have a board, a strategic plan and a clear mission.  We would be embedding good quality through those mechanisms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00500"><p>That is a fair point.  It is just that when a budget is allocated to an approved housing body, it would have to come through a specific Department.  I agree that it would have to be through some agency that manages to ring-fence the funding so there would not be pull from other areas.</p> <p>  Mr. Mfaco's statement was very moving.  He has highlighted a contradiction in that people are coming from countries in which there are human rights abuses and we are replacing those abuses with our own, domestic set of difficulties where we are not vindicating human rights.  It is a profound contradiction that we need to resolve domestically.  I acknowledge that.  One issue that was raised last week is important.  Perhaps some of the witnesses can give feedback on this.  I refer to the right to work and the constitutional precedent that has been set by the Supreme Court.  Has there been any improvement or feedback in terms of people being able to work?  Will the witnesses give us any update on how things have changed since that judgment?  Is it still a difficult threshold to meet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bulelani Mfaco" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00600"><p>It is still difficult for many people who have been in direct provision for a long time.  When they introduced the labour market access permit, it was only to be issued to people who had been awaiting a first instance decision for about nine months.  That immediately excluded many people who already had decisions and were on appeal.  We know that there are people who go through an appeal for years and years.  We had one lady who went through an appeal for about eight years before she was granted refugee status.  In that time, she was unable to work although she had a legitimate claim to asylum.  They botched the initial decision at the IPO.  We have many people in that situation in direct provision who are not legally allowed to work and cannot work until they have a final decision under the current arrangements.  There are also a lot of restrictions in respect of the permit itself.  It is a piece of paper.  Ordinarily, when employers in Ireland are hiring people to work for them, especially non-EU nationals, they look for an Irish residency permit card or the old Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, card.</p><p>Asylum seekers do not have that and cannot even get a driving licence because they do not have the Irish residency permit card.  One of the recommendations we will be making to the committee is that the temporary residency card, the blue card that is issued, should be replaced because it is of no use to an asylum seeker except to inform a police or immigration officer that they have permission to stay in Ireland.  They cannot use it for work.  If one brings asylum seekers in line with other non-EU nationals resident in Ireland, one is able to immediately inform the potential employer that this person has the right to work.  They do not have to go through all the other administrative areas, such as having to submit reports.  They are told right on the front page of the permit that it is a criminal offence not to provide this report, if one is required provide a report within ten days.  That is a deterrent to any employer.  </p><p> I have personally gone through that process of having to explain to employers that the permit is renewable, but many employers do not accept that and have informed me that the permit should be valid for at least 11 months, and they will not accept it if it is valid only for six months.  People can stay in the asylum system for longer than a year waiting for an interview and for their asylum claim to be assessed.  The idea of having the permit valid for only six months does not make much sense for a person who is going to be stuck in the system in any event.  It would be better for us to have it valid for at least 12 months because we know it takes longer for the Department of Justice and Equality to make a decision. </p><p> By September 2018 the Department had issued over 1,500 permits, and only approximately 330  people were able to find work.  When people find work, they have to send their declaration to the Department of Justice and Equality.  That highlights the restrictions.  I have had the permit since 1 August 2018 and I have only worked for one hour since then.  All the employers that I have previously worked for in the Republic under different permits have not hired me because of the restrictions of the permit itself.  It is not that I do not meet their requirement, because I have had those three jobs before and I have done them well.  I have friends who would substantiate that.  It becomes very restrictive for people.  It discourages others who are already in the system who qualify for the permits.  Many people do not apply for it because they see people who have it who are not working.  There are hoops that one has to jump through as to how the permit works which have to be explained to an employer, because many employers do not know how it works.  It is different.  Everybody else goes in with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, or an Irish residency permit card or an EU passport and we do not have any of those things. </p><p> It is restrictive in that sense.  Many people will still be stuck in direct provision without this right to work and our recommendation to address that is for people to be given immediate access to the labour market when they arrive in the State because it increases the prospects of integration.  It means a person is not going to be staying idle in a direct provision centre that is in a remote area like Knockalisheen, or Mount Trenchard in Foynes, where they have no access to public transport, for example.  That is another barrier for people who want to work.  Once one has a job, it may be actually difficult to get to work if one lives in a direct provision centre that does not have any access to public transport.</p></speech>

That is a stark reminder of the ongoing, sheer and shocking level of human rights abuses in our direct provision centres.  I am slightly alarmed if our mental health services are providing a sticking plaster approach by way of sleeping tablets.  What is the experience of people living in direct provision with regard to mental health services and support?  Do our guests have any suggestions on how that can be improved?</p></speech>

The biggest problem is that no services at all are being provided to us in the centres.  In order for a person to be able to access the help that they need, one would have to attend his or her GP to receive direction to get the help that one needs.  The biggest problem with that, as we already know, is that many people coming in to seek asylum are from traumatic backgrounds and have experienced some kind of trauma.  It would be crucial and vital to have such a service at the reception centres.  The only thing that is there at the moment is one or two posters in the centre signposting a person to places like the Samaritans or to Spirasi, for which one has to get an appointment through referral from one's solicitor or from one's GP.  Often, it takes a very long time to receive an appointment to be seen by Spirasi.  That is why we find that many people tend to turn to things like sleeping tablets or alcohol. They develop a lot of addictions like gambling because they are trying to find a way to cope with living in that situation.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Khambule might give the recommendation now.</p></speech>

Suicide attempts have increased in the past 18 months.  Last year alone, there were approximately five deaths in direct provision, some of which related to the mental health of people who were on these sleeping pills.  This is not a qualified opinion but we feel that the provision of the tablets as a means of addressing the mental health issue is the wrong one.  The psychological traumas that people face in direct provision are the things that need to be addressed in a very serious way.  Otherwise we will see more deaths happening in direct provision because we are ignoring the signs that are there on mental health issues.</p> <p>  A fresh example happened a month or so ago, where a lady had attempted suicide in one of the centres in the country, where she even left a message to be sent to a manager of that centre to take care of the babies in her absence.  She had a history of mental health illness and we are not addressing that.  Instead we are punishing people for the actions that they take, without understanding what they go through.  It is a serious matter and needs to be taken seriously.  As my colleague said earlier, people arrive with traumatic experiences already.</p> <p>  The other problem that people face is that they need prescriptions to get depression pills.  The fact that some do not have access to medical cards makes it hard for them to even access those pills if they have been prescribed, because it takes time for them to get those medical cards.</p></speech>

Speaking from my personal experience, I have three children myself.  My youngest is nine years old.  Over the past few months he has been showing signs of depression, to the point that he has come and said to me that sometimes when he feels sad he feels like killing himself.</p><p>This is a nine year old saying it to me.  I am already facing personal mental health challenges but now I must face the extra burden of these children seeing me go through this and possibly experiencing their own mental health issues because of our position.  It is very important that children are not overlooked and mental health services can be focused on the children as well.</p></speech>

I followed the live discussions and comments but if one has not gone through the trauma, one will not understand.  People do not understand the events or what happens in direct provision.  I have suffered depression.  I have three kids.  I have migraines and I have almost had a stroke because of what I always face.  My kids have been bullied in school.  I have been through Tusla social services because my child was bullied at school but it was turned around to seem like my son was in the wrong.  There was a point where it seemed my kids would be taken away from me.  There was a recent incident with my daughter.  She opened someone's top in school and I tried to explain things to the teacher but she could not understand.  I have set a meeting so I can discuss this with her.  These are kids and when they are at school the teacher is the parent and when they are at home, I am the teacher; we must work hand in hand.  There was an incident that I witnessed of a woman who tried to commit suicide.  The kids also reacted.</p></speech>

I left direct provision in 2016 and it is a tough transition.  I had that first-hand experience.  We first had to look for a house and it is very hard to find one.  One must get on with one's life.  We do not know which direction we have to take.  There was a lack of support while I was in direct provision to set me up to succeed as quickly as possible in Irish society.  I did not have a problem with language but if a person has a problem with language, how could he or she stay in direct provision for five years and then move on with no support?  There is not much transition support to help people leave.  I found a place of my own and although my activities are in Dublin, I had to go all the way to Wicklow to find a place.  Fortunately, I work as well.  My life is on the positive side but it is a very hard transition.</p></speech>

We should remember that there is not much of that in the direct provision system, and the location of the direct provision centre also has an effect.  I would not really look at my experience as I had to put myself out there in an active way, so it was easier for me to integrate after direct provision.  There is a need to support people moving from direct provision but the support needs to start while people are still in direct provision.  It should happen with education and methods of coping in the community.  We cannot start building to integrate in a community if a person has lost the will to live because he or she is in direct provision.  Life must start from the first day in Ireland and not from the day the person has his or her application approved.  That is too late.</p></speech>

If the committee is to make a recommendation like that, we must figure out what will replace it.  We have an obligation to provide shelter and comfort to people coming to the country seeking protection.  Is this a housing problem?  Is there a concern because we cannot really sort out the housing problem in the country at present?</p></speech>

For 20 years we have considered accommodating asylum seekers as something that should be dealt with via the Department of Justice and Equality through a very narrow remit using private providers and old buildings on the outskirts of towns.  That should change.  We must provide accommodation for people who come here and the direct provision population is approximately 6,500.  If we take away the number of people who cannot leave, backlogs and delays in decision making, it might be possible to get that down to something like 5,500.  It is not a large number of people.</p><p>Using the existing budget and engaging better providers to provide that accommodation would form the building blocks of a new system.  I implore the committee to have a bottom line of own-door accommodation, the right to cook for oneself and one's family and a broader right to work and live in a community.  These are the red lines we want to see.  We need to design a procurement process that will allow housing bodies or other new entities to provide that accommodation.  The current procurement process on eTenders is timetabled to go through the different regions of Ireland in 2019.  A crucial problem with this is that it requires a provider to have a property with 50 beds or more.  Every housing body with which we have worked and our colleagues from MASI who have lived in the system will say putting 50 people in one building will be problematic sooner or later.  We need to redesign the procurement process.</p></speech>

It is vital that we hear not only from organisations working with asylum seekers and refugees but also from people with direct experience of the direct provision system.  People seeking asylum in Ireland do so with international protection.  Sometimes it is lost in the debate that they are here because they are fleeing persecution, conflict and oppression.  I presume that applies to all of the persons present from MASI.</p> <p>  I will not put anybody on the spot because obviously I appreciate it could be traumatic.  Does any of the delegates wish to share his or her reasons for seeking asylum?  If not, does anybody have a story he or she would like to tell of a friend or somebody he or she knows in the direct provision system in order to give the committee an insight into the reasons people flee and are in Ireland seeking international protection?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bulelani Mfaco" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#H00800"><p>I applied for asylum in 2017.  I am from Cape Town, South Africa.  Most people's reaction when they hear this is that there is no war in South Africa.  They expect the person seeking asylum to come from a war-torn country.  That is the general misconception.  International law has held that one must have a well founded fear of persecution that may arise, for instance, from politics, religion, race or membership of a particular cultural group.  I am a queer man, a gay man.  In South Africa it becomes very difficult to live openly as a gay man, particularly if he happens to be from a very poor background or a township.  Rich people experience the same persecution, but black people in townships experience it much more.  There are more targeted killings of queer people.  I had stones thrown at me and have been spat at.  I have been called all sorts of name.  At one point I was held in a shopping centre and humiliated by security guards.  They picked me up and made fun of the way I was dressed.  I used to be very effeminate; apparently, I am now manly.  Gay people go through all of the trauma of having stones thrown at them just because of their sexual orientation.  In January 2017 in South Africa I heard about what had happened to a lesbian woman who lived down the road from where I lived.  She was the third person on our street who was openly gay; the other was another man.  She was abducted and shot dead for no other reason than her sexual orientation.  At that point I decided that that was it; I was not going to wait and hang around to be the next one to be killed.</p> <p>  When I got to Ireland, I was placed immediately in Balseskin, just like everybody else who was seeking asylum.  We stayed there for about five weeks.  What happened in the very first week frightened me because for the first time in my life I was not allowed to work.  I had been working since I was ten years old.  I used to help my grandmother to sell fruit at the taxi rank back home.  Now I am told that I cannot work.  What do I do?  I sleep, wake up, shower and eat every single day.  Days become weeks, weeks become months and months become years.  It is very disheartening.  One begins to lose hope the place where one has sought sanctuary is actually the compassionate place one thought it was.</p> <p>  I was moved from Balseskin to Knockalisheen where I was placed in a room with a homophobic man.  When he heard that I was gay, he said, "I don't like shit in here."  I am sorry for my language, but that was how he said it.  We still had to share a bedroom and live together.  In the first few weeks in Knockalisheen, when I was queuing in the canteen, I heard homophobic slurs from other asylum seekers from the same region, the same homophobic slurs I had heard in South Africa.  That created a lot of anxiety that I might be killed.  Many people who are murdered because of their sexual orientation will first hear those slurs before they being attacked.  When I told the international protection officer in Knockalisheen, they could not be bothered to do anything about it.  One then begins to lose a sense of hope.  I did not trust anybody and still do not trust anybody in Knockalisheen.  When having food in the canteen, I often sit on my own with my back against the wall.  I will not sit there with somebody behind me because I do not feel comfortable being in that space.  However, I have no choice because I have to queue for food in the canteen.  It becomes very difficult to go through life when one has live in such a situation and I do not control when I will be out of it.  I had my first interview only this year to assess my claim for asylum.  For all of that time I was sitting there and my file was gathering dust in the international protection office.  I was finally called for an interview in March, but I am still waiting for a recommendation.  I am told that if it is positive, I might even have to wait longer for a declaration from the Minister in order that I can get out and live independently. </p> <p>  We are subjected to petty bureaucratic processes in direct provision centres.  Recently a notice was put up indicating that we were required to produce an ID card if we needed to receive our post.  I have been in Knockalisheen for over a year and receiving my post without having to produce an ID card.  No asylum seeker in this country is issued with an ID card.  No Irish person has an ID card, but I am being asked to produce one.  They use the permission to stay in Ireland card as an ID card.  That card was issued for the purposes of showing a police officer or an immigration officer that I had permission to stay in Ireland.</p><p>Yet, every single day that I need an ironing board or need to check my post or get a tissue or any petty everyday thing that people use in their houses when they are living their lives, I have to produce all kinds of things.  It becomes disheartening.</p><p> One of the issues is privacy because we do not have much privacy.  We may be forced to share a bedroom with someone who may happen to be homophobic.  For a person who is gay and seeking asylum because he has been persecuted on the basis of his sexual orientation to be subjected to the same kind of treatment is cruel from the State side.  We have staff members in direct provision who undermine the right to privacy for individuals too.  I was sitting in my room one day and someone knocked once and then opened the door.  It was a lady who worked Knockalisheen direct provision centre.  She knocked once and opened the door.  I was sitting in my room getting ready to have a shower, so I only had my underwear on.  The next time it happened because a manager in Knockalisheen walked into the male showers in the men's block.  We have a block specifically for single men.  There are several of them.  She opened the door to the male showers.  She looked and then closed the door and said she was sorry as she walked away.  It was the men's shower - what did she expect to see?  Privacy means nothing to them.  We have had similar incidents in Hatch Hall accommodation centre, where a staff member and another resident have walked into a room where a person was naked.  We have heard the experiences of children who feel unsafe because of the creepy way that men look at them.  It has been reported in the news that direct provision centres have women who feel unsafe sharing intimate living spaces with other people.  Some of the women would have suffered torture or sexual violence.  For such a person to be placed in a position where she feels unsafe again is very cruel.  It shows we are not really responding to the person's call.  When a person comes here and declares that he is seeking protection, he needs protection.  To place such a person in a position where he feels unsafe is very cruel on the part of the Government.</p><p> We have had these experiences along with many other lived experiences from people who live in direct provision.  I am not the only gay person who has experienced homophobia in direct provision; there are many others.  It is apparent across the board.  One woman locked herself in the gym in Knockalisheen because she felt unsafe sharing the gym with men.  Now, they have decided to reserve certain hours for women only in the gym.  The problem is that the woman will still have to share other intimate spaces with everyone else.  That minor tweak does not really change the situation when it comes to personal safety very much, especially for people who have had traumatic experiences.</p></speech>

It is not a story.  When I hear the word "story" it is like a tale that is simply being told.  These are serious cases.  We have been through a great deal.  I will talk in a neutral matter and not specifically about my case.  The reason women are fleeing Zimbabwe is child marriages.  The issue is still active, as I speak.  Committee members can check the BBC interviews in which young girls are being interviewed about why they had a child when they were 13 or 14 years of age.  These girls come here and tell their case.  The officers tell the girls they are lying.  How can they say I am lying when they were not there when the incident happened?  I am telling my case because it happened to me.  I am seeking protection and the officers are telling me that I am lying.  It upsets me because I have been trying to prove to the officers for the past three and a half years that I have been through this.  Then, at the end of the day, the officers are telling me that I can go back home and that I cannot live here.  They say a certain part of my country is okay and that it is better for me to live there and that I cannot live in another country.  That is my experience.</p></speech>

It comes in the form of sexual exploitation and in terms of work.  When people are not allowed to work legally, it creates and openness for whoever wants to exploit them.  We have had people coming to Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland who have worked from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and were only paid between &euro;25 and &euro;27.  It becomes very difficult for such a person to live a normal life because they do not have a sense of what their rights are once they are given permission to live.  They might continue with that exploitation.</p> <p>  We also have people in direct provision being offered money for sex because people know that there were people getting paid &euro;21.60 per week.  The figure is now &euro;38.80.  People have to live.  I have been offered money for sex.  There are children and women who have been offered money for sex.  We do not know the extent to which the exploitation is happening but we have had reports from our work and from other people.  RT&Eacute; produced a programme called "Taken Down".  The producers were doing research because the show is set in a direct provision centre.  One of the things they came across was that people were being offered money for sex.  People know where the direct provision centres are.  People know that there are people there who are vulnerable.  Then we have sex pests coming around trying to exploit people.  That needs to be highlighted as well.</p></speech>

I am grateful to them for sharing the reasons they sought asylum.  I think it is important because sometimes the debate around this issue neglects the fact that people have come here after fleeing persecution, oppression and violence.  It can be forgotten that people have suffered from trauma that most of us present can only begin to imagine.  Yet, the system is retraumatising people by putting them through what I believe to be a traumatic system.  I agree with Mr. Henderson and the representatives from Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland that this system is failing the human rights of people and it needs to be replaced.</p> <p>  I want to put the question to the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland and the Irish Refugee Council representatives.  Last week Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon said to us that in his view, while it was far from perfect, the direct provision system had improved.  I want to get the response of the representatives to that.  Can they tell us about their experience of the Garda National Immigration Bureau and how that office conducts itself as well as the Garda generally?  I am putting that question to both groups.  I will have a final set of questions following that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#J00600"><p>As I said in our opening address, we have a real concern that the system has worsened.  The primary manifestation is emergency centres.  There are a little over 500 people in emergency centres.  These are hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation that the State has procured or contracted to provide accommodation on an emergency basis.  We have used the phrase "off-grid".  We do not really know where those centres are located.  Fundamentally, the people in those centres, hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation do not know where the external services that could help them are located.</p> <p>  There have also been issues with people not going through Balseskin reception centre.  If that were to happen, the people affected should have received a medical card.  People have not been getting medical cards.  They have been located in areas where the general practitioner list may be full.  A significant number of children are in emergency centres - 88 children.  Like children in homeless bed and breakfast accommodation, they have struggled to get education.  Indeed, I do not know if they get any education at all.</p><p>We are gravely concerned about that situation.  </p><p> On wider improvements, as we understand it, there has been a narrowing of the gap between capacity and occupancy rates in the direct provision system in the last two years.  There are fewer beds and centres are now simply overcrowded.  That has meant that reforms envisaged by the Government arising from the McMahon process have had to be curtailed or limited to an extent.  </p><p> On the third point, we refer the Deputy to Nasc, an NGO in Cork, from which the committee will be hearing in June.  It has produced an important report which analyses the extent to which the recommendations have been implemented.  The picture is less clear than what may have been suggested by the Government.  The emergency centres are of real concern and we do not see this changing over the course of 2019 owing to the numbers within and existing capacity within the traditional direct provision estate being full.</p></speech>

For example, regulation 3 requires that people be given information when they first arrive on their rights and entitlements and organisations that may be able to help them.  In our experience that is not happening.  People are arriving in, particularly from the emergency centres, who do not know where they should be going, how to make an application for asylum, how to get legal aid, how to apply for a PPS number or a GP card, or how to gain basic access to medicines and prescriptions.  They are arriving and it is simply a case of fire-fighting.  This means that the benefits of reforms which may have been introduced or which are under way following the McMahon report are not being felt in practice.  There is a fire-fighting exercise under way in the Department of Justice and Equality, alongside which we need to see a commitment being given to medium to long-term reform of the system overall because conditions are just unacceptable.</p></speech>

It is nice to see him here.  During the many years I spent in Cork he was always making himself known in the direct provision centre.  Everyone there knows of his work, which we appreciate.  I remember that he arranged for lines to be drawn around a bus stop opposite the centre as there was a danger to the children.</p> <p>  A comment was made to the effect that the situation had improved.  From MASI's day-to-day interaction with the people involved, things have got worse.  I repeat things have got worse.  The situation in which the Government finds itself in having to provide emergency accommodation should not have arisen.  There should have been a better plan to allow us to respond to the large increase in the number of people coming here.  There has been an immigration crisis since 2015.  If we are now only thinking about what we need to do, it shows that we did not think hard enough before.  </p> <p>  Some of the things that came from the work of the working group include the single application procedure and the introduction of the International Protection Act 2015.  We were told that it would cut all waiting periods to nine months.  We were also told that the system would be capable of getting through everything within nine months.  That meant that one would be out of the direct provision system within nine months, but that did not happen.  There is an 18-month backlog of people who have not been called for their first interview.  There are people who have not been a chance to present their case for refugee status.  Some do not even know when they will be called, which is a problem.  </p> <p>  To give an indication of how bad things are, I can point to two centres where action was taken.  Two months ago in west Cork the residents had had enough and demonstrated.  There was also a demonstration in Mosney.  That indicates that there is something wrong.  What is also alarming is the squeezing of residents by local management to discourage people from speaking up or making complaints.  I know that some complaints have been recorded by the Ombudsman, but the numbers are low.  That is because people are being told that if they complain, their cases and applications will be affected.  Fear is stopping them from saying what is not happening.  </p> <p>  Management in some centres has so much power that it can issue notices that disrupt everybody.  I will give two examples.  In one of the centres a notice was issued indicating that people were not allowed to use their phones, laptops or iPads at certain times.  For no reason, a curfew was imposed which prevented people from communicating with others.  Some people are studying and use their time to study.  Others have families in different time zones.  How can someone wake up and have it in mind to impose such a rule?  In another centre residents have what we call counter fridges.  Sometimes fridges are donated to people with kids or who need to store medications in order that they will be able to store them in their room.  The centre in question made a rule that residents were no longer allowed to have fridges in their room.  Management actually confiscated fridges from people's rooms, usually when they were not there. It just came into someone's room and ransacked it. A lady might have come back to her room to find that her wardrobe had been turned upside down.  That is the kind of life people are living in direct provision centres.  That is a big problem because things will explode.  When people are treated in that way, the time will come when they will say enough is enough.  We can avoid this just by being compassionate and dealing with people as human beings.  That is all that we request, even from the people who are there.  Hotel managers have no reason to treat people who have suffered torture in that way.  They are only interested in the bottom line.  Some have even gone to the extent of having residents in a centre volunteer because of downsizing.  Why are they doing this?  They are maximising profits.  They want to replace people who are salaried with others who are vulnerable and will agree to anything.  They want to use them to provide the services and do work that is supposed to be done by the State.  That needs to stop.  The issue needs to be highlighted in order that people can be held accountable.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB.  Our experience of the GNIB relates mainly to the length of time it takes people to receive their GNIB card.</p><p>Once someone has been granted the right to stay in Ireland, be that on a refugee, subsidiary protection or leave-to-remain basis, the GNIB is key.  Without the GNIB card, one has nowhere to go.  In our interactions with the GNIB, delays are a problem.  We do not really have much contact with the rest of the Garda unless officers are called because of a complaint against someone in the centre.</p></speech>

It was recommended that there should be a single application process, but I am not sure if it is being applied.  I had to apply again for the single procedure process in 2016.  I received a refusal, which I then had to appeal.  That was refused and I had to go to the High Court, which said that my case should be heard again.  I went for my interview two months ago, but I am still waiting.  My experience there was dehumanising.  They stopped looking at why I had come here to seek asylum and went into my personal life.  When I explained something, they told me that I was lying.  It was dehumanising.</p> <p>  If I am going for an interview, the tribunal members should be more knowledgeable about what is going on in my country.  They kept pressurising me and saying that I had been a refugee in Swaziland because I had a travel document.  That is how it is in our country, though.  We have travel documents that we use in the southern part of Africa.  There is more to be done in respect of the tribunal members.</p> <p>  It is mental torture for someone to keep on repeating what he or she has gone through.  When someone asks me why I am in the country, I do not say anymore because I am tired of crying.  I cannot keep on saying what happened to me.  For how long would I be saying that?  I need to move on.  It is dehumanising to make someone sit there and do that.  This is not a story - it is something that we are going through.  A mother tells people what her children are going through, but the response is "You are lying."  How can one lie about one's children suffering?</p></speech>

I promise I will not take long.  I will touch specifically on many issues that have been mentioned, particularly single mothers and children in direct provision.  After the Ombudsman for Children stated that such environments were not fit for human habitation, let alone raising children, I do not understand how mothers with children are still in direct provision.  I do not believe that the Department of Justice and Equality or the IPO considers asylum seeker mothers and children as human beings.</p> <p>  Men are giving children creepy looks in small passages that actually serve as the children's playgrounds.  Naked men walk down those passages to the bathrooms.  Let there be sense.  Let this become a normal human situation.  I am a father.  My youngest is 21 years old.  I have to walk in that passage with my towel tied around my waist to go to the bathroom.  There are children, from three years old to 16 years old, boys and girls, playing there because there are no playgrounds.  The system is just not fit for any purpose.  When we say that direct provision should be abolished, we do so because it is not an environment for human beings.  I could invite committee members to spend a night with me in direct provision in Viking House where I sleep with three other people in the same room.  I have measured it - it is 4 m by 4 m.  There are four of us in the room.  Within that area, we have our wardrobes and a bathroom.  We are all men.</p> <p>  There is no area in the centre where, if members came to visit me, they could sit to talk to or greet me.  That is not human living.  The jailer-prisoner attitude that prevails is not for human beings either.  When I go to sleep in Viking House tonight, I will tell people that I am going home, but is it really home?  When I get there, anyone who wants to see me has to sign in.  If that person is lucky, someone will call me so that we can go outside.  There is no reception or anywhere people can just sit down and talk.  I do not know what training RIA has put in place for the people who work in the centres, but they feel that they are jailers and we are prisoners and that they are doing favours for us.  Kitchen staff throw people plates of food.  Sometimes those plates fall and people laugh.  This is happening to adults, who are in a queue.  They will then beg for food.  If someone happens to miss a meal, he or she knows that it will stay missed even though the food will not have been served.  Obviously, if I miss my meal, there will be leftovers, but they cannot be served to me because I have returned outside the meal time.  That is not human living.  I have to wake up at 8 a.m. to ensure that I have breakfast before 9 a.m. because if I get there at 9.02 a.m., the door will be closed.  I call this place "home", and I have been there for the past three years, but I still cannot get that meal.</p> <p>  I attend school in Dublin.  I understand the problem with accommodation here.  I live in Waterford and travel to UCD and back.  That is six hours on the road every day.  I am a full-time student.  I cannot get a packed lunch from the centre.  I must use the &euro;38 that I get to pay for the travel and food that I need to go to school.  That is well and good with the RIA and the IPO, but it is not natural.  A country of Ireland's status should not be doing this to people.</p><p>I do not believe it should be done.</p><p> We have spoken about improvements.  I disagree completely with the suggestion made by Mr. Justice McMahon a week ago that this is improving.  I wonder how he considers it to be improving when people are running direct provision for profit and to become even more rich.  Can that still be called an improvement?  The centres that have moved slightly by providing cooking facilities have also set up shops that are still owned by these people.  Why does this segregation exist?  When it was decided to stop requiring residents to queue for food, why was it decided to require them to buy their food in a shop owned by these people if they want to cook in the kitchen?  There is a Centra shop at the gate.  I could buy what I want there if it were not for the voucher system.  We are told to report what we want to buy so that the authorities can order what they need.  We have to tell them in advance what we want to buy the following week when we bring in our vouchers.  That is not on.  That is not life.</p><p> I would like to speak about education and work permits.  I suggest that giving people the right to work has actually put them in the negative, rather than giving them better opportunities.  If one wants to get schooling or training or do anything, one is required to have a work permit.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is responsible for this area, will not approve any training if one does not have a work permit.  Unfortunately, the people who do not have work permits are in the majority.  They tend to be the people who have been in the system for the longest periods of time.  This means they are being deprived of the opportunity to study.  I am studying at third level.  When one is in direct provision, one is not supposed to be studying above level 4.  Monaghan Institute will not take one for training into any course above level 4, even if one is prepared to pay international fees.  I do not see that as an improvement - I see it as getting worse.</p><p> I will conclude by speaking about the amount of time that people who have received refugee status have to wait.  Two gentlemen in direct provision in Tramore who have been given refugee status have been waiting eight months for the Minister to send them a letter on moving out of direct provision, which will enable them to go to the GNIB to get a GNIB card.  They have been told that their refugee applications have been approved, but they have had to wait eight months for this letter.  It is really not on.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibanda referred to the suggestion that being given the right to cook represents an improvement.  A food hall has been introduced in my centre.  When I go there, I mostly get water and fruit because I cannot eat the food that is there.  I wonder whether it would be possible for people to get vouchers to go into shops to get what they want.  The food is being bought in SuperValu.  If I were given a voucher, I could avail of the wider selection in that shop to get what I want.  We are told we can write down what we want, but because I am a difficult person, they do not bring what I want regardless of what I write down.  I understand that not too many people might want to buy what I look for.  I ask the committee to consider my suggestion that we be given vouchers that we can use ourselves.  In the case of people who spend all their time in direct provision, the vouchers are not sufficient for the whole week.  We are given 45 points to use for seven days.  If we want to get a meal, such as a lunch, it costs four points.  If we used ten points a day, we would need 70 points a week, but we get just 45 points.  Toiletries are not included.  We still have to get toiletries and all that by ourselves.  I do not know how the points are weighted.  Many parents have told me that the points they get do not suffice for the entire week.  Children are living on bread.  When we talk about improvement, all I can say is that it has not really happened.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their helpful and thought-provoking contributions.  I had intended to ask a number of questions, but I will let them be for now because some of the witnesses' observations have clarified matters.  I agree that direct provision is not fit for purpose.  It is not a fit place to raise children.  It is not a fit place for anyone to live.  During previous discussions, comparisons have been made with institutions of the past.  Some people have debated that.  As far as I am concerned, this institutionalisation of people is a form of warehousing.  This system reflects very poorly on Ireland as a country and needs to be replaced.  It is clear from what has been said here today that far too often, the system is unfortunately adversarial.  I am not sure it needs to be like that.  I will leave it at that.  I have no further questions.  I thank the representatives of MASI and the Irish Refugee Council.  I hope we can produce a report at the end of this process that does justice to these hearings.</p></speech>

My head is spinning.  I am blown away by the reality of the situation.  I knew it was bad, but I was not aware of how horrendous it is.  It is important that I repeat something Mr. Mfaco said at the end of his presentation.  I hope it is okay for me to do so.  He stated:</p><blockquote>We are human beings like all of you.  All we ask is that we be treated as such.  The very fact that people have to ask the Government to treat them humanely should shame all of you.</blockquote> <p>I feel absolutely devastated by what I have heard.  I am ashamed that I live in this country.  I am ashamed by the way our Government is treating people in direct provision.  There is no representation here today from our Government.  It is probably too hard from them to hear what the reality is.  We do not know.  I am grateful that the witnesses are here today because we need to hear the reality of what it is like to live in direct provision.  I am shaking with anger.  I am saddened to hear that in this day and age, people are going through the experiences that have been described.  When we talk about the Magdalen laundries, we say it was terrible and ask how these things happened.  It is going on here today.  That is the reality.  When I spoke last week to a man from the US, he thanked God that the abuses which happened years ago in the Magdalen laundries have come to an end, but I told him that abuses are continuing.  I informed him about the case of a woman who was living in a direct provision centre in the midlands.  When she was nine months' pregnant she went into labour, but she had no money to get a taxi so she had to walk to the hospital.  That is what is going on in our country today.  The man to whom I was speaking burst into tears and cried when he heard this story.  What the hell is going on?</p><p>In this country, we do not treat animals in the way people in direct provision are being treated.</p><p> I have taken down many notes here and I want to touch on a couple of points, if that is all right with the Chairman.  A story was told here last week on the right to work and it had an impact on me.  A man in direct provision, with his wife and three children, was asked by one of those who presented here last week about how he was getting on with his legal status.  He replied that he did not care about his legal status at this time and that all he wants to do is work.  He stated that all he wants to do is get up in the morning, go out to work, come back and tell his children that he went to work that day.  Moreover, he said that he does not even want to get paid for it.  He just asked to be given his dignity.  Deputies Jack Chambers and O'Callaghan touched on it today but that is why we need to see an effective right to work.  It is vital.</p><p> There is no doubt but that we need to get rid of direct provision.  This report is so important.  My recommendation would be to get rid of direct provision and treat people with respect and dignity.  I cannot even imagine what it is like for those children.  These people are coming from trauma.  I work in an area of trauma in a different field but I know what trauma does to people.  I see its impact.  As for them coming here from a traumatic situation where people are being tortured, sexually violated and sexually abused, only to be treated with such disrespect and absence of dignity, I do not know to where our humanity has gone.</p><p> I am sorry, but I need to be able to say this because what I am hearing today is so upsetting.  Even though I was aware it was bad, I did not realise it was so bad.  One must present a card for an ironing board.  The point that private companies operate these centres frustrates me.  Last year, we paid more than &euro;70 million to private firms operating direct provision centres and yet, where one wants to cook one's own food, which is a basic human right, one has to go to a shop to buy it.</p><p> I seek the witnesses' thoughts on the integration piece.  I apologise, as I am upset by hearing everything, but I wish to hear their thoughts on efforts to help asylum seekers integrate into Irish society.  There are a few points I wrote down; I hope this is okay.  First, although we have an official Government migrant integration strategy, asylum seekers are excluded from it.  They simply are not mentioned.  This suggests that while the State will actively try to help integrate migrant EU workers, for example, I gather I would be right in stating this is not the case with asylum seekers.</p><p> Second, from reading about the design of the direct provision system, it seems that there is almost a fear of genuine integration running through the heart of the rules.  The logic seems to be that if we let people put down roots to work and embed into the committee, it would be harder were their application to be ultimately refused and, therefore, many in the centres live at a physical and social distance from local communities.  Can we hear about those experiences?</p><p> I also want to hear about their experiences on the right to work because that is really important, and a little more on the importance of having cooking facilities, which is a basic human right.  Many direct provision centres still do not have those facilities.</p></speech>

There are several families living there and there are a lot of single men.  Four out of the six blocks are occupied by single men.  There are single ladies as well and many of them find it difficult to share communal spaces with men.  When Donnah must go and queue in the canteen with children to get food, we queue with the children.  One day one child went in to ask for a doughnut and was told that they had given him one already.  The child wanted another doughnut.  It is just a doughnut.  Sometimes people do not even take those doughnuts and they serve them the following day, but they did not give it to the child.  It is a child.  It becomes difficult for parents.  Donnah is a parent.  I am sure she will speak about the difficulties parenting in direct provision.</p> <p>  From an integration point of view, the Reception and Integration Agency forgets what "Integration" in its name means.  I do not think the people there even know that the word is in the agency's name because all they do is receive people.  They take people's forms.  What they give a person when he or she arrives in a direct provision centre is the house rules.  They will tell a person when his or her meal times are.  These varies from centre to centre.  One will be told in the morning one will have breakfast, in the afternoon one will have lunch, and the time in the evening one will have dinner.  In most of the centres where there are no cooking facilities, one is also told what to eat and when to eat it.  One does not get to decide what to eat.</p> <p>  The strangest aspect for many people is that one goes into the centre and sees people eating and enjoying their food.  Then one finds a friend sitting and asking, "How on earth are they enjoying this?  This is terrible.", because tastes vary.  We do not all like the same food.  For example, we do not all like the same spices.  When one walks into a canteen and smells the same spices, it almost smells the same every day.  It is a canteen.  If one goes into a hospital canteen or a prison canteen, it will have its own smell.  When one lives in a direct provision centre, one recognises that every single day.  When I leave here, I will go back to Knockalisheen.  The moment I see the sign "Knockalisheen", I will be dreading it because I know the experience of having to live through waking up in the morning, a shower, going to eat and having no sense of purpose.</p> <p>  Meaning in life is lost when one is not allowed to work.  One sees people coming in to do their work.  Irish people who work in direct provision centres go in and report for duty every morning and one is reminded every day that one is not allowed to work.  They are living life and one gets to sit and watch people live their lives.  It is even worse in centres that are in the centre of cities.  For example, those who live in the direct provision in Limerick city centre must watch people go about their daily lives and they are reminded every day that they are not allowed to go and do ordinary things that people do every day.</p> <p>  It becomes difficult to talk about integration when one is warehoused in a direct provision centre, such as Knockalisheen, where one has not access to public transport and one cannot go anywhere.  Where one is given &euro;38 a week without public transport, how will one socialise?  What kind of social life will one live?  As humans, we are social beings.  If any Deputy or Senator in the room has a dog, he or she will know that one needs to take a dog out for walks, etc.  If one only kept a dog in one room and gave it shelter and food, that dog would not be satisfied with life.  In fact, it would be cruel not to take the dog out for a walk and let it do what dogs do, but we allow that to happen to people in the asylum system, to take away all the things that make us human, that is, all that human beings do.  For instance, one cannot work.  Since the beginning of time, if one studies the history of mankind, one will know that human beings have always worked to provide for themselves, for their loved ones and to improve the human experience on earth.  Here, however, one takes a person, because he or she applied for asylum, and says that person is not allowed to work.  Then it becomes difficult for the person to integrate into the community while he or she is in direct provision.</p> <p>  One cannot speak to me about integration while I am still segregated.  I am using a segregated bus.  When we get off the bus in Limerick city centre, we see all these brown people.  One actually sees Irish people staring at us, as if to ask, "Where did this bus come from?  Look at those brown people."  They do not look like the committee members.  They look different.  It only hurts them.  Everybody knows the bus is from a direct provision centre.  When the bus shows up in a school, some of the schoolchildren are ashamed that their friends might know where they live but everybody knows that school bus will take them to a direct provision centre.</p> <p>  Every Thursday, we get a cheque from social welfare.</p><p>To claim that &euro;38 per week allowance, one queues at the post office and produces one's PPSN card and cheque.  Everybody in the queue in that post office then knows that one lives in a direct provision centre.  It is written on the cheque receipt itself that it is a direct provision allowance.  One is constantly reminded how bad one's life is and that one is not considered part of Irish society.  One is divorced from social life.  One cannot really socialise on &euro;38.80 while living in Mount Trenchard.</p><p> There is no public transport in Knockalisheen or other direct provision centres.  I had a hospital appointment, for example, which was at 9 a.m.  I explained that to the community social welfare officer at Knockalisheen and asked if a supplementary allowance could be paid to cover travel.  It was outside the normal bus schedule at Knockalisheen where there are three services a day.  The first leaves at 10 a.m., the next is at 1 p.m. and the last is at 5 p.m.  If one misses that, one is stuffed because one must then walk for over an hour.  I needed to get to the hospital at 9 a.m.  The officer said regional travel was not covered.  The regional hospital is approximately 9 km from Knockalisheen.  I had to Google that when I was wondering how to get there.  I had to sit and argue with her over why I needed assistance to get to the hospital.  I needed to go to hospital and see a doctor yet she simply said "We do not cover regional travel".  It is dehumanising for a person to have to explain a very basic need for medical assistance.  One needs to get to a hospital.  It is almost as if they want us to get on our knees and beg for these things.</p><p> If I was not in a direct provision centre, I would have provided for my own medical expenses.  The Department of Justice and Equality knows that.  Where I come from, I worked and was studying and was able to provide for these very basic things.  Now, however, we have to go and argue with bureaucrats and managers in the centre over the basic everyday things that people go through.  It became very difficult for me to sit there and look at her to say "I have to get to a hospital".  In the end, she said they would call a taxi.  I was checking the metre.  She stopped herself before suggesting I should walk there.  At 9 km, I would probably have had to leave at 6 a.m.  It is dehumanising for me to have to go through the process of explaining the need.  It is self-explanatory that I have to get to hospital and receive the treatment I need.  When that happened, I felt discouraged.  It becomes very difficult to go through the same process again with the welfare officer.  If I have another appointment, I will still have to go to see her.  When the RIA says it is providing X or Y, it can tick a box.  It says it has done this and that and that one is entitled to a medical card.  While I have a medical card, I cannot put it under my feet and fly to the hospital.</p><p> That basic things are not there for people makes it very difficult to even hear the word "integration".  It sickens me to hear it even from NGOs who come to direct provision centres and say they want to help integrate people.  It is not helping to integrate a person if that person goes back at the end of the day to sleep in a direct provision centre.  That alone should tell one that they are segregated from the communities in which those who say that live themselves.  Residents do not live among communities, they live among people like themselves.  That is where the fundamental problem is.  We cannot begin to talk about integration while we still have direct provision.  One cannot talk about integrating asylum seekers when a person can be removed from the State at any point.  There is no integration there.  If one wants to integrate people, one integrates them into the social life of the country so that they can socialise and one integrates them into political life.  We have seen people run for election.  One integrates them into the economic life of the country so that they can work and become productive and contributing members of society, thereby ending the profiteering.  I talk a lot but before I stop I refer to one direct provision centre in Cork which had three bunk beds in one tiny room.  There were six asylum seekers in that tiny room.  That tiny room earns the company &euro;6,300 per month.  No one looking for a house to rent in Ireland would have to pay that much for a room.  We allow it to happen here because it is happening to people who are not from here.  It is happening to asylum seekers because the view is that they should be grateful that they are here and that they are given a bed and food.  That is what we are told.</p><p> We are called welfare scroungers and in the recent election campaign we were called freeloaders.  No asylum seeker has ever asked the Government for a plate of food.  No one arrives at Dublin Airport and says "I would like to have food please".  I am told I am being provided with food and a bed, but I never asked for any of that.  I asked for protection.  It becomes very difficult to even begin to talk about integration for us when we have been warehoused in direct provision centres without access to very basic everyday things and are being treated inhumanely by managers who can waltz into one's room without any consideration for one's privacy and without considering that people have suffered traumatic experiences.  The State is warehousing vulnerable people with children, including women who feel unsafe in direct provision centres.  We have had reports of sexual violence from AkiDwA and of the experiences of women feeling unsafe in direct provision centres.  I said in response to a member earlier that people come here with fear already.  When one puts them in a direct provision centre where they will experience the same fear, that alone tells one the system is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Donnah Vuma" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#O00200"><p>I find it shocking that people have said there have been improvements or that the recommendations have been implemented when people continue to live in a state of forced poverty.  One of my biggest issues with the working group report is that no one came here looking for comfort, as Mr. Mfaco said.  We are not looking to be comfortable in direct provision.  We do not want the direct provision system reformed or made comfortable.  Many of us came here to seek protection.  We did not unpack our experiences, skills or expertise in the countries we left.  We came here with them.  That means we are able to work.  We are capable and qualified to do so.  All we want is to be allowed to work so that we can provide for our families.  As I have already mentioned, I am a mother of three.  Unfortunately, I have been living in this system for five years and it was only yesterday that I received a decision on my case.  It is finally out of the High Court to which I appealed the decision that was made on my original application for refugee status.  It is still unclear what is happening there because I have no contact with my solicitor.  I have not been updated as to what it means that the case was successful in the High Court.  That is a major problem which many of us face.  We do not have proper legal advice.  While legal aid is available in principle, one may only get to see one's solicitor once on the day before an interview.</p> <p>  It is a great challenge to raise a children in direct provision on an allowance, which used to be just &euro;19.10.  I cannot begin to explain to the committee the challenge of having to save money from a &euro;19 payment to meet the expenses associated with raising children.  My eldest child is in her third year of secondary school but I take the committee back two years to when she started in first year.  The initial cost of starting school was approximately &euro;900.  I had no idea where that &euro;900 was going to come from when I was on an allowance of &euro;19.10.  To try to meet that &euro;900 expense, let alone the expenses for my two other children, I had to save money from that &euro;19.10 to supplement the &euro;150 back-to-school payment the State gives everyone.  My greatest problem with that is the limitations it imposes on the development of children.  They cannot participate in extracurricular activities.  Since my children have been in the school system here, they have never been able to take part in extracurricular activities.</p><p>I would not be able to pay for my children to do so in any case out of the &euro;38.80 allowance to which I am restricted because I do not have the right to work.</p><p> The same issue arises for children in secondary school.  As an example, my daughter will be going into transition year in September, which includes a school trip next January with an option to go either on an exchange programme to the United States or to Austria on a ski trip.  This is a trip in which everybody in her class is partaking.  She knows she has a passport because we got it when we came to Ireland, although we had to give up those documents at our point of arrival when we sought asylum.  How do I go about explaining to my child that she cannot take part in an activity that might have a huge impact on the rest of her life and in which all her peers will be able to participate?  This is one of the restrictions and barriers we face as parents.  It is only a miracle that will allow my child to go on the trip given that it costs &euro;960.  While I do not have the right to work, how am I supposed to be able to meet that type of expense?</p><p> I am taking the opportunity to highlight the most serious issues, but I also want to give the committee examples of the simple oppression we face in the centres on a daily basis.  I had a recent incident where I needed an extra roll of tissue.  We are given basic toiletries, including tissue, toothpaste and shower gel, at our centre in Knockalisheen, but it happened on this day that we ran out of tissue.  As embarrassing and humiliating as it is to have say this at the committee, I was in the bathroom when I realised there was no tissue.  I called my 12 year old daughter and asked her to run down to reception to get a new roll.  She did so and was mocked by the two security staff members on duty who told her to go back and get her mother to come out of the bathroom and fetch the tissue herself.  Apparently the manager had told them they were not allowed to give tissue to children.  What is wrong with giving a toilet roll to a 12 year old?</p><p> Another incident I wish to highlight is one of which members may already be aware.  My son was sick one night and needed a simple slice of bread and some milk.  I am not allowed to cook for my children or have food in my room.  Previously, I was able to access these things but on this particular day, the manager had decided to impose a new rule.  I went to reception at 1 a.m. in desperate need of a slice of bread and milk to help my sickly child, but I was denied it.  The Minister subsequently requested that an inquiry to be made into what happened, as a result of which some sort of apology was given.  I do not know whether it was directed to me, but some kind of apology happened and the staff were supposed to receive training on the issue.  I am not sure whether that training was about how to treat people humanely and with more respect but, as I said, I have now had a situation where my child was denied tissue and I was told to come out of the bathroom and fetch it myself.</p><p> That raises a serious question about the type of people, communities and society the direct provision system is shaping for the future.  If I am put in that centre on an allowance of &euro;38.80 per week, I am being taught how to be dependent on the system, and I am teaching my children the same.  I am teaching them how to be helpless.  By the time I move out of that centre and am on a social welfare payment of &euro;180 per week, there is no way I will want to move myself out and find work.  It will be a promotion for me to go from &euro;38.80 to &euro;180 per week.  The process is automatically teaching my children the same system of dependency.  It is a very dangerous situation that is being created.</p><p> Children in direct provision are not even allowed to attend a school of their choice but are instead confined either to the schools in the local area or a school to which they are referred by the centre manager.  My child goes to a school that is a bit out of the way for where we live, being some 20 km away, but it is the school to which her peers from primary school chose to go and so she wanted to go there.  The bus that takes her to school stops less than 1 km from the centre.  The first bus out of the centre to take children to school is at 8 a.m. but my daughter needs to be at the bus stop at 7.45 a.m.  I have asked the centre management many times to make an adjustment, which would not be solely for my child but also for the few other children who need an earlier bus service.  Our request has been denied repeatedly.  This means that from my &euro;38.80 allowance, I have to pay a lady &euro;40 every week to take my daughter to the bus stop in the morning and bring her back to the centre in the afternoon.  I do not know how we are expected to survive under those conditions.</p><p> The same teenaged daughter has no idea how to boil an egg.  For the five years that I have lived in direct provision, my children have not known the taste of my cooking and are subjected only to what is served in the canteen.  My nine year old eats rice and gravy on a daily basis, as Mr. Mfaco, who sees him in the canteen, would be able to confirm.  I am sure my son is the one who asked for a second doughnut and was refused.  It is the one thing he likes.  Otherwise he is on a diet of rice and gravy endlessly because it is the only thing he can stand to eat.  That is not a normal situation and not the way that any child should be growing up.  It would not be acceptable to Irish people, Irish communities or Irish society to take an Irish child and put him or her in that situation and subject him or her to growing up in those types of conditions.</p><p> We and others have stated over and over again that direct provision is not fit for purpose.  We are not looking for comfort, as I said.  We are just looking to live as normal human beings and to be able to contribute to the communities that have welcomed us in many situations.  We are looking for the opportunity to give our children a better life than what they have experienced here and in our countries of origin.  We just want that opportunity to have sanctuary and safety and to be able to live normal lives.</p></speech>

That argument can be made because everybody there cooks for themselves and there are playgrounds for the children.  Whenever direction provision is discussed, there is a concentration on Mosney but no mention of Monaghan, for instance, where the playgrounds have been closed, or Kinsale, where residents are not allowed to cook.  We are asking for focus to be placed on those other centres rather than just advertising Mosney as the good place out of the whole system.</p></speech>

The system has recently been brought under the remit of the Ombudsman.  There have been 148 complaints this year.  Does the IRC feel there are adequate safeguards in place in every centre to ensure that the residents' rights are respected, particularly in respect of sexual abuse and even mental health issues that arise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#Q00200"><p>Those are serious problems and the testimony of everybody today has spelled that out plainly and clearly to all of us, ourselves included.  The simple remoteness of some centres may make it difficult to access mainstream services, as has been well explained.  Let us not forget that existing mental health services in Ireland are already stretched.  GP lists may be full and one may have to travel to a GP.  As Mr. Khambule explained, there have been several incidents of suicide and I can think of three within the past three years.</p> <p>  There are clearly deep problems and there is a framework for that to change.  The law that was passed in June of last year states that the Minister for Health shall ensure that a recipient has access to emergency healthcare and such healthcare as is necessary for the treatment of serious illnesses and mental disorders.  There is, therefore, a framework and a clear legal obligation on the State to ensure that people with such mental health problems are given proper assistance.</p> <p>  The two organisations here today and six other organisations released a statement last Sunday highlighting the fact that there is no vulnerability assessment procedure as required by that law in Ireland.  In June, it will be 12 months since that law was passed.  If there was a vulnerability assessment procedure, that would mean that if people were to arrive, they would be assessed and a determination would be made on what special reception needs they have such as if they have children and all the issues around children that Ms Vuma has explained, if they have health needs and if it is appropriate that they are accommodated in somewhere such as Knockalisheen.  That has not happened and that is a clear absence of, gap in or non-implementation of law and that is seriously problematic.</p></speech>

I hope they never give up the fight to abolish direct provision centres.  We will do everything and by the way we have a great Chairman to whom I want to pay credit.  We will do our best to highlight the issues that the witnesses have given us information on.  I appreciate their honesty.  It has been an unbelievable eye-opener for me and I thought I had a fair idea of the injustice that is going on here but the detail the witnesses have given us is important and I thank them so much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#Q00400"><p>I reiterate everyone's gratitude for the presentation.  It has been a tough meeting.  I have been a member of this committee for almost three years and Mr. Sibanda made probably one of the most insightful and thoughtful contributions I have heard to it.  To then see him in the condition he is in now and to hear some of these stories is a bit of a wake-up call and a dose of reality for us.  My view on direct provision is not much good to the witnesses because they are living it and they articulated the experience of that vividly today.</p> <p>  I am not as kind as my colleague, Senator Black.  The Government party is not represented here today because it does not care.  It knows full well what the situation is in direct provision because this is not the first meeting about this.  These meetings, presentations and engagements have happened consistently over a long number of years and, therefore, we need to consider a dose of unfortunate reality as we move forward collectively.  There are people in society and in government who think it is okay to lock people away in direct provision, who put the interests of private companies ahead of human beings and who think the culture that prevailed, as Senator Black said, during the period of the Magdalen laundries is okay now because we are not doing this to Irish people, even though the same Government oversees children who are born here sleeping in hotel rooms.</p> <p>  That is a culture we have to acknowledge before we hopefully get to the stage where direct provision is abolished.  That is a sad and unfortunate fact of Irish life that we need to challenge.  The committee's report could and probably should comprise the transcript of this meeting.  That is not to take away from any other contributors but the most important people in all of this who need to be heard are those living in direct provision.</p> <p>  The Chairman, whom Senator Black rightly acknowledged we are lucky to have in this regard, will lead a delegation from the committee to visit a number of direct provision centres next month.  I do not mean to be facetious about this but I remember when inspectors visited my school we were told to buck up our ideas, tidy up and put on a good show, so I ask the witnesses to be as frank as they can and to tell us what we should look out for and what questions we should ask.  I am sure their contributions will inform those of us who are going on that trip.  If there are any specifics that we should look out for and ask about on the day then the witnesses can be sure and certain that we will ask them but if there is anything beyond what they have said this morning, please let us know.</p> <p>  I do not want to come across as too negative.  I always go in hope.  One of the staff in my office always says to light a candle as opposed to curse the dark.  We can get to a point where we get rid of this stain on society.  This is how we are treating people as a nation of emigrants for generations, who went all over the world seeking refuge and seeking support.  It is a great shame and the message from this meeting is that when people are trying to exploit fear, ignorance and hatred, we are duty bound to help to inform people about what our fellow human beings are going through and to shine a light on what is happening in direct provision.</p> <p>  I am grateful to the witnesses for taking the opportunity to come here.  I wish we could do more and I wish I could give them the answer today.  Members will do their best.  We are up against it and the witnesses are up against it to address a political culture that thinks it is okay to do this.  That is the greatest shame.</p></speech>

Subsequent to this engagement with the IRC or MASI, I would like to submit some suggested points that we should look out for or that we should raise.  The contributions of the witnesses have been significant and informative and they have helped greatly in the preparation of what we intend to do but something else may occur subsequently.</p><p>I am opening up the opportunity, through the clerk, for the delegates to furnish us with particular points.  We would welcome that.  Senator Lawless is very welcome this morning.</p></speech>

He said some people are obviously happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  If I had a hotel standing for two years and I was not getting any money from it, and if, with the arrival of people seeking protection, the Department of Justice and Equality gives me the opportunity to use that hotel and suddenly my account is on the plus side and going, I would be very happy.</p></speech>

The manager of the centre I am in will say everything is perfect and well, but things are not okay.  One will be shown the kitchen and people cooking but, in the centre I am in, mothers are struggling to cook their meals because they have got small babies they cannot bring into the kitchen.  By the time they find someone to mind their babies, the kitchen is closed.  If one visits during the day, one finds the kitchen is functional and one will have the impression that everyone is cooking.</p> <p>  If one visits, one will be told the centre provides transport, but our transport is being provided by the private sector also.  Therefore, we have to beg.  We try to keep active as much as we can.  I tried to register a couple of people for the upcoming local elections.  The vote is one of the only rights we have and we need to use it.  We register the people and ask for a bus to take us to vote.  I was told the bus would pick people up at 10 a.m., leave them at the polling station and pick them up at 11 a.m.  The polling station is less than ten minutes away.  Emo is not a busy place so one can vote quickly and come out within five minutes.  Therefore, people have to wait for 40 minutes.  I asked one of the employers why the bus was not sent at about 11 a.m. and sent again to pick people up around 11.30 a.m.  The response is that the centre is not obliged to provide the transport and is just doing people a favour.  I was upset and made a point about treatment.  I said that if transport is provided as it was, no one will want to get on a bus, and the staff will say people do not want to be active.</p> <p>  Asylum seekers cannot be integrated because they are not legal in the country, but they are staying in the system for five years.  It would make sense if they were in it for only a year.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Khambule, Mr. Mfaco, Ms Vuma, Ms Ndlovu, Ms Kunene, Mr. Sibanda and Ms Leonard.  Ms Leonard had an opportunity to be quiet this morning but she was well represented in all the contributions we heard.  We thank the witnesses and wish them peace and success in their lives.  Those of us here are very much part of what we are proud to describe as "Ireland of the welcomes".  We believe it, and we want to live that with the witnesses.</p> <p>  I thank my committee colleagues for their participation today.  I invite all the delegates for a group photograph outside as a record of our morning's work.  We hope to have them back when we finally publish our report some time in the autumn.</p></speech>
