I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>We will now have an engagement with Ms Almut M&ouml;ller, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, on alliance building to strengthen the European Union.  I am delighted to welcome Ms M&ouml;ller who has travelled from Germany to speak to the committee.  Members of the committee have been dealing with Brexit for months and years and they are anxious to engage with others in planning and plotting the future of Europe and what it will mean to us.  We are very honoured to have Ms M&ouml;ller before us and grateful to her for taking time to discuss this important topic.</p><p>The committee, in its discussions on alliance and coalition building in the European Union, has had some interesting presentations from different sections of society, both political and non-political.  All previous presentations were made by senior commentators in Ireland.  Sometimes it is useful to listen to and consider an outside voice. </p><p>The European Council on Foreign Relations has been carrying out some very interesting work on mapping coalitions between member states across the European Union.  It has examined which countries have similar interests, which could potentially work together more closely and which may not work together.  We have been discussing the various ways Ireland can build on its relationships with EU partners and continue to build strong multilayered coalitions at all levels.  I look forward to hearing Ms M&ouml;ller's insights on this matter.</p><p>Members  are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her or identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence they give.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an entity or a person either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms M&ouml;ller to make her opening statement.  I am sure the committee members, as well as myself, will be interested in hearing her views and in asking her a number of questions afterwards.  I thank her again for being here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Almut M&ouml;ller" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman, the Senators, and the Deputies.  It is a great honour to be here in the Houses and I thank the committee for inviting me.  To underline what the Chairman just said, the European Council on Foreign Relations is a non-partisan think tank, and I am based in one of our offices in Berlin.  We care deeply about views from across the Union, and with this project, we started to map out the views of the 28 member states to the best of our ability.  The most interesting part of this work has been travelling to capitals where there has already been a lot of strategising going on over alliances within the various arenas and levels of the European Union.  This is my second time in Dublin in a little more than two months, and this is particularly exciting because, as the committee will be aware, there is much thinking going on here, so it is also a great opportunity for us to share our insight and see to what extent that resonates with thinking here.</p> <p>  I will explain briefly what we did in our quest to better understand how member state capitals look at the issue of coalition building.  The environment is very clear in that increasing dynamics of bilateralism are emerging in the EU 28 - soon very likely to be 27 - not only because of a more conflictual environment but also because of the changes ahead in light of the UK departing the Union.  We sense in our data and survey a great deal of overall commitment to working together but we have also spotted quite a few blind spots and I will talk about them briefly as well.</p> <p>  The committee will see an interactive explorer visualisation which I will use occasionally.  The backbone of this project has been going to EU capitals and speaking to those people in state chancelleries, foreign ministries, and other relevant ministries that shape EU strategy, and asking them about their preferences, interests, the countries they contact most, and what that means for the coming years.  This is a survey of experts who work on policy in that sense.  We also have people from academia and think tanks in the sample who help us balance it.  This is not looking at the EU environment in Brussels.  A lot of interesting work has been done on that in other fields, but this is looking at member state capitals and their engagement.  We came up with a number of areas and chapters that we asked participants about, and I will show them briefly.  We asked basic questions about preferences, such as who people contact most, with whom they share interests, who is the most responsive, and who is the most disappointing, which is something people would normally not tell us, even though it is in the room.  Our data very clearly show the top three most disappointing across the board, which are, excluding their own views about themselves - Poland, Hungary, and the UK.   We then asked about influence, and we tried to trigger a ranking because that is often interesting.  We also have an ambition to create a matchmaking platform for countries in terms of their policy priorities in the coming years, to look at their potential partners, including ones who might be overlooked, and how that might play out on policy.  We are looking at a relatively complex chessboard of 28 member states, for the time being.</p> <p>  I will briefly show the committee the overview to make it more interesting.  This interactive PDF is available free of charge online so members are welcome to browse it on long summer evenings or winter nights.  It is a bit of a beast but it is brilliant in that one can also browse it according to preferences, so one can just set it to Ireland or other countries to look at their policies and so on.  I will show the committee our overall findings, and I reiterate that this very much about perceptions.  This is how people working on EU policy in national capitals perceive each other.  We came up with a ranking, which is always something of interest.  Here we can see the bigger members states, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland among the top performers in terms of their coalition potential, clout, and weight, which is no surprise.  However, smaller member states such as the Netherlands and Sweden also rank fourth and sixth, respectively.  That is interesting because a question that came up a number of times was what a country's coalition potential is and how it can be exploited better.  Size can be of advantage but is not necessarily a guarantee for success, and a few countries that are not even members of key integration projects such as the euro can rank high.  Ireland finds itself ranked 20th in our research.</p> <p>  I refer to five broader lessons we took from this, and one I mentioned already which is the capacity of the big member states.  France, Germany, and a few others have a lot of potential, but it is clear that some of the best connected member states are smaller and have been active in shaping new coalitions in this new environment.  This includes the engagement around the Netherlands, Ireland, and the New Hanseatic League, which is an interesting group emerging from a single policy issue.  We have followed this with great interest, not least because we had come up with our own idea of an artificial group of countries which we call the affluent seven, which has quite a bit of overlap with the countries of the New Hanseatic League.  The argument we wanted to make was that we should look beyond established alliances that are no longer getting much traction, or are not important enough to punch their weight together.  We talk a lot about France and Germany, and these days there is a lot of talk about the Visegr&aacute;d, V4, countries.  The old coalitions of the founding member states or the net contributors or even the Club Med around Spain, Italy and France, are no longer getting that much traction.  Our encouragement was to look beyond that.  A few years ago when we started this project, we came up with the idea of the affluent seven group and there is overlap with the New Hanseatic League, which is interesting.  We travelled to a lot of the countries involved in this, including to Dublin, to see that there is perhaps a potential to move beyond the fiscal issue and go a little bit wider.  This is interesting and promising research for us.</p> <p>  Another lesson is that member states cannot rely on their relationships with France and Germany alone.  It is important to be out there, and I understand there has been quite some activity between the governments in Dublin and Berlin over the past years, but we have found in our data that there is a great deal of disappointment at times when it comes to the attention countries are getting back from Germany and France.  Everybody is looking at them and at times there is a lack a capacity or a lack of willingness to re-engage.  Our suggestion is that there are other ways for member states to draw the attention of these key players, and that involves creating alternative coalitions that are of relevance to them.  We see it clearly, as I pointed out, in the New Hanseatic League, which is of interest in Berlin and is perhaps also raising eyebrows at times, hence it is attention that can be useful.  There is also the question of the Visegr&aacute;d countries.  There is a strong interest in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in Berlin these days, partly driven by their membership of the V4.</p> <p>  A broader lesson we took from the survey is about overcoming geographical challenges through strategy.  This is particularly interesting when one travels to the periphery of Europe, though I do not like that term very much.  When we look at the data on Portugal and Finland, we have found that there are some strategies that can help overcome the disadvantages, and this is a relevant finding for Ireland.  Let us take Portugal, for example.  Portugal strongly perceives itself as an Atlantic power.  It is located next to a big neighbour and based on our data, Spain is an important entry point for Portugal into the core of the EU.  Spain has probably not been delivering as well as would have been expected over recent years, so that is somewhat of a problem for Portuguese engagement.  We found that this can be overcome through issue areas that I will also refer to shortly.  Finland has engaged strongly with the Baltic environment.  It helps a great deal that the Baltic states have seen quite an interesting trajectory since joining the EU and are playing a very interesting role that is different from both the V4 and south-eastern Europe.</p><p>We thought this was worth exploring further.  I can only be staccato really and hope the committee will forgive me for that.  The consultation between the UK and Ireland is one where some of the geography and interests make it more difficult so the question of how to bring it towards the centre of the EU is of great interest.</p><p> I want to talk about priorities and partners because on this occasion we tried to find out what the priorities of governments across the EU are for the coming years.  This is the answer we get for the entire EU.  Members can browse the document.  This is the overall picture I am outlining.  When we went out in the field in summer of last year, the top four topics or priorities were a common immigration and asylum policy, a single fiscal policy and eurozone governance, a fully completed Single Market and a common border police and coast guard.  We do not know what that means in the end regarding a consensus on a direction of travel in these policies in the context of this visualisation.  This is just a broad list of priorities.  Members can look at countries.  I will quickly jump to Ireland to see where it finds itself.  Members can see that the fully completed Single Market, the single fiscal policy and eurozone governance are strongly in line with overall EU interests in what will be the talk of the town in the coming years.  It is even more than average regarding the fully completed Single Market.  Members will see a plus two here.  This matter is really important for Ireland and Irish respondents.  Members will also see two areas that get a great emphasis in the sample from our Irish respondents, namely, a common digital policy, which is probably no surprise to members, and the common energy policy.  So there are two areas where there is consensus with the EU at large and there is a slightly stronger emphasis than the EU average on three of them.</p><p> What we then tried to do was structure the findings of our survey and ask who shares those priorities with Ireland and thinks Ireland is an important partner in these areas.  These are the results we obtained.  If members look at the fully completed Single Market, which is the number one priority here, they will see in bold that the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Finland also agree that this is an important priority.  What one would wish for in this visualisation is for a blue dot to appear next to them, which I will show by jumping to Sweden.  Sweden's top priorities are set out.  If members look at the fully completed Single Market, they will see that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland appear.  Ireland appears a bit less because it is less statistically relevant in our serving but it is still there.  Then there are blue dots - a little blue dot and a larger blue dots.  That means that Ireland thinks that the fully completed Single Market is a priority and thinks that Sweden is a partner in this.  Here members can see that the Government representatives with whom we talked and the academics we included see that there is already a relationship here that is probably worth exploring because it is not that developed.  We call a match making platform.  It is a lot about perceptions.  We hope it is a bit of a quarry for ideas.  If members look at preferences and shared interests to show them what they can do with this instrument, they will see that we are asking which EU member states generally share many of Ireland's long-standing interests on EU policies.  That goes beyond day-to-day business and is about a longer-term commitment to the EU, eurozone membership, etc.  Interestingly, Malta, Cyprus, the UK, Luxembourg and Portugal show up as countries that share a great deal of interests with Ireland when it comes to EU affairs at large.  This shows the results we get from the Irish respondents.</p><p> Members can move between the two.  Here we have a broad range of countries.  Interestingly, the Nordic countries, France, Germany and the Netherlands show up.  These are really lopsided relationships.  This is something we find quite a bit.  It is not exclusively relevant to Ireland.  By and large, in all our data, there are only eight mature bilateral relationships.  Members can probably think of some of them such as the Franco-German relationship, the Germans and the Dutch, the Slovaks and the Czechs, the Finns and the Swedes, etc., but there is then a lot of lopsidedness that we think is worth exploring because it means there is an interest in one side and not so much on the other.  What is the reason for that?  There are many ties that do not show up that are close to non-existent.  We believe that in this environment of European integration, from a strategic perspective, there is far more potential to engage not only in like-minded initiatives in bilateral relationships but also in more conflictual relationships.  We believe that, ultimately, this serves the health and vitality of the Union at large.  We do not want to promote a Union that only consists of bilateralism and is a kind of Congress of Vienna-style intergovernmental union.  We think it is very important to place that into the wider EU context.  This is also a strategic question to ask.  What does the emergence of new bilateralisms across the board mean for the overall cohesion of the EU?  This is just a thought to leave with members.  I stand ready to respond to questions and to go deeper into some of our findings.  Our hope as a think tank is that there will be a renewed debate based on data we gather.  We continue to gather the data and have done so for the second time.  We are refining our methodology as we go along and will do this again next year.  We hope to be even more interesting and accurate that time around.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#C00300"><p>I welcome our guest and thank her for her informative submission.  It is very important to discuss coalition-building in Europe, particularly at present.  There are two sides to that argument.  It is hugely important that EU member states form coalitions.  The downside of that is that those coalitions could be wrong footed at some stage in the future and an association or group could find itself at a disadvantage numerically by virtue of smaller groups associating together.  It is important that smaller countries also have an association with larger and more powerful economies for two reasons.  One is to ensure that there is overall recognition of the need for coexistence while the second is to ensure that the smaller countries know they are not insignificant and should not be overlooked.  In this country, for example, from time to time we have heard that we only represent 1% or 1.5% of the population.  The implication being that we mean nothing.  That is incorrect.  Ireland is an integral part of the EU.  Irish citizens have equal rights along with every other citizen throughout the EU regardless of what part in which he or she resides.</p> <p>  There is another issue, namely, the advent, or reinvention, of nationalism.  To my mind, this is a rejection of the concept on which the EU is based.  It is a dangerous route to take that could have tragic consequences.  There could be a disregard for smaller countries that would grow with the passage of time and would eventually end up in a division within Europe that would not be to the advantage of either the European people or the global economy and community.</p> <p>  We must refer to another issue in the context of Brexit.  Our nearest neighbour is leaving the EU regardless of whether it crashes out, walks out or performs a controlled landing.  Obviously, we would prefer a controlled landing and I think the British would.  However, not everybody in the UK agrees with that.  As a result, we may face some difficulties.</p><p>The crucial element now emerging is the extent to which the 27 European Union member states stuck together with a single common purpose regarding the Irish situation and the impact of Brexit on the European Union.  How it came about, what happened, what should have happened and what did not happen are immaterial at this stage.  It is happening and we must deal with that.  We hope that the UK will rejoin the European Union at some stage in the future.  I cannot see any alternative and believe it is inevitable.  I hope it happens.  However, we may have to rely on the European Union to an even greater extent in the future by virtue of our geographical position and isolation, and we are on the periphery of modern Europe, the extent to which we trade with our next door neighbours, the extent to which we will have to replace that trade with alternatives and the extent to which the European Union might look on Ireland in the future as a minor player.<br/><br/>We have often heard that we must bring Europe closer to the people.  I believe it is the opposite - we must bring the people closer to Europe.  All member states and potential member states must recognise that they are Europeans to start with and must commit themselves to the <i>acquis communautaire</i>in the way originally envisaged.  They must continue that after becoming members of the European Union.  There is little sense in practising the <i>acquis communautaire</i>beforehand and deciding afterwards to be selective in doing so by accepting A, B and C, but not the rest.  That does not work.  I cannot see how a union the size of the European Union can exist economically without a single currency.  I have said this many times previously.  Plenty of people disagree.  The problem is that when there are numerous currencies within the European Union that will always allow speculation to take place to the extent that it will disadvantage smaller countries at particular times in the crowding and rush of the markets that takes place from time to time.  We all know that.<br/><br/>We acknowledge the role played by our partners throughout the European Union in the Brexit talks.  It is crucial and must continue.  Any crack in the uniformity of the member states' attitude will be not only the end of the debate but also the beginning of the end of the European Union, which is a much more serious issue and will unfold very quickly thereafter.  We acknowledge and compliment our European colleagues on the work they have done and the work that remains to be done.  We hope to play an important role in the formulation of European policy in the future, as we believe we have done in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#D00200"><p>I thank Ms M&ouml;ller for appearing before the committee today and providing us with a good overview of the work of her organisation.  It is quite interesting and is the type of thing I could find myself playing with in the evenings as I try to figure out the relationships that exist across the European Union.  I am looking at the screen before me and specifically at Poland and the tiny blue dot regarding its commitment to deeper integration.  There is always a latent aspect to any data and information and my fear is that those who are seeking coalitions on that issue, for example, would decide to scrap Poland, saying there is no point in going there, and move on.</p> <p>  Returning to what Deputy Durkan said, the new European Union that will exist in a post-Brexit world will require that coalitions are built based on a topic or specific interest.  We will find ourselves, perhaps, seeking German support for financial issues, French support for agricultural issues and so forth.  When building the coalition one takes the major partner and tries to assemble the smaller countries around it to have a critical mass for the particular project.  This is where Ms M&ouml;ller's data are excellent because one can figure out which state one wishes to marry for a particular issue.  Those marriages might be short-lived as one moves on to the next issue and changes coalition partner.  What the European Council on Foreign Relations is doing is very good from that point of view.</p> <p>  I always get a little concerned when we talk about engaging with capitals around the European Union.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that we have to bring the citizens to Europe, not Europe to the citizens.  There is a disconnect in that regard and I have long had the view that we should engage as far down as local authority or regional authority level and even try to build coalitions between regional authorities in different parts of the world.  I have just returned from Saxony in Germany where I spent some time.  I am chairman of the German interparliamentary friendship group and I love to travel there because the people there are so committed.  In Saxony over the last week I could have been in Ireland.  We all have the same interests and I found a huge correlation between the things that interest me and those that interested people in Saxony, for example, how they dealt with the housing crisis after the reunification of Germany and other such matters.  We have a great deal to learn from each other.</p> <p>  Ms M&ouml;ller's software can allow me to pick a menu of countries I want to engage with in the first instance.  It will also point out the countries we need to engage with to build their interest in topics in which they are not quite interested or have not shown a great interest.  Looking at one of the other graphs, it appears that part of the problem is that there is a learning curve as one goes further east in Europe.  It has not yet fully adopted the European ideal, what is available and how to build coalitions.  Over time one will see the blue dots getting bigger across Europe.  This is very interesting stuff.  It allows the ordinary public representative who is not involved at European level to browse and see what is going on and who is making alliances with whom.  It is very good material and I compliment the organisation on it.  I would like to see more of it.</p></speech>

It is very useful.  This committee decided to examine the issue of alliances because of Brexit.  We felt that with the UK leaving the European Union we are losing an ally across a wide range of areas, taxation being just one of them.  This research is particularly interesting from that point of view.  Last month, Ireland published its national statement regarding the future of Europe, and big decisions will be taken at the June meeting of the European Council on the strategic agenda and the future of Europe.  As regards our national statement, our priorities are very much linked to Ms M&ouml;ller's research with regard to the completion of the Single Market, the completion of the digital single market and so forth.  Will Ms M&ouml;ller clarify the background to her research?  Is she giving us the views of the governments of the member states?  How do those views coincide with the views of citizens?  Is there separate research regarding the views of citizens?  I suspect there is a disconnect, for all sorts of reasons.  That is an important question and it would be interesting to know the answer.  It appears that Ms M&ouml;ller's research and our national statement coincide so obviously both have fed into each other.  However, is some research taking place on the views of the citizens of Europe as well?</p></speech>

If Ms M&ouml;ller were making recommendations to Ireland in addition to what she has told us, what would they be?  What should our priorities be?  Everybody seems to want to be friends with Germany.  What does Germany think of us?</p><p>Is this helpful to Germany and can it deliver what is expected of it?  Is too much emphasis and expectation being placed on Germany?  Will it be able to meet the expectations of other member states?  I was interested in what Ms M&ouml;ller said about countries disappointing each other.  Will she explain what she means?  How is Ireland perceived as a partner in the future?  Does Ms M&ouml;ller think Ireland is doing well?  How does she think we are faring?</p><p> I like to think that our committee has been broadly supportive of the Government's engagement regarding Brexit.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be in here in later.  She has always been highly regarded by members of this committee, as has the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney.  I do not want this committee to be political in any way regarding what is happening in Europe.  I do not think that it is.  We are not trying to knock the Government or use this issue as a political football.  I think the exact opposite is the case.  Everybody here is wearing the Irish jersey and we maintaining a united front.  That is only right and proper.  It is important that we pull together when there is a job of work to be done.  My colleagues and I would be grateful if we could hear Ms M&ouml;ller's views and her responses to our questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Almut M&ouml;ller" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for their comments and questions.  I will start with the Chair's question regarding disappointment.  It is an unusual question that we are asking and it might be wondered why we are doing that.  We are doing it because we wanted to understand what matters to governments.  To clarify, this question is specifically looking at government positions and think-tanks and academics observing government.  This, however, is only one part of a larger puzzle.  There are many other arenas that matter as well and what citizens think certainly matters very much.  We have some reference to that in our policies and partners section.  I ask the committee to forgive me if I am jumping around the topics a little.</p> <p>  Reference was made to engagement.  Is there a preference for engagement in the context of all 28 EU states, in groups of member states, in the treaties, outside of the treaties or just alone?  There is a view representative of government officials.  We also have a sample, however, of the public polling we carried out.  It is very expensive to do that in 28 member states, so the smaller countries do not match representative standards.  We wanted to include this in order to illustrate the point.  I agree fully with the Chair that it is of tremendous importance.</p> <p>  We have another flanking instrument called the EU cohesion monitor.  It has just come out and also looks at the 28 EU member states and their trajectory over the past ten years.  That has been the most formative time in European integration.  We have witnessed crises and responses which affected not only our economies but also the attitudes of citizens.  We can very clearly map out what the citizens think in that context and we are doing so.  We do not have time now to look at that in detail but that research is also available online and free of charge.  Ireland is a very interesting example of how attitudes can really change for the worse regarding approval of the EU and then recover.  It has been amazing for us to see the recovery in the past months.</p> <p>  I want to turn now to the Chair's question on disappointment and why we think that matters.  Our submission details the countries in the EU that get the most votes for disappointing the most, namely, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Poland, Greece, France, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.  Those countries do not regard themselves in that light.  Why does the rest of the EU make these statements?  It is because there is deep disappointment about neglecting the EU and the values of the Union.  That tells us about what the governments of the member states care about and that is a very interesting finding.</p> <p>  Ireland is a country that is very much liked.  We can see a little bit of disappointment showing up in the data.  For a more nuanced picture overall, however, I would like to exclude the French, the Germans and the Spaniards and just concentrate on the other member states.  We know that the big countries automatically attract more attention and that this results in it slightly more blurry in respect of the smaller member states.  We can see from the data what the Irish respondents are telling us and in whom they are disappointed.  The member states most mentioned are the UK, Poland and Hungary.  We also see mention of France and Germany, however.  My interpretation is that is because of attention not being reciprocated as much.</p> <p>  The Chair also had a query concerning Ireland's role and how it is perceived.  My sense is that Ireland is seen as closely intertwined with Brexit.  From my perspective in Berlin, I sensed in recent years that there is a clear idea about the interests of Dublin in this process, as well as the associated vulnerabilities.  There was much engagement on that issue.  I will read with interest the document to which the Chair directed my attention.  My question concerns the identity that Ireland wants to shape for itself in the post-Brexit environment.  How does Ireland want to offer itself as partner?  Our data tell us that an answer is not really emerging yet.  There is not enough clarity about that.</p> <p>  The Chair also asked about our recommendations for Ireland.  One area where the Union really needs to punch better in future policies is in the digital realm.  Our Irish respondents tell us that is an absolute priority for Ireland.  That again does not necessarily mean that there is alignment across the Union and that every other country also stating that this is important.  There are differences regarding policies but there is a great deal of potential to raise this issue in the future.  That is particularly the case in the context of the New Hanseatic League.  The French have been talking about this more.  There is great potential to engage in these new future-orientated policies and, in doing so, to shape a picture of a country which has the strong backing of its citizens.</p> <p>  As an aside, that aspect also makes Ireland very interesting for all of those committed to European co-operation, if not necessarily further integration.  Ireland is a very stable and reliable partner in that context.  This is something Germany definitely cares about.  My recommendation is to use that advantage and ensure that other member states really see Ireland's potential.   The country has had past difficulties within the European Union, but our cohesion monitor data show that Ireland is also seen as a success story demonstrating how Europe can help to deliver on potential.  It is necessary for Ireland to paint a clear picture of itself, talk about that vision more and in that way become more prominent on the map.  There is much to work with already and Brexit presents a clear window of opportunity because much attention is focused on Dublin right now.</p> <p>  The point concerning the longevity of coalitions is very interesting.  I agree that there will be more issue-orientated coalitions.  That will be the case because of a more politicised environment in the member states and the EU institutions.  At the same time, however, it is important to have longer term strategies for partnership.  They can allow a sense of co-operation to be developed that transcends occasional differences.  I refer to the current relationship between France and Germany.  Normally, those two countries do not agree on many of the issues.  They have a framework established, however, in which they can talk about those differences.</p> <p>  We have a special section in our data on France and Germany where we asked only the French and the Germans about themselves.  They are well aware of their differences and they are also not very optimistic about overcoming them in the key areas that need to be tackled.  The Chair mentioned the Eurozone as one such issue.  These types of data are an important indicator for us.  It is not enough to know about each other's differences.  There also has to be knowledge of the space we need to create to allow action to be undertaken.  The French and the Germans have not proved to be very good at that.  There are reasons why that is the case, as well as reasons that affect the rest of the Union.</p> <p>  I will turn now to the concerns of Ireland as a minor player.  There is great potential for member states that do have the size and heft of France, Germany and others.  Ireland already has a legacy and credibility within the EU framework.  I had some interesting conversations in Croatia recently.  It only joined the EU in 2013 and is coming from a completely different perspective.  The level of difficulty is much higher.  I refer to shaping an idea about oneself and having the willingness to be proactive in that and not just a passive receiver.  That is a completely different situation.</p><p>There is an advantage to being recognised as a country that wants not only to take but to shape although that, at times, might look different.</p><p> The disregard of smaller countries was connected to point about the reinvention of nationalism.  It has less relevance in our data and more in our cohesion monitor data.  Following German foreign policy very closely, I agree that the current environment probably brings more focus on the old-fashioned methods of power, which is very dangerous.  It will force players within the Union to play and punch, especially when we do not know where one of our most important partners, the United States, is going, but it clearly does not want a strong EU.  It understands a more old-fashioned type of power, which clearly is not how we Europeans would like to look at it.  It represents a risk and places a duty on the larger member states, especially when shaping coalitions outside of the EU framework.  Tying things back into the EU framework at large is becoming increasingly important and I am concerned that this is not adequately recognised.  There is an important role for the countries which warn against this.  Alliances are important in this regard.  This is very clearly seen wherever I travel in Nordic countries, for instance.  </p><p> I spoke earlier about the construction of the affluent seven group, but it could be an affluent eight or affluent nine or whatever.  We could see Ireland as being a part of it but we did not include it for the time being.  These are important opportunities beyond the shaping of the day-to-day politics of voting on respective policies; it is on the broader notion of what it means to act together as Europeans.</p><p> I will comment briefly on the Senator's point about Saxony, because it points towards a dilemma.  In recent days in the vote for the European Parliament, Saxony, along with Brandenberg and to an extent Thuringia, showed large votes for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party.  It is coming in first in Brandenberg and Saxony and it came in third in Thuringia.  This is something to watch.  There is shared interest but then there is the question of how the public allows for closer co-operation.  The question related to the regional level, however, which is very important but we are not mapping that in this survey.  We deal with it better in other surveys we are undertaking. </p></speech>

Has Ms M&ouml;ller's study shown any capacity for small countries to exercise soft power and bring together a coalition, and hence bring the large blocks to join rather than going cap in hand to larger blocks, as it were?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Almut M&ouml;ller" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#F00300"><p>It is important to do both.  The Dutch example is an interesting study.  Our analysis showed that the Netherlands understood Brexit would require a reshuffling of alliances.  It already has a very strong relationship with Germany, which is one of the strong bilateralisms which shows up in our data of the eight; it invested in its relationship with France, which is not an easy one; and it came up with a stronger engagement through the Hanseatic League format.  This was precisely what the Senator described, that is, not focusing on the big ones but having a second pillar to avoid having placed all its eggs in one basket.  That is a very smart strategy.  That would be my answer to the Senator's question of what smaller states can do.  Collectively there is a great deal of power in the affluent seven, as we put it, or the Hanseatic League, as we might put it in the future.  When we travelled to countries which affiliate themselves with the Hanseatic League, we found an interest in trying to explore other areas that might carry weight.</p> <p>  If one looks at the numbers that it takes to shape and not merely block things, then a Hanseatic-plus group, bringing in some of the bigger states as the Senator suggested, has much potential.  It requires positioning, whereby states clearly outline what they want.  My sense is that no EU member state has been very good at this, as it requires them to put their cards on the table and makes them vulnerable.  It probably needs a culture of states overcoming reluctance to position themselves, taking initiatives, declaring preferences and seeking compromise.  If one looks at the Hanseatic League or the affluent seven group, there are many thing that do not fit together.  This is not a natural group, at first sight, and it needs work.  That is another lesson, that coalition building does not only take place in a harmonious environment but that groups need mitigating and bridging of differences.  We have not done that research as it requires a lot of resources.  Another study that I would love to do is how member states deal with this environment of greater bilateralism and what it means for representation in capitals, how many people at home work in relevant Ministries on those issues.  There is a lot more to learn on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#F00500"><p>All my questions are small.  As we discuss the need to support one another, to identify with other groups and gain strength by association and so on, this in itself is a criticism of what we are.  The European Union suggests that every person in every member state is a committed member and equal in every way to one another.  It says there is no difference whatever.  If my car is in one part of the Union it should be the same price in every other part of the Union.  Especially for those of us on the periphery, that has gained a greater importance than before.  For example, many years ago, this country's currency was aligned with the pound sterling.  When the European Monetary System came in, we immediately opted to align ourselves with the Deutsche mark.  That was a commitment by this country to recognise that we had to become more a part of the system, rather than remaining part of the periphery.  We often discuss the regulation of medicines on the Committee on Health, of which I am a member.  The Single Market and the customs union do not apply in that area.  Different prices are applicable in different member states.  Why?  There is no reason that should be the case.  We manufacture in Ireland, where there is a huge pharmaceutical industry that is proportionately much greater than our numerical strength.  It is in our interest to be able to supply the 500 million people in the European Union.  The motor industry is of great interest to Germany.  It is in Germany's interest that it be able to supply the 500 million.  Like many others here, I have always tried to support European industries in the purchase of machinery, motor vehicles and electrical goods.  It is of ever increasing importance.  These are all areas on which the European Union as a whole must improve to be and remain relevant and to become more relevant to the people.</p> <p>  I will conclude by reiterating the point about bringing the people to Europe, whereby each person who gets on the European train has a commitment to European ideals and being a European.  It should not be as if we in some way are from outside the Union and are seeking admission to an inner sanctum.</p></speech>

That will get a lot of traction in central and eastern Europe especially.  The idea of second-class citizenship is very damaging.</p> <p>  I will finish by showing member a contact map, which shows the intensity of contacts in the EU.  In order to show up in our visualisation, a certain threshold must be passed, so this does not mean that there are not ties between other capitals which are not shown here.</p><p>All I want to show the committee is that one sees clearly that regional engagement matters very much.  What one also sees, by the way, is that there is only one link between the east and the west and that is through Warsaw and Berlin.  As I stated, compared to our previous data, this is a weakened link.  This should be of primary concern.</p><p> The committee will see the secondary ties there.  We just want to illustrate that.  This also puts Ireland on the map.</p><p> Then we see the Brexit effect.  The committee will excuse me for being brusque with this as obviously, there is much more to tell about that, but this clearly shows how much work there is to do.</p><p> I offer to re-engage with the committee.  We are happy that we had the chance to come here.  It was an honour.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for that opportunity.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will update the joint committee on issues which were discussed at last week's meeting in Brussels, including the EU's next five-year strategic agenda and Brexit contingency planning.</p> <p>  The next few months will be of great significance for the European Union.  Last week, the citizens of the 28 member states voted in the European Parliament elections forming a new European Parliament and it would be neglectful of me at this stage not to take this opportunity to wish every person from Ireland who has so far been elected to the European Parliament, from whatever political parties and none, every good luck, success and every good wish on their new venture.  Some of them have been re-elected.  Others have been elected for the first time.  It is important for us as a committee and all of the members, again in a completely non-political way, that we consider them all to be flying the flag for Ireland, for us and for our citizens.  It is only right and proper that we wish them well today and that we support them in every way we can.</p> <p>  A new European Commission should be in place by November and a number of senior roles will change over.  Now is a time of calm before great change and renewal and it is an important time for us to focus on the future direction of the EU.</p> <p>  I would normally read out the usual reminder of the rules on privilege but, as the Minister of State and the officials are familiar with them, I do not have to do so.  However, I remind our guests of their application.  I, again, welcome the Minister of State and warmly welcome her officials, who are always excellent and hardworking on behalf of all of us.</p><p>I invite her to make her opening comments.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance if my voice starts to go but I have a bit of a cold.</p><p>I join the committee in wishing our new MEPs every success.  I look forward to working with them, as I know the committee does, in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>As usual there is much to report upon since my previous visit.  Last week I attended the General Affairs Council where we focused on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and preparations for the June European Council.  The agenda for the upcoming European Council includes the next strategic agenda for the Union, high-level appointments, the MFF and climate change.</p><p>I propose to focus on three headline issues, which are the EU&rsquo;s strategic agenda 2019-2024, an update on the other issues discussed during last week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council and an update on the negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU and our preparedness and contingency plans.</p><p>I will first turn to the EU strategic agenda for 2019 to 2024.  In 2014, the European Council adopted the &quot;Strategic Agenda for the Union in Times of Change&quot;, setting out five key overarching priorities to guide the work of the EU.  Change is a constant and it is right that we look again at our priorities to ensure that we focus on meeting the needs and expectations of our citizens and prepare for the challenges of the future.  Ireland began preparing its contribution to the new strategic agenda in 2017, when I joined the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste at the launch of the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogues on the future of Europe.  These were designed to help us learn about what mattered most to our citizens in the debate on the future of Europe, which took place throughout member states.  The Chairman will recall that this committee also held its own hearings on the future of Europe.  The Chairman spoke at our national event in May last year in Dublin, for which I thank him.</p><p>In April, the Cabinet approved the publication of a national statement on the European Union.  This is a whole-of-Government response to the issues raised during the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogues and is Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the next strategic agenda.  It was laid before the Oireachtas and was the subject of statements in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann just before the Easter recess.</p><p>The Europe of the future must meet the ambitions of our citizens.  It must deliver on the unfulfilled potential of the Single Market &ndash; one fit for the digital age.  It must be ready for the opportunities and the challenges of the digital transformation, protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  It must be a global leader in finding solutions to climate change.  It must play a central role in advancing the sustainable development goals and it must stay true to its values.</p><p>Heads of State and Government began their discussions on the strategic agenda a few weeks ago in Sibiu, with a view to adopting it at the next European Council in June.  In the meantime, we will work with the other member states to ensure that our priorities, defined in Ireland's national statement, are reflected in the new strategic agenda.</p><p>With regard to the other issues discussed at the General Affairs Council last week, I refer to the MFF.  During the debate on this occasion we discussed the neighbourhood, development and international co-operation instrument, NDICI. The new proposed instrument will see a major restructuring of the EU&rsquo;s fund for external action.  The proposal is to integrate the European neighbourhood instrument and the European Development Fund, which used to be managed separately, into the EU budget.  This is intended to reflect the EU&rsquo;s strategic priorities, notably the neighbourhood countries and Africa.  In my intervention, I supported the integration of the European Development Fund within the NDICI.  Integration will allow for greater coherence, more efficiencies and simplified procedures, or to remove duplication where we can.  I also indicated that Ireland supports the proposal to integrate the European neighbourhood instrument into the NDICI.  We feel that the current level of proposed ring fencing for the neighbourhood instrument should allay any concerns about the importance and priority that the EU attaches to relations with our nearest neighbours.  I am aware this was a concern for many of my colleagues, and those concerns were outlined.  We feel the ring-fencing of this funding should allay many of the concerns that were raised.</p><p>It was clear that there is no clear majority at the Council in favour of either option and it is likely that these two issues will have to be discussed again as the MFF discussions progress.  This was the last thematic MFF discussion under the Romanian Presidency.  At the June European Council, leaders will assess whether we are on track to reach an overall agreement in the autumn or whether more time will be needed.  I commend the Romanian Presidency for its dedication to these important negotiations.  I am sure that the incoming Finnish Presidency will do its utmost to guide us towards agreement by the end of the year, which we would very much favour.</p><p>The other item on the General Affairs Council agenda was preparations for the European Council meeting in June.  The European Union elections signal the start of the next institutional cycle in our Union.  As part of that cycle, the new strategic agenda will be adopted by leaders at the Council next month.</p><p>There will also be a series of personnel changes at the top of the EU&rsquo;s main institutions.  A new Commission President and College of Commissioners will be appointed.  The European Parliament and European Council will also elect new presidents and Mario Draghi will be replaced this year as President of the European Central Bank.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach attended an informal European Council to start the consideration of these high-level appointments ahead of the European Council next month.  These appointments should reflect geographical balance and demography to ensure large and smaller countries are represented in the highest positions in the EU.We must also ensure we have gender and political balance, which should also be taken into account.</p><p>The EU has implemented measures aimed at combatting disinformation in election campaigns.  The European Council will consider a Presidency report on lessons learned from the European parliamentary elections.  Ireland fully supports EU efforts to combat the manipulation of our democratic systems.  Domestically, our interdepartmental group on security of the electoral process and disinformation has been working to identify best practice to secure our electoral processes.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has also helped to establish a media literacy campaign entitled Be Media Smart.</p><p>At the June Council, leaders will also discuss climate change, in light of the UN climate action summit this September and the development of a long-term EU climate strategy.  Our Deputies and Senators will be aware that an all-of-Government plan will be completed shortly to deliver on the Government's ambition to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.  This follows from the cross-party and cross-committee report that was published this year.</p><p>The General Affairs Council next month is expected to discuss enlargement in advance of the next European Council, at which a decision is envisaged on opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania.  Ireland believes that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union.  I visited Skopje and Tirana in February and was impressed by the progress made on key reforms.  The Commission published its opinion this morning and based on its positive recommendations, we would like the Council to take the decision to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania in June.</p><p>The Commission updated Ministers on their recent communication on strengthening the rule of law within the Union.  I am aware that Deputies have raised this issue on many occasions.  The communication is the start of a reflection process on rule of law issues.  According to the Commission, there is a need for better promotion of the rule of law, early prevention of risks or breaches and more effective responses.  This matter is of serious concern to Ireland as the rule of law is a fundamental principle for all EU member states.  We look forward to the specific proposals from the Commission, which will hopefully be published next month.</p><p>I will now turn to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union or Brexit.  The April European Council decision to extend the Article 50 process reduced the risk of a no-deal scenario in the immediate term.  The political impasse in the UK, however, and the failure of the UK Parliament to ratify the withdrawal agreement, means that the threat of a no-deal Brexit in October remains.  There are those who would say that it is even more severe than the March deadline.  The process of replacing Prime Minister May will begin in the week starting 10 June.  It would not be appropriate to comment on this internal matter for British politics, other than to say I wish Prime Minister May well.  Her efforts to find a path forward in a very difficult situation demonstrated a commendable commitment and sense of duty.  We look forward to working constructively with the next British Prime Minister and his or her team.  A change of Prime Minister, however, will not change the facts of Brexit.  The European Council has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, cannot be reopened or renegotiated.  The European Council has also said, however, that should the UK&rsquo;s position evolve <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the future relationship between the EU and the UK, the EU is prepared to reconsider the political declaration on the future relationship.  The responsibility for avoiding a no-deal outcome lies firmly with the UK.  Our position has remained the same for some time.  The best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  It is vital, therefore, that the UK, regardless of whoever is the next Prime Minister, makes good use of the period between now and 31 October to try to find a suitable way forward.</p><p>Last week, the Cabinet indicated its approval for Government to continue its Brexit planning and preparedness work for all possible outcomes, including no deal.  This work will continue both at home and at EU level.  Since December 2018, we have focused on putting the necessary contingency measures in place to mitigate the potential impacts of a no-deal UK withdrawal.  Much of this work, as outlined in the Government's December 2018 Brexit contingency action plan and subsequent updates, will continue to be relevant in any scenario.</p><p>The Government is determined to make good use of the period afforded by the extension to further deepen our no-deal responses.  This will include adding to or refining completed measures to maximise our readiness.</p><p>We have recruited additional staff as part of our work to prepare our ports and airports for all Brexit scenarios.  The Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Health Service Executive recruited staff in time for a no-deal Brexit last March, but they would still be needed in a range of Brexit scenarios.  Additional training for these officers will take place over the summer months.</p><p> Many of the preparatory measures undertaken by businesses and outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign are good business practice and will benefit stakeholders, whatever the outcome of the UK withdrawal.  We will continue work to encourage businesses to prepare, including by taking practical steps such as registering for economic operators' registration and identification, EORI, numbers.  Most Deputies and Senators who have been out and about for the past few weeks are aware that there may be a sense that this has gone away and will not happen but we encourage everybody to continue to engage and take practical steps to prepare themselves and their businesses for this event.  The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 was signed by the President on 17 March and its provisions remain ready to be deployed if and when required.  We are preparing for Brexit with the full support of the European Commission and our 27 EU partners.  Many of the actions aimed at mitigating the effects of a no-deal outcome will be taken at the EU level, as they involve sectors regulated by EU law.</p><p> Earlier this month, I welcomed the European Commission announcement of an exceptional aid fund for the beef sector in the context of Brexit.  The Government had sought such provision for Irish beef farmers, both at meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and in direct consultation with the Commission.  It is something constantly raised by members, particularly in the context of raising awareness of the need to retain our overall Common Agricultural Policy budget.  We are grateful to the European Commission, in particular Commissioner Hogan, for the assistance.  It is another example of the importance of EU solidarity in the context of the economic challenges caused by Brexit.</p><p> It is clear that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU will have a significant impact on Ireland, whatever its outcome.  Government, businesses and citizens must make the necessary preparations to minimise its impact, and we are determined to be as ready as we can be, whatever the outcome.  I thank members again for the invitation to address the committee and for their attention this afternoon.  As always, I am happy to take any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

She mentioned Commissioner Hogan and the package for beef farmers.  Since that announcement there have been many questions as to how it will make its way to the people who need it most, to put it bluntly.  These are the people producing beef, not the factories, exporters or anybody else.  It is about the farmer who produces the beef.  How can they see the bottom line panning out better for them?  Will the Minister of State give clarity as to the way the package could have an impact in a positive way on the small farmers producing or buying calves, fattening them and keeping them for a winter or two and then selling them to the factories?  In many cases they only break even or lose money.  Others have a marginal profit, meaning the industry is on its knees.  That is why it was acknowledged that a package was needed.  Getting a package is one thing and I am grateful for it.  The members know I do not care who helps and I will compliment anybody who does it.  How will the money get into the pockets of the right people and those who deserve it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#J00300"><p>I echo the Chairman's sentiments on the people who should see benefit from the package.  These people are in the critical area of production for the country and the European Union.  It is tied to and is essential to exports and jobs in the European Union.  I compliment the Minister of State on her interaction and work throughout the European Union advertising Ireland's cause right across the Union.  The causes of Ireland and the EU have converged to a large extent so I compliment her on her role in this respect.  We are in a formative era for the EU and this is a new challenge, with new personnel, issues and challenges.  There are matters that will have to be resolved within the European Union by the Union and its people in the next five years.  We should wish the Minister of State well in her role in dealing with issues wherever they may arise.</p><p>We have mentioned in past times the need to ensure equity and that the Single Market applies right across the board to everybody.  We must be able to buy and sell into the Single Market and be treated equally within it.  We should not be penalised any more than anybody else in the Single Market.  We must have the right, the space and the ability to prosper, and we have that now.</p><p>Climate action is a major challenge for every country.  Some countries contribute to a greater or lesser extent than others to carbon footprints.  We must note that we have a role to play.  Agriculture can and will play a role on the basis that it is already very efficient in its treatment of the environment, as it has proven over many years.  For example, I do not accept the notion that we should have a knee-jerk reaction and take one sector of the economy out of business because of the idea that is a sole contributor to the problem.  We are not the sole contributors to the problem across the European Union and we are like everybody else.  Some areas are better than others.  It is essential we deal meaningfully with the matters that must be dealt with.  For example, electricity generation leaves a major carbon footprint.  This is key to what we must deal with in future both from an economic, environmental and competition perspective.  We have a role to play and we expect to be able to play it.  We do not have to destroy our economy to do this.</p><p>We must welcome enlargement as we are Europeans and others wishing to come on board the Union are Europeans as well.  There is a commitment to the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, and new members would be as entitled as we are.  We are becoming part of a bigger Union but equal contributors to it, and that is the way it should be.  There can be no exceptions and we are all part of the same group.  Government policy is absolutely correct in that it is proper to welcome enlargement.  However, we must insist that countries coming on board that committed to the <i>acquis </i>before coming on board remain committed to the <i>acquis</i>after membership of the Union is granted.  That is critical.  This leads to application of the rule of law and we must insist the rule of law applies right across the European Union.  If there are exceptions, compliance with the <i>acquis</i>would no longer exist and a pretence otherwise would be wrong, misleading and very damaging to the concept of the European regime and project.</p><p>Last and by no means least, we come to Brexit.  It has been a topic of conversation all the time and it will remain as a topic for some time yet.  In the short few months ahead, the issue will develop to a greater or lesser extent, or else it will not develop at all.  We have a meaningful role to play within the European Union, as Ministers have, along with the Opposition over recent years.  That meaningful role within the Union has been about bringing people together to establish common ground and objectives, with less reliance on emerging nationalism, which is the enemy of the European Union.  I will conclude with a point I made in response to the previous submission.  If there is a discussion on a loosening of the rules in the European project, it will be the beginning of the end for the Union.</p><p>The first brick in the wall that removes member states' responsibility or allows member states to proceed of their own accord will be the beginning of the end of the European Union.  People across the European Union need to examine that carefully and ask whether we should go here and whether we have been there previously and, if so, what were the results and costs of our previous visit to that particular pedestal.  The evidence is clearly there for everybody.  My party strongly supports the lines being taken by the 27 member states and we hope the UK will find its way back into the European Union at a later stage.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Durkan, I welcome the proposed enlargement of the European Union, which would be confined to North Macedonia and Albania.  Is it correct that Albania is a member of NATO?  By what name was North Macedonia known previously?</p></speech>

The Minister of State portrayed the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, in a good light.  I agree with her and it is generally accepted, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, that he has been an excellent Commissioner.  Please God, he has been mentioned for promotion under the new arrangements.  I will understand if the Minister of State is unable to comment on that.  I wish the Commissioner well.</p> <p>  Brexit is a very fluid situation.  Ireland must be concerned about the future of the 80% of our exports to continental Europe which go through the British landbridge.  The Minister of State might comment on that.  I would be very worried about that in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  If I read the position correctly, with Mr. Raab pulling back and given the comments made by the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Hunt, the balance seems to be edging towards excluding a no-deal Brexit, which is very good from our point of view.  The Labour Party wants a customs union or as near as possible to what we have at present.  Whatever one might think of Mr. Corbyn, the balance of the party is right.  There is also a welcome sign that the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, has now come out strongly in favour of parliament having its view.  My reading of Mr. Bercow and his comments today is that he very much upholds what parliament has already decided in excluding a no deal.  While he cannot make that decision, he has had his voice heard and seems to be a tough Speaker in that regard.  I would welcome the Minister of State's comments on those matters.  I hope I am reading the position correctly.  Hopefully, the ball has turned a little in our favour.  Maybe it was not going against us but I am reading the signals as being a little more hopeful than they were some days ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019052900002#K00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  Her contributions are always very informative.</p> <p>  We were concerned that the European Parliament elections would have a scattergun outcome with moves to the far right and left but they seem to have converged towards the centre.  I do not see a great threat to the European ideal emerging from the incoming Parliament.</p> <p>  My colleagues mentioned the Commission and the Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan.  I am told I look like the Commissioner and it would be easy to slot me into his job if the Taoiseach was of a mind to do so.  On a serious note, I attended one of the citizens' dialogue sessions and I compliment the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, on a really good job of engaging people around the country.  That is what is needed to revitalise the European ideal among the people.</p> <p>  I am a little disappointed that the Minister of State adverted to our desire to become leaders in climate change.  In the previous session, we were talking about a trip I made to Saxony last week with the German-Irish Chamber of Commerce.  As the Minister of State will be aware from travelling throughout Europe, the amount of wind energy being generated on mainland Europe is astounding.  It does not seem to cause any great problem to planners or anybody else.  In this country, we must come to terms with whether the environment or the landscape is more important.  People will criticise me for that statement but climate change is now the greatest threat to all of us.</p> <p>  Unlike my colleagues, I am not exactly embracing enlargement right now.  I have concerns about the western Balkans.  Tensions still exist there.  I favour enlargement provided all those who are playing in this game realise that the European ideal is not a peacekeeping organisation and countries come to the European project having made their peace with everybody and ready to move forward and leave the past behind.  Albania and North Macedonia are not really a problem, but there are other states in that region which still have difficulties in this regard.  I would be interested in an update on the position in respect of Georgia.</p> <p>  It seems that every potential leader of the Conservative Party is in favour of reopening the withdrawal agreement.  I sincerely hope that is not the case.  The alternative, for which we must prepare, is that there will be a crash-out Brexit.  If there is no further negotiation and clarification, the UK will crash out of the European Union.  We will need serious support from the EU should that rise and I note the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste have been working hard on that.</p> <p>  On the issue of the Border, we keep talking about our ports and saying we will have customs officials and everything else on our ports.  On the day after the referendum in the UK I said the Border would be a problem.  I am still unsure as to what preparations we have made to ensure the integrity of the Border.  A few in this room will recall the difficulty we had in closing the Border in 2001 when the foot and mouth disease scare occurred.  We closed it but it took customs, the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Army to do so.  I can see no way that the Border can remain open.  By the way, I do not subscribe to this nonsense of a Border poll either.  We are not ready for that.</p></speech>

I should not leave out our officials both nationally and internationally who have been incredible in the work they have done.  I am blown away by what I see as I travel throughout Europe.</p> <p>  An issue that came up the other day is that we have now opened the sea bridge and there are ferries going directly to France.  I would hope to see ferries going directly to Germany, the Hook of Holland or somewhere like that.  I heard a chap on the radio the other day who produces flowers for export to the Netherlands, of all places.  The sea bridge is too long for his produce but the landbridge will not be shorter because we hear there will be 9 km tailbacks at the various ports.  We will not be able to offer such small producers anything.  They do not have enough produce to fill a truck.  I am concerned for them.  What supports will be put in place for them?  It is not all about beef, lamb and chicken.  There are people producing other perishable goods who will need significant supports to remain in business.  As the guy who grows flowers was saying, he produces so many flowers that his operation is too big for this market on its own, there will be no market in the UK and by the time the produce gets to mainland Europe, it will be of very little value because it will have gone over its timeline.  While the sea bridge will support big producers, how will we deal with the small guys?</p></speech>

I will touch first on the issue of the beef fund from the Commission.</p><p>Everybody here will agree it is most important that the money gets to those who need it most and is not diluted by administration.  The people seeking these funds are those who have already been negatively affected by the uncertainty caused by Brexit.  This money needs to get to those who have already lost revenue.  As the criteria have not yet been set out fully or published, we need to wait to see what they will look like.  I know those who have been working to advocate for this, including the IFA, have been emphasising that this money needs to get to those who need it.  We need to wait to see what the criteria will be.  I hope we will have that sooner rather than later.</p><p> Deputy Durkan referred to the Single Market.  When we talk about the strategic agenda for the next few years, the biggest aspect is that it is not all about new priorities or new areas, it is about completing the commitments we have already made and the work that is already ongoing.  The Single Market is approximately 80% complete in the area of goods, but the digital market is just 30% complete.  When it comes to services, which comprise a significant part of our export economy, the figure is somewhere in between.  There is substantial work to do.  We need to ensure that everybody benefits from the completion and digitisation of the Single Market.</p><p> Deputy Durkan and Senators Coghlan and Craughwell raised the issue of enlargement.  When this matter came up at last June's European Council meeting, it was decided not to open the accession process for North Macedonia and Albania.  Having travelled to those countries this year, I am aware that a great deal of work has been done there.  We have to remind ourselves that opening the accession process does not mean they become member states.  It is a lengthy process.  It takes a number of years for countries to become member states after that process has been completed.  There has to be give and take.  When progress has been made and work has been done, we need to be able to show support and solidarity as well.  I understand that other member states have particular difficulties and challenges.  We will discuss this matter and lend our support to it at next month's meeting of the General Affairs Council.  Georgia is a member of the Eastern Partnership, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year.  It is not looking to join the EU and is not part of the accession process at the moment.  As in the instances of Turkey and other countries, these conversations are continuing to remain there without moving anywhere.</p><p> There is a huge amount of work to do on climate.  We have said we want to become leaders in this regard.  We know we are falling behind at the same time.  The next targets are not going to be targets we can reach.  That is why we are focusing on our 2030 targets, which involve a reduction of 40%.  We understand that we have significant challenges in light of the fact that 33% of our emissions come from our largest indigenous sector.  We need to work with that sector.  As many people stated, we should not engage in the "climate-shaming" of certain industries and sectors.  We need to make sure our approach is affordable, equitable and technically feasible.  It must be something people are on board with as well.  Some of the biggest challenges we have faced in recent years with regard to wind, solar or other proposals have involved ensuring communities are on board.  The way we have planned the layout of our country means that houses and other things are situated in areas that make this a much more complex and difficult matter than is the case in other countries where there may be thousands of acres without a house or community in sight.  We have to take each country based on its geography, population and concerns and try to apply this.  We are focusing on that.  We are working with the Commission on a longer-term strategy.  This has been discussed a number of times.  At a significant summit that will take place in New York in September, we will focus on young people and on how climate change initiatives can be implemented.  We are trying to be as active as we can with our European and international partners.  We have been active at home by declaring a climate emergency, by doing our cross-committee work and by drawing up the cross-departmental plan that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, hopes to implement soon.</p><p> I was also asked about the overall structure of the next Commission and the next European Parliament.  The positions are being discussed.  The initial conversation took place last night.  We want to ensure smaller member states are represented and there is a good balance between male and female representation.</p></speech>

That will be discussed.  The timeline provides that an initial proposal should be made by June.  I do not know whether that will happen.  That is the timeline which has been set out.</p> <p>  Even though the UK Parliament has voted to avoid a no-deal Brexit, that does prevent it from happening.  The only thing that can prevent it from happening is for the UK authorities to put forward a measure, a plan and a timeline for what they want to do next.  Obviously, the EU will be there to work with the UK, regardless of who assumes the role of Prime Minister later in the year.</p></speech>

We need to focus on trying to avoid that situation.  At the same time, we have to wait to see what the UK will bring forward.  It will probably be September before that happens because it will take a period of time - most likely up until the end of July - for a new Prime Minister to be elected.  It is possible that discussions will not resume until September.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked about Brexit preparedness.  A meeting of the Brexit stakeholder forum took place this morning.  Such meetings have taken place on a regular basis for the past two years.  It is heartening to hear that in certain sectors, there is a level of preparedness of between 80% and 90%.  It is very difficult for sectors of industry to prepare fully without knowing what the future relationship will be.  The issue of transportation and haulage across the landbridge continues to be raised.  Some larger companies in certain sectors of industry have already been able to change direction away from the landbridge.  It is likely that they will not go back to the landbridge even if things change and a softer Brexit is agreed.  Such a change is possible with larger companies, although not necessarily with smaller companies.  We are acutely aware of this issue, particularly given that some sailings are 20, 40 or 60 hours.  Such sailings will not be able to support the transportation of fresh flowers, particular types of fruit and vegetables and other produce.  We are very aware of that.  We do not know what type of future relationship there will be, what the landbridge will look like and what kinds of timelines through the UK we are talking about.  We can prepare as much as possible, but it is very difficult.  We are asking businesses and individuals to look at seven key steps for getting ready.  Much of this work does not involve a cost, which is extremely important.  It is not being discussed as much as it was a few months ago, but I encourage everybody to try to engage with it as much as they can in their own constituencies and counties to make sure people still have it on their agenda.</p> <p>  I was also asked about the overall position following last week's elections.  We are looking at a different composition across the leading groups - the European People's Party and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats - because they have come down in numbers.  With regard to our own position here, I wish all of our new MEPs every success.  According to the most recent survey, which was carried out by European Movement Ireland and Red C, our overall support for the EU increased last year from 92% to 93% and support for the EU among young people between the ages of 18 and 26 increased from 96% to 97%.  This continuing strong support was reflected in the elections that took place last week.  We will do our best to ensure it is reflected in our contributions in the European Parliament, at the General Affairs Council and at the Foreign Affairs Council.</p> <p>  It seems to me, based on my engagement with colleagues at the General Affairs Council and elsewhere, that there is no appetite for the reopening of the withdrawal agreement.  In terms of the Border, we need to be clear that we will not be dragged or taken out of the Single Market or the customs union with the UK if it goes.  We need to ensure that does not happen.  We need to protect the Single Market and the customs union without putting in place a border between the North and the South.  That is very complex and difficult.  It will not be good overall in terms of our economy.  We are working intensively with the Commission on this.  Before the previous deadline, the Commission travelled to Ireland, in the same way that it travelled to other member states, to discuss a number of things.  We will continue to engage with it in this regard.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome the representatives of the Mental Health Commission: Ms Kate Frowein, senior regulatory manager; Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services; and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality.  I also welcome, from Mental Health Reform, Dr. Shari McDaid, director; and Ms Kate Mitchell, senior policy and research officer.  I thank them all very much for attending.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

The Mental Health Commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  We are an independent statutory body that was established in April 2001 under the Mental Health Act 2001, under which the role of the inspector is set out.</p> <p>  Some 90% of mental health services are delivered in primary care settings.  A further 10% are delivered within specialist mental health services, including community residences.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services only, which are estimated to make up less than 1% of mental health services in Ireland.</p> <p>  The joint committee has sought information on developments in mental health services in the State.  The basis of this report is taken from recent inspection findings as well as information compiled by the commission as part of our ongoing monitoring of compliance and receipt of quality and safety notifications from services.  While the scope of the commission&rsquo;s regulation is limited, we nevertheless closely monitor developments across the broad range of mental health services in Ireland, including acute adult mental health services, rehabilitation, continuing care, child and adolescent mental health services, forensic mental health services, and community mental health services.  As a general comment, it is evident that the provision of mental health services is inconsistent across the country and lacks proper integration.  For example, a young person in need of mental health services in Galway will be able to access a vastly different range and level of services than a young person in Waterford.  Similarly, a person in Cavan-Monaghan or Sligo-Leitrim will have access to mental health rehabilitation services, while a person in Donegal will not, even though they are in the same community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.</p> <p>  The commission therefore welcomes the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which envisages a system of integrated care provision based on need rather than on location, age, or diagnosis.  We hope that this will finally realise the goals included in A Vision for Change, which set out Government policy 13 years ago in 2006.  We understand A Vision for Change is undergoing a review and refresh, and we look forward to seeing the revised policy.</p> <p>  In regulated services, we have seen a number of positive developments.  We have seen an overall increase in the national average compliance with regulatory requirements, from 74% in 2016, to 76% in 2017, to 79% in 2018.  Progress is slow but is consistently trending in the right direction.  For the most part we have seen good engagement from services in working towards compliance and implementing the judgment support framework, the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s quality framework.  There have been some notable improvements.  For example, the department of psychiatry in Roscommon University Hospital has gone from being 52% compliant with regulatory requirements in 2017 to being 83% compliant in 2018.  Another marked improvement was seen in St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital, Ardee, which went from 64% in 2017 to 93% in 2018.</p> <p>  We have also seen some improvement in fundamental aspects of care provision such as medication management, individual care planning, and consent procedures for involuntary patients.  These are positive developments but are not consistent throughout the country.  There is work yet to be done to ensure people receive the same consistent high-quality care and treatment no matter where they are located.  There has been ongoing progress towards decommissioning outdated and unsuitable buildings for the provision of inpatient services.  In 2006, 17 approved centres were operating in inappropriate institutional settings.  By 2019, only three remained, with two due to close by 2020.</p> <p>  We do, however, have ongoing concerns.  The commission continues to highlight concerns relating to the physical infrastructure of mental health facilities and premises.  Inspection reports have consistently identified concerns relating to the overall suitability of premises to meet patient needs, concerns relating to the physical safety of premises, and concerns relating to the maintenance of the premises, including basic repair works and cleanliness.  In 2018, 70% of regulated services were found to be non-compliant with the regulatory requirements relating to their premises.  It is unacceptable that in 2019 we still find service users in long-stay units living in dormitory-style accommodation and in units where one shower is shared between 20 people, and to find units which are dirty and in disrepair.  This does not respect the basic privacy and dignity of service users.</p> <p>  It is the position of the commission that there is no therapeutic benefit to the use of restrictive practices such as seclusion or physical restraint.  These practices should only ever be used as a last resort where there is a serious and urgent safety concern.  Despite this, physical restraint was used in 81% of all approved centres in 2018 and 97% of acute adult services.  Seclusion was used in 42% of all approved centres in 2018 and 65% of acute adult services.  We are concerned that there is a lingering complacency in the use of these practices.  In many services, these practices are accepted and commonplace.  Such practices directly affect a person&rsquo;s human rights to liberty, autonomy and bodily integrity.  We have seen little real engagement in the proper scrutiny and reduction of these practices by the mental health services</p> <p>  In a recent report, I highlighted serious concerns regarding the provision of general health services to persons with severe mental illness in continuing care approved centres.  People with a severe mental illness will die, on average, 20 years earlier than the general population for largely preventable reasons unrelated to their mental illness.  Following a review of ten services across the country, I highlighted inadequate and inconsistent monitoring of patients&rsquo; physical health needs and inadequate and inequitable access to essential healthcare services.  The commission has sought a national response from the HSE to address these serious concerns.</p> <p>  I also have concerns about the provision of specialist rehabilitation and recovery services for people with enduring mental illness.  This can be summarised as a lack of appropriate housing for people to move to more independent living; too few rehabilitation teams - we only have 48% of the number recommended by A Vision for Change; existing teams which are poorly staffed; and a lack of localised community and inpatient specialist rehabilitation units.  We have a large number of people who are still residing in institutional care who, with rehabilitation and recovery services, could live more autonomous, satisfying lives as part of their own communities.</p> <p>  While the statutory scope of mental health regulation is limited to inpatient services, as inspector I have the statutory power to visit and inspect any premises where a mental health service may be provided.  Over the past three years I have been undertaking a systematic review of all 24-hour nurse-staffed community residences in the State.  There are 118 such community residences across the nine HSE community healthcare organisation areas, accommodating more than 1,200 service users.  The residents of these services are often in long-term accommodation and the community residence is their only home.  They represent a large number of potentially vulnerable adults with enduring mental illness whose voice is rarely heard.</p><p>The community residences are often poorly maintained, too big, institutionalised, restrictive and at times not respectful of service users&rsquo; privacy, dignity and autonomy.  Many residences were in poor physical condition, with 19% of those inspected in 2018 requiring urgent maintenance and refurbishment.  A significant number of people living in these residences should, with appropriate support, move to smaller, less institutionalised accommodation.  These units remain without regulatory oversight or safeguards, despite the number of units and vulnerability of service-users accommodated in such units.  Over a number of years, the Mental Health Commission has called for these residences to be regulated.  Regulation would allow the commission to enforce changes where deficits and risks are found, protect the human rights of people living in these residences and help mental health services to provide care and treatment in accordance with best practice standards. <br/><br/>At the end of 2017, I reviewed the provision of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This review highlighted a number of concerns about the provision of the services nationally.  These include: poorly staffed community teams - overall the staffing in 2017 was 60% of that recommended in A Vision for Change<i>; </i>the number of young people admitted to adult units, which the commission had continued to raise as a concern across a number of years; the variation in funding for CAMHS across the CHOs, which varies from &euro;40 <i>per capita</i>in CHO 5 to &euro;92 <i>per capita</i>in CHO 2; the lack of out of hours emergency CAMHS both for assessment and for inpatient beds; and waiting times of up to 15 months for non-urgent outpatient appointments with CAMHS teams.<br/><br/>The commission recommends national oversight and governance to address the ongoing concerns within regulated mental health services, noting that the ongoing and widespread nature of the concerns points to systemic issues that will not be addressed with a solely local or regional focus.  The commission recommends that the revised national mental health policy, A Vision for Change,<i></i>should reflect the aims set out in Sl&aacute;intecare, in particular a focus on the provision of integrated care based on need, not on location, age or diagnosis.  The commission recommends putting proper regulatory safeguards in place to uphold the human rights and ensure the safety and well-being of persons in specialist community-based residential mental health services, that is, 24-hour nurse supervised community residences.The commission recommends the establishment of an out-of-hours mental health service for young people in crisis, including a clear pathway for their families and loved ones.  The commission recommends the proper provision of funding ensure there are adequate services for persons with severe and enduring mental illness, including appropriate accommodation, general health and rehabilitation services.The commission recommendations the prioritisation of funding to ensure all accommodation in residential mental health services - approved centres and community residences - are safe and fit for purpose.</p></speech>

We welcome the attention that is being given by the committee to the area of mental health.  By way of background, the prevalence and impact of mental health difficulties is significant and growing.  At any time, one in ten adults in this country has a mental health difficulty, while almost 20% of young people aged 19 to 24 and 15% of children aged 11 to 13 have experienced a diagnosable mental health disorder at some point in their young lives.  The number of people disabled by a mental health difficulty is also growing at an alarming rate, with a jump of almost 30% in the numbers reporting a level of mental health difficulty that was disabling between the censuses of 2011 and 2016.  Importantly, such difficulties can be more debilitating than most chronic physical health conditions.  For example, people with mental health disabilities are nine times more likely to be outside the labour force than the general population.  This is the highest proportion for any group of individuals with disabilities.</p> <p>  The cost of mental health difficulties is enormous, with figures suggesting it may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries.  This would equate to approximately &euro;12.4 billion based on Irish figures.  To put this in context, a research study on the cost of childhood overweight and obesity estimated the total lifetime cost in the Republic of Ireland to be &euro;4.6 billion per annum.  Untreated mental health difficulties contribute significantly in terms of cost.  It is imperative that mental health is recognised and afforded appropriate priority within the wider health agenda to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease in Ireland.  This will require a substantial increase in mental health funding, including in budget 2020, both to sustain existing levels of service and to develop new mental health services and supports.</p> <p>  I would like to draw the committee's attention three major issues of concern this morning, namely, governance and accountability in mental health services, protracted delays in reform of Ireland&rsquo;s Mental Health Act 2001 and the implementation of national mental health policy.  It is very important to acknowledge the positive developments that have been achieved across the mental health system at local, regional and national levels.  Mental Health Reform recognises the dedicated work of Government, its agencies, public representatives, direct service providers, and the community and voluntary sector.  These achievements include the development of clinical care programmes in areas such as self-harm, eating disorders and early intervention in psychosis; the introduction of a national framework for recovery in mental health; and the pilot of advocacy services in child and adolescent mental health services.  Some positive developments that have been initiated at the primary care level include the introduction of assistant psychologists, the expansion of Jigsaw services and the piloting of e-mental health supports.  Mental health has also received significant attention in the Oireachtas through Seanad and D&aacute;il debates and, most significantly, the establishment of the Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.</p> <p>  While all of this progress is welcome, it has taken place in the context of new challenges.  The mental health system suffers from a severe lack of capacity in the face of increased demand, which has pushed the mental health services to breaking point.  While efforts have been made in recent years to make up for some of the losses, the old adage of mental health as the Cinderella of the health services is clearly evident in the continued under-resourcing of mental health services and supports.  The shortfalls in mental health service delivery are further reflected in the lack of out of hours crisis services for both adults and children.  We are disappointed that despite the recruitment of new staff as part of a planned roll out of seven day services across adult community mental health teams, only four additional areas are reporting a seven day service.  In April, HSE mental health confirmed that there is no planned date for completion of the cost and implementation plan for providing seven day child and adolescent mental health services.  Not only are the child and adolescent mental health services not able to provide 24-7 support around the country; there is not even a date for producing a plan to see how that can happen.  A participant of Mental Health Reform&rsquo;s national My Voice Matters consultation noted that &ldquo;outside of office hours [there is] no professional to turn to when in crisis- at the weekend for example.  [It] makes no sense that people in this day and age still have to go to A&amp;E as [a] first resort. [It] doesn&rsquo;t help the patients&rsquo;&rsquo;  The inspector for mental health services has recently reported &ldquo;appalling standards&rdquo; in certain mental health inpatient units and the Mental Health Commission has recently published a report on the lack of physical health care monitoring of individuals in a number of inpatient services across the country.  There are myriad other gaps in mental health service provision, including a lack of resources in CAMHS, which has a fundamental impact on access and quality of care.  As of September 2018, in the most recent figures we were able to identify, almost 2,500 children were on the waiting list for CAMHS, of whom over 12% were waiting more than 12 months.  Lengthy waiting lists also exist in primary care psychology and there are significant challenges for particular client groups to getting access to mental health services, including those experiencing homelessness and those from ethnic minority communities.</p> <p>  We are also deeply concerned with reports from service users of poor quality in mental health services.</p><p>Our national My Voice Matters surveys found that over 40% of service users indicated that they had a poor experience of HSE mental health services.  Almost 40% indicated that they were not involved as much as they would like in decisions about the medication they take.  Two thirds reported that they did not have a written recovery or care plan developed with their community mental health team.  Among family, friends, carers and supporters, over 70% were dissatisfied with the extent to which HSE mental health services had considered their support needs.  We draw a direct link between the resource issues and the experience of the quality of the services capable of being provided.</p><p> In terms of governance and accountability, we acknowledge that between 2013 and 2018, there was an increase of approximately 20% in the mental health budget and of 28% in mental health spend.  Despite such progress it is important to acknowledge that it still has not brought us to the same level of funding that was being provided in 2008 before any implementation of A Vision for Change had taken place.  Investment in mental health services continues to fall well below international standards.  In 2019, just 6% of the total health budget was allocated to mental health, representing an ongoing trend in recent years of significant underinvestment.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that mental health spending increase to 10% of the overall health spend.</p><p> A report prepared for the Department of Health by the Work Research Centre identified that a comparative positioning of Ireland internationally suggests that the percentage resource allocation to date is lower than in some of the countries with better developed and better performing mental healthcare systems.  The data available indicate levels of allocation of between 10% and 30% in countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK.  Recent developments to invest in Ireland's forensic mental health services and the introduction of the service reform fund in the HSE, including the national roll-out of an evidence-based approach to supported employment for people with severe and enduring mental health difficulties, are welcome.  However, investment in mental health services and supports must continue and must be increased on a much greater scale to effectively improve the mental health outcomes of Ireland's population.  We recommend that public expenditure be increased to 10% of the health budget within ten years to be in line with international standards on mental health funding as a proportion of the overall health budget.</p><p> In addition, there continues to be no national mental health information system to report on the full extent of resources, provision, quality and outcomes for community based mental health service delivery.  For example, there are no data on the number of people in community mental health services who have an individual care plan, the number of individuals offered a talking therapy, the wait times for such therapies within mental health services and the employment and housing outcomes for people using the mental health services.  Mental Health Reform has been calling for such a system in budget submissions since 2013.  It is unacceptable that more than 13 years after publication of A Vision for Change there is no information system to account for the almost &euro;1 billion in public expenditure on mental healthcare each year.  We recommend that an interim system for gathering key performance information on the mental health services be put in place as a matter of urgency.</p><p> We note that the restructuring of HSE governance and accountability structures in 2018 led to the dissolution of the HSE's mental health division and the abolition of the post of national director of mental health.  Despite the appointment of senior management officials responsible for leading on mental health operations and mental health service planning and strategy, it must be considered that the dissolution of these structures within the HSE on mental health may have an adverse effect on driving the reforms necessary to ensure the delivery of a modern, recovery-focused mental health system that adequately protects the human rights of adults and children.  We recommend that the post of national director for mental health and the mental health division be restored to ensure coherent leadership in mental health at national level and clear authority and accountability for a distinct, national mental health budget each year.</p><p> With regard to mental health legislation, we have consistently advocated for reform of the Mental Health Act 2001 in line with the expert group recommendations on review of the 2001 Act, to ensure that people have their rights adequately protected when they go into hospital for mental healthcare.  The Minister has recently announced that the general scheme of the Bill on reform of the 2001 Act will be complete in June 2019 and ready for the Mental Health Commission's consideration.  Given the lengthy delay so far and noting that the expert group's report was published in March 2015, we are asking for a date for publication of the full reforming legislation before the end of 2019.  It is also of fundamental importance that the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, signed into law by the President in May 2018, is commenced as a matter of priority to ensure that those small but significant changes can be made immediately to the 2001 Act.  This includes that people are encouraged and supported to make their own decisions about their mental healthcare.</p><p> Implementation of the national mental health policy is a concern.  Significantly, the oversight group tasked with reviewing Ireland's current national mental health policy is due to complete its work and the publication of its report is imminent.  In accordance with the terms of reference of the group it can be expected that there will be a much greater focus on early intervention and prevention, mental health in primary care, improved access to mental health services, the development of services to appropriately meet the needs of particular groups of people, such as individuals experiencing homelessness, people from ethnic minority groups and those engaged with the criminal justice system, and the social inclusion of people with mental health difficulties.  It is an understatement to say that many stakeholders were disappointed with the pace of implementation of A Vision for Change.  It is imperative that the revised mental health policy is supported by a costed and timelined implementation plan and the establishment of robust monitoring and review mechanisms.</p><p> I will conclude this statement with the comment of one of the participants in the My Voice Matters survey: "It has been seven years since my first contact [with the mental health services] before I have gotten the help I need which I do feel the course of time waiting made a lot of things worse in my life".  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to members' questions and comments.</p></speech>

It is great to see, yet again, a full panel of female witnesses, which is extra welcome.</p> <p>  The Darkness Into Light walk, which was held recently, brought the issue of mental health to the fore.  As a result of that walk, people were sharing their stories more frequently than they normally would have.  I acknowledge everybody who took part in the walk and those who organised it.  What do the witnesses think can be done to decrease the stigma of mental health issues?  Have they any ideas on how something could be included in the education system, particularly in national school, whereby a child growing up to become an adult realises it is okay not to be okay and would never think otherwise?  Obviously, the wheel turns and those young children will become adults, so it is a win-win situation in that people will feel better and it is cost effective because it will not cost the health system as much for treatment and so forth.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  There were many questions in both submissions.  Do the witnesses often meet the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly?  What are his answers to those questions?</p></speech>

My concern is about stigma surrounding serious mental illness.  That has not been tackled as enthusiastically as it might be.</p><p>People who have a serious mental illness and may need inpatient care from time to time, or who need help with vocation and accommodation, experience stigma.  It is to do with a lack of education about mental illness, especially serious mental illness.  People do not realise that those who suffer from a serious mental illness recover and can, and do, live lives in the community the same as any other citizen.  The way to tackle that is through more education and publicity around the fact that it is okay to have a mental illness, they are like other illnesses in that they can be treated and people can live lives the same as the rest of us.  That is my feeling on it.</p></speech>

When I think of mental illness, it is the lower form of it rather than the more serious end I am thinking about.  Dr. Finnerty's suggestion that there is still much stigma with serious mental illnesses is interesting.</p> <p>  Have our guests any ideas for the educational system?</p></speech>

We do meet him and we have requested to meet him soon particularly about the findings of the My Voice Matters surveys, which give a national picture of people's experiences of mental health services.  We are awaiting a date from the Minister of State in that regard.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Mitchell, to answer the questions about stigmas and schools.</p></speech>

In terms of the broader question around stigma, some fantastic initiatives are happening at national and local levels.  This month sees the green ribbon See Change campaign which has done fantastic work in raising awareness around, and promoting positive attitudes towards, mental health.</p> <p>  Research shows that attitudes towards severe mental health difficulties are still very much lagging behind.  We can see that through research carried out quite recently by the National Disability Authority.  Members of the public are not as comfortable working with, or living beside, people with mental health difficulties in comparison with individuals in other disability groups.  We still have a way to go in challenging attitudes towards more severe mental health difficulties.  Measures need to be taken to better support employers in recruiting and retaining people with mental health difficulties and local authorities in placing individuals in secure housing and so on.</p> <p>  Some wonderful work has been carried out by schools, teachers and principals in promoting the mental health of students and ensuring their mental health needs are addressed.  We need to see that happening at a national level through national protocols and processes.  National guidelines were produced for both primary and post-primary schools in 2013 and 2015, which promoted mental health and well-being.  There have been concerns about the lack of implementation of those and lack of resourcing and training for teachers and so on.  The key point is that schools really need to be adequately resourced and their staff trained and supported to push that forward.</p></speech>

The board and chief executive officer of the commission meet the Minister on at least an annual basis and meet the officials from the mental health division in the Department on a quarterly basis.  We addressed all of the matters we have raised today at our last meeting with the Minister.  He advised of commitments in relation to staffing including putting assistant psychology posts into primary care and looking for consultant psychiatrists because we are finding those posts difficult to fill at the moment.  Those were the Minister's priorities.</p> <p>  We also raised the governance issue with him prior to the appointment of the new director general.  We spoke about the structures and, as Dr. McDaid said, we advocated for a national director for mental health and the national offices to be put back in position.  We found that unit and the national director very helpful from a governance and accountability perspective and it is not as effective in the absence of that office.  We addressed that with the Minister at our most recent meeting and he advised that he will allow the new director general to find his feet before discussions take place about that.</p> <p>  As Dr. McDaid said, we are expecting the legislation in June and very much welcome it.  We have had two welcome legislative changes in recent times.  One removed the unwilling treatment of people who are detained.  People are no longer forced treatment against their will and we welcome that from the perspective of safeguarding and human rights.  The most recent legislative change removed 12-month orders, so people can no longer be detained for that duration.</p> <p>  We table Vision for Change at all our meetings with the Minister.  We have asked to be consulted about the refreshing of the policy and look forward to receiving a draft of that.</p></speech>

Monitoring is really important because somebody can be prevented from developing cardiac problems.  By monitoring things such as waist circumference, body mass index, BMI, or bloods and so on, one can stop the development of cardiac problems if one gets in early enough.  That is the difference between treating somebody proactively and someone ending up in an intensive care unit.</p></speech>

I join with my colleague in saying it is a refreshing and welcome change to have an all-female panel.  People will be jumping onto Twitter now to give out about me saying that.  They had better preface that by showing examples of them giving out on occasions there has been an all-male panel.  People do not give out about that.  I welcome the all-female panel and the witnesses are all very welcome.</p><p> Reference is made in the Mental Health Reform submission to the piloting of e-mental health supports.  Britain is using a crisis text line, Shout, which comes from an American-based model.  I have concerns about e-health in general.  I am not convinced of its merits but I have very particular concerns regarding e-mental health and e-mental health supports.  I would be interested in our guests' views on e-mental health as a back-up when there are other services on offer and, in particular, on abandoning traditional services in favour of online supports.  If we give someone an app, that is not the same as offering him or her real support.  It is not going to where the person is at; it is simply fending off a problem and not actually dealing with it.  I would be interested to hear our guests' views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00200"><p>Mental Health Reform has been looking at e-mental health or digital mental health in recent years because we are the Irish partner for a cross-north-western Europe project to explore this.  Mental Health Reform wanted to be in that role because we are in a position to open up the discussion about digital mental health, to explore the pros and cons involved and to facilitate knowledge sharing so people, in the professions as well as service users and service providers, can be fully informed.  There is a basis for figuring out what that role should be.  What we are seeing in the evidence is that it is effective, particularly in a blended therapy approach.  What we mean by that is that digital mental health support is a complement to the support that is provided by a mental health professional.  Particularly in primary care, one could think of a digital mental health support as being book-ended by an initial consultation with a mental health professional and then follow-up with a mental health professional.  In between, however, we are getting pretty good evidence that the online programme, particularly online cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, is something people can do.  In addition, the mental health professional is always informed as to how he or she is getting on in the programme.  The information is available in order that the mental health professional can see the progress.</p> <p>  What does it do?  First, it makes the mental health support much more accessible to people wherever they are.  This is a significant issue.  For example, I have heard of situations where, for example, mothers with young children find it very helpful to be able to access a mental health professional online because it is very difficult for them to get organised and have the opportunity to go to an appointment on their own.  For people where stigma is an issue, digital mental health can help them to access support whereby they do not have to go onto the high street and into a clinic that says "mental health" on the storefront.  We think there is potential.  We are really interested in exploring that and discovering how to ensure that it is done in a safe way and on the basis of good practice.  We held a joint seminar with the Psychological Society of Ireland last year to make sure that we are all learning about the appropriate way to bring digital mental health into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00300"><p>The difficulty I have is not that there may not be a place for it in a functioning mental health system but that we have a dysfunctional mental health system and the supports do not exist at the moment.  This is something I have recently taken an interest in.  My worry is that this is a cheap way of offering support.  It is, obviously, always going to be less labour-intensive and all of that.  Dr. McDaid stated that a person may not want to walk down the high street and walk into a shop with a sign up advertising "mental health supports".  However, those supports are not there so that option is not there either.  It is not that people are saying that there is a range of supports available to them and that they wish to choose the one that is being offered online.  My concern is that people are saying there is literally nothing available.  They want to talk face to face with a person and to be the one who walks down the street and goes through that door.  They are actively seeking help but all they are getting is an app.</p> <p>  Dr. McDaid makes a very relevant point that this may be appropriate where it is book-ended by professionals, where they are available.  My fear, and my understanding, is that these crisis text lines do not necessarily deliver this type of support.  As the studies go on, there will be evidence that they operate as a complement to services, which is not necessarily a bad idea, but if they are the service itself, they will be wholly inadequate.  In a space where we have difficulty recruiting and retaining staff, this becomes nearly an outsourced way of doing it.  That is where my concerns would lie.</p></speech>

We have to look at what people who might need that help want, whether they are what we call mental health service users or people with low-level mental stress who are looking for early intervention.  We have to look at what they want and their preferred options.  Many people will still want to see someone face to face but some will feel more comfortable with a digital or online option.  It is about creating that choice for people.</p></speech>

It is not to fill a gap without having the full support structures in place.  Second, it is most important that those who are providing the service are regulated either by an oversight body like ourselves or a professional regulator, so there is governance and oversight of such a service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052900002#K00600"><p>Would it make sense that these services should be put to one side for the moment in favour of developing the more traditional services?  Telemedicine is quite new.  I have to put my cards on the table and state that I do not like it, although that is my personal opinion.  I would prefer to see a doctor or mental health professional.  In the absence of services being developed, I would caution against going down the road of telemedicine.  Every person who has spoken has said it is okay and it might be positive as a complement to existing services.  The difficulty I have is that if we go down that road before we build up the other services, it will become increasingly less likely that we will develop the other services and we will simply have the idea that what was intended to be the complement to the services becomes the only service.  I caution against that.  I ask that we park that for the moment and focus solely on the development of the services that are so lacking.</p> <p>  I live in north County Dublin.  The waiting times there for children to access a person face to face are running up to 30 months.  I would be nervous that families who are in crisis, and getting further into crisis as the wait goes on, would simply be offered an app or some version of telemedicine without the additional support and then, because all the staff are under pressure, the box is ticked to indicate that the supports are in place.  There is a space for the telemedicine service or the e-mental health support to complement existing services but, in the absence of existing services, I do not believe the telemedicine model will work or be effective.  It is not intended to be the service; it is intended to be the complement to the service.</p> <p>  Dr. McDaid makes a very good point that mental health service users should be consulted and their opinions should be sought, and the service they want and need should be delivered for them.  However, my fear is that the service will be developed because it is cost-efficient and is much cheaper than another version of it.  That is where the focus will go and it will no longer be on making up the deficit.</p></speech>

I think we have an estimate that 300,000 adults in Ireland will have a mental health difficulty at some level over the course of a year.  Our counselling and primary care service has capacity to see 11,000, less than 10% so we need both and we need both urgently.  We need to build up the digital mental health supports and the options for using them throughout the mental health system but we need to do it safely and in a way that recognises the integral and vital role of mental health professionals in our mental health system.</p></speech>

I have one very brief question that relates to attendance at accident and emergency units.  I know because there are people in my constituency who have come to my office because they have had to bring a loved one to an accident and emergency department.  The person does not have a physical ailment but he or she literally has nowhere else to go so the only door that is open to him or her is the accident and emergency door.  It is the last place these people want to be.  Could the witnesses talk about the impact of this?  As a former trade union official, I represented nurses, many of whom were in accident and emergency departments, and I know the impact it has on staff.  These are people who want to do their best but might not have the training to cope with a person who is experiencing mental health distress and who finds himself or herself in an accident and emergency unit.  Could the witnesses describe the impact on the individual?  I know the impact on staff members is horrendous but the witnesses might be able to describe the impact on a person who has to go to an accident and emergency unit.  What happens to the person after he or she presents at an accident and emergency department, which we all agree is the last place the person wants to be and the last place he or she should be but in some instances, is the only place where he or she finds an open door?</p></speech>

Mental Health Reform has carried out consultations in different parts of the country for a number of years.  It is one issue where we heard consistently from people who use the services when they experience a mental health difficulty, family members and mental health professionals and what we have heard echoes what Deputy O'Reilly saying, which is that when somebody is in mental distress, he or she is in crisis and an accident and emergency department is the last place he or she wants to be.  It is not an appropriate environment.  It can be quite distressing.  It can be very noisy and chaotic and in many situations, the person is waiting for an extremely long period of time to be seen by a mental health professional.  In some cases, people will leave before they get the support they need, which can lead to tragic consequences.</p> <p>  Mental Health Reform has been advocating for out-of-hours mental health services.  We received a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to roll out seven-day-a-week services in all parts of the country for adult mental health services.  Recruitment has been completed for about 36 of the 48 posts required to deliver on that roll-out, with an additional eight posts accepted but the implementation of this 7-7 provision is slow, so it is important that we see the implementation of that as a matter of priority.  In many areas of the country, there are no 7-7 or 24-7 mental health services for children and young people, who must go to an accident and emergency unit when they are in mental distress and crisis.  Often when they go to an accident and emergency department, they do not get to see a child and adolescent mental health professional but are seen by an adult consultant psychiatrist.  Many families and children have to wait quite a considerable amount of time to get that crisis support.  We would say that there needs to be a roll-out of 24-7 services for children and young people.  It is really important that this is implemented as a matter of priority.  </p></speech>

With regard to after hours, in nearly all places, it is the accident and emergency department people arrive at.  There are some services that do provide an eight-to-eight or seven-to-seven service and there are few that provide a limited seven-day service but it is very limited.  The other difficulty in some places is that when people do come to accident and emergency departments and are seen by the psychiatrist, the units to which they would be admitted are full.  This leads to all kinds of difficulties such as people staying long periods of time in accident and emergency departments and people being discharged from accident and emergency units when it may not be the best thing for them.  During office hours, in most cases, there are day hospitals or areas where people can come and see somebody in an emergency so that they do not have to go to an accident and emergency unit.  In some places, there are home-based treatment teams that will go out and assess somebody in his or her home but it is very patchy and inconsistent across the country.</p></speech>

In a scenario where one can schedule appointments and only hit that crisis between 9 a.m and 5 p.m., even at that, someone is still not guaranteed that he or she will get the service he or she needs.  This is unscheduled care no matter which way one looks at it and having a nine-to-five service is no use to someone at midnight.  It is very regrettable not just for the patient but also for the staff, who can do nothing for the patient, and is something that must be worked on.</p></speech>

Regarding the variation in terms of spending across the CAMH service, particularly the &euro;40 to &euro;92 per capita variation, is that caused by a local need or investment in outdated services or structures?  What is the main cause of that?  There is a significant difference - more than double - that needs to be addressed because if that is a symptom of what is happening across the board, it is a serious problem.</p></speech>

The service in Galway is a particularly proactive service that has developed a number of good practice initiatives such as advocacy.  It has an emergency bed and other beds in that region and has developed the services very well.  That in itself attracts people to come and work in that service.  CHO 5 finds it particularly difficult because it cannot get staff to work in that area, which down the line decreases the chances of getting people - either allied health professionals or consultant psychiatrists - to come and work in the service.  The service in Galway is a very established one going back many years and has attracted funding in order to maintain that whereas the CHO 5 area would be a new service that does not have beds and finds it very difficult to get inpatient beds for CAMHS.  There are a number of factors.</p></speech>

For example, I have an idea as to why staff cannot be found to work in CHO 5 but I would like to hear it more graphically.  There should be no patchiness in the system.  It should be equal across the board.  We need to know what the cause or causes are and if there are particular causes, which I think we know, we must address them.  Can we do that?</p></speech>

A considerable number of years ago, the commission conducted a review and the result indicated there were enough inpatient beds within our jurisdiction for CAMHS and that the problem lies in community services, whereby care and treatment that could prevent people warranting admission are not available.  We have spoken about waiting lists and waiting times.  It then comes to the point in time when people do need admission.</p> <p>  The commissioners made the decision on the structures and where to locate the CAMHS units.  They are located in Galway, Cork and Dublin, including in St. Vincent's Hospital in Fairview.  These were decided by the commissioners.  Only three of the units provided by the State take in those aged under 16 years of age.  Again, this is a reduction in the number and capacity.  The commissioners decided on the age groups that would be admitted to these units.  With regard to the lack of provision, the commission has repeatedly requested that the provision of 24-7 out-of-hours services and community services be developed.</p></speech>

Some of these children were admitted more than once and some had a tragic ending.  To what degree does the system as it is now interact with these children, identify them and try to protect them and provide the type of services that they require?  They may be in a difficult home situation.  There may be addiction involved and a variety of issues contributing detrimentally to their particular situations.  In these circumstances, what do the witnesses see as being the most immediate and urgent intervention to address the issues?</p></speech>

The figures on presentations of self-harm continue to be significantly high among our younger population.  A HSE national clinical care programme has been introduced on self-harm presentations to emergency departments.  This has been in operation since 2014.  I believe it has been expanding to each emergency department throughout the country.  My understanding is that 24 emergency departments now have a dedicated self-harm specialised clinical nurse in post, with the aim of expanding this to the three paediatric hospitals.  As far as I am aware, this issue is being addressed to some extent through the self-harm national clinical care programme.  It will be very important to continue to review the programme and monitor it to ensure it is being implemented effectively.</p></speech>

It will be important in the future that there is consistency and standardisation in how it is rolled out throughout the country and how it is implemented in various hospitals throughout the country.  There are certainly other measures that need to be put in place.  It is not the full solution.  For example, there is a requirement for more out-of-hours services and crisis services for children and young people to support that need.</p></speech>

The difficulty, as Ms Mitchell and I have said, is this it is not available in every area.  Obviously this is concerning and we recommend an out-of-hours CAMH service available for accident and emergency departments so children who present, particularly at that age, are picked up by the CAMH services.</p></speech>

To what extent do we have this in place?  From my dealings, and I am sure everybody here can point to similar dealings, I can point to cases where this did not take place, where there was a void and, as a result, there were tragic consequences.</p><p>To what extent do CAMHS identify children through the schools and offer them support, reassurance or whatever is required?

Clearly, CAMHS are very under-resourced.  They have approximately 56% of the recommended number of staff.  Inevitably, those services retrench.  They heighten the criteria for admission because they feel that they cannot cope.  There was also a major increase in demand - it is believed to have been 25% - for CAMHS.</p></speech>

In the face of that, staff will increase the threshold at which people can access mental health services.  Ironically, it may be more difficult now for CAMHS to do the kind of outreach and interaction in schools that they should be doing than might have been the case ten years ago.  The Deputy is correct to state that it should be happening.  If a school has a concern about a child, it should find it relatively easy to contact CAMHS and get advice, support and guidance on whether the child should be referred, but we do not get a sense that this is routinely available across the country.  I am just pointing out why that might be the case.  It is not enough simply to blame CAMHS and say that they should be more open.  There must also be adequate mental health support throughout the system - within the school, in primary care and in CAMHS.</p></speech>

Where one has double the funding of an area that is under pressure, there is a gap in the system.  Information exists, and I would like it to be made available to the committee.  Could we have a report on the extent to which CAMHS in areas that are underfunded are meeting, failing to meet or for whatever reason unable to meet targets compared with those areas with different funding chains?</p></speech>

The committee should bear in mind that the HSE used to publish an annual report on CAMHS but, as far as I am aware, it is no longer producing those reports annually.  We would welcome it if the committee requested that the HSE get back into the practice of publishing the annual report on CAMHS.</p></speech>

As a child grows older, a parent - especially a mother - can have a concern about restraints and the child not taking medication or being supervised in that regarding to the extent that he or she should be.  The progression of the child's condition may be a contributory factor.  How do we reassure the parent that the child is safe when seeking treatment or while in respite care?  We need to reassure parents so that the State is seen as a helping, supportive and fair instrument for dealing with their children's conditions.</p> <p>  My final question is on housing and a matter that we have all encountered.  Adults, including young adults, may have been sleeping rough before being referred to what used to be called sheltered housing, although it is no longer sheltered to the extent that it should be.  We must try to ensure that the person is in an environment that is supportive and does not undermine his or her self-confidence and self-esteem and where the person and his or her family can feel that they can rely on it for the best possible treatment.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my submission, we have concerns about the residences that are supervised over 24 hours.  We would like to see them respecting the autonomy and dignity of those residing there, both through how they treat the residents and through the environment in which they live.  In 19% of such residences, the environment is unsatisfactory.  Something needs to be done about that as a matter of urgency.  Since the residences are also large, there is a tendency for people to become institutionalised, lose their independence and stop being part of the community.  That is why the commission is anxious that these residences be regulated.  While I can inspect them, we cannot enforce action because the Mental Health Act does not allow us to do so.  We recommend that they be regulated, as that would help us to ensure that those residential places were suitable for people, be they young or elderly.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's first question, it is difficult to reassure people about medication, its effect on someone or how the illness will progress without knowing the circumstances of that particular person.  The clinical team is best placed to do that.  In such cases, every effort should be made for people to communicate with the treating team and for the family and young person to be involved in his or her treatment.</p></speech>

It is important that we acknowledge the work, dedication and commitment of everyone working in the mental health services, which is a very demanding area.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a few issues, some of which have already been touched on.  I will first address CAMHS and my experience from dealing with parents who have come to me about the issue of medical practitioners.  I know of a case where someone would have had access to a consultant within a short time if he had just lived a half mile up the road, but there was no medical consultant in his own area.  I do not understand the geographical boundaries that are being used to determine who a person sees.  If someone is in the wrong area at the wrong time and there is no consultant, that person might have to wait anything up to 18 months to see someone.  I have had to deal with such a situation.  The parents of a 16 year old had to monitor their son non-stop for those 18 months.  CAMHS would not get involved until he was assessed.  If there is not a consultant, I do not understand why some other process is not in place to ensure that a case is handled.  The parents ended up taking their son to an accident and emergency department, but he was sent back home without an additional care plan being put in place.  This issue needs to be addressed.  Why are there geographical boundaries?  We do not have that type of boundary in maternity services.</p><p>Why do we have it with adolescent mental health?</p><p> The second issue is the growing challenge that we will now have to deal with of people who are non-Irish and who have come to Ireland without the kind of traditional family support that one might see in Ireland.  I had a case recently, for example, where a non-Irish girl had been in Ireland for approximately 12 years and had no family in Ireland.  She was in rented accommodation and had serious mental difficulties.  The landlord got her GP to see the girl because she would not go to the GP herself.  The GP's response was to contact me as a public representative for the area but four weeks later she was still not getting help.  I got on to the public health nurse, who told me she could not attend the girl unless she is requested to do so by the GP or somebody else in the HSE.  There were four weeks during which there was no action but eventually the landlord took a recording of the person because she was going downhill very fast.  Only when played the recording did the GP go to see the person.  The person in question was admitted to psychiatric services for eight weeks but is now back in the community and in the same residential accommodation.  The landlord has told me the person must leave by 30 June but I cannot source a back-up service.  This is one of many problems where we have many non-Irish people who, unfortunately, will end up in a position without backup from a family.  We will end up with people like this on the street.  What do we need to bring about forward planning with this matter?</p><p> The third issue relates to balancing of cost.  I had a case of mid-30s person and, in fairness, the HSE was doing its best.  It had to apply two care assistants to the person in question because assistants working on their own had been assaulted.  A package was done to provide care for the person in the community and the cost was &euro;130,000 per annum.  There must be a way of dealing with a case like that, where a person has good and bad days but the assessment is the person should be out in the community as opposed to being in a more definitive care position.</p><p> The fourth issue concerns the lack of information.  I know a guy for a long number of years and I spoke to his family recently as I received ten or 20 emails per day from the person.  The person is now under the care of mental health services.  The family has distanced itself from the person because of difficulties, and the family is convinced that the use of illegal drugs over a long period caused a long-term mental health problem.  We are not getting the information out there that the use of illegal drugs can lead to mental health issues.  There is not enough information out there for young people in particular.  I have come across a number of cases where people have been in perfect health before getting into drugs and they now have long-term mental health problems, with no road back.  How is it proposed to deal with this?  Must we put much more information out there?  Where do we start with such a process?</p></speech>

There have been some difficulties over the past few years filling posts for CAMHS consultants, and there have been occasions when in certain areas there has not been a consultant available to provide a service.  Sometimes they will cross over from another area or community healthcare organisation to try to pick up any of the emergency cases.  I know CHO 5 ran into some difficulties with that and the services from other areas went through the waiting list, with urgent cases being seen and so on.  That was not ideal at all and the difficulty was in recruiting a consultant psychiatrist.  The posts had been approved.  Dr. McDaid has done some work on the topic of non-Irish patients.</p></speech>

We have been calling for some time now for the mental health services to develop a programme of cultural competence for staff in bringing about a culturally sensitive service.  This will have to apply to mental health care delivered in primary care as well and it is about ensuring the system is equipped to support people from different ethnic communities and new communities coming to Ireland.  That extends not just to developing a level of staffing competence in providing services to people from diverse cultural backgrounds but also to planning for services that have adequate capacity to support individuals in distress in those circumstances.  That is really where the Senator's story hints at a failure to adequately plan for a new situation in Ireland, which is a more diverse community.  I would welcome it being a priority within the HSE for them to plan for services that can provide support for people from ethnic minority communities coming into the country.  It will probably need to do that in partnership with other services around the country, such as the direct provision system.  There needs to be communication and collaboration between those who organise direct provision and mental health services.</p></speech>

There are a number of people who have very complex psychiatric needs and they require very expensive packages for care.  They are either treated outside this jurisdiction or else the care is provided by a private company with the health care assistants or mental health nurses providing care for them.  It is expensive but there is no facility in Ireland currently where people with such complex needs and high staffing requirements can be treated.</p></speech>

The cost of keeping the person in the community is very high.  A number of years ago, that person would have been kept for a substantial period in more permanent care but that seems to have totally changed.  The argument put to me is the person in question is not suitable to be in the community.  Members of that person's family have suffered injury after being assaulted, as have care workers.  There is a concern as to whether this was the right decision.</p><p>There seems to be a reluctance to keep a person in more clearly defined care.  Referral into the community is the preferred option, but the appropriate support services may not be available.  Even where they are, there can be a difficulty in finding staff and then with the cost of staffing.  <br/><br/>Returning to the CAMHS issue and the geographical divide, I still do not accept that because there is a boundary half a mile up the road from a person's house he or she should have to wait <i>ad infinitum</i>.  <br/><br/>My other question is about the definition of &quot;urgent care&quot;.  I think a 16 year old teenager who is borderline in respect of self-harm, or whatever the issue might be, requires urgent care.  However, the system seems to be telling parents that it is necessary to go on a waiting list to see a consultant and that CAMHS cannot become involved until a full assessment has been made.  Something has to change.  Geographical boundaries should not apply.  If one consultant is not available, some process should be set up immediately to ensure no one will be left in limbo.  The family to whom I am referring were left in such a situation.  Other families in the same area are caught in the same dilemma.  No assistance was being offered for a long time.  That issue has to be dealt with.</p></speech>

Anybody who needs urgent care should be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist or the CAMHS team.  </p> <p>  On the geographical areas, the HSE has divided the country into community health care organisation, CHO, areas, within which there are various sectors.  I am not sure how strong the boundaries are between each team or CHO.   However, anyone who needs urgent treatment and intervention should be seen.  There should be no question of telling someone that is not possible because he or she lives in a certain area.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

This issue highlights the gaps in staffing in the mental health service.  A consultant psychiatrist might be not available in one area, but there may be one available a few miles down the road.  There is a waiting list in the particular catchment area, which highlights the need for enhanced efforts to recruit the required consultant psychiatrists.  There is also a need to focus on the recruitment of allied health and social care professionals.  We need an increase in the numbers of psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists in order that children and young people and their families can access services when they require them.</p></speech>

That is the position set out in legislation and policy.  If the committee is to look at the issue, it will need to examine it in the context of the existing legislation.  There are other jurisdictions, the United Kingdom for example, where a consultant psychiatrist is not required to make the assessment and take on the role of clinical lead.  That is not the case here.</p></speech>

No one is taking responsibility.  The question arises as to who is in charge in the area once an adolescent mental health consultant is not available.  Who takes responsibility when such an issue arises?  Mental health consultants do cover the particular geographical area, but they do not deal with adolescent mental health issues.  There is buck passing going on.  No one is taking responsibility, even though the person concerned is living in the area.</p></speech>

I refer to the governance of and accountability for the service.  We cannot see it happening and would like to see the issue being addressed so as to rule out the possibility detailed by the Senator.  There should be an individual who could be held to account for the care and treatment of a child or adolescent in such a situation, but that is not the case.  </p> <p>  Turning to the point made by Ms Mitchell concerning the legislation, it only pertains to children who require involuntary admission.  They must be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist.  A very small proportion of children are admitted under section 25 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We advocate that an assessment be undertaken by any member of the team whenever a child or an adolescent presents at an emergency ward or elsewhere.   As Dr. Finnerty stated, such a presentation should be regarded as an urgent need and the child or adolescent addressed by a consultant.</p></speech>

It is helpful that the Senator has brought up this broader point about the evidence increasingly showing that certain illegal drugs seem to have an association with severe mental health difficulties.  I refer, in particular, to psychosis, where there seems to be a link with certain drugs.  We need to get out that message.  One of the issues on which we are not focusing enough is the prevention of mental health difficulties.  We may never be able to cope with demand if we do not put more effort into prevention and educating people about how they can prevent mental health difficulties.<br/><br/>The Senator's point is well made.  However, a challenge often arises with people who have a history of addiction or misuse of illegal substances when they present with a mental health difficulty.  Too often in our system they are turned away from one service or another.  They are told that they have to sort out their addiction issues before they can be seen in the mental health service or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is probably more often the case that a person ends up in addiction services when he or she also needs mental health service supports.  Those supports are not being deployed in an integrated way.  I hope that failure will be addressed in the revision of A Vision for Change.  I do not think that policy was very helpful.  It seemed to conceive of addiction issues and services as being separate from mental health difficulties, unless there was a clear mental health difficulty prior to addiction.  I hope the next mental health policy will recognise much more that substance and alcohol misuse often feature among those with mental health difficulties and that holistic support is needed.</p></speech>

I have some generic questions.  Can the witnesses name one or two critical issues, areas or services that are outside the health services and that have a significant impact on the people about whom they are concerned?  On prevention, which Dr. McDaid just mentioned, we have the analogy that it is better to prevent people falling into a river than to be trying to pull them all out in time.  Are we spending too much effort on trying to save people, as it were, and not enough on keeping them well most of the time?  I am not suggesting that resources be taken from one and given to the other.</p><p> I also have a couple of questions for the Mental Health Commission.  It was great to see the executive summary it provided with the bullet points.  The summary states that there are some good things happening.  It also sets out six areas, forensically but briefly, where there are serious issues.  It states that "basic and fundamental aspects of care and treatment in regulated health services continue to be lacking", that there is "lingering complacency around restrictive practices", and that a large number of specialist community health teams remain without regulatory oversight.  It cites a lack of rehabilitation supports for people with enduring mental health services; the whole issue of the physical health needs of people with enduring mental health needs; and the provision of child mental health services in the community.  I want to focus on the second last item.  What is the interaction in respect of general health, disability and other conditions?  How might that be dealt with differently?  The drugs thing was almost a parallel issue in terms of trying to slice and dice people.  </p><p> The Mental Health Commission is the regulator of mental health services.  It is also there to protect the interests of people admitted and detained under the 2001 Act, which is quite a critical and long overdue provision.  It is, dare I say, therefore locked into people who are in services or who are on the cusp of being so.  We have heard it set out eloquently by Senator Colm Burke.  What has the commission to say about people who are not in services and should be?</p><p> Turning to Mental Health Reform, it sets out three major issues in the first page of its presentation, governance, accountability and protracted delays in reform of the 2001 Act.  We hope we do not have to wait as long as from 1945 to 2001 to get the next Act and get things moved on.  Reference was also made to implementation of the national mental health policy.  I refer to the United Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Will the witnesses comment briefly on what it requires, what Ireland has said it is going to do and how this relates to A Vision for Change and the Mental Health Act?  The second page of Mental Health Reform's presentation states "the Irish mental health system suffers from a severe lack of capacity in the face of increased demand which has pushed the mental health services to breaking point".  What is actually meant by that?  When is that going to happen if something does not change?</p></speech>

The Senator is right that our remit extends only to inpatient services in respect of enforcement and compliance of the services.  We register them.  Our remit does not extend beyond that, although the inspector has the right to visit anywhere a mental health service is delivered.  We have no enforcement or powers beyond that.  We have advocated and have recommended today that our powers be extended.  It would give us more powers in being able to look and to address many of the members' questions, which we are not able to answer because we do not have the full picture of a pathway of a patient through mental health services.  We are only looking at the 10% of people who are inpatients.  We do not have oversight of the rest of the mental health services, where the majority of them are delivered.  This is a deficit.  There is no oversight of a patient's journey through mental health services provision.</p> <p>  The protection element is a very important piece of work.  We see ourselves as safeguarding those who are the most ill and who require involuntary detention.  Through our offices, we establish the tribunals to ensure their rights are upheld.  It has been a very welcome provision for the people who have to go through that process that they are afforded those rights and protections.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked about the critical issues outside of the health remit.

Many people who have a mental health difficulty would identify themselves that if they could just get adequate housing, it would help them to recover.  If they could just get support to help them into the daily routine of employment or participating in the community, for example, as a volunteer or parent, this would be as important for their recovery, if not more so, than some of the medical treatment they will receive.  They are not alone in thinking that because the evidence on the impact of having secure housing and employment is very good.  For instance, when we see in the social welfare system that about 50% of people on disability allowance identify mental health as their primary concern, we know that we do not have a well functioning mental health system.  It should not be the case that people who have a mental health difficulty and want to work do not routinely get the support they need to get back into work.  We welcome the national roll-out, under the service reform fund, of support for people with severe mental health difficulties to get back into work.  That is a pilot programme and needs to be mainstreamed.  In housing, no one should be in an inpatient for the sole reason that he or she cannot get housing.  That is a very inefficient use of resources, yet it is the case in inpatient units around the country.  We have seen evidence of this.</p> <p>  Another area which may not be as closely related to what would help people recover but is nonetheless symptomatic of the weaknesses in our system is the extent of mental health difficulties arising for people who are in the prison system and on remand.  Between 40% and 60% of people on remand have a diagnosable mental health difficulty and between 5% and 10% of people in the prison system have a severe mental health difficulty.  That is not the appropriate place to recover from a mental health difficulty.  It will not help them to recover.  We need to look closely at the supports in the prison system and ensure that people in the prison system who are experiencing mental distress get good quality supports and all the support they need to ensure their mental health difficulty does not reduce their ability to get back into the community.</p> <p>  I would like my colleague, Ms Mitchell, to answer the question on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  While people with a mental health difficulty do not always identify for themselves as having a disability, that convention has many powerful messages and commitments that can positively impact on people with mental health difficulties.</p></speech>

The Government acknowledged this in its roadmap for ratification of the convention.  This is evident in several parts of the Mental Health Act, for example, voluntary patients do not have basic rights to information on their estimated length of stay in hospital.  People who are inpatients detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 do not have a legal right to an advance directive by which they can, when they are well, set out their wishes and preferences for their treatment.  The advance directive then comes into effect when they become unwell.  People who are detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 are the only group of individuals who are excluded from that right to a legally binding advanced directive.  We are also out of compliance in not having individual care planning on an statutory footing and the lack of statutory rights around advocacy services and supports.  Many provisions in the Mental Health Act 2001 require reform and must be updated urgently to ensure we are in compliance with international human rights standards, including the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  On A Vision for Change, it is clear that many aspects of the policy have not been implemented or implemented to full effect.  This was evident in Mental Health Reform's most recent national consultation of people who use mental health services.  For example, for 13 years, the national mental health policy has stated that all individuals accessing mental health services would have an individual care recovery plan.  More than two thirds of respondents to the survey reported that they were not aware of having a written care recovery plan.  The national mental health policy explicitly states that people should have access to key working but many of the people using the services report that they do not have access to that kind of support.  A similar issue arises with regard to service users being listened to or involved in decisions on medication.  There is a significant gap between what is in the policy and what is happening in practice.  The revised mental health policy offers a very positive opportunity to address some of those issues.  We need to ensure implementation of the revised policy and one way to achieve that is to cost a timelined action plan to ensure there are robust monitoring review mechanisms in order that we do much better this time.</p></speech>

My target is to conclude by 12.30 p.m.</p> <p>  I hope I will not go over ground that has been covered.  Reading the opening statement last night, governance and accountability in the health service stood out.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts which have discussed CervicalCheck and the national children's hospital project.  Key to fixing all this a change in governance structure, which is a magic wand that is waved at us when something goes wrong.  Overspends in hospitals are one issue but if the witnesses have a serious concern about governance and accountability in mental health services, the net effect of poor governance are the catastrophic instances of people dying prematurely.  Will the witnesses outline their experience of how bad governance or weakness in governance can have catastrophic impacts on patient outcomes?</p> <p>  On the devolution of powers to regional bodies, Deputy Durkan, the Chairman, Deputy Harty, and I sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee at which we discussed community health organisations and having proper boundaries among the hospital groups.</p><p>Are the witnesses saying to us that we need a national director of mental health steering this from the top and then filtering down that direction to the organisations?  Coming out of this committee, we want to make it clear what the witnesses want because if bad outcomes have catastrophic impacts on families and on people's lives then we have to act because it is not an accident.  This is an emergency as far as I am concerned.</p><p> For the doctors and the medics present, when there are gaps in funding or staffing, how does it affect their approach to treatment and their approach as professionals?  I cannot outline every permutation of a situation but are consultant psychiatrists and teams ending up in situations where, for example, they see person A at 14 years of age and they want to carry out a considered pathway of care for this particular individual but because the resources are not there, they have to go to the tier 2 or the tier 3 of the treatment where they decide that they do not have cognitive behavioural therapy, social services, clinical nurses or psychiatrists so they will just medicate in a holding situation?  I am a pharmacist by profession although I do not practise anymore.  Is it a case that people, young or old, are getting suboptimum treatment to keep them in a holding position?  To what extent is that happening?</p><p> The increased demand was mentioned and I find that concerning.  In some ways it is good because people are recognising that there is an issue and perhaps openness towards mental health is the reason for that.  Maybe it is just that there are more conditions or there are more presentations but it is very concerning if there is an increased demand.  Although I can see that the budget has increased, it has not increased at the same rate.</p><p> Dr. McDaid or Dr. Finnerty spoke about the threshold and how that makes treating medical professionals feel they literally have to nearly triage the level of emergency.  I do not want to get into the witnesses' personal lives, but in terms of going home and sleeping at night when they are looking at that threshold and that funding, are they lying there in bed wondering if that person should have got over the threshold and if they have made the wrong decision?  Are they being forced to make suboptimum decisions because they just have to prioritise the services to those who are most at risk?</p><p> I refer to the institutionalisation in residential care reference mentioned by Dr. Finnerty in response to Deputy Durkan's question about homelessness.  Trinity College Dublin has a longitudinal study on growing up in Ireland and I read some findings that were brought out at the start of the year.  There were negative effects from the recession on children and families and their mental health.  I cannot remember the detail but I am sure that is the case because it is a well constructed study.  I mention the people living in direct provision; 13 years ago I was working in Athlone with the Lissywollen site as a pharmacist and I cannot believe those people are still there as I was telling them it would be over soon.  Can anyone quantify the long-term effects on those people's mental health?  In this scenario 13 years have been taken out of people's lives  - they have been deskilled, the ability to have a home has been taken from them and there are other issues affecting women with children who are particularly vulnerable.  Is this the inquiry of the future?  That is what I am getting at here.</p><p> I want to finish off my questions and then I will take the answers.  The next bit I want to speak about is the separation of addiction and mental health and international best practice.  I have heard anecdotally in the real world that people cannot see a psychiatrist until they stop taking drugs.  Is it normal in other jurisdictions to stream these two illnesses or conditions?  It does not seem in any way logical.  If a person is taking drugs because he or she is self-medicating for an underlying mental health issue and then he or she comes off the legal or illegal drugs, he or she is in limbo and his or her mental health needs are still not met.  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on that and maybe outline what the best way is of sorting this out.</p><p> Another issue that came to me as I have been sitting here this morning is that I have a bit of legislation going through the D&aacute;il, and we will be looking at it here in the committee, about the regulation of the advertising of fake cures and treatments for people with cancer.  On the influence of social media on vulnerable people who have mental health issues, some people are so bad that they will target people who have stage 4 cancer and tell them that by standing on their head and rubbing cat's urine into their hair, for example, it will cure it.  Is this happening across mental health and psychiatric units?  Is there any market out there that the witnesses know of or that they have come across?  That is just an aside I thought of this morning out of personal interest.  Is there a notable social media influence, a negative impact and a targeting of people with mental health illnesses with rogue treatments or suggestions that big pharma is out to get them?  Is that prevalent these days and is it an issue in providing care?  Do people drop out of the services because somebody on the Internet is going to fix them and not the professionals?</p></speech>

I might answer the question about doctors and how they feel about gaps in funding and treatment.  I am a psychiatrist but like the Deputy I do not practise clinically and have not done so for some time.  On gaps in funding and treatment, consultants have told me about the worries they have about how to provide a service for people when it is basically not there.  An example of that might be to take somebody who has a severe and enduring mental illness, who is in a continuing care unit and who is capable of moving to more independent accommodation.  There may be a small rehabilitation team who want that person to move on and who have provided the best they can but there is no housing for them to move into, no employment or vocational training for them to move on to and not enough support in the community for them to live a more independent lifestyle.  That person stays where he or she is within the continuing care unit despite the fact that the doctors and the team feel that this person could move on.  That person's life is affected by the fact that there are gaps in services and funding.</p> <p>  At the other end of the spectrum the same thing happens in CAMHS services as well.  A person who may be assessed by a consultant or by one of the team may be unwell but there might not be any accessible beds in the system at that time for that young person to be admitted.  That is where the Deputy's point about sleepless nights and worries comes into it because that young person may be unwell and, as was mentioned, the parents have to look after that child because there is no accessible place for that person to go.  Yes, doctors worry, other team members worry and families worry about that.</p></speech>

A good example of this is the statement the HSE made in the service plan this year.  The plan stated clearly that the HSE will have to essentially make choices about providing services to some people and not providing services to others because mental health services did not get the full funding that they needed.  The HSE is essentially saying that it has to ration services.  That is how the statement translates.  It means the HSE will have to make choices that some people with get mental health treatment while others will not because the mental health services will not have adequate funding for the year based on what those responsible know the demand will be.  The real tragedy, as has been pointed out, is that when people do not get mental health treatment their mental health deteriorates and they get worse, sometimes with the worst of outcomes.</p><p> Moreover, we do not know, and we have no way of knowing as far as I can tell, how much this is going on or who is being helped and who is not or what those decisions are.  A good example is in emergency departments.  We have a self-harm liaison service and admissions through accident and emergency departments.  We know people who are admitted through accident and emergency departments get help but we do not know how many people are turned away from accident and emergency departments.  That information is not kept, so we have no idea how many people have showed up at accident and emergency in distress but who have not gotten any service.</p><p> That runs throughout the mental health services.  We do not know how many people are helped.  We do not know how many people go into mental health services who feel they need a holistic range of supports but maybe only get one type of support but not the others they need.  We have some indications from our survey of people who have used mental health services.  They say they have got talking therapies.  The findings were encouraging in that more people said they were getting talk therapy than we had expected.  However, it is still the case that many people say they only saw one mental health professional.  Many say that within the mental health services their experience is of medication being the predominant mode of treatment.</p><p> We really do not have robust consistent regular transparent information about what is going on in our mental health services and of course that is concerning.  We have hundreds of people living in high-support accommodation and medium and low-support HSE accommodation but we do not know the quality of the service they are getting apart from the inspection reports that have been done on an informal basis, so to speak.  We do not have those services regulated.</p><p> I will say what I have said to the committee in the past.  It is an urgent priority to get better quality more transparent information about what is happening in the delivery of our mental health services so that we can then attest to whether people are getting the services they need.</p><p> There was a question on the separation of addiction and mental health.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental issue.  We hear consistently of adults and children not getting access to mental health services because they have a dual diagnosis of mental health difficulties and addiction.  My understanding is that there are practices in operation in other jurisdictions that focus highly on integration between addiction and mental health services and co-location of addiction counsellors on mental health teams.  I gather that is proving effective.  Within the Irish context there has been a pilot involving integration between addiction, mental health supports and co-location of addiction counsellors on a mental health team.  This is the "no wrong door" approach piloted in north Tipperary.  It proved positive outcomes in terms of people being able to access the services they required as well as showing marked improvements in their mental health and well-being.  We really need to look to these kinds of initiatives in Ireland in terms of what is working.  We need to look at rolling them out at a national level.  However, it requires a multi-pronged approach in addition to co-location of addiction counsellors on teams.  That is happening in certain areas but it is certainly not happening everywhere.  There is also a requirement to increase the capacity within community mental health teams to support people with addictions.  That applies across the disciplines.  We need to increase capacity and adequately resource addiction services so that they can provide low-level mental health support.</p> <p>  We also need formal processes and protocols to ensure collaboration and integration between addiction and mental health services.  It requires significant investment attention and focus to ensure we see progress in this area.</p></speech>

I suppose I am around a long time.  When I started, addiction counsellors were on mental health teams.  There were usually one or two addiction counsellors.  That has continued in some areas to this day.  We believe that addiction, whether it is the cause of the mental illness or because of the mental illness, needs to be addressed in a holistic way of looking at people to try to help them.  There certainly has been a move to silo it.  That ties in with what I was saying about physical health.</p></speech>

It took the view that treatment of addiction problems should be in the community and outside mental health teams.  That approach has continued.  I hope that innovative change, review and refreshed thinking will see that looked at again.  I hope to see more holistic and person-centred treatment.  Ideally, addiction counselling, physical health and other areas would be part of that care pathway.</p></speech>

Since the commencement of the 2001 Act in 2006 we have seen several iterations of governance structure within the public sector.  We do not see similar structures in the private sector, which we also regulate.  We have gone through several people who are responsible.  There have been occasions when we did not know who was responsible and accountable, although the Act provides for a registered provider or proprietor.  In the case of the public sector, this is the director general of the HSE, who devolves down the function.</p><p>That can be devolved down to anybody the director general deems fit to be considered for the role, and it can be at different levels of authority.  The person does not always necessarily have the remit over funding, for example.  Therefore, he or she does not really have the authority to exercise any change within their remit.  I was asked for an example of that.  It can be clearly seen in the inspection reports and the levels of non-compliance within the different CHO areas.  Even within the CHO areas, the disparity of compliance levels within the regions will be seen.  It is one service that is provided by one provider and the question must be asked why in one area a service can be compliant and people can receive a good quality service while down the road people are not receiving the same type of service, despite the fact that it is the one governor and the one commissioner of that service.  This is why we ask and advocate for a national office for mental health with oversight of and responsibility for the delivery of mental health services.</p><p> We would also advocate in the area of regulation.  The Act and the regulations do not provide for us to have oversight of governance arrangements, which would be unlike our sister regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and also unlike other jurisdictions that have such statutory regulatory oversight for governance.</p></speech>

Reference was made to regulatory compliance improving by some small percentage points year on year.  What are the areas with non-compliance?</p></speech>

We have a very comprehensive data set spanning across a number of years that allows us to take a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to identifying concerns.  Across most of the areas there is improvement.  As Dr. Finnerty has said, it is slow and modest improvement.  There are some areas, however, where improvement is lacking.  That would be in areas such as unsuitable or unsafe premises or cleanliness of the premises.  There could be issues around privacy, medication - which is still low - and staffing and staff training in particular.  We continue to have concerns around those areas.  As my colleague Ms Smyth has pointed out, we do see high compliance in some parts of the country and in some sectors.  There is no explanation as to why in some areas or in some CHOs compliance should be so much lower when it is the same provider.</p></speech>

We have very strict regulations around housing in the housing sector, but are there regulations for accommodation in hospitals?</p></speech>

It is very broadly stated and there is a lot of room for interpretation within that.  As Dr. Finnerty has pointed out, we do not believe it is suitable that people continue to be in dormitory-style accommodation, especially for long-term accommodation.  There is, however, no regulatory prohibition on that.</p></speech>

If there is any gap in those 25 steps the approval may be delayed and it could be up to 18 months before a service could recruit a nurse.  Is this an issue given that recruitment is national rather than regional?  Sl&aacute;intecare includes a proposal for regionalisation of services, one aspect being that regions would have autonomy in the recruitment of staff.  Is it an issue that recruitment and retention is too centralised?</p></speech>

This does not just apply to nurses.  It also applies across the board into the allied health professionals.</p></speech>

This leads to a reduction in services, prolonged waiting lists and poor outcomes for patients, unfortunately.  Senator Colm Burke spoke about the lack of consultants making decisions.  Unfortunately, we now have non-consultant hospital doctors who are filling the gaps, and not just acting up to consultant level.  It may be that the non-consultant hospital doctor is the only person who can man an outpatient department.  This is not satisfactory.  How can we overcome that?</p></speech>

The non-consultant hospital doctors are doctors in training to become psychiatrists or to become GPs.  The level of training differs.  One could have a person who has just started his or her training or a person who is finishing the training making those decisions, taking outpatients and so on.</p> <p>  On the recruitment of consultants, it is very difficult to recruit consultants in an area where there are no consultants, if the committee gets what I mean.  In an area where there is an active service, where teams are well staffed and there is good training and continuing professional development then one will tend to attract the consultant psychiatrist.  We can see this around the country.  In areas where teams are poorly staffed or where there is long-term difficulty in recruitment of consultants, one finds that retention is also a difficulty.</p></speech>

That team disintegrates quicker due to the lack of support.  Staff who work in psychiatry, and in other areas of medicine, do not have adequate support from the HSE to allow them to work effectively and efficiently.  They burn out much more quickly.  Are there any moves within the HSE to put in additional supports to support staff?</p><p>A member of staff is a fantastic resource to have.  To allow such people to burn out and leave seems to be very uncaring on the part of the employer.</p></speech>

We are back again to the spiral.  The difficulty is to release the staff for training because they do not have enough staff.  It is a spiral.  As we do not have the critical mass of staff, it is very hard to retain those who are there without introducing motivating factors.  Even when motivating factors such as training are introduced, staff find they cannot be released.  It is a big problem.</p></speech>

However, they do not necessarily need the services of CAMHS.  They do not need a psychiatric service; they need a much more supportive service.  However, CAMHS tends to be the catch-all for everyone in distress, which then blocks appointments and places for people who are in genuine need.  Is there a way to direct people to a more appropriate service other than CAMHS?  Talk therapy is generally what these adolescents need.  Unfortunately, however, talk therapy is very difficult to get.  That also goes into adult psychiatry.  Owing to a lack of talk therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, occupational therapy and all the other therapies to help people with mental illness, the prescription pad is the easy way out.  I believe a considerable amount of unnecessary medication is prescribed because the other support services are not available.  How can we address that?</p></speech>

I am hopeful that the assistant psychologists in primary care will address some of that need, even though there are not many of them.  I mentioned Jigsaw.  Young people can go there to get that kind of support where a serious mental illness is not involved.  I have been told by nearly all the teams in CAMHS that they are absorbing everybody with any mental health difficulties.  They sit on waiting lists, meaning that people with serious mental illness cannot be assessed and treated.  Triage is going on and some areas have managed to get their waiting lists right down, but there are very few community services for the less seriously ill and there they sit on the waiting lists.</p></speech>

It is deeply concerning that people are in HSE-supported accommodation that is unregulated.  I do not think any other residential services within the health service continue to be unregulated.  In light of what we have seen in other parts of the health service in that regard, I believe that would be an urgent priority.  We should ensure people have the right to make decisions about their own mental health treatment.  Removing the exclusion of people with mental health difficulties, who are involuntarily detained, from the provisions under the advance healthcare directive is a priority.  People who lack the capacity to make decisions should have their rights protected and there should be oversight of their circumstances.  People lacking capacity under the current law can still be considered a voluntary patient and therefore there is no tribunal and no requirement for independent oversight as to the reasons they are in hospital.  That is a very significant concern.</p> <p>  In all circumstances there should be the right to advocacy support.  We have the right to a lawyer in the context of a tribunal, but we do not have the right to the kind of representative or peer advocacy to ensure that everyone who is in hospital for mental health care has the support they need to make their voice heard and to be supported to address concerns they have about their treatment.</p> <p>  Those are some of the priorities.  Voluntary patients can also be quite vulnerable when they are in hospital.  I am concerned that there is no legislative requirement to provide voluntary patients with information.  People who are voluntary patients may often not even be sure about their status and whether they are voluntary or involuntary.  They will not necessarily know about the provision of an advocacy service or other rights they may have when they are in services.  Ms Mitchell might point out anything I have missed.</p></speech>

I would also stress the importance of placing individual care and recovery planning on a statutory basis.  People should have a legal right to that kind of care and recovery planning.  The legislation should contain specific children and youth principles, so that there is particular consideration for the voice of the child, with children and young people being involved in decisions about their care and treatment.  We specifically need to address the issue of age of consent when young people go into hospital for mental health care and treatment.  Currently 16 and 17 year olds are not presumed to have capacity to give consent to admission or treatment.  It is really the only area of the health sector where that exists.  In every other area of the health sector, 16 and 17 year olds have a legal right to consent to their healthcare.  That area also needs to be updated urgently.</p></speech>

Given the need to deal with patients with dementia who can no longer live at home, are there plans to develop specific dementia services within our health services?

More widely, there is a need to ensure adequate mental health services are integrated in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is relatively light on mental health.  There was a rationale for that insofar as there was an anticipated review of A Vision for Change.  Such a revised framework needs to be fully part of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.  It needs to be perceived as part of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.  The Sl&aacute;intecare reforms will not work if mental health is not integrated into them.</p> <p>  I give the example of the new GP contract.</p><p>The new GP contract, about which I have only read in news reports, refers a lot to support for chronic diseases.  We know, for instance, in the case of diabetes care, that it costs 50% to 75% more to care for someone with diabetes when the mental health aspects of the disease are not being addressed.  I encourage the health community to look out for mental health as an issue in the implementation of all the health service reforms.  Unless mental health is integrated in all of those locations, the system will be far more expensive than it needs to be.</p></speech>

We concur with everything she said and agree that all of those areas need to be addressed.  In addition, as I outlined to Deputy O'Connell, the registration section of the Act needs to be addressed.  Part 5 of the Act is taken from nursing home legislation from the 1990s and needs to be amended in order that it is fit for purpose in the context of a modern mental health service and the registration and regulation of same in the modern era.</p></speech>

In making a decision to decriminalise cannabis, one would have to look at the evidence very carefully and weigh up the risks on a population base.  Certainly on an individual basis, in my past life, I saw people who had major difficulties because of cannabis use.  It needs to be thought about very carefully.</p></speech>

Is anyone looking at the Portuguese model and the impacts on the population?  Do the witnesses have any information on that?  Is it their professional opinion that if there were magical powers within a particular compound that has been around for generations, they would have been noticed before now?  I am concerned by many of the claims being made for cannabis.  I am very much in favour of a compassionate approach to drug use in respect of the links between addiction and mental health but some of the claims being made are such that patients would not need any other tablets if they had access to cannabis.  That is the narrative at the moment but many of us are concerned about the erosion of the good work that professionals such as the witnesses have done over the years.  As with our discussion of the Kardashian effect last week, we are concerned that some celebrity's opinion is considered equal to a body of evidence.  I find that concerning not just in this case but in every case of medical treatment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for affording me the opportunity to present the proposed Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019.  As I outlined at previous meetings of the committee, the regulations will provide planning exemptions for limited short-term lettings further to the primary legislative amendments introduced in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019, which was recently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently signed into law by the President last Friday.  Under the procedural requirements of the Planning and Development Act, both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be signed into law by the Minister.  The consideration of the draft regulations by the committee today is part of that statutory procedural approval process, although we have already discussed the proposals at length.</p> <p>  These regulations supplement the provisions introduced regarding short-term letting in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  The regulations provide for the definition of "short-term letting" as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for periods not exceeding 14 days, and that the use of a house or apartment for any short-term letting, as defined, in a rent pressure zone will be classified as a material change of use of the structure for planning permission purposes.  Supplementary to the primary legislative provisions in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act, the draft regulations provide for certain specific exemptions from planning permission.  Home-sharing, that is, the letting of a room or rooms in a person's principal private residence, will continue to be allowed on an unrestricted basis and without the need for planning permission.  Home-sharers will also be allowed to sublet their entire principal private residence, be it a house or apartment, for short-term letting for a cumulative period of up to 90 days annually where they are temporarily absent from their home, again without being required to obtain planning permission.  Where the 90-day threshold is exceeded, the planning exemption provided for in the regulations will no longer apply and change of use planning permission will be required.</p> <p>  However, the main change in the new arrangements provided for in the Act and the draft regulations is that where a person owns a property in a rent pressure zone which is not his or her principal private residence and intends to let it for short term-letting purposes, he or she will be required to apply for change of use planning permission unless the property has a specific permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.  It will be up to the local planning authority to make a determination on such planning applications and, as I have outlined to the committee, it would be highly unlikely that planning permission would be granted for such short-term lettings in rent pressure zones except in limited and specified circumstances which will be outlined in advisory guidelines to be issued to planning authorities.</p> <p>  The regulations also provide for specific reporting obligations on persons engaged in home-sharing and short-term letting.  In the first instance, a person engaging in home-sharing in his or her principal private residence will need to register it with his or her planning authority.  Furthermore, persons engaged in home-sharing of their entire home, that is, their principal private residence, be it a house or apartment, will need to notify their planning authority of the period or periods for which they intend to use their home for home-sharing, when they have reached the 90-day threshold for home-sharing in a principal private residence, and confirm all the details of home-sharing undertaken at the end of each year.</p> <p>  While the draft regulations presented here differ slightly from previous drafts discussed by the committee, there has been no major change to the substance of the proposed provisions.  The changes made are primarily structural or presentational in nature from a legal drafting perspective.  Two additional changes have been made since the previous draft was presented to the committee with a view to strengthening and tightening up the enforceability of the provisions.  First, a statutory declaration provision was inserted requiring persons engaging in home-sharing in their principal private residence to make a statutory declaration that the reporting and notification information being submitted to their planning authority is true and correct.  Second, a fairly broad provision has been inserted empowering planning authorities to request such other information as they may reasonably require for the purposes of establishing that the information submitted in the reporting forms specified in the regulations is true and correct.</p> <p>  These provisions are aimed at ensuring that persons engaging in short-term letting of a second property, that is, a property which is not their principal private residence, do not make a false declaration that the property in question is their principal private residence for the purpose of trying to avail of the planning exemptions in respect of such second property.  Where a person makes a false declaration for the purposes of the reporting obligations and to circumvent the short-term letting provisions in these regulations, it will be an offence prosecutable under both the Statutory Declarations Act in addition to an offence under the Planning and Development Act.  The regulations do not place any reporting requirements on persons letting out a room or rooms in a house or apartment that is not their principal private residence on the basis that such persons are not entitled to avail of the planning exemptions provided for in these regulations.  Instead, in a rent pressure zone, it will be a clear requirement that such persons are obliged to apply for change of use planning permission and, as indicated, it will be up to planning authorities to determine such planning applications.</p> <p>  As outlined at previous briefings with the committee, the new legislative changes will not affect homes, apartments or larger housing developments which have a specific grant of planning permission for use as holiday accommodation and short-term letting.  The new provisions will also not affect normal house or apartment letting for periods in excess of 14 days, such as executive lettings or lettings under the rent-a-room scheme.  In addition, the new legislative arrangements will only apply to short-term lettings in rent pressure zones as designated under section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, which are the areas of the highest housing demand, and will not impact in any way on short-term lettings outside of rent pressure zones where housing pressures and demand are less acute.</p> <p>  I commend the regulations to the committee.  They are essential to support and underpin the recently enacted primary legislative amendments aimed at regulating short-term lettings as incorporated in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  As I outlined previously, the primary objective of these new legislative reforms is to encourage the bringing back of houses and apartments in rent pressure zones which are being used for short-term letting purposes to the traditional long-term rental market, thereby helping to ease the accommodation shortage pressures currently being experienced in this area.  I thank members for their positive engagement in the consideration and development of these short-term letting legislative proposals, which I am hopeful will have the desired effect.  We have circulated copies of additional documentation, as I committed to do at the previous meeting, including a draft of the advertisement that will go into all the national and local newspapers, a draft web page for inclusion on the website, and a draft frequently asked questions document that will likewise be published on the website and which may be helpful to Oireachtas Members in contacting and liaising with constituents.  In addition, there is an outline of the initial guidance that will go to planning authorities on the change of use provisions and those limited specific circumstances that will be taken into account where permissions are sought in rent pressure zones.  That guidance will issue to planning authorities on Tuesday of next week.  If, subsequent to this meeting, the regulations are approved by positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force on 1 July 2019, which is concurrent with the commencement of the primary legislative amendments in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  As such, it is my intention to sign the regulations into law at the earliest possible date.</p></speech>

He should not be lulled into a false sense of security as I will be back for the second part of the meeting.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of the Minister and his officials on this.  Despite our disagreements in other areas, these are important regulations which I fully support.  The Minister confirmed the statement he made yesterday on the floor of the D&aacute;il that, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas this week, the regulations will be enforceable from 1 July.  That is very welcome.</p><p> I have a couple of minor technical questions by way of clarification so that members of the committee and the public are clear about what this involves.  My understanding of the definitions in the regulations is that A1 refers to a room or rooms in a person's property, whereas A2 is when someone is letting out the full property.  Will the Minister confirm in plain English that that is the case?  Will he also explain, again in plain English, the difference between forms 15, 16 and 17 and the different functions they have?  I am thinking about the people who will have to fill out these forms.</p><p> I only have one reservation which I raised on Committee Stage.  If I am reading this right, there could be a requirement for hosts to correspond with the local authority four times in one year.  They would need to notify the local authority of their intention to seek the exemption at the start of the year, correspond with the local authority 45 days later and again 90 days later and correspond with it again at the end of the year.  The Minister might clarify if I have that wrong but that is the way I read it.</p><p> Subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, the regulations will come into effect on 1 July.  This means that people who will not be eligible for this exemption will have to apply for planning permission.  Many of these people are asking about the period between 1 July and the time a decision on planning permission is granted.  What is the status of any lettings those people have booked in at the moment?  I presume a certain level of common sense will prevail and it will only be at the end of the planning process, when a decision has been taken, that this will be enforceable.  Will the Minister shed some light on that to give clarity for all concerned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#D00200"><p>I very much appreciate the support we have had through this process.  This is very much a working committee and we get work done through heavy lifting around legislation and other changes we need to make.  That is very much in evidence here when we look at what we are trying to do on short-term letting.</p> <p>  For clarity, A1 relates to home sharing and A2 relates to short-term lettings.  To clarify for members of the public, home sharing refers to the sharing of one's own home or principal private residence, be it a room or the entire home, for a period not exceeding the cap of 90 days.  Short-term letting is when the relevant property is not a person's private residence and home and it is being rented out on the short-term letting market.</p> <p>  There will be no cost for interacting with the local authority, which is an important point.  We are not putting any cost burden on people.  Most people will only need to communicate with the local authority twice a year, namely, at the beginning and end of the year when they inform the authority of what happened during the year.  Form 16 is filled out when the 90-day cap is reached in one year but most people will not reach that level.  Most people who do home sharing of their entire property will do so for the two weeks they are on holidays in the summer or a series of weekends at times they are away.  Most people will only interact with the local authority twice in a year.  They might have a third interaction if they reach the 90-day cap.  We have removed, on the advice of the committee, the 45-day interaction.</p> <p>  These regulations will be the law on 1 July.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in the Chamber yesterday so that people could be clear, early in the week, that this must happen this week.  I particularly thank the Seanad for moving so quickly with the primary legislative changes so that we could proceed this week and have the regulations in place for 1 July.  This will be the law.  People who have a second property that they have been using for short-term letting can apply for planning permission through the normal planning permission procedures.</p> <p>  We will communicate with the local authorities in rent pressure zones the need to use common sense while an application for permission or retention is live.  That said, certain local authorities, such as Dublin City Council which has been to the forefront on this, may already be involved in applying this in certain respects.  That is a separate matter and we will not interfere in that because the council is the planning authority and makes its decisions independent of the Department.  However, we have asked for common sense to apply.  It is worth stating that we have been very clear about what we have been planning to do since October last year.  The only real change has been that the date moved from 1 June to 1 July.  There was uncertainty as to whether these changes would only apply in rent pressure zones and that was clarified earlier this year.  People have known that these changes are coming.  We have made clear our intent as to the separation between home sharing and short-term letting so there should be no surprises here for any of the platforms or anyone doing this as a business.</p></speech>

The draft questions and answers document is excellent, which highlights the issue of communication.  People have a great deal of information to take in and we will have to bear with them, as the Minister pointed out.  It is an extensive question and answer section.</p> <p>  The local authorities and the Department will need to initiate an information campaign before the regulations take effect.  The Minister might share with us his plans regarding information because people want to be compliant with the law.  The legislation addresses a substantial number of issues.  Will the Minister outline his public relations plans to promote the concept of the legislation and the requirements it imposes on people?  Will he explain how these arrangements will be enforced?  This is important because people need to be clear that there are repercussions for failure to comply with the regulations.  I would like to hear more about the Minister's intentions for enforcement and the lead enforcement agencies.</p> <p>  What resources will be made available to local authorities?  The Minister spoke in some detail about compliance with the forms and touching base with local authorities, which are ultimately the planning and housing authorities.  The regulations will place additional demands on local authorities.  Does the Minister plan to give additional resources to them to manage those demands?</p></speech>

This is a change so we need to be as clear as possible with people.  We are designing advertisements at the moment and have provided some draft text for those advertisements.  We need to tell people that changes are coming and they may need to register and also point them to where they can find more information.  We need to push people to the information available online.  We will try to be as clear as we can.  We are also developing infographics to share online.  We will take out advertisements in each of the main newspapers and in local newspapers next week making the point that changes are coming and they may affect people and that people may have to register.  We will show them where to find more information.  We will then repeat that advertising campaign two weeks later.  There will, therefore, be two public media interventions, through newspapers, over the course of the month of June.</p> <p>  In addition, we will take web space in relevant locations through banner advertising or whatever else might be the case.  There will be a social media campaign to push this using different channels in the Department.  We will also ask local authorities to push it over their social media channels.  Some local authorities have excellent social media as a result of events such as Storms Emma and Ophelia.  People pay attention to them because they provide information on road closures and other matters.  We will ask local authorities to push the campaign through their social media channels.  The campaign will be to try to get the facts to as many people as possible who will be affected in the rent pressure zones.</p> <p>  One of the positive aspects of this, when it comes to other types of planning, is that this activity must happen in public for it to work.  If someone needs to find a property to rent or wants to let a property as a short-term letting, he or she must advertise it and that is done online.  While there are a number of platforms which provide this service, it helps that the activity is public because 90% of the heavy lifting is identifying these properties, be they short-term lets of second properties or principal private residences.</p> <p>  The declaration in the regulations strengthens the ability to enforce under different laws.  Mr. John Downey of Dublin City Council has been taking the lead on this and he will communicate with other local authorities next Tuesday about guidance as to how to pursue enforcement.  The Department has been in discussion about providing additional resources, which means money.  It will not be a significant amount of money in the overall scheme of things but it is necessary so that new resources can be hired to do this.  </p> <p>  Other steps will be taken on enforcement but I will not go into those in detail because I do not want to advertise them to people who might try to evade them.  We have looked closely at this issue.  A certain ease is lent to quick and steady enforcement because the marketplace is online.  We are finalising reporting arrangements as to how enforcement is proceeding as these new changes bed down over the coming months and into next year.</p></speech>

The lack of regulation has exacerbated the housing crisis and is in contrast to the norm in other countries.  This is a step forward.  However, I have issues with the proposals.  On balance, it would be best if the proposals were to apply across the board nationally and not just in the rent pressure zones.  Having said that, let us focus on what will happen in those zones.  It has been common practice recently to look at the Airbnb website in respect of a given town and at <i>daft.ie</i>in respect of the same place in order to show that the number of properties advertised for short-term let outnumber those being offered for long-term rental lease.  Sometimes, it is not even close and the ratio is 2:1 or even 3:1.  The stated purpose of the Bill is to tackle that situation.  According to the associated frequently asked questions list, the current situation has resulted in some professional landlords withdrawing houses or apartments that would normally be rented on a long-term basis to instead rent them out as short-term lets.  It is indicated that the purpose of the Bill is to tackle that and reverse it to get that situation sorted out.  If the legislation is designed to do a particular job, it would make sense to provide for a review after the lapse of a certain period of time to determine whether that particular job has been done.  Is there a proposal to come back to this after a set period, be it six, 12 months or 18 months, to see if the legislation has worked and, if it has not, to determine what steps we need to take to strengthen these measures and take them further?</p><p>A matter which has been raised already but on which I would like more information is the resources that will be allocated to local authorities to ensure the new rules and regulations are, in large measure at least, being followed.  Will we have a situation in which changes are implemented which it is difficult to oversee or police or will the resources be allocated to local authorities?  What specific steps are being taken in that regard?</p></speech>

That is what rent pressure zones, in effect, identify.  The legal advice was to tie the legislation to rent pressure zones which is why we have done so.  The objective here is to get properties that would otherwise have been long-term rentals but have gone into the short-term rental market back into the former.  That would be a good thing and would mean more landlords operating.  It is good to know Deputy Barry welcomes more landlords operating in this space.</p> <p>  We will carry out a review.  The legislation will take a few months to bed down and it would be wise to look at it after six months of this being properly in effect.  Some local authorities will be quicker off the mark than others and we will be able to conduct peer reviews between local authority areas.  For the joint committee itself, six months into next year would absolutely be a good time to carry out a review to see what exactly we have achieved.  Currently, my Department is discussing with local authorities the reporting requirements they will have around enforcement.</p></speech>

I think by then we will have a good amount of information.  What will happen after we bring in the guidelines on 1 July is that home sharers will have an obligation to interact with their local authorities and register.  That obligation will apply annually.  We will then have information from 1 January 2020 as to whether there has been a change from 1 July to 31 December 2019.  We will have the first picture there as to what is happening but six months on from that, we will have a better idea about whether anyone is hitting the 90-day cap early in the year and what is happening around enforcement with regard to non-principal private residences.  That would be a good time.  We are discussing with local authorities now the obligations they will have to report on enforcement and issues like that to me.  That could be helpful.  </p> <p>  Deputy Barry asked about resources.  We have been speaking to local authorities about that.  They have made a request regarding the type of resources they think they will need and we are locking down the allocation of additional money to certain authorities such as Dublin City Council which will be doing a great deal of the heavy lifting given that it is in Dublin that the problem is most acute.  We are locking down the amount of money the authorities will need to hire staff and we are considering perhaps having a shared function.  Every local authority has a planning authority which is the expert body when it comes to planning laws and exemptions and so on.  We are asking if there is a way to help each planning authority in doing 90% of the heavy lifting in identifying what properties need to be targeted.  We are looking at that as a potential model but we have already engaged at length with Dublin City Council on what it needs to do the job and will finalise it if not this week then next week.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council will be taking a lead and communicating to other local authorities on Tuesday of next week on guidelines as to how to do this.  Our first port of call is to agree with Dublin City Council the amount of money it will require for the coming 12 month period.  It will be finalised, if not this week, next week with Dublin City Council and we will continue to negotiate the idea of a shared function which would have an impact on the amount of money other local authorities would require.  These conversations are ongoing.  The next engagement with Dublin City Council will take place later this week.  The money is required but it is not so significant in the context of budget lines that we would not be able to meet what will be required.  There is no real issue around that.  It is about the best way to manage our resources.</p></speech>

I was delayed in Dublin traffic for over an hour.  I am sure everyone else has had the same problem.  I welcome the regulations and the increased vigilance around attempting to ensure those houses in rent pressure zones are let on longer terms.  Does it apply to every single home from 1 July which may be let for a period of up to 14 days?  If I am letting a house now, will I have to apply for planning permission from 1 July?  I presume that if that planning permission is turned down, I would have a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Before one will have an effective decision, it will probably be September or October at the earliest.  I refer to someone who might want to frustrate the regulation.  If a short-term letting is defined as 14 days, how can we ensure people do not frustrate the regulation by signing people up to a 15-day period?  It seems they are exempt if the period is greater than 14 days.</p></speech>

It is not going from Dublin City Council to the other local authorities.

I will just talk through the tiers, if I can.  If one intends to let the home in those circumstances, it is exempt from the need to obtain planning permission but one will have to register with one's local authority.</p><p>If it is a second property, planning permission will be required after 1 July.  One might think one has an established use, one might be looking for retention or one might be looking at a fresh planning application.  It will depend.  It will be a judgment call for the person who has the property.  Then one will go into the planning system.  The application process for permission allows for an appeal to the board as well.  That will happen in some instances.  Most people will understand that, as a result of this change in the law, they will not get planning permission in respect of a property in a rent pressure zone.  They will then move to regularise their affairs if they have not already done so.  Other people who seek to make a case or make an appeal will have the right to do so.  We have asked local authorities to approach such cases with common sense.  We are clear that if a local authority is already engaged in a planning enforcement issue, that is separate to this.  It is important to be clear on that as well.  There will be a process that will allow people to get clarity if they think they have a legitimate case.  The planning authorities know what is going on here.  If someone tries to extend the period of use of his or her second property for short-term letting even though he or she does not have a strong case, the planning authorities will be able to take measures.  As the law relating to applications and appeals is not changing, such a person will be able to avail of it.</p></speech>

I am trying to see how people might try to frustrate the new system.  If someone is letting his or her non-principal private residence for periods longer than 14 days - he or she could be doing it for 15 days - will that frustrate the new legislation?</p></speech>

If one has a second property, one does not need to register.  It is just not allowed.  If one applies for planning permission in respect of a property that is in a rent pressure zone, it is more than likely that the application will be denied.  We have defined "short-term letting" as periods of 14 days or less to capture the short-term periods in which people go for city stays.  Someone might have a longer two-week vacation in Dublin city.  We do not want to rule out the possibility of using a second property for longer stays.  If one is doing substantial refurbishments on one's own home, one might need to rent another property for three months.  We do not want to stop that happening.  We have received feedback on this.  If someone has to travel to Dublin because his or her relative is ill, he or she might need to stay near the hospital for a period.</p></speech>

A person who is arriving into the country to work here for two, three or four years might need to take out an executive letting for a couple of months while he or she is finding a place for long-term rental.

I think the key to the proposal is that it is based on a shortage of accommodation for families and people who need long-term accommodation.  That is the key point.  There are no penalties being imposed.  I was contacted by someone who lives outside the rent pressure zones.  This initiative will not apply to that person, so there is no problem here.</p></speech>

The recent rent pressure zone legislation, which was passed last week, extends all rent pressure zones out to 2021 and changes the qualifying criteria so that new areas will be designated as rent pressure zones.  This legislation is tied to the operation of rent pressure zones.  As long as there are rent pressure zones in existence, this legislation will apply.  We want to get to a point at which we are regulating the sector.  This change in the planning law allows planning authorities to stamp out certain practices.  When the housing sector is no longer facing these pressures, the ultimate long-term objective is to have a regulatory system whereby at some point in the future - I cannot say when, but certainly not before 2021 - someone might be able to use a second property for short-term letting in Dublin city.</p></speech>

I think I am more confused now.  The Minister has responded to questions about enforcement, timescales and resources by saying he will come back to us.  When he said he will start an awareness campaign, he said he thinks Dublin City Council will be the lead base in that regard.  I appreciate that short-term lettings are more common in Dublin and the other cities.  The Minister needs to come in here more positively.  We all welcome it and it will be good in the long term.  The Minister has responded to every question that has been asked by saying he will check it out.  It is going from 1 July-----</p></speech>

Who is going to enforce this?  Is there an issue with regard to the timescale?  A question was asked about awareness and the Minister responded to that.  I am not being unfair.  I think this is welcome.  As a member of the housing committee, I have expressed concern to the Minister about many matters.  I know this issue is particularly relevant in our cities.  I am asking about regulation.  This is absolutely welcome.  I am delighted.  Well done.  The Minister is saying that the local authorities will have the discretion to consider cases.  They will have to work within that.  I do not know whether Dublin will be the lead base.  What will happen?  When the Minister comes to our next meeting, could he provide us with a plan with regard to enforcement?  Will the timescale after 1 July be a year, six months or eight months?  The Minister spoke about awareness.  I think we need to know for definite what the awareness campaign for this will involve.  Perhaps the Minister can give us more details in that regard.  It is good.  Like everything, it is about knowing the information.  That is what is important here.</p> <p>  I know we have gone to 2021 with the rent pressure zones now.  That is important.  I have had issues on that before.  The Minister has said that the criteria have changed.  When will that change come?  I have been waiting for seven years for the local authority reviews to be done.  It is now eight years since a review was done.  I was promised two years ago that this would be delivered.  I am not being negative here.  I understand the issues.  The Minister gave a commitment when he said that the rent pressure zones would continue until 2021.  That is fine.  The criteria have changed.  Will the Minister come back to us next week, or within a few weeks, to set out when those criteria will change?  When will other counties, including my own county, qualify for the rent pressure zones?  I say again that this is welcome.  I feel that many questions are being asked without being answered.  I am not saying that in a bad way.  I ask the Minister to come back in a few weeks to give me the answers I am looking for.  Is money going to be provided in certain areas, particularly Dublin and Cork, that need extra staff?  What body is going to be the lead body?  What role will local authorities play in this?  What is going to happen with regard to enforcement?  What is the timescale?  Can we have more information on the awareness campaign?</p></speech>

This is our fourth engagement on the short-term letting regulations.  We have already made the planning changes.  The committee has had the draft regulations for a couple of months.  Additional supporting documentation has been provided to the committee this morning.  I will not be coming back with additional information at a future meeting because I have given all the information I have.  The only thing I have not set out is the amount of money I will give to Dublin City Council and other local authorities.  I am unable to provide that figure because it is currently under negotiation.  I will be able to provide that information at a future meeting because the allocation will have been decided by then.  As I said to one of the Senator's colleagues, enforcement and resources are not about amounts of money.  There are sufficient moneys in the budget line to provide for such matters.  Funding will not be an issue as we seek to allow enforcement to happen.</p> <p>  The planning authorities will do enforcement.  As I said earlier, they will get guidance from the Department next week on how to enforce this.  I said that we may have a shared resource or function behind the individual planning authorities to help to do 90% of the lifting.  As we enforce these new planning laws, that will be worked out depending on what exactly we think might need to change to help planning authorities to do this better.  We recognise that in certain areas, planning authorities have more work to do because they have more issues.  That is why I keep mentioning that Dublin City Council has been working on this for a long time.  I have given the committee draft documentation for the information campaign.  I have also provided the timelines for that campaign.  I have set out what will be happening in June.  I have said that the first advertisements will be published in every national newspaper and in local newspapers next week.  A follow-up advertisement will be published two weeks after that.  I have mentioned that banner advertisement campaigns, as well as a social media campaign, will happen over the month of June.  I have referred to the frequently asked questions document that has been provided to the members of this committee.  It will be provided to everyone in the House to share with their constituents who may get in touch with them.</p><p>The RPZ qualifying criteria have changed in law as a result of the legislation that was passed in the Seanad last week.  I thank Senators for their help with that.  That will come into effect as we get updated data from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  These data go to the Housing Agency, which makes a recommendation to me that new areas have qualified to be designated RPZs because they have met the new qualifying criteria.  That process will begin from next month.</p></speech>

I am still not happy with some of the answers.  There are still issues that need to be sorted out.  The most significant issue, and the Minister knows it, is the fact that everything boils down to money and resources.  It does not matter which regulation the Minister introduces or which local authority someone works for, if there is no money and enforcement, it does not work.  The Minister mentioned the awareness campaign.  It would be good to promote it.  I will promote this.  This regulation is very good and I welcome it, but I always feel that things fall down when there is no money to support them and there is a lack of communication.  All I am saying to the Minister is that he needs to promote it more.  There are still unanswered questions that I feel the Minister has not come across.</p></speech>

I will give credit where credit is due.  These are very good regulations that will make a difference.  What the Minister has done is quite radical so I say "fair play" to him and his officials.  The one question I have concerns proof that somebody is actually living in the principal private residence.  This concerns the potential for abuse.  The Minister mentioned bills as documentary evidence that the person is living there.  That would not prove that somebody was living there.  The person could easily not be living there but the bills would still be in his or her name.  The Minister has to think a bit more about how we establish whether somebody is living in his or her principal private residence and is not abusing the new regulations.  Will the Minister comment on that?  Other than that, fair play to him.  He needs to do far more on all the other aspects of the housing crisis but in this area-----</p></speech>

We may need to take a step back.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments.  He is correct in saying that some people will try to get around this.  People will always try to break or evade the law.  The vast majority of people in this country are law abiding so they will move to regularise their position now they know these changes are coming into effect.</p> <p>  Regarding people who must give documentation to the planning authorities, we have provided very wide powers to them in terms of documentation they can request.  The planning authorities have a history of dealing with people around where they live, their principal private residence, requesting documentation and looking at fake documentation.  Local authorities will not be coming to a person blind and will not be coming without a deep suspicion.  When they move to enforce, it will be because a lot of heavy lifting will have been done in the background to identify a property they think is being used for continuous short-term letting and is not somebody's home.  They will move from a point of suspicion until they can ask for one document, two documents or a lot more documentation.  We have enforced it in the regulations by saying that if someone knowingly gives a false documentation, this is an even greater breach separate to the planning laws, which provides for more enforceability powers as well.  We have strengthened those aspects of things because we know that when it comes to that end of things, they will be dealing with people who probably are in breach and knowingly in breach so they will need those extra powers to be able to get that from them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#G02400"><p>I have a few questions.  I know the Minister said it had to be on a legal basis regarding why we had not rolled this out nationally.  I can kind of accept it but the regulation we are introducing is quite good and I do not see why we cannot bring it in nationwide.  What happens if an area that was an RPZ is no longer one, which is a possibility?</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister has had engagement with the short-term letting platforms, which have been part of this process.  Regulation of short-term letting platforms is an issue about which I have spoken previously.  While the Minister has told me that it is not within his remit but is within the remit of another Minister, it is a critical piece that is required.  Regulation of short-term letting platforms could make things a lot easier and make what the Minister is introducing a lot simpler for the local authorities.  From my engagement with the Minister today, it looks like he will be providing a shared service for all the local authorities, although I could be wrong.  This shared service will probably be the one that collates all the data that can feed information to local authorities to identify those properties breaching the regulation.  If we had regulation of short-term letting platforms today, that information would automatically be provided by those platforms to each local authority so that it could act on it.  As a person involved in tourism and from a customer perspective, I can say that this industry needs to be regulated.  There is no regulation to protect a tourist coming to Ireland today who is staying in a place booked through a short-term letting platform.  Not alone would regulation assist each local authority, it would also provide a better experience for the visitor to Ireland.  This is why I think the regulation of short-term letting platforms is critical for the success of this legislation.  The Minister has told us that it is not within his remit, which I understand, but I ask him to impress on the relevant Minister the importance of regulating short-term letting platforms from the tourism perspective and in respect of providing valid and accurate information to each local authority to allow it to act under the regulation the Minister is introducing.</p></speech>

It involved fraudsters identifying particular houses.  One person had about three in about two months.  It was in my area, although I cannot remember which part.  People, including families with children, were arriving in the middle of the night telling the resident that they had rented his or her house when the resident did not have a clue.  It was quite extraordinary so somebody needs to pass it up the line and something needs to be done about that.</p></speech>

As I approached the property, I often wondered whether the person would be there and whether my weekend would be about to fall through, so I understand tourists' concerns.  Unfortunately, tourism does not come under my brief.  We all recognise that this new type of activity, which is still relatively new, although it has been happening for a few years and is becoming increasingly popular, does need a different type of regulation compared with what we are trying to do because our focus is on housing and long-term letting.  There have been discussions between my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport about the next stage that needs to happen, namely, regulation of the platforms.</p><p>It also cuts across - the Vice Chairman was right to identify this - to the regulation of other platforms that advertise letting properties - although similar, it is not the same space - where there should be an obligation on a publisher or a website not to allow the advertisement of illegal practices, as it were, such as the advertisement of substandard accommodation and so forth.  These are pieces of work that must be done and that fall to be done by the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are engaged with it on that issue.  There is a Bill before the House that has been brought forward by a Deputy from one of the parties to do something in that regard and on which we will engage.  Yes, I would like to move to a point where we are also regulating the platforms.  That will be necessary in the coming years for the reasons identified by the Vice Chairman and Deputy Boyd Barrett.  It will also help in enforcement.  If we want to loosen things a little in the future because there is not the same pressure as there is today, that might be warranted also.</p><p> To respond to the Vice Chairman's questions, initially we were examining applying the changes to planning laws nationally, but the advice of the Attorney General was that, on the balance of rights, we had to tie them to areas where there was a quantified and established demand and pressure.  They were the rent pressure zones.  Using the existing law was the easiest way to do it, which is why we went through the RPZ legislation.</p><p> We engaged with the short-term letting platforms, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Corporate Housing Alliance and the Irish Self Catering Federation because obviously we wanted to ensure there was a carve-out for holiday homes and there is.  There has been engagement with all of the people who might be interested in this sector.</p><p> Shared services is the model I would like to apply as it is probably the most efficient.  A potential shared service would do much of the groundwork and then submit reasons for concern to planning authorities.  The planning authorities, being the experts and having the competence and responsibility, would then move forward with them.  We are examining that matter, but from 1 July the planning authorities will have both the legal understanding and clarity on how to enforce regulations.  They will then proceed to deal with planning applications as they are submitted and the building of registers in their areas.  This refers to the planning authorities in the relevant local authorities.</p></speech>

I raised the issue with the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, at my first housing committee meeting.  We have since completed a detailed report.  It is welcome that the Minister is taking it into consideration in dealing with the legislation.  It has taken a little longer than we had hoped, but today we have what we all agree is an important legislative measure.  I ask the Minister to stress to the corresponding Minister the need to try to regulate the platforms now because that would be of significant help to each local authority in regulating.  I thank him for his engagement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and assistant secretaries, Ms Maria Graham, Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. Paul Lemass.</p> <p>  As I have stated on many occasions, supporting families and individuals experiencing homelessness continues to be a priority for this Government and for me, as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That is why we are so focused on the accelerated delivery of social, affordable and private housing and the reform of our rental sector and planning system.  This morning the Department is publishing the homelessness report for April.  The report shows that in April there was an overall increase of 73 people in emergency accommodation.  The report also shows that there was a reduction of four families and 27 dependants from March.</p> <p>  In Dublin, where the problem of family homelessness is most pronounced, we are seeing some positive results arising from the prevention work being carried out by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  In the first four months of the year, one in two families presenting to homeless services in the Dublin region were prevented from having to enter emergency accommodation.  That is progress but is nowhere near enough.  We are also seeing increased exits with 329 families exiting emergency accommodation to a home in the first four months of this year.  There are some improvements and some progress but there is still a very big challenge ahead.</p> <p>  The monthly homeless report does not provide enough detail as to the different challenges we are facing and different reasons people enter emergency accommodation.  My Department has been working to introduce a revised reporting system in order that we can publish more detailed reports on a quarterly basis.  My Department will continue to publish the numbers in emergency accommodation each month but the publication of more detailed reports on a quarterly basis will allow for better analysis and actions on this subject.</p> <p>  My Department has commissioned the Housing Agency to undertake detailed research on homelessness.  This research will examine in detail the reasons both families and individuals present to homeless services.  The research will promote continued policy development to reduce the numbers of households presenting as homeless and will ensure that the correct supports are provided to support an exit from homelessness within the shortest possible timeframe.  The research will also examine barriers being faced by single adults and families in moving from emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  While we seek to provide homes for households in emergency accommodation, we are working to ensure that we have sufficient and appropriate emergency accommodation in place.  For families, we are continuing to deliver on a programme of family hubs to ensure we have increased accommodation available that is appropriate for families and their children.  We now have 27 hubs in operation nationally, providing 650 units of accommodation with further hubs being developed.  I recently met the Ombudsman for Children and we discussed a number of issues that he raised in his recent report.  My Department will be working with the local authorities and the various service providers to ensure that we can address a number of the issues raised.  However, it is important to recognise that hubs, while a better temporary response than hotels, are just that; they are temporary.  Our ultimate priority is to ensure that families in hubs are supported to exit to a home in the shortest time possible.</p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the report that my Department has been progressing is the introduction of a national quality standards framework for homeless accommodation.  The framework has been successfully introduced in the Dublin region and will be introduced nationally over a 12-month period from 1 July.  The overarching aim of the framework is to ensure that the services we provide to individuals and families experiencing homelessness are well organised, co-ordinated, integrated and focused on moving people out of homelessness into sustainable homes as quickly as possible.</p><p>The standards will ensure greater consistency in the national response to homelessness and will also support service providers by providing a clear framework for the delivery of effective services.</p><p> In terms of social housing delivery, we are continuing to build on the significant progress that was made between 2016 and 2018 in supporting new households.  My Department is validating returns from all 31 local authorities and will shortly be publishing the local authority breakdown of delivery against targets for the first quarter.  Indicative delivery outputs reflect that more than 5,800 additional homes have been provided in the first three months of this year across all of the various social housing delivery programmes, for example, build, acquisition, leasing, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  This includes more than 1,200 additional social homes provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, under build, acquisition and leasing programmes.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, my Department publishes a quarterly construction status report.  This report is a compendium of the 31 local authorities' new build social housing activity for the duration of Rebuilding Ireland.  By the end of 2018, the number of new build social homes delivered or in the pipeline stood at over 19,000 of the overall build target of 33,600, with nearly 5,000 homes on site and under construction and a further 2,569 homes at the final pre-construction stage.  The 2019 first quarter report will be finalised in the coming days.  Given the rate of new projects being added to the programme, going on site and completing, I expect this to show a very good pipeline against the overall target.</p><p> We have also seen positive news from the CSO in the past month regarding the number of new homes built in the past year.  Almost 19,000 new homes were built in the year to the end of the first quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 25% on the year to the end of the first quarter of 2018.  In addition, more than 2,600 homes were brought out of long-term vacancy and almost 800 dwellings in unfinished housing developments were completed, meaning that more than 22,200 homes became available for use in the year to the end of March, which was up 19% on the previous period.  This does not include the nearly 3,600 bed spaces completed in the student sector in the year to the end of the first quarter of 2019.  We remain on course to meet our Rebuilding Ireland target of 25,000 new homes to live in by the end of this year.</p><p> Clearly, Rebuilding Ireland is substantially increasing the supply of new homes and we need to drive new builds higher again over the course of this year and on into 2020.  We also know that this increase in supply is contributing to the moderation in the growth in house prices, which is important in terms of housing affordability, particularly in Dublin and certain other main urban centres.</p><p> In terms of our programme for affordable purchase, last June I commenced Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This placed the new affordable purchase scheme on a statutory footing.  In March of this year, I signed regulations under which local authorities made their schemes of priorities, providing the administrative framework through which homes will ultimately be made available under the scheme.  To date, 26 of the 31 local authorities have submitted draft schemes to my Department.  These are now being approved at local authority level.  My Department is working in respect of the further regulations and guidance needed to put in place the administrative processes to complete the affordable purchase scheme.  I anticipate that these will be in place in the autumn.</p><p> One of the mechanisms available to local authorities to help them deliver affordable housing options is the serviced sites fund.  Some &euro;310 million is available in grant funding out to 2021 for infrastructure, which will support the provision of up to 6,200 affordable homes.  Last December, I approved funding of &euro;43 million under the fund, which will enable the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands in Dublin and Cork.  An example of the progress that can be supported through the serviced sites fund is apparent in Cork city, where planning permission was recently approved for 147 homes on Boherboy Road.  This will see the delivery of social and affordable housing solutions along with a cr&egrave;che and ancillary works, with work starting on the site in the coming weeks.  A second call under the fund issued last month to 19 local authorities and 29 submissions from 15 of them have been received under it.  These are being assessed and I intend to announce approvals under the second call before the end of June.</p><p> Serviced sites funding is also available to local authorities that wish to provide cost rental options.  Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other urban centres are also facing significant affordability challenges, I am committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit cost rental sector in Ireland.  Ultimately, it is envisaged that cost rental options will be delivered as a national programme at scale and in areas of high demand.  My Department has engaged the European Investment Bank on a research project to help us identify the optimum operational and financial model for cost rental in Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, progress is being made in the shorter term through advancing pilot cost rental projects.  This has involved many actors working together in partnership.  I am glad to say that this work is now coming to fruition and we will see construction on our first cost rental development at the Enniskerry Road site beginning next month.</p><p> Regarding the rental sector, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 was passed earlier this month.  I expect to sign a commencement order later this week to bring the majority of provisions into operation.  The Act provides a number of key measures and reforms designed to enhance enforcement powers for the Residential Tenancies Board provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the rent pressure zone arrangements until the end of 2021.  The duration of tenancy termination notice periods is significantly extended under the Act.  For example, a minimum of 180 days' notice must be provided by landlords who terminate a tenancy of between three and seven years' duration.  The Residential Tenancies Acts will now apply to student-specific accommodation let under tenancy or licence by private providers and public educational institutions.  My Department is working closely with the RTB to ensure that adequate resources are provided to facilitate a smooth introduction of the new sanctioning regime and annual registration of tenancies.</p><p> As members will be aware, Project Ireland 2040 signalled clearly the Government's intention to shift away from "business as usual" sprawl-based development patterns and adopt instead more compact, sustainable and community-centred development approaches.  Project Ireland 2040, through the national planning framework and the national development plan, is being implemented so that we can continue to plan proactively and prudently for a population increase of 1 million, 600,000 new jobs and over 550,000 new homes.  It is not just about national strategic planning, but also strengthening the regional and local level planning tiers.</p><p> The first of three regional spatial and economic strategies to give effect to the national planning framework has recently been approved.  The other two regional strategies will be approved in the coming months.  Approval of the regional strategy for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly area, which includes Dublin, earlier this month means that all county development plans in the region must now commence either a variation or full review process before the end of the year.  Local development plans in the other two regions will follow suit once their regional strategies are approved.</p><p> To support this, my Department is preparing updated guidance for local authorities on development plan preparation that will also include guidance on housing demand assessment.  The purpose of this is to enable local planning authorities to better provide for and identify the location and type of housing that will be required in the future.</p><p> As part of this overall approach, the establishment of the Land Development Agency, LDA, last year means that there is now a delivery vehicle to work with public bodies and others in using public lands to provide housing and to act as a catalyst in stimulating regeneration and wider investment to achieve compact urban growth.  We can expect to see the first homes delivered on the initial tranche of eight LDA sites by next year.  The agency is actively identifying further lands and sites and is tasked with taking a long-term view on the sustainable development and management of the State landbank.</p><p> In terms of delivering more effective oversight of the planning system, Mr. Niall Cussen has been appointed as Ireland's first Planning Regulator, with an important role in ensuring that the planning process properly implements Project Ireland 2040.  The Office of the Planning Regulator will independently assess statutory plans, conduct examinations and reviews of local authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la planning functions, and drive a national programme of planning research, as well as information and education.  This ongoing process of improvement, reform and institutional change signifies the critical need to respond to the challenges we face in order to make a key contribution to the delivery of housing and the shaping of our country over the next number of years.</p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today and I look forward to working with members throughout 2019.  I will of course answer whatever questions members might have.</p></speech>

It reads: "We will accelerate and expand the Rapid-Build Housing Programme to provide, in the first instance and as a priority, more suitable accommodation for families that are currently residing in commercial hotels".  In that regard, the Minister might update us on the delivery of the target of 1,500 new units.  I believe there was a target of 1,100 homes by 2021.</p> <p>  The Department organised a number of housing summits and there was considerable discussion about them in the media.  How did they go, in particular the local ones?  As a result of the summits, the Minister suggested that he would engage with the 31 local authorities.  How has that engagement gone?  What has come of it?  What issues are the local authorities raising?  What additional supports do they require?  This is an important issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the affordability of the schemes of priority, setbacks were suffered.  My local authority of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did not necessarily agree with that approach.  There was ongoing engagement between the Department and the council's officials and councillors.  After a second opportunity to consider the matter, the council agreed a scheme, but the process was disappointing for a number of reasons.  I will not comment on them in any great detail, but the Minister might confirm whether all of the local authorities are in agreement about getting on with their schemes of priority in respect of affordable housing.</p><p>Galway came up as an issue in the past.  There were particular problems with the delivery of housing there last year.  Will the Minister talk us through how that is being addressed and dealt with?</p><p> I would like to mention one or two other matters.  Will the Minister confirm the status of the Land Development Agency's work on the substantial Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, which presents great opportunities for the provision of housing?</p><p> Action 3.15 relates to affordable housing schemes on State lands.  As I have said time and again, there is great potential for the development of State lands such as sites owned by harbour companies, Irish Rail properties, or lands adjoining bus stations.  We can use imaginative approaches to move some of the activities based on these sites, especially those in key residential areas, to other places.</p><p> I would like to ask the Minister about the potential of Thornton Hall.  He might not be able to tell us too much about that site.  I think there are challenges and opportunities relating to Thornton Hall.</p><p> Will the Minister reach the target of 25,000 new homes this year?  He put a certain amount of pressure on himself when he set that target.  Will he tell the committee whether he is confident that he can deliver on the target of 25,000 new homes this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#L00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  He began by making a very important point about the ongoing work that is being done to review Rebuilding Ireland.  As I said earlier, this is a working committee.  We work through different problems and challenges we have.  When issues are raised, we try to resolve them.  We recently made good progress by finalising the short-term letting regulations and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.  I appreciate the engagements we have.  I hope the committee appreciates the documentation we have provided to update it on the action plan and the other reports we have given to it.  I take this opportunity to thank my officials for their offline engagement as well.</p> <p>  The first point I want to make about the rapid-build pipeline is that rapid prefabricated off-site technology construction is not just a homelessness solution.  I know that is how it was initially introduced as a concept, but it is now very much taking over from traditional building in the private sector and in other areas.  What they are able to do now is fantastic in terms of the quality.  It is a quicker form of development when one gets on site.  There is no way to get around the procurement, planning and other things that need to be done before one gets on site.  At the moment, we have more than 1,100 such builds in the pipeline.  In excess of 400 such builds have already been delivered.  More than 200 such builds are on site.  We are about to see the new volumetric programme, which is using prefabricated off-site construction technology, for multi-storey developments.  There are 300 such builds to go on site in the next quarter.  That is where we are with this pipeline.</p> <p>  I thank the Senator for reminding me that we have already had two workshops, with a further regional workshop to come.  They are being chaired or hosted by the Department in conjunction with the County and City Management Association.  They are looking at a range of issues, including the targets of each local authority under the various streams of delivery and the appropriate use of the land that can be used.  Each local authority was asked to do an economic assessment around affordable modelling.  That is being addressed as well.  Collaboration with housing bodies is very important because housing bodies have been raising issues concerning land.  Issues like the provision of emergency accommodation and the standards of such accommodation are also being addressed.  The vacancy teams that are in place are drawing up vacancy plans.  The workshops give us a chance to do what we do at the summits in a more in-depth manner with each region.  There are different challenges in each region.</p> <p>  The Senator alluded to the Galway task force, which is dealing with the challenge we have in Galway.  We have taken the model we used in Cork, which has proven to be successful, and we have applied it to Galway.  There has already been a meeting of the Galway task force.  Ms Geraldine Tallon, who is a former Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is chairing both the Cork and Galway task forces.  The Galway task force is having another meeting in early June to look at how particular land will help to unlock the delivery problem that is being experienced in the city.</p> <p>  Twenty-six schemes of priority have been sent into the Department and local authorities have approved ten of them.  All of the schemes in Dublin and the schemes in Galway and Cork have been approved.  We want to get the remaining schemes over the line.  We have an affordability pipeline in place, so it is important that they are over the line.  Various local authorities have taken different approaches in line with the flexibility they have.  I am open to keeping this under review.  I understand what has happened in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have spoken to representatives from D&uacute;n Laoghaire about some of the changes they would like to see in the future.  We need to see how the initial scheme will work.  The scheme was developed in consultation with Members of the Oireachtas.  We believe it is a good scheme of priority.  If people think that further amendments can be made, I am open to them.  We need to agree those schemes where houses are going to be delivered first.  We need to get them working.</p> <p>  I have a document on what is happening with the Land Development Agency's work in Dundrum, but I cannot share it.  I will give the Senator an overview of the timeline for the Dundrum site.  Design development is already under way for that site.  It is intended to progress to a full design competition in the third quarter of this year, to have a detailed design in place next year and to go for planning in the second or third quarter of next year.  We believe we will have vacant possession of the hospital at the end of the third quarter of next year.  A great deal of work is happening on the design side to get ready for the planning application to go in.  We need to have engagement with local stakeholders as well.  When a Department or agency makes its first proposal, it is sometimes so out of kilter with what is needed for the site that people are not open to considering any kind of reform or change in that proposal.  I do not want to see that happen in this instance.  We need to make sure that when we have possession of this site, we can move quickly with a development that people will support.  Not everyone will support it.  The Senator knows as well as I do that people object to housing in their local areas for a host of reasons or excuses, depending on the reasons being proffered.  We will be as sensitive as we can to local concerns while recognising that we can deliver a great deal of affordable housing on this site.</p> <p>  The Land Development Agency's other function is to manage State sites better by identifying where an existing use might not be optimal.  We are looking at that.  When we look at certain sites, we realise that they may not require the existing function to be moved because we can build over it.  That is being looked at as well.  Other cities have been quite efficient in allowing an existing function to remain on a site while building above it.  The changes we have made with regard to densities and heights will allow us to do that on certain sites.</p></speech>

One of the key commitments is that 25,000 new homes for people to live in will be delivered in 2019.  I will set out where I think we are at by going through the component parts of that cohort of 25,000 new homes.  In 2018, there was a 25% increase on 2017.  We have to work on projections.  This is not an exact science.  We are not building these homes ourselves.  We change laws or regulations to allow these homes to be built separately from the homes we are building directly ourselves.  More than 6,000 homes will be delivered through our own programmes.  If we estimate that last year's level of activity will increase by between 15% and 25% this year, we can calculate that between 20,700 and 22,500 new homes will be built this year.  I will explain what will support that.  We had 22,000 commencements in 2018.  In the first quarter of this year, we had 5,758 commencements, which represented an increase of 31% on the figure for the first quarter of last year.  That is the range we are looking at.  I think we can assume that between 2,000 and 2,500 more homes will come out of long-term vacancy in 2019.  In the first quarter of this year, 559 homes came out of long-term vacancy.  In addition, we will see between 300 and 500 homes coming on stream from unfinished housing estates.  Anyone who has had the problem of unfinished housing estates in their constituency will know that, in many of these cases, nothing was built at all.  A site may have been opened without even the floor plates being put down.  That is a full build that has to happen.  We think the number will be between 300 and 500.  Some 182 homes were completed on that side of the ledger in the first quarter of this year.  When I step back from all of that and look at it, I am confident that we will see 25,000 new homes becoming available for use this year.  Those projections are confirmed by the figures we saw last year and in the first quarter of this year.</p></speech>

The money we are providing to support people in the private rental sector is absolutely necessary because if we did not do so, those people would find themselves in emergency accommodation or worse.  We can support far more people in this way now than if we were to put that money into direct build and know those buildings would be built overnight.  We can actually support many more people using the same amount of money.  It is my ambition and the aim of the plan before us to move to a point in 2021 when we will accommodate more new people in the stock of social housing than we will in the private rental sector.  We will continue with that ambition beyond Rebuilding Ireland and Project Ireland 2040.</p></speech>

The report states that the average top-up is &euro;177 per month and closer to &euro;300 per month in urban areas and areas close to them.  Threshold notes that 45% of those surveyed say that these top-ups contribute to them seriously struggling to pay utility bills, for groceries and childcare and school costs.  Landlords are creaming it in this country and they are being facilitated by the Minister and his policies.</p><p>The main point I wish to raise is that of co-living.  There has been a huge controversy about this recently and the idea that the Minister's co-living guidelines could potentially allow for a situation in which up to 42 people would share kitchen facilities and sleep in cubicles that would be smaller than a disabled parking space.  Co-living has been described by the Minister as an &quot;exciting opportunity&quot; for young workers but it has been described by Threshold as opening the door to 21st century bedsits.  Other serious commentators have raised the prospect of 21st century tenements developing.  Co-living has an interesting history.  In its modern guise, it began as a form of housing pioneered in the 1930s in interwar England by people who had a radical social intent.  It was an idea of communal living which went against the <i>laissez-faire</i>market policies of the time.  It allowed tenants to have democratic control over their living quarters and fed into the idea of the welfare state after the Second World War because it promoted the idea of housing as a universal right.  This progressive idea has been completely and utterly turned on its head in recent times by big business and corporate interests, particularly in the United States and Britain.  It is very much part of the commodification of housing.  The idea promoted by the Minister and some of his Government colleagues that it might allow for a cheaper alternative accommodation for people is knocked on the head by the proposed rent of &euro;1,300 which is linked to one particular planning application.  Will the Minister comment on Threshold's proposition that what he is doing is opening the door to 21st century bedsits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#M01200"><p>On the first issue the Deputy raised, top-up payments are allowed but three in four tenants in receipt of a housing assistance payment do not pay a top-up.  Local authorities also have discretion to make a 20% top-up, where necessary, to ensure a tenant is not placed in a position of being unable to afford a top-up when more rent is required because of the demands in the market.  Allowing that kind of flexibility is very important because it can be to the tenant's benefit in securing a property where he or she wants to live.  The vast majority who avail of a housing assistance payment do so successfully.  They enjoy the flexibility it gives which previous schemes did not give in terms of being able to work more and earn more.  They also enjoy having flexibility regarding the location of the accommodation.  From a policy perspective, notwithstanding that we want to provide more social housing stock, HAP allows us to do something with the existing housing stock in terms of achieving a social mix which we would not do without it.  HAP will always be provided to some degree, albeit to a lesser degree in the future, because from the State's perspective, it has social benefits in terms of achieving the mix we want to see in housing.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke of landlords but earlier he was looking for more landlords in the long-term rental sector.  I ask for some consistency.  It helps no one and does not serve mature debate to have the Deputy speak of a landlord class when 70% of landlords in this country only own one property.  They are families and individuals and the Deputy is trying to paint them as something that they are not.  That is grossly unfair.</p> <p>  Arrears and people having difficulty paying rent, whether it is a top-up or otherwise, is an issue.  The Residential Tenancies Board believes it is a greater issue than serving notices to quit where the reason is sale of property.  The Department and the RTB, together with some of the leading NGOs and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, are trying to get further information on the issue of arrears to see what further interventions can be made.  I have discussed arrears with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and it has also been discussed at the inter-agency group, the Government group I set up in September 2017.  How we make earlier interventions to help people who find themselves in difficulty or housing insecurity has also been discussed at a special meeting with the Taoiseach and other relevant Ministers.  The earlier the intervention, the lower the chance that someone will have to present to the local authority or enter emergency accommodation.  That is a big piece of work. </p> <p>  On co-living, I cannot comment on an individual planning application.  I do not remember the Deputy making any objection to this proposal when I first brought it forward 14 months ago or when the regulations were brought in last year.  The Deputy noted a view given by Threshold.  I will note a view given by the Irish architects who welcomed it as a way of providing another layer of choice in the housing sector.  There are different views on this.  It is a very small aspect of what we need to do.  Less than 1% of new builds in the next 12 months will be for co-living.</p> <p>  Co-living is not for everyone.  However, a house share in a four-bedroom home is not suitable for someone coming to this country for the first time, nor is living in isolation in a studio or one-bedroom apartment.  There will be more than 20,000 new builds this year and I do not know if any will be for co-living.  If co-living proceeds, it will be for less than 1%.  Given the Deputy's historical outline, I note that he welcomes the concept of co-living.  That is what I take from his comments as he talked through the concept.  I repeat, we cannot discuss an individual planning application.</p></speech>

Housing was the biggest issue at the door.</p><p>As some of my colleagues have said, housing came up as an issue on every doorstep.  In fairness, I did say, as a member of the housing committee, that we worked extremely hard and that the work being done had not yet come to fruition but that it would in the next while.  Concerns were raised which I said I would take back to the Minister.</p><p> One of the biggest issues in my area - I know that I keep on about it, but it is important - is the threshold for local authority housing.  It is eight years since it was changed.  It has one of the lowest qualifying thresholds for local authority housing, at &euro;27,500 for a family.  In neighbouring counties such as County Laois it is &euro;32,000.  I will discuss the approved housing bodies in more detail, but a few weeks ago there was bedlam between neighbours, some of whom are within Carlow County Council's jurisdiction, while others fall within that of Laois County Council.  Carlow County Council's rent cap is &euro;180 per week, while Laois County Council's is &euro;93 per week.  Someone living in a housing estate and earning the same amount of money as his or her next door neighbour could be paying treble in rent.  It is becoming a massive issue.  On local radio I said I would speak to the Minister about it.  It is a major issue when one of two households living in similar houses and earning &euro;500 a week is paying almost double what the other is paying because they are in different local authority areas.  We really need to look at this issue.</p><p> The Minister has been very fair on many of the concerns I have raised and come back to me on them.  Yesterday a lady had to be taken off air on my local radio station because staff thought she was going to have a panic attack.  The house in which she is living has been sold and she has not been able to find another.  No one was helping her.  I have been speaking to her since.  We come across many situations where people believe they are not receiving help.  I believe her problem has almost been sorted, but there are many more such cases that are not being highlighted on radio stations.  However, people should not have to go on radio to highlight them.  It is unfortunate that they do.  More hardship cases need to be recognised, but this is not being done. </p><p> I ask the Minister about approved housing bodies.  Paragraph 2.15 states a regulator for the approved housing body sector will be established to oversee the effective governance and financial management of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies.  As I said to the Minister in the Seanad, approved housing bodies will become more involved.  I have given him the details of two cases in which builders have been working with different agencies, with a total of 130 houses being built between the two.  The local authorities are considering whether they will look at the houses being built.  They are excellent builders who provide excellent housing.  It worries me that we do not have a regulator who could remind the local authorities of how many are on their housing lists.</p><p> The housing assistance payment has been raised as an issue in terms of what it is costing the country.  We need it because people need rental accommodation.  There has to be a system whereby the approved housing bodies can go to the local authorities, perhaps through the builders.  As the Minister knows, everything has to be above board and right.  That is something for which I stand, but it is unacceptable that builders working with approved housing bodies are being told that the local authority is considering looking at the houses being built when we could have access to that number of houses.  What is the up-to-date position on the establishment of a regulator?  I believe that in neighbouring counties approved housing bodies provide a massive service for local authorities.  They take people off their housing lists.  This will become one of the biggest issues.  </p><p> I would appreciate it if the Minister came back to me with answers to my questions about changing the thresholds in qualifying for local authority housing.  That badly needs to be done.  They are the issues about which I have massive concerns.</p></speech>

While we had an excellent debate and discussion on it, as all Senators are not on the committee, not all of them were aware of the amount of time we had spent on the Bill.  The remarks made by the Senator were helpful in clarifying the position and we were able to meet the timelines we had put in place for ourselves.</p> <p>  Housing should come up as an issue as we knock on doors as representatives or during an election campaign because it is one that is affecting everyone.  Some try to present it in the House as an issue that only affects those whom they claim to represent, but that is not the case.  It affects everyone, either directly or a very close loved one, be it a child or an elderly relative.  Therefore, we must continue to drive Rebuilding Ireland to a successful conclusion and make changes where we need to make them - if it is smart to make them - and review what we are doing all the time.</p> <p>  Something we are doing is reviewing the issue of social housing qualification, income thresholds, differential rents and the right to a house in which someone's parents lived.  All of these issues are being looked at because we are dramatically increasing the stock of social housing from various streams.  That is happening.  It is important, as we increase the stock of social housing, to look at the changes we need to make to ensure the system is fair.  What the Senator spoke about was fairness in the rents being paid.  Some of the work on thresholds is being led by the Housing Agency; to a degree, therefore, the matter is outside my hands.  The Department is, however, liaising with the local authorities on other work being done.  I hope to bring together a suite of reforms to state this is what the new landscape will look like six months hence.  That is being worked on.  Perhaps it might be secondary to what we are trying to do on the issue of affordable housing.  We are trying to get all of the pieces of the affordable programme in place, including sites and priority schemes.  That is where we are at in terms of what we are looking at and some of the work I want to do later this month.  In tandem with it, much work has been ongoing for quite some time and we are hoping to bring it to completion, I hope prior to the D&aacute;il rising for the summer in order that I can have a session with the committee.  If that is not the case, it will happen when we come back at the beginning of September.  We are looking at the issues raised by the Senator of differential rents and income thresholds.</p> <p>  There are several important things to note with regard to approved housing bodies.  The Senator's colleague asked about the regional workshops.  They are about co-operation between the approved housing bodies and the local authorities.  It is happening very well in some areas and with some approved housing bodies, but we should not see local authorities and approved housing bodies competing for a site or approved housing bodies competing with each other for a site.  Neither should we see local authorities losing out on a particular site.  From my experience to date, the workshops have been very strong in trying to identify opportunities for better co-operation.</p> <p>  We have had a voluntary regulatory code in place since 2014.  There has been pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill which will provide for statutory regulation of the approved housing body sector.  It will be published shortly.  It will make provision for the establishment of a statutory regulator for the sector.  The Housing Agency does this work in the context of voluntary regulation.  It has a good chunk of the tier 3 approved housing bodies under the code, but not all of them.  The work being done means that we will not be starting from a standing position.  A lot has happened.  We will be able to move smoothly from voluntary to statutory regulation once the Bill has been passed.</p></speech>

The figure now stands at 10,378.  The Minister keeps saying Rebuilding Ireland is working.  How does this chime with the latest figures?  Will the Minister react to the figures that have just been published?</p></speech>

He is most welcome to this morning's session of the committee.  The figures for April are just out.  As the Deputy pointed out, they have increased, which is very disappointing.  However, we continue to increase the stock of social housing.</p><p>We continue to see housing delivery generally across the economy ramping up quite significantly and sustainably, which is important as well.  We are now seeing moderation in house prices, which is good, and we have changed the laws around rent pressure zones, although this will still take some time to take effect.  It is very disappointing to see the numbers up again.  We have seen a decrease in the number of families and children in emergency accommodation month on month.  It is a small decrease but it is still a decrease.  In the first four months of the year we have seen more than 320 families leaving emergency accommodation, so it is important to point that while there are more people now in emergency accommodation than there were in the previous month, people are exiting all the time.  Families are getting out of emergency accommodation and into homes.  It is also important to note that for every two families that came into homelessness services and might have gone to emergency accommodation, we found a home for one before that happened.  That speaks to the huge level of work that is ongoing in local authorities and with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to prevent families from having to go into emergency accommodation.  Roughly speaking, for every family that went into emergency accommodation in the past month, one family would also have exited that accommodation.</p><p> There is a great deal happening and the NGOs that work with us do a fantastic job.  Work is done through these NGOs, and we are spending more than &euro;120 million on emergency accommodation this year and those types of services because we recognise that those NGOs are the experts.  It still a very big challenge that we face and there is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

The evidence is before our eyes with these figures.  We cannot on the one hand say Rebuilding Ireland is a success because we are building more houses and we are "ratcheting" up construction, as the Minister stated, while we get these figures month on month, quarter by quarter, indicating an increase in the number of people who are homeless.</p> <p>  There are a number of aspects to Rebuilding Ireland that I want to focus on very quickly.  Affordable homes and cost rental scenarios are almost non-existent.  Again, the Minister keeps telling us we will see progress in these areas but people do not see it.  There must be a focus on social housing.  In my constituency the targets for Rebuilding Ireland are woefully unambitious.  The Government is missing the fact that more people are coming on the housing lists than coming off because we are building so few homes.  There is no evidence of any ratcheting up of construction in the city and county where I live, that is for sure.  The Minister needs to understand that unless we build more homes for people, we will keep coming into rooms like this and having these conversations about rising homeless figures.  We will keep having the same conversations inside and outside the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p> <p>  I ask about the Minister's plan for co-living and the comments he made in advance of the Raise the Roof rally.  I commend trade unions and progressive political parties of the left, as well as others who mobilised, on the campaign to demand better housing for people and more houses.  The Minister said co-living was a "choice" for people.  The people who will be forced into these co-living arrangements do not see it as an option or choice.  It certainly will not be a choice for the privileged or those who are doing well.  The Minister said he did not want to comment on an individual planning application, which is fair enough.  However, is it acceptable to the Minister that one of these co-living options will have an average rent of &euro;1,300 per month?  This would essentially amount to a bedsit.  Is it acceptable to the Minister that we could have up to 40 or even more people sharing a kitchen on one floor?  Is that something the Minister would want to see for one of his family members?  I certainly would not.  These are not choices for people and they do not aspire to it.  It is a reality as there is no other option or alternative provided by the Government.  Is it acceptable that &euro;1,300 will be charged for one of these bedsit co-living options?  Can the Minister stand over it?  Is it acceptable that 42 or more people could share a kitchen?</p></speech>

The Deputy is very welcome to the committee but he was not here earlier when I answered some of the initial questions he posed.  I will go back over them.  This has been a very good working committee over the past two years and there has been a very respectful tone.

It is working and I can say that because of the increases we are seeing in the supply of new homes.  There has been an increase in the number of new builds this year in the first quarter, and there is evidence for this from the Central Statistics Office, independent of the Department, relating to new buildings completed and commencing on site.  We are seeing a very quick but also sustainable increase in the number of new homes being built.  Before speaking about any other challenges that we face in housing, if we do not fundamentally correct supply, we will not solve those other challenges.  At least we know the fundamental problem is being addressed through Rebuilding Ireland, which is important.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a rapid increase in the stock of social housing.  Since the year before Rebuilding Ireland started, we have seen an eightfold increase in the stock of social housing, which is substantial.  That is significant and it cannot be dismissed as not being social housing, a commitment to social housing or an actual increase, because it is.  We have an ambition of getting 50,000 new homes for the stock of social housing over the period of Rebuilding Ireland, which is very significant and ambitious.  The first cost rental project and the first affordability project will go on site next month.  All the work we have done in planning and preparation will begin to bear fruit in either affordable or cost rental homes.  That is just as the work we did in social housing and making reforms and changes there is now bearing fruit through increases in social housing.  The Deputy states that the numbers on the housing list have increased, but those numbers have decreased, with just over 70,000 people on the housing list.  In the Deputy's area of Waterford, the number has fallen from 1,596 in 2016 to 1,117 now.</p> <p>  We are seeing progress with Rebuilding Ireland.  I understand people who say Rebuilding Ireland is not working looking at what is happening with emergency accommodation.  I understand their frustration, their anger and upset because of increasing numbers.  However, they must recognise that other significant parts of Rebuilding Ireland, including increasing supply, making important changes in planning guidelines, fast-track processes and reforms in the rental sector, have had some impact.  It is a five-year plan so we must continue to drive those reforms and make new ones where they prove necessary.</p> <p>  I addressed co-living earlier with another member of the committee but I will repeat my comments as the Deputy asked the same questions.</p></speech>

Looking at the tens of thousands of new homes to be built over the next 12 months, easily less than 1% will be for co-living.  This is not about replacing homes or apartments with co-living but making a small addition where some people may want that choice.  Not everybody coming to this country will want to move to a four-bed flat with people they do not know.  At the same time, such people may not want to live in isolation in a single studio.  They may also want to make sacrifices to have access to a gym or such facilities.  It is for those people to decide.  Our current problem is that people do not have choice in housing, but by increasing supply, we can try to increase that choice with different types of supply.  These include accommodation for the elderly, apartments for families, houses for families, student accommodation and co-living, which will be a small part of the whole.  The concept has been welcomed by many.  I have said that I cannot speak to an individual planning application so I will not do so.</p></speech>

The numbers are up again.  Normally, there is an increase in homeless numbers at the start of the year and after Christmas.</p><p>Numbers tend to go up in January and February.  Traditionally, in the past, the numbers tended to go down again in March, April, May and coming through the spring into the summer, but that is not happening here.  They are going up, month on month.  My first two questions are as follows.  Does the Minister believe that a Minister on whose watch this happens deserves to remain in office?  Does he believe a Government that allows this to happen, with more than 10,000 of our people officially homeless, with the numbers going up coming into the spring, deserves to remain in power?  I have one other question for the Minister but I will pause to hear his response to those questions.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we have seen an increase in the past month of 73 in emergency accommodation and we have seen a decrease of four families and also a decrease of 27 children.  These are small decreases but decreases nonetheless.  The numbers go up and down each month in different categories and in different parts of the country.  That is why I have said before that the monthly reporting is not very helpful in terms of understanding the reasons behind each individual and each family either entering or being prevented from entering or exiting.  That is why I said this morning that while we will continue to publish the numbers every month, we will report every quarter in more detail in order that we can have a better analysis of exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  I also mentioned that an independent piece of research will be done, separate from my Department, and we are just finalising the draft terms of reference for that research.  This will mean we can look at what is happening with individual adults and families in greater detail, not just in terms of those who present and are prevented from entering, but also those who enter and their subsequent pathway to exit, what that looks like, and how sustainable it is.  That is a piece of work that needs to be done.</p> <p>  It is very disappointing to see the numbers up again.  However, it is unfair to try to characterise that as either the local authorities or the NGOs not doing a huge amount of work in that same period.  As I said earlier, in the first quarter of this year, more than 320 families left emergency accommodation for homes, which is very important.  When we see the numbers going up, it is not necessarily the same people in emergency accommodation.  Last year, more than 5,000 adults were prevented from entering emergency accommodation.  In the first four months of this year, for every two families that presented to homeless services, one was prevented from entering emergency accommodation and one entered emergency accommodation.  That shows the substantial amount of work that is happening.  At the same time, roughly, to take the figures for last month, for every family that entered emergency accommodation, another family was leaving.</p> <p>  What that tells us is that things like family hubs, which are a new support, are getting families out of emergency accommodation more quickly.  It tells us that the supports we are using, from the housing assistance payment to the increase in the social housing stock, are working to get families out of emergency accommodation.  However, as we continue to see things like, for example, landlords exiting the market, we are going to see continuing pressures on housing insecurity, which is very challenging.  Our responsibility, as legislators, is to try to bring forward solutions that have the support of this House and that will make important changes to help people, as we saw with the rent Bill we agreed as an Oireachtas committee last week.  That is an important change that will help people and it is how we try to fix this situation and do better.</p> <p>  That is the approach we have taken as a Government, and that is the support I have had from this committee on those measures that it has been able to support.  There are differences on policy as, of course, there must be in a democracy.  Rebuilding Ireland is a work in progress.  As I have said, it is showing very strong results in areas like supply, but in areas like homelessness, despite the substantial sum of money that has been spent and despite all the extra resources that have been put in place, we continue to have this very big challenge.  However, we continue to do a significant amount of work to get families out of emergency accommodation or prevent them from entering.</p></speech>

I would love to see his ambitious programme of 100 to 200 different actions under a cohesive, progressive piece of work that will do more than what we are doing now.  Where is his coalition of people?  Where is his coalition of ideas?  What he was saying in asking that question was that he believes he will do a better job of this and, more than that, he believes he has the popular support from the public to get Deputies into seats, or that there are other parties in this D&aacute;il which will coalesce with him on this issue, and not just this issue, but every other issue in government.  He should stop playing to the Gallery with these questions.  Let us move on to getting into the detail of Rebuilding Ireland.</p></speech>

There are a number of people who are facing a very challenging situation and there are, of course, people who are in housing insecurity and who do not know where is the next place they are going to live should they get served a notice to quit.  There are also people who have moved back in with their parents because they are struggling to find a place to live.</p> <p>  What I would say to all of them is that the Government is working night and day to further progress Rebuilding Ireland, to get more homes built and to do things like what we have done this morning, which is, effectively, to commence the regulation and limit short-term letting from our major rent pressure zones.  What we did last week was to finalise major reforms to the rental sector that are going to introduce rent caps to more areas, extend the timing of rent caps and give people who are in housing insecurity much more time, when the notice to quit is served, to find other accommodation.  It is also going to allow the RTB to chase up rogue landlords where they are stepping outside the law or are in breach of the law, and a whole range of other things that will help people in the rental sector, including, for the first time, regulating many larger landlords who, because they brought new properties to the market in the last two years, were not previously covered.  For people in emergency accommodation, I continue to engage, week in, week out, with the NGOs and local authorities.  We have increased funding for this year for emergency accommodation and we have increased the number of placeholders.  We continue to roll out the housing assistance payment.</p> <p>  All of these things are helping people.  It is not enough but 329 families left emergency accommodation in the first four months of this year because of work that local authorities are doing, with NGOs and supported by my Department.  For the first four months of this year, for every two families that presented into homelessness, one of those families went into emergency accommodation and one went into a home.  A huge amount is happening and more will happen as we continue to increase the stock of social housing and continue to put in place those other supports that need to be delivered.</p> <p>  If the Deputy has any additional idea that can help those people, because he is a representative too, he should please bring it forward, look for the support of the House, and he will be able to get it through and we can get to work on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#P01300"><p>I thank the Minister for corresponding with Lucan community college's Amnesty International group of students.  I presented the Minister with a series of petitions the students had collected on foot of a sleep-out they did recently, which all of the local Deputies attended.  I suggest, given the really good work of that group, that the Minister might invite them in to meet him and talk through some of things they discussed with us as Members of the Oireachtas in the constituency.  They had some very powerful real-life experiences the Minister would benefit from hearing.</p> <p>  I have specific questions but I want to respond to what I have heard so far.  In my opinion, and the Minister knows this, Rebuilding Ireland is not working.  Let me deal specifically with the arguments the Minister made to justify his claim that it is.</p><p>He stated that supply was finally being delivered.  Progress on the central supply target of Rebuilding Ireland is far behind the target, which was for an average of 25,000 new home completions each year over the lifetime of the plan.  I welcome the 18,000 homes completed last year but that is not what is in the plan.  To meet that central object of Rebuilding Ireland, it will be necessary to achieve 30,000 completions this year and even more than that next year and the year after.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is presenting missed targets as significant progress.  The Minister is correct that the CSO data are spot on but most independent observers know that progress is significantly behind the target.  </p><p> I also think the Minister's position on the monthly report is disappointing.  The Minister is again correct when he states it does not give us the background detail for which many of us have been asking.  The report does give us a point-in-time way of tracking the trend.  I appreciate the current incumbent was not the Minister when the monthly reporting was agreed but some of the strongest advocates of monthly reporting were academics and homeless service providers.  They realised the value of having that point-in-time tracker in addition to having more in-depth quarterly reports.  It gives us valuable information and we are one of only two member states in the European Union to have this system in place, as far as I know.  We should not underestimate its value.  It does not do all of the other things the Minister mentioned but it was never meant to.  </p><p> I look forward to the publication of the more detailed quarterly reports.  We do not know, for example, the average length of time that a family spends in emergency accommodation.  We have some of that information in respect of Dublin City Council but not for the rest of the country.  We also do not have information on whether an "exit", as the Minister describes it, from homelessness refers to someone leaving emergency accommodation or somebody being prevented from going into emergency accommodation through access to homeless HAP before the notice to quit expires.  Those are important things that we need to understand and the sooner we get that information the better.  </p><p> The Minister also referred to an eightfold increase in social housing.  I commented on this issue to the Minister of State, Deputy English, during the debates on the right to housing.  Other parties can speak for themselves but our party is not stating that no social housing is being delivered.  We are stating, however, that what is being delivered is nowhere near enough.  An eightfold increase sounds impressive, until we realise that there was virtually nothing eight years ago.  Eight times nothing is not particularly impressive.  </p><p> Deputy Cullinane is correct.  Real social housing need in his county and every county in the country is increasing.  We define real housing need as those people who are in need of real, permanent and secure long-term social housing tenancies.  Those are generally properties owned by the approved housing body sector or local government.  Adding those people on housing lists and HAP to those in insecure tenancies, the numbers overall are increasing significantly.  We are also concerned that the number of new households entering onto the local authority housing lists every year is greater than the number of real social housing units being delivered.  That is according to the Minister's own figures.  Some 14,000 households came onto the list last year, while the total for real social housing provided was about 7,000.  Current provision is not catching up with either existing or new needs.  </p><p> The Minister described yet another increase in the homeless figures as "disappointing".  It is not disappointing; it is deeply concerning that these figures continue to go in the wrong direction despite all the actions listed and all the work of the Minister, his officials and those in the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is so concerning that using words like "disappointing" does not capture the gravity of the situation.  The Opposition parties have passed a range of measures but the Minister continues to ignore them.  After the scandal revealed by the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" Nightmare to Let programme, a motion was passed with cross-party support recommending a range of measures for improving the private rental sector.  Every party on the Opposition benches supported that motion but the Minister has acted on none of those recommendations.  </p><p> On 3 October last year, a significant motion was passed with a range of policy alternatives.  The Minister has also set his face against almost all of those.  I acknowledge that the Minister has responded to some things on which Opposition Members and this committee have worked, including short-term lettings and strengthening the powers of the RTB.  Those are, however, peripheral issues.  I want to respond to all of these points.  I am concerned that we still do not have the full roll-out of the national quality standards framework inspections of all emergency accommodation, voluntary and private.  The current inspections are not independent.  I ask the Minister to comment on whether we are ever going to have fully independent inspections of all emergency accommodation.  </p><p> I am growing increasingly concerned at what I am hearing about the entry rents for the cost rental model.  It was originally meant to be &euro;1,600 a month in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  It is now down to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 but is far above what the people who need much of this accommodation can afford.  These projects are also taking far too long.  I would like the Minister to give the committee updates on each of the individual projects under way, such as Enniskerry Road, St. Michael's etc.  Turning to the co-living issue, I would have no difficulty with the concept if there was a way of controlling it and we could ensure that the idea was intended only for upwardly-mobile professionals who wanted to live in that type of accommodation for a short time.  My worry is that short-term investors will build these types of projects.  They will start off as the type of accommodation described by the Minister.  Those short-term investors will then flip the buildings, however, to take advantage of the generous tax incentives introduced by the Government.  Those developments will then become slums or tenements in the future.  That is my big concern.  How will the Minister prevent that from happening?  I am not asking if he agrees with a particular planning application but about a later stage when these projects are sold on.  How do we prevent them becoming substandard accommodation for people with no choices?  </p><p> On the approved housing bodies, I am again concerned that there is very little evidence that the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance are progressing the reclassification of the approved housing bodies.  That is going to have an impact on the Government's balance sheet and the ability of that sector to deliver in the future.  We also heard from the Minister's officials at one of our earlier meetings that the near zero energy building, NZEB, regulations are going to be published soon.  It is disappointing that a targeted phase-out date will not be included for gas boilers.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that.  I know there are issues regarding skills in the marketplace but I think that those regulations have to have a phase-out target date.  Preferably, that would be 2021 for gas boilers.  That is what is needed if we are to meet our climate change targets.  </p><p> Turning to the rental stock, as the Minister is aware, we have lost 12,000 or 13,000 rental properties since January 2017 according to the RTB.   We need to track the loss of properties and not landlords.  That is what is really important.  The vast majority of those properties, from the information that we have, were owned by one-off, accidental semi-professional landlords who had been stuck in negative equity.  Those landlords are now exiting the market because there is positive equity.  I have not seen or heard anything from the Minister or his officials concerning measures to try to prevent the disorderly exit of those types of properties from the market.  I know that is going to be difficult.  The Minister will probably tell me that increased supply from institutional investors is part of the solution.  What is the Minister going to do, however, to stop the exit of these vital properties from the rental market?  Clearly, that is one of the key drivers of the increased homeless figures we have seen today.  </p></speech>

I am just taking a final note of his questions.  I thank him for relaying that information to me from the school students.  I could not find a Twitter handle to tweet them.  Perhaps they are not on Twitter.  I have invited students into the Department from time to time to present on various projects they have done.  I am happy to have these students come in and talk through their experiences and their perspective.  A number of schools and students have corresponded with me on the crisis in housing and homelessness.   It is great to see that level of engagement which demonstrates that civic lessons in schools are touching on the most important issues we face in society today.  I am always happy to get correspondence and to engage with students.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made some political points at the beginning and I will address those.  Rebuilding Ireland is a work in progress.  It is not something that will transform what is happening in housing overnight.  It needs to be managed and that is why we have a Minister and a Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is true that some things will not work as well as initially intended.  They will need to be reformed and we have done that in certain areas.  </p> <p>  Turning to the issue of supply, the progress being made is not behind target.  I addressed this earlier.  It is unfortunate that Deputy &Oacute; Broin is trying to undermine some of the facts behind the targets.  It is clear that is what he is trying to do.  We remain on target for what we set out in Rebuilding Ireland, which is 25,000 new homes this year.  The overall target for new homes in the period 2017 to 2021 remains on track as well.  Those targets will be ramped up again as we move into implementing Project Ireland 2040, which will replace Rebuilding Ireland.  Regarding the monthly reports, we will continue to publish the numbers.  I do, however, want more detailed quarterly reporting.  It is not possible to do that more detailed reporting each month.  I understand the point the Deputy is making about having month-on-month figures.  That will only tell us one thing, however, while all sorts of other information is missing.</p><p>That is why I mentioned two improvements we will make: a quarterly report; and the independent research that is happening.  They will address the other issues the Deputy raised of how long families are spending in emergency accommodation and the other challenges we face.  I mentioned that in the first four months of this year there had been 329 exits of families from emergency accommodation into homes.  That highlights the great work being done every week to help families.</p><p> We do not have enough social housing homes yet.  When I talk about the increases we are seeing in the provision of social housing it is to welcome that we are increasing.  The Deputy claimed that as a party, Sinn F&eacute;in does not claim the Government is not building social housing homes.  He then stated, however, that eight times nothing is nothing and therefore he does give the impression that he believes nothing is happening.  He cannot take those two sides.  The supply of social housing is increasing.  The point about eight times is that while I accept it is coming from a low base, it is increasing quite dramatically.  We cannot go from nothing happening to 50,000 homes overnight.  We cannot do it in a year but we can do it in years.  When people say that we built thousands of homes in the 1950s, it will be true when we look back at Rebuilding Ireland, we will say that in those years we built thousands of homes but it will not happen in one or two years.  The programme and timings we have are clear in terms of increasing the stock of social housing by 50,000 homes over the course of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p> Regarding the number on the housing list, we have a determination in law for the calculation of the social housing need assessment.  The Deputy cannot say that he does not like that and that he will add extra things to it and that therefore the numbers are increasing because that is not how this works.  We know where we are from a social housing need perspective with just over 70,000 on the social housing list.</p><p> The housing assistance payment, which helps people in the private rental sector, is meeting the housing needs of people.  When people go through HAP into the private rental sector, they are no longer on the list.  The vast majority of people who are getting that support want it and they prefer the flexibility it gives.  It works for them as tenants because they do not want to live in a particular area in a social housing home.  They want to live in a different area in the private rental sector with HAP support and that is meeting their housing need.  From a policy point of view, it allows us to achieve a social mix in existing built areas and in newly built areas that we might not have been able to achieve.  In the future it will not be used to the extent today, but it will always be there as a component of the mix, ensuring tenants can have the flexibility they might want to have.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about my reaction to what is happening in emergency accommodation.  He tries to present a picture to people that I do not appreciate the gravity of this.  He should stop trying to personalise it to me.  He has been doing that for two years now.  I am not sure if he believes it is working.  All the feedback I have got from people, including over the past weekend, is that it is not.  Of course, I understand the gravity of this.  It is the most pressing issue we have in society today and I am responsible for getting people out of emergency accommodation and preventing them from entering emergency accommodation.  If the Deputy wants to dance on top of me for the use of an individual word, he can go ahead.</p><p> I will continue to do my work to help people.  I will continue to work with the NGOs and the local authorities.  I have met people in emergency accommodation.  I have met people coming out of hotels.  I have met people in dire living situations with the outreach teams.  I have also met people rough-sleeping.  I have also met the people working on the front line trying to help these people and who recognise the work we are doing.  Of course, we need to do more but it is not a small thing that in the first four months of this year, for every two families that presented to the local authorities, the NGOs were able to get a home for one of those families and unfortunately, not for the other family, which is what we need to change.  Over the same period, for every family in April that was entering, another family was exiting.  We also need to change that so no family is entering emergency accommodation.  That is the work we continue to do, week in and week out, using all the levers available to us.</p><p> The Deputy talks about having policy alternatives, which he does.  In certain areas he looks to tweak or change a policy.  He suggests that if we are doing A, we should do B on top of it.  I will come back and say why we cannot do that.  Having proposed changes to aspects of what the Government is doing does not come close to being an alternative to a comprehensive plan like Rebuilding Ireland.  Where there are good ideas, they get the support of the House.  They get the support of the Government and my officials.  I welcome the engagements we have had offline as a committee in the Department to tease through some of the issues and see where we can make improvements.  When positive suggestions come from the committee, of course, I embrace them.  However, I cannot do everything because I have to think about unintended consequences.  I have made this point recently.  People made changes in the recent past to try to improve one thing, accommodation standards, and it had the unintended consequence of people not being able to get secure accommodation.</p><p> As we look to do things in the rental sector, I have to think about other impacts it might have in respect of landlords.  The Deputy spoke about the rental stock.  For the past two years I have heard Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and others hammering landlords and now they are turning around and asking what we are going to do about landlords exiting the market.  While policy is important, words can do considerable damage.  The proposals by some Deputies had landlords saying, "That's it.  If this gets through into law, I'm not going to be a landlord any more."  I am in a position of saying it will not get through into law, because it does not have the popular support of the House, but it still has an impact.</p><p> The Deputy asked what we have done for landlords.  We introduced 100% mortgage interest relief for landlords in the last budget and the Sinn F&eacute;in leader, Deputy McDonald, hammered it.  That is something we were trying to do to help keep landlords in the sector and Sinn F&eacute;in hammered it.  The Deputy cannot continue to play both sides of this.  As we want more institutional investors, larger landlords, coming into the build-to-rent sector, I have made changes to the guidelines to help them in.  When someone is coming in and trying to do that, they are making a long-term play as landlords over 20 or 30 years.  They are not independent landlords looking for some kind of capital appreciation on a property with a view to exiting in five, ten or 15 years.  It is a much longer, more sustainable commitment.  That is part of achieving more of a balance.  As independent, smaller and accidental landlords leave, as is their right, we are replacing them with some other independent landlords but also with larger institutional landlords.</p><p> I am very glad the Deputy does not have a difficulty with the concept of co-living.  It is important to note that co-living cannot be sold on like individual apartments can be.  That is also true for the build-to-rent sector.  That is one of the protections in place in that regard.</p><p> Cost rentals are taking a bit longer.  If we were to start a cost-rental project and set a rent for the next 30 years and we found ten years in that the financial modelling was incorrect, it would force hundreds of thousands of people into housing insecurity.  We need to ensure we are thinking about the long-term horizon.  That is why the European Investment Bank is now carrying out detailed analysis of costings, as has the  National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  We have also done some analysis - I have seen it for certain sites - to see if the rent equates to one third of the disposable income of a person at the entry level point in the public service and in certain other jobs.  We have found that it does and we are trying to lock that into our modelling on that.</p><p> The pilot on the quality standards framework is now complete.  We will roll that out over the next 12 months.  In my recent engagement with the Ombudsman for Children, I spoke about this in detail.  It is a very good framework.  It has been developed with the experts in the sector and the NGOs.  I am not against independent inspections at a future date but I want to get the quality standards framework in place first and then see what we do in that area.  That is what I communicated to the ombudsman.  The priority now is to get that quality standards framework out across the country over the next 12 months.</p><p> On approved housing bodies, AHBs, the Department of Finance is leading on the accounting treatment when it comes to our balance sheet of AHBs.  Not all the large AHBs have been counted as per the CSO and EUROSTAT decision.  Therefore this is more complex than had they always been put on balance sheet.  We have received proposals from representatives of the sector as to how we can work around getting them off balance sheet.  It has been led by the Department of Finance.  It is not hindering development to date and I am working to ensure it does not hinder any future investment in AHBs, as we seek to include AHBs more in the delivery of social housing and other forms of housing.</p><p> The Deputy asked about nearly zero energy buildings, NZEBs, and gas boilers.  Gas boilers are being phased out anyhow.  There has been a decrease of approximately 30% in the use of gas boilers in homes in recent years.  I have more precise statistics on this.  At the moment I am engaged with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on the climate action plan the Government will introduce in coming weeks, about how we ensure that as we introduce NZEBs, passive buildings and other things, we also reduce gas boilers as a solution, which is already happening in itself.  As we do that, we need to have a pipeline for supply and maintenance of alternatives and that is happening.</p></speech>

Along with other speakers, I am also concerned about the homeless figures.  There are issues there that we need to address more.  We have all said that more needs to be done for people in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Another example is people who are coming to me who are not even qualifying to go onto the housing list.  These people are on family income supplement.  They are not qualifying.  There is a lot of this throughout the country.  Perhaps for the long term we need to provide for those who are barely over the income threshold.  There has to be a provision for hardship cases.  If a person is &euro;10 over the income threshold to qualify for the local authority housing list, there is no discretion.  The Minister can go to the Department to say it has to be changed.  If a genuine family is just &euro;10 or &euro;20 over the cap, they are being told "No".  We are not addressing the issue for this cohort.  It is becoming a massive issue and may be a bigger problem going forward.  The Department's figures for an average monthly spend on rent in Ireland state that rent in Carlow is &euro;554.  I can tell the Minister that the cheapest rent in Carlow for a house is &euro;1,000 per month.  A person can pay the balance with the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Years ago when people were in receipt of rent supplement they could not say how much the house was costing, but now they can.  People now have less and less income because they are paying a massive amount back to the landlord since the HAP is not sufficient.  This issue needs to be looked at.  I am shocked at the number of people coming to me who are in that position.  It is just another area that needs to be looked at.  I am very concerned about the issue of homelessness.</p><p> I want to know more about the funding of what I would have called local authority mortgages.  In fairness to the Minister, his Department has made this a big priority and it has had a massive uptake.  I know many people who will apply for this and many others who are in the system waiting for it.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify what way the funding is on this.  It is another area that needs to be addressed.</p><p> Nearly one year ago I brought to the Minister's attention the Danish co-housing system.  It is a living solution where families get together and build several small houses together on one plot of land with shared spaces for communal laundry and cooking, and a lounge.  I believe there are very good reports and statistics on this Danish model.  Is there any way we could look to this in the long-term picture, especially for housing those who are homeless?  These are the types of units that will happen going forward.</p></speech>

With regard to homelessness and the difficulties facing individuals, there are a number of different layers.  I said that I had an engagement with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and we have raised it with the inter-agency group that I had set up in 2017.  It has also been raised at a special meeting we have with the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers about the issue of arrears, payments, and people who are at risk of having to enter into emergency accommodation or to present as homeless because they are not able to meet the bills.  We ask if there is a further intervention we can make that would help much earlier in the timeline to keep that person in his or her home.  That work is progressing.  It is an important part that sometimes gets missed.  Of course we focus on people who present as homeless and on those who enter into emergency accommodation, but there is a cohort behind that who are in difficulty today and whose rent is building up.  They are not paying it and later they will find themselves in that line unless we can step in.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, and I are looking at that.</p> <p>  I have spoken already about the threshold review so will not go back over that.  We have changed the qualifying criteria for rent pressure zones to exclude the greater Dublin area, GDA, and that will have an impact in those areas outside the GDA.</p> <p>  I will give the committee an update on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  A total of &euro;92 million was drawn down to the end of 2018 and &euro;145 million was drawn down to the end of April this year.  The local authorities continue to accept, process and approve Rebuilding Ireland home loans because we have told them that the funding they need will be made available for those approvals they have given.  That discussion on funding is almost complete.  The Housing Finance Agency has an outstanding facility so there is no issue with it being able to secure the funding once I have the next figure for it.  The approvals and drawdowns are not contingent on this money, and it is not even contingent upon us going to the local authority and saying the money is there.  They have already been told to do what they are doing.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke of the co-housing model   There are a lot of concepts in the mix currently, one of which is the Danish model referred to by the Senator.  There is also a German model that is not too different from it.  We are progressing our own pilot project that will be similar but not exactly the same.  I am trying to tie together the final pieces of it.  In making a deal, the key aspect is the delivery of the land.  It is not about the willingness of people to engage in building such homes and it is not a design problem because these models exist elsewhere and they look really great.  It is about seeing what exactly we can deliver on the land, servicing the sites and so on, with the funding we have.  There is a piece of work happening in that regard.  I acknowledge that the Senator had mentioned the Danish model previously.  We are looking at it.</p></speech>

I want to come back in with three questions and will respond to some of the initial points.  On inspections, will all emergency accommodation be inspected or is it still just the voluntary sector accommodation to be inspected?  When I refer to "all" I mean the voluntary sector, the family hubs and the private sector accommodation.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of gas boilers, I urge the Minister to go back over the transcript of a recent committee meeting here on the subject.  The percentage of the total number of boilers going into new builds may be declining, but because far more properties are being built, the number of new gas boilers coming into the system is substantially greater.  We are being told by industry that perhaps as many as 60% of new builds have gas boilers.  The problem is that while it is not possible to phase out gas boilers today due to constraints around expertise in the industry, unless there is a phased target date by which gas boilers will no longer be used in new builds, they will be used for much longer than is necessary.  We will be here in 15 years having a conversation about where to get the money to cover the costs of retrofitting those boilers.  I urge the Minister to go back to look again at the nearly zero energy building guidelines and regulations before he publishes them to see if it is possible to consider a target date for the ending of the installation of gas boilers in new builds.  My preference would be for 2021.</p></speech>

That would be my preference, but the real issue is to include in those regulations a date by which they have to be out.</p> <p>  Perhaps I did not explain my question on co-living clearly enough so I will go through it again because the Minister did not answer it.  Consider a situation where an institutional investor comes in and gets planning permission to build a co-living facility, as the Minister describes them, which is then inhabited by the kinds of people the Minister has said might choose to live there.  If at a later stage another institutional investor comes along and purchases not just individual units but the entire block, this is the point at which many of us would be concerned.  Depending on what is happening in the market and the intentions of that institutional investor, the accommodation could go from providing relatively high-end and high-cost short-term accommodation for emerging professionals to providing accommodation for very vulnerable people.  It could descend into tenement type accommodation.  I do not hear anything as to how the Minister would prevent that from happening.  Is it a concern?  Does the Minister believe it is an aspect he should be looking at?</p> <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland target for new home completions is very clear.  It is an average of 25,000 over the lifetime of the plan.  It means that we will not get 25,000 over the first or second years, but we will have to reach 25,000 by the third year and then exceed that.  The Minister is behind in this.  The plan may catch up, and we will have to wait and see, but it would be more straightforward if the Minister would at least admit that he is behind and that there is a lot of catching up to do.</p> <p>  On the legal definition of housing needs, I can argue for and make the case for any definition I choose.  I do not accept that people who are in receipt of HAP have their long-term social housing needs met.  I accept that HAP is a short-term benefit support, and I accept that we will always need a housing benefit of that kind, but these people have a real long-term social housing need.  The best way to test if people on HAP would choose to remain on HAP or go for social housing is to put them back on the list and let them make that choice themselves.  The way the system has been set up under legislation, which Sinn F&eacute;in opposed, presents a problem where people do not have the choice they would have if amendments were made to the legislation in the way I would like to do it.</p><p> The Minister often tries to deflect criticism by accusing us of personalising the issue, as if somehow I was making personal attacks on him and his character.  Deputy Murphy is the Minister.  He is responsible.  Therefore, when people here criticise the things he does, it is because he is the Minister and we do not think he is doing the job correctly.  That is not personalising the issue.  It is called holding him to account.  If he does not like it, that is fine, but I will not make any apologies for criticising either the things he does because I believe they are the wrong things to do or the things he says.  Of course he will defend his actions and words, but if he is suggesting that somehow we should not criticise him because that does not play well with the voters, I am sorry but I have a job to do here and I will continue to do it.  Where he does things wrong or says things that are inappropriate, I will do my best to hold him to account, and I think the public will thank the committee for doing that into the future.</p><p> Lastly, just so the Minister knows, some local authorities are not accepting or processing new Rebuilding Ireland home loans.  South Dublin County Council currently is not.</p></speech>

They are quickly forgotten and he goes to mantras we have heard before.  I had this in the Seanad last week during debate on the rent Bill.  I had to make the same arguments again, even though I had already made them in the previous week with the same representatives from Deputy &Oacute; Broin's party because they were not listening or did not like the facts.  I am sorry if some of the facts are uncomfortable for Sinn F&eacute;in, but it is the case that we are making progress on the supply of new homes through Rebuilding Ireland.  I believe we are on course to meet the fundamental supply targets we have set for new homes available to use this year and in the following years.  We are not building all of these homes ourselves, of course.  Reaching these targets is about pulling the right levers and making the right changes in law and regulations to allow the sector to do more, and the sector is doing more as a result of the changes we have made.  This is not an exact science, however.  As I informed the committee earlier, when Deputy &Oacute; Broin was not here - I do not know if it was when he was out on the radio rather than at a housing committee meeting - we will see in the range of 23,000 to 25,000 new homes provided this year.  I believe we will reach 25,000 new homes, which is the target, but this is not an exact science.</p> <p>  I understand the point Deputy &Oacute; Broin makes about gas boilers.  I do not want to say too much about this now because I am in discussions with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on his climate action plan, but if we are going to have a target for phasing out, we certainly need to ensure we have security of supply chain at the same time.  These are the things being discussed in detail in advance of the climate action plan going to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Regarding co-living, any time we make a change in guidelines we absolutely must ensure we do not do anything that will reduce standards or have a negative impact on people who might be more vulnerable.  Looking at the rent Bill that was recently passed, all the improvements we are making to standards, such as defining a substantial improvement and linking it to measurements such as the BER rating, are very positive.  I refer also to the new inspectors we will have with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, for enforcement and the increased number of inspections taking place under Dublin City Council.  We are seeing a great improvement in the stock of housing coming online, with social housing being built today.  The social housing being built today is phenomenal, as it should be.  It is very important we do not let standards slip.  Just as we have done with student accommodation, we are watching this very closely in the case of build-to-rent and co-living to ensure there will not be any unintentional redirection of a type of accommodation into something for which it should not be used.</p> <p>  Regarding the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, every local authority has been informed to continue to accept, process and approve local authority loans, so if Deputy &Oacute; Broin has examples of people being refused, I ask him to share with me the emails - if he wants to anonymise the names, that is no problem - so I can get on to them and follow up on the cases myself.  However, the fact that I have not yet agreed or published a financial amount that will support these loans that are being approved does not mean they cannot be approved.  As I said, the Housing Finance Agency has a standing facility for the drawdown of loans that is quite significant.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made his point about social housing needs assessments.  I made mine.  We will not go back over that.</p> <p>  All emergency accommodation will be subject to the inspections and the standards in the framework.  There is a complaint regime and process in place.  I did discuss with the ombudsman improvements that might be made to the complaints regime to ensure that people feel safe and comfortable making complaints independent of the body or organisation that might be delivering the services.  Accommodation site visits will commence next year.  We will go to everyone, all service providers, and everyone will have to be compliant with the quality standards framework from, I think, the middle of 2020.  The quality standards framework is very good, and we should not lend ourselves to the view that things may be happening in emergency accommodation that should not be happening.  Again, I had an engagement with the ombudsman on this to ensure he was satisfied of certain things in the inspections he did.  I am not saying we will not have an independent inspection regime in place.  What I am saying is that we need to roll out the quality standards framework first, ensure that everyone is compliant, and then see where we go from there.</p></speech>

Action No. 3.19 of Rebuilding Ireland relates to the publishing of the strategic development management plans prepared by each local authority for its housing land.  The Minister might confirm whether all these plans have been completed, returned and published.  There may be reasons they have not been.  He may not have the information now.  If he does not, not to worry.  He might come back to us with supplementary information or drop the committee a note.  I would have no difficulty with that.</p><p>The Minister said one of the mechanisms available to local authorities to help them deliver the affordable housing options is the serviced sites fund and that &euro;310 million is available in grant funding to 2021 for infrastructure.  What is the position in this regard?  He might update us with some more information.</p><p>In <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning a story was carried about a report that is to be published which is highly critical of the maintenance standards in many of our local authorities.  Of course, this has an impact.  When these houses eventually become available, first, they should not be at such a low standard.  This is not the case everywhere, and I have not seen the report.  I have just read about it in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  However, this also has the knock-on effect of turning these houses around again when they become available if they are in such a dire state.  I have been in some local authority houses in my local authority area that I am amazed people even lived in for the five years prior to this.  A lot of this is due to the lack of maintenance of these houses and supports for the tenants in them.  As I said, I am sure the Minister has not seen the report.  I am just drawing it to his attention, and perhaps someone might come back on the report's comments on same.</p></speech>

To respond to the last question he asked, I did not see the report, I am afraid, because we were in committee first thing this morning.  The plan is, as we finish our voids programme, which is coming to its conclusion, to move that money and activity into maintenance.  Maintenance of the social housing stock across the country fell through the crisis years in a big way as resources for local authorities were reduced.  We are now increasing resources and funding for local authorities.  As we come through the voids programme, we will be able to move that money and activity into a maintenance programme, which is very important because of the increase in the number of social housing homes that we must maintain.  Of course we do so.  These are people's homes, so State management in this regard is very important.  We have hardwired this into all the regeneration programmes we have coming out.</p> <p>  Some &euro;310 million was made available for the serviced sites fund in budget 2019, comprising &euro;275 million from the Exchequer and &euro;35 million from local authorities.  The breakdown on this in spending, as allocated, is &euro;100 million in 2019, &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021.  This funding will not all be spent in each of the years, but I have authority within my budget to carry forward money for the serviced sites fund into subsequent years as I need to do so.  That funding is there to deliver at least 6,200 homes as part of that affordability pipeline, but it is not the only affordability pipeline we have.  Last year we commenced the relevant section of Part 5 of the 2009 Act relating to the serviced sites fund.  We introduced the regulations for the scheme of priority in March of this year.  As I said earlier, 26 of the 31 local authorities have submitted their schemes to me, and ten have been approved by local authorities.  I made the first call for sites from local authorities in June of last year.  We finalised ten projects for 1,400 homes in December of last year worth &euro;43 million.</p><p>We have received from 20 local authorities the economic assessments they did towards the end of last year.  We issued a second in call in April and we have received 29 submissions from 15 local authorities so far.  These are worth about &euro;90 million and will help support almost 2,000 new homes.  We will give sanction on those that have been successful very shortly.  That is the current position with the serviced sites fund.</p><p> Work on action 3.19 of the Rebuilding Ireland plan is ongoing.  In some areas, as we solve particular land issues, we are then able to update the live map we have in Rebuilding Ireland regarding what is happening with land use.  In other areas, we have made greater progress in getting a proper picture of the land need.  The Galway task force will do an important piece of work on that.  Some land belonging to local authorities is indebted.  We are also considering private land for potential turnkey solutions as these may be a cheaper and quicker way of getting social housing delivered.  There are several layers to this and the process is ongoing, which is the reason it is coloured orange on the map.  We are constantly publishing and updating the website map.  Certain areas have a very detailed plan already in place.  The Housing Agency has done its land aggregation scheme work within the timeframe.  With regard to the publication of individual plans, I will check the position with the relevant section.  As the Senator is aware, the housing delivery office in the Department checks weekly with the local authorities what is being delivered and where the land is coming from and does future needs assessments for land for local authorities and housing bodies.  The purpose of the regional workshops is to identify the land needs of housing bodies that local authorities might be able to meet or State land on which housing could be delivered by the Land Development Agency.</p></speech>

The Housing Agency has finished its work on the land aggregation scheme, which I believe it has published.  According to the report I have, all of the plans were returned by the end of September 2017.  Separately, local authorities are updating the Rebuilding Ireland land map.  I will get a detailed note for the Senator to confirm the position and see what we can do about publishing the plans.  Local authorities believe they are meeting their reporting requirements by updating their land maps on the website on a quarterly basis.</p></speech>

When it comes to dealing with the wider housing and homelessness emergency, however, I am truly in despair at the failure of the Minister's policies in my area.  The failure of those policies presents an appalling vista.  Next year, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will, at best, deliver six new council houses.  The Minister said all of this takes time and things cannot be done overnight but claimed the situation would improve and as we get nearer to the end line of Rebuilding Ireland, the output of directly provided council housing would ramp up relative to the reliance on the private sector.  That is not happening in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where things are moving in the other direction.  The council will provide six new council houses next year.  How can the Minister possibly claim that is a serious attempt to address the housing crisis in D&uacute;n Laoghaire?  It is shocking that there will be just six new social houses provided.  While some units may be provided by approved housing bodies and under Part V, the council's housing output next year will amount to six units.  That is significantly lower than the number provided this year, which was pathetic compared with demand.  The Minister should not say that it is the council's fault or that the Government is doing its best to put pressure on local authorities because D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il council.</p> <p>  I did not hear the Minister's response to the question on the reliance on the housing assistance payment as I had to pop out for a minute.  Some 70% of people in receipt of the HAP in D&uacute;n Laoghaire are making top-up payments compared with a national figure of 50%.  It is absolutely shocking that people are paying hundreds of euro over and above what they are supposed to pay.  Does that not prove that the HAP is not equivalent to directly provided council or social housing?  The Minister has always claimed the two approaches are simply different ways of delivering the same thing.  If 70% of the people in the HAP scheme have to make top-up payments, they are clearly completely different.  People on the HAP scheme are prey to private landlords and the extortionate rents they are charging.  Moreover, the local authorities are now facilitating this extortion by approving situations where these massive top-up payments have to be paid.  In some cases, the council has even suggested that people use their child benefit to make up the difference.  People are now using child benefit to make up the difference between their rent and the housing assistance payment, which is directly leading to impoverishment and money being taken away from children.</p> <p>  On another matter, one which we knew was in the pipeline but is now an accomplished fact, as I discovered last night, DLR Properties Limited, a corporate subsidiary of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, yesterday completed the handover of part of the Cherrywood development known as TC3 to Johnny Ronan, a  private developer.  How can the Minister excuse that sale?</p></speech>

It is unbelievable that the Minister would allow this to happen.  This is a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il council.  We opposed the setting up of that corporate subsidiary as we believed the democratically elected representatives of the council should make decisions about these matters.  However, this corporate subsidiary, which is dominated by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, has been allowed to hand over what is known as TC3 to a private property developer.  This shocking decision will not deliver any of the desperately needed affordable housing.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that the standards and quality of social housing that is being delivered must be maintained.  Allow me to give him a newsflash on what is actually happening because it drives a coach and horses through his claims about social mix and the integration of people from different income streams.  Cualanor-Honeypark, one of the biggest developments, was in the hands of the National Asset Management Agency but is now back in the hands of private developers.  We have just discovered, on foot of representations from residents, that all of the houses built for social housing under Part V were built to lower specifications than the private equivalent in the same development.  That is housing apartheid.  The residents are now suffering the consequences with noise pollution and so on between units.  At every level, the social houses were built to a lower specification.  The attitude taken was that these were council tenants who could, therefore, be given lower quality housing.</p><p>How does that tally with the Minister's claimed aspiration for a social mix and placing people from different income brackets in together?</p><p> Those people who cannot even get on a housing list because their incomes are just above the threshold are completely in no man's land, in particular in areas like mine.  I have repeatedly asked the Minister when he is going to raise the income thresholds for people who have been waiting ten or 12 years and are being whacked off the list because they get a job or a pay rise.  They are trying to do well.  They are not dependent on social welfare as some people might have to be.  They are working and they then lose their ten or 15 years on the housing list.  This is happening every week.  I have asked the Minister again and again to do something about this but we are told it is being looked at and that there is a review.  We are told there is this, that and the other.  A whole generation of people who are working are in no man's land.  There is nothing for them.  There is no affordable housing and they cannot get on the council housing lists.  Nothing is happening.  What is the Minister going to do about it?</p></speech>

He talks about the failure of policy but I am not sure what policy proposal he is bringing forward as a silver bullet to the challenges we face.  What we require in housing is a number of different policies because it is a very complex area.  That is what we have.  To pretend Deputy Boyd Barrett has some radical and different way of doing it that would have the support of the public let alone of the House is disingenuous.  I admit that D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a special case.  It is different from what is happening in other parts of the country.  Where was Deputy Boyd Barrett when I went out to the local authority there to talk to councillors about the challenges in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, however?  He was outside protesting.  I was inside a democratic chamber trying to resolve issues and go through details and Deputy Boyd Barrett was outside with a megaphone trying to drown out the meeting.  What use is that?</p></speech>

The Deputy is involved in the political democratic process but he has to lean in and get involved.  He can bring forward proposals and work with us or he can go outside and protest.  Going outside to protest will not house one extra person.  I guarantee that.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific question, more than 1,500 new homes will have come into the stock of social housing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire between 2018 to 2021.  In 2019, we will see 650 come into the stock of social housing.  Last year, 192 homes were built.  I do not know why Deputy Boyd Barrett does not count Part V or housing body provision as social housing.  These are homes that go to people on the housing list and they are social housing homes.  The Deputy is wrong not to count them but he does so from an ideological point of view, which I just do not understand.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will deliver on its targets for this year.  We have seen a drop in social housing needs in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We saw the local authority exceed is targets last year.  I was in 33 homes in Fitzgerald Park recently.  They are fantastic homes.  Deputy Boyd Barrett talks about quality but when is the last time he was in a new build social housing home?  They are built to fantastic standards.</p></speech>

It is there to complement what we are doing in relation to build.  There is too much dependence on HAP today but that dependence will decrease.  However, there will always be a need for HAP because individuals like the flexibility it offers around where they can live and from a social housing policy point of view, it allows us to secure a mix of tenure in existing stock where we do not have it or in new stock as it is built if that stock consists, for example, of apartments.  It plays a very positive role.  The top-ups to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred are being met by the local authorities in many instances because we have given them the flexibility to do so.  Local authorities are meant to carry out assessments to ensure that where top-ups are being met by individuals that it does not put them at risk of being unable to meet their bills or make other payments.  Where that does happen, however, we are looking at initiatives and interventions we can make around arrears to ensure people do not find themselves in housing insecurity because of affordability issues where they are living.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to income thresholds.  As I said in earlier contributions, the Housing Agency is looking at this and a review is under way.  I want to make a number of social housing reforms now that the stock is increasing.  I hope I will be able to bring the reforms forward as a single package so that we can have one major discussion around differential rents and other aspects of social housing policy at the same time.  We are working towards that.  In addition, for those who will never qualify for social housing even when the income thresholds change, if they do, the affordability programme is in place.  It is why we are no longer saying as a Government that we will just have a social housing programme where if one qualifies, that is fine but if one does not, we wish him or her good luck.  We recognise the views of citizens all over Europe and in many modern cities are changing as to what responsibility the State has around the provision of housing.  It is no longer about just social housing, emergency accommodation and nothing else.  In fact, it is about looking after a middle group of people who might never be able to afford to live or rent near where they work, in particular in urban areas, unless we make the interventions we are making now.  We are responding.  First, we responded with rent caps and now we are responding with affordable housing and cost rental.  We will continue to respond with measures around land such as we are doing with the Land Development Agency so that we can have mixed housing development in desirable areas where there is high demand.</p></speech>

Instead, the site is going to a property developer who is just looking to maximise the profit that can be squeezed out of it and these boxes with fold-out beds for which the developer will charge &euro;1,300.</p> <p>  I will provide some local knowledge to what has become a national debate on the site.  People across D&uacute;n Laoghaire and from all sectors of society are raging about the proposal.  It is an absolute abuse of the strategic housing development process.  That one can bypass the normal planning process to do this is shocking.  This is not meeting the area's housing needs.  No one asked for something like this.  People are asking for decent quality housing for families and individuals who cannot get anything because it is unaffordable in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where the average property price is in excess of &euro;600,000, rents are well over &euro;2,000 per month on average and virtually no public housing is being provided.  It is shocking.  We submitted an objection to this development.  As I did last week, I ask the Minister to examine whether allowing something like this is an abuse of the strategic housing development process.</p> <p>  The Minister did not comment on the question of whether it was appropriate in the current climate for a local authority, which is under his remit, to be exchanging land that could provide hundreds of desperately needed housing units in Cherrywood for office blocks.  In the teeth of this crisis, is it appropriate that public land that could be used for housing is being given to private property developers?  I believe it is shockingly inappropriate.  Will the Minister please comment?</p> <p>  The Minister did not comment on my point about the Part V example that I gave.  The Minister is not aware of that particular example, but if my assertion is correct and Part V social housing is built to a lower standard and quality than private development in the same housing development, does he view that as acceptable?  It is not acceptable and represents housing apartheid.  There are two tiers of housing standards.  This increases the stigma and so on associated with social housing.  I ask the Minister to please comment.</p></speech>

Regarding co-living, I will not discuss an individual planning application.  As the Minister with responsibility for planning, I must be very careful.  I note that the Deputy did not object to co-living as a concept when it was introduced.  Earlier today, one of his colleagues, as well as Sinn F&eacute;in, welcomed the concept and supported it.  It is only a small part of the supply, though.  Over the next 12 months, it will probably form less than 1% of the tens of thousands of new homes that will be built.  Co-living is not a solution to our supply problem.</p> <p>  Regarding the question on building offices in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's area and the exchange the authority has made, I am not across the details.  I will examine the issue and see what is happening.  We know that there are pressures on land supplies.  I want as much land as I can get, and I created the LDA to get more State lands for more housing.  I cannot comment further on the situation in question, as I am not across the details.</p> <p>  We must find a balance between autonomy at local level and control at central government level.  I believe in local government form and in devolving more powers to local authorities.  For example, I am glad that the plebiscite was approved in Limerick.  I have spoken to councillors re-elected in the Deputy's area over the course of the weekend.  They gave out to me for taking too many powers away from either the executive or the elected representatives.  I must give some degree of autonomy to the officials and councillors in how they go about their business in their local authority areas.  That is not to say that it is not my responsibility.  Rather, there is a balance between my role as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and their role as the relevant local authority.  We are trying to strike the right balance all of the time.  Whenever I go to do something that I believe would make something happen more quickly but would involve removing powers, I get blamed for undermining local authorities.  When I go to give more powers to local authorities and they do not use them as the Deputy might like them to, I get blamed for not taking responsibility for local authorities.

The social housing that I have seen has been built to an exceptional standard, as it should be.  We are not falling back into some of the mistakes that were made previously in terms of the stigmas that arose from social housing.  Design, planning and forethought are going into the building of new social homes, how they look and feel, what they are like for the families moving in and the additional facilities that must be built.  Now that supply is increasing, the challenge is becoming more about planning and ensuring that we are building the right types of homes in the right types of places.  This is crucial, not just for meeting our current housing needs, but for ensuring that we do not make mistakes that will come back to bite us severely in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019052900002#W00500"><p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for raising the TC3 issue.  Last night, I was informed by a number of D&uacute;n Laoghaire councillors that the chief executive had taken the decision to do a land swap.  I do not want to get into too much detail and I am conscious of what I am saying, but will the Minister examine the record of this committee?  I raised this matter a number of times.  I have the exact dates.  I went to the trouble of finding them because I knew that this particular case would be raised.  I always opposed the establishment of a company that was at arm's length from the council and in which the latter had no function.</p> <p>  From speaking with a number of councillors this morning, I am reliably informed that they had no hand, act or part in the decision to dispose of the land.  At this committee, I requested that the director of the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, examine the issue and the general question of having a company that was indebted, insolvent and propped up by the shareholder, namely, the council.  In this case, the shareholder's agent is the chief executive.  DLR Properties Limited has a board.</p> <p>  Many months ago, I raised questions at this committee about zoning issues.  I have also raised questions with the council.  This site had the potential to build hundreds of residential units.  I am not suggesting that they should all have been social or affordable housing, but there could have been an imaginative mix that also included offices.  It is located in a strategic development zone, the second such zone in the country.  That zone could be one of the most successful, given its Luas connectivity, schools and the great infrastructure that was front-loaded into this scheme.</p> <p>  I am not dropping the Minister into a situation.  I am on record as appealing to him about this issue.  Will he speak to the director of the LGAS and examine her qualified notes in respect of DLR Properties Limited?  In her 2017 report, she raised concerns about this company.  The company has been raised a number of times in local government auditing reports.</p> <p>  Is the deal complete?  We may not be able to do anything.  Some weeks ago, I asked the Minister to look into this issue and that the message be conveyed to him that it would be looked into.  Now, the councillors have been informed - after the election as opposed to beforehand even though this situation had been ongoing - of the swap.  The bottom line is these are public moneys.  This is not a company that is rich in cash.  It is indebted.  We are discussing taxpayers' money.  There are serious issues.  The council is swapping a debt for another debt or property.  I do not want to go into too much detail because I am conscious that this is a public meeting, but I appeal to the Minister to seek a full briefing from the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the background and reasons involved and the debt to which the company is exposed.  Forget about who is involved - this is all debt guaranteed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I am not sure whether that is a satisfactory situation, given that the company is effectively at arm's length from the council.  It has an executive and a board.  As a limited company, it has its own directors.  To be fair, some of them are councillors, but they are not allowed to discuss any aspect of this business with the local authority.</p> <p>  An alarm bell must be ringing at this meeting.  Where any company that is wholly owned by a local authority yet is at arm's length from it and not accountable to it, serious concerns arise.</p><p>I ask the Minister to take a look at this TC3 issue and to ascertain its background.  I will collaborate with a number of Oireachtas Members today in suggesting that if it means bringing people before a committee of the Houses, we should do so.  I suggest to the Minister that he will have a number of parliamentary questions in a matter of days on this issue.  There is outrage about this locally.  We need answers and if it is possible, within the constraints of the Minister's position and the sensitivities around it, I seek some sort of report on it.  There is a lot to be found out and to be inquired into and I ask the Minister to use his office to do so.</p></speech>

I know the Local Government Audit Service looked at the operations of these types of entities before.  I suggest that the Senator might raise it as a Commencement matter, to help have a public engagement on this matter and we can speak about this specific project in as much detail as I will be allowed to at the time.  That might help further some of the concerns the Senator has raised with me today.  I do not have the details of this in front of me so I do not want to speak on it in too much detail.  I am flagging the restrictions I have on my powers because of the autonomy that we give to local authorities but I am happy to look into it in more detail in advance of us discussing it in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I have some concerns that there is an over-reliance on it in specific areas because I know of some locations in my area where 100% of construction of housing is being purchased for turnkey developments for either approved housing bodies or the local authority.  I am concerned about the implications that has on having houses available for first-time buyers.  Another reason I have been given for this is the lack of funding available to contractors to finish out estates.  The fact that such funding is not available means they are looking to the Department for a quick solution for finishing out the estates.  With that in mind, I am aware that the Department established a &euro;780 million fund for construction contractors who could apply for funding for smaller developments such as these.  What progress is being made with those, how many applications have been made and how many have been awarded with funding from that capital fund for development?</p></speech>

There is a misperception around what a turnkey is.  People hear the word "turnkey" and they think a house is built and completed and the local authority has decided to buy it and take the keys.  In most instances, a turnkey is where the land is vacant, is not being developed at all and will not be developed but for the fact that the local authority has engaged and decided that there is land in a preferable location for social housing delivery and has negotiated the delivery of homes on that land all the way from that point through planning, permission and construction.  In such cases, were it not for the local authority engaging, nothing at all would be built on such land in many instances.  The word "turnkey" does not mean the housing is completed and the local authority is just collecting the keys.  It is a confusion sometimes because the word "turnkey" does not reflect what it is and so when we have a public debate on this issue, people think we are just stepping in front of the buyer and taking the keys but that is not what is happening.  It also allows us to provide social housing homes in areas where we do not have the land in the right area, which is really important.</p> <p>  We have told local authorities not to compete with first-time buyers, so where it is an individual house on a road, which is an acquisition and not a turnkey, and there is an engagement from a first-time buyer, the local authority is to back off.  Where there are a significant number of homes where we might not have engaged before construction commenced, local authorities are told to back off.  We are trying to manage this as best we can.  Turnkeys are useful because they involve land in areas where we might not have land.  They can also be more efficient and we need to make sure we are providing social housing in the right places, so they have an important function.</p> <p>  On the overall build that happened last year, there was not an over-reliance nationally on turnkeys but in some areas there would have been more than others because that is how the market was working and that was what we needed to do.  It is an important part of delivery and the only real difference between it and what might be considered local authority builds is that it is not happening on local authority land.  They have the land and it is in an area we want for social housing.  Maybe they have already serviced it so it can move quite quickly or maybe they already have planning so we can move quite quickly and that is why we go with the term "turnkeys".</p> <p>  On the Senator's second question which was on Home Building Finance Ireland, that is operational as of the beginning of this year.  It does not come under my remit but I understand there will be a report in July on the first six months of its operation that will go into the number of loans that have been approved, drawn down and everything else.</p></speech>

From the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, we are joined by Mr. Nick Henderson, chief executive officer, and Ms Rosemary Hennigan, who is the policy and advocacy officer.  They are both very welcome.  Joining us from the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, is Mr. Lucky Khambule, the group co-ordinator, as well as Mr. Bulelani Mfaco, Ms Donnah Vuma, Ms Tina Ndlovu, Ms Rosemary Kunene, Mr. Christopher Sibanda and Ms Babs Leonard, all of whom are members.  I did my best with the pronunciations and I am sure my name will not prove any easier.  All of our guests are very welcome.</p><p>I will shortly invite the nominated witnesses to make their opening statements.  Before doing that, I first have to advise on privilege for witnesses who come before an Oireachtas committee.  I draw the attention of our guests to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Before hearing the first opening statement, I again remind people to switch off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  I invite Mr. Henderson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The Irish Refugee Council is a charity that helps people seeking asylum.  We give information, provide early legal advice, help people to access employment and education, help young people and support people to leave direct provision through our housing project.  We also advocate for improvements in the asylum process.</p> <p>  It has been a consistent call of the Irish Refugee Council that direct provision should end.  Moreover, politicians across the spectrum, international bodies, other non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and, most importantly, people living in direct provision have called for it to end.  There are countless articles, reports and testimonies on what is wrong with this system.  The fact that Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur on child protection, has called on Ireland to abolish direct provision and that the Ombudsman, as recently as yesterday, has said it is not a suitable long-term accommodation for those waiting on an asylum claim should alone be enough to bring about wholesale and radical change.  Direct provision is already, unfortunately, a chapter in Ireland&rsquo;s long and dark history of institutional living.</p> <p>  We believe the system has worsened in recent months, particularly in the context of emergency centres.  A grave concern we have is that the short-term emergency situation will become entrenched, which will make the implementation of change harder.  If direct provision ends, something will have to take its place.  The bottom lines of a new system should include own-door accommodation and the opportunities to cook for oneself, live in a community and to work.  We believe this model could be agreed upon more easily than others think.  On foot of discussions with the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, I believe it is open to real change.  However, the bigger challenge lies in how the new model could be delivered.  We are very doubtful that existing providers or the current procurement process being rolled out over 2019 can deliver that model.  The system is broken and it is costing too much for too little.  We know that it must change, so how do we get to a new system?</p> <p>  First, we should consider the accommodation of people seeking asylum as a housing issue.  That is not to draw from existing funds for housing but to take a housing policy approach.  The Department of Justice and Equality is not equipped to design that policy and the responsibility should not lie with that Department.</p> <p>  Second, we should use the existing budget more strategically.  The Government has built only three accommodation centres in 18 years.  The majority of existing centres were originally designed for other purposes.  The State should procure fit-for-purpose accommodation to meet particular needs.  We believe this will be a cost saver in the long term.  Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Director General of the Department of Justice and Equality, told this committee a few weeks ago that the spend on direct provision in 2019 will likely reach &euro;95 million to &euro;100 million.  In 18 years, over &euro;1.2 billion has been paid to private providers of accommodation.  Spending money on providing people with asylum is a good thing, but it should be done strategically to the benefit of people in that system and the public.</p> <p>  Third, and linked to this, a fundamental criticism of the system so far has been that it has been reliant on for-profit actors.  Private providers are not social workers or public servants.  They cannot and are not meeting the complex social needs of the people living in their centres.  That is a public obligation on the State.  There are many housing bodies in Ireland that are non-profit, work to a particular mission and have strengths and expertise.  We believe those bodies could be best placed to provide accommodation.  The procurement process has to change for this to happen, with longer lead-in times, longer contracts, funding for capital and conversion costs and a reduction in the number of people a provider must accommodate.  Current procurement models require a provider to accommodate 50 or more people.  The approved housing bodies, AHBs, tell us that this risks perpetuating the model of congregated living and it is difficult to procure buildings of this size.</p> <p>  Fourth, direct provision is not just about the bricks and mortar.  We can reduce delays in the system by giving resources to decision makers and increase legal aid at pre-decision stage so applications are better prepared.  The right to work should be broader and we should allow for integration from day one.  This model has been developed successfully in Scotland.</p> <p>  Fifth, there must be greater engagement on this issue by all Departments.  This was emphasised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, head of office, Enda O'Neill, last week.  Moreover, the Department of Justice and Equality could work better internally.  The International Protection Office, IPO, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, the Legal Aid Board, the Reception and Integration Agency, the ministerial decisions unit, MDU, of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, are all under the remit of the Department but they could work better.  To give an example, the Legal Aid Board is not supported enough to ensure everyone has a well prepared application to the International Protection Office.  This means the International Protection Appeals Tribunal has to deal with more complicated appeals.  If somebody is recognised as a refugee, there are long delays in issuing the declaration of refugee status by the ministerial decisions unit.  This means that people spend longer in the direct provision system and the system becomes more overcrowded, which puts pressure on the Reception and Integration Agency and leads to people being accommodated in emergency centres.  There are not enough appointments issued by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for people to get a residency card.</p> <p>  At each step, there are hurdles requiring intensive interventions and supports.  It does not have to be this difficult, but systemic change is key.  The written submission we will provide to the committee will go into more detail on what I have said.</p></speech>

The Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland is a platform for asylum seekers to join together in unity and purpose.  The group is made up of people who are directly affected by the direct provision system.  As people who are currently undergoing the international protection application process we, unlike experts and NGOs, are uniquely placed to offer direction to the committee on the many issues on which it has asked us to comment.  The content and recommendations in our submission are all directly informed by the experiences of our members, asylum seekers who live every day of their lives under the appalling system of direct provision.  The purpose of our submission is to gather together our collective experiences to inform the committee and to make a series of key proposals that would make the Irish asylum system compatible with minimum human rights standards.</p> <p>  We do not view human rights as gifts that governments bestow on people.  They are rights and entitlements we all possess by virtue of being human.  People cannot be treated as less than others and, indeed, less than human merely because of differences in nationality and citizenship.  In May 2017, the Supreme Court told the Department of Justice and Equality that as asylum seekers, we can rely on constitutional protections that affect us as human beings.  That simply means fundamental human rights are not reserved for Irish, EU or other legally resident nationals in Ireland and that an asylum seeker child does not have to be Irish for the best interest of the child to prevail.  It cannot be in the best interest of the child, therefore, to ban parents from working.</p><p>There are children in direct provision forced to grow up in State-sponsored poverty as their parents are unable to provide for their material needs.  Many of them are too ashamed to tell their friends in school where they live.  In a direct provision centre in Kildare, children dumped their sandwiches underneath their seats on the bus because they were too ashamed of carrying the same sandwich for lunch every day.  A mother once told an Irish court that she had to sell sexual favours while living in direct provision centres to support her child.</p><p> The asylum system must uphold and vindicate the fundamental human rights of all international protection applicants, including family rights, the right to privacy, the right to education and the right to work.  The best interest of the child must prevail.  Vulnerable persons must be looked after.  LGBT+ rights, women&rsquo;s rights and the right to religious freedom must be safeguarded.  We receive so many texts from distressed asylum seekers.  One such text was from a woman who had spent about five years living in direct provision and was ostracised for having HIV.  She had no privacy to take medication, and as soon as room mates found out what the pills were for, people began gossiping about her.  Another text we received was from a queer woman who was told by the International Protection Office that she was not credible, thus her application for asylum rejected.  This means that the IPO believes she is lying about her sexual orientation and wants her to prove it.  She is not the only LGBT+ applicant to be treated in such a manner.  That dehumanising practice of assuming asylum seekers are lying must stop.  The role of the asylum system is to vindicate peoples&rsquo; right to seek asylum and to live in safety in Ireland, not to dehumanise people.  The rights of the child and the protection of children in the international protection system must be a priority of the asylum system.  Undocumented minors who turn 18 before receiving a final decision on their asylum claim must be supported to live independently and not be shipped off to direct provision centres.</p><p> Deportations are brutal and dehumanising and can have no part of an ethical and human rights-centred approach to asylum and migration.  That is why many people commit suicide in direct provision centres.  Some attempt to commit suicide because they fear that they might be deported, especially when they get letters from the Department of Justice and Equality saying their application has been rejected.  Many of the people who are taking sleeping pills in direct provision struggle to sleep for fear that the next letter in the post could be a deportation order.  We also believe that no child born in Ireland, in the asylum system or undocumented should ever be served with a deportation order.  The Minister for Justice and Equality can, should, and must introduce a scheme to regularise undocumented people in Ireland, with long-term residency for all children born in the State to non-EU parents.  That is not asking too much.  We are not asking the Minister to make them all citizens.  It is just regularisation so that people who are already living here can get on with their lives.</p><p> People seeking protection in Ireland are entitled to live an independent life with their families in accommodation that upholds the rights to privacy, dignity, and integrity of the person.  The warehousing of asylum seekers in direct provision centres throughout the country, without certainty of time for stay, amounts to effective incarceration as many asylum seekers are divorced from the social, economic and political life of the country in the same manner as prisoners in Mountjoy Prison.  Among our key recommendations is that the legal process has to be reformed.  The process of seeking asylum is first and foremost a legal process so it is essential that people receive all necessary legal advice and that the system is orientated towards vindicating people's right to seek asylum and safety.  The right to work must be immediate and unrestricted for all people seeking protection in Ireland.  At present, people who are on appeal are excluded from working.  People should be accommodated in reception for no longer than three months before moving into housing in the community.  We do not believe people should be segregated and living in centres.  They should be living in communities along with everybody else in Ireland.  Direct provision should be abolished and people seeking asylum in Ireland should have access to the same housing supports via their local authorities as is the case for others.  Full and tuition fee free access to education and training at all levels must be available to international protection applicants.  If the State keeps a person in direct provision for five years and then gives him or her a letter saying he or she can live in Ireland, where does the State expect the person to start living?  These recommendations are not insurmountable for the Government.  Uganda has more than 1 million refugees and is one of the poorest countries on earth.  We are human beings like all of you.  All we ask is that we be treated as such.  The very fact that people have to ask the Government to treat them humanely should shame all of you.</p></speech>

We will now move on to members' questions.  Deputy Jack Chambers was first to indicate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00300"><p>I thank both organisations for their excellent presentations and submissions.  A model was mentioned for moving from the Department of Justice and Equality to approved housing bodies.  It was said that there was a lack of synchronicity in the strategic approach.  What would be the State oversight of an approved housing body approach?  We have difficulty with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Custom House on a lot of housing policy issues.  Where would the funding stream be delivered or what would the oversight mechanism be to deliver that synchronicity?  I agree with the witnesses.  In excess of &euro;1 billion has been spent over several years and we have nothing to show for it in terms of State spending apart from profit for private providers.  How do we deliver a very well thought-out approach?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00400"><p>We would use the existing budget, which is large.  It may be, and I would suspect, that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government would want nothing to do with this issue.  Therefore it may be necessary to take it away from the Reception and Integration Agency and from the Department of Justice and Equality and create a new, independent entity.  Alternatively, the Government might create a new body and attach it to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but ring-fence the funding so there would be no accusations or suspicion that it was taking anything away from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government's resources or those of the local authorities.</p> <p>  On maintaining oversight, we believe that could be done relatively easily.  We are about to produce a piece of work around the public sector duty.  We believe the State can maintain and require of private operators of current and future direct provision centres that they embed in human rights protection via the public sector duty which is contained in the Human Rights and Equality Act.  The idea would be that these approved housing bodies are experts in housing and in providing care and assistance to vulnerable people.  We are already guaranteeing oversight as these organisations would already have a board, a strategic plan and a clear mission.  We would be embedding good quality through those mechanisms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00500"><p>That is a fair point.  It is just that when a budget is allocated to an approved housing body, it would have to come through a specific Department.  I agree that it would have to be through some agency that manages to ring-fence the funding so there would not be pull from other areas.</p> <p>  Mr. Mfaco's statement was very moving.  He has highlighted a contradiction in that people are coming from countries in which there are human rights abuses and we are replacing those abuses with our own, domestic set of difficulties where we are not vindicating human rights.  It is a profound contradiction that we need to resolve domestically.  I acknowledge that.  One issue that was raised last week is important.  Perhaps some of the witnesses can give feedback on this.  I refer to the right to work and the constitutional precedent that has been set by the Supreme Court.  Has there been any improvement or feedback in terms of people being able to work?  Will the witnesses give us any update on how things have changed since that judgment?  Is it still a difficult threshold to meet?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bulelani Mfaco" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#E00600"><p>It is still difficult for many people who have been in direct provision for a long time.  When they introduced the labour market access permit, it was only to be issued to people who had been awaiting a first instance decision for about nine months.  That immediately excluded many people who already had decisions and were on appeal.  We know that there are people who go through an appeal for years and years.  We had one lady who went through an appeal for about eight years before she was granted refugee status.  In that time, she was unable to work although she had a legitimate claim to asylum.  They botched the initial decision at the IPO.  We have many people in that situation in direct provision who are not legally allowed to work and cannot work until they have a final decision under the current arrangements.  There are also a lot of restrictions in respect of the permit itself.  It is a piece of paper.  Ordinarily, when employers in Ireland are hiring people to work for them, especially non-EU nationals, they look for an Irish residency permit card or the old Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, card.</p><p>Asylum seekers do not have that and cannot even get a driving licence because they do not have the Irish residency permit card.  One of the recommendations we will be making to the committee is that the temporary residency card, the blue card that is issued, should be replaced because it is of no use to an asylum seeker except to inform a police or immigration officer that they have permission to stay in Ireland.  They cannot use it for work.  If one brings asylum seekers in line with other non-EU nationals resident in Ireland, one is able to immediately inform the potential employer that this person has the right to work.  They do not have to go through all the other administrative areas, such as having to submit reports.  They are told right on the front page of the permit that it is a criminal offence not to provide this report, if one is required provide a report within ten days.  That is a deterrent to any employer.  </p><p> I have personally gone through that process of having to explain to employers that the permit is renewable, but many employers do not accept that and have informed me that the permit should be valid for at least 11 months, and they will not accept it if it is valid only for six months.  People can stay in the asylum system for longer than a year waiting for an interview and for their asylum claim to be assessed.  The idea of having the permit valid for only six months does not make much sense for a person who is going to be stuck in the system in any event.  It would be better for us to have it valid for at least 12 months because we know it takes longer for the Department of Justice and Equality to make a decision. </p><p> By September 2018 the Department had issued over 1,500 permits, and only approximately 330  people were able to find work.  When people find work, they have to send their declaration to the Department of Justice and Equality.  That highlights the restrictions.  I have had the permit since 1 August 2018 and I have only worked for one hour since then.  All the employers that I have previously worked for in the Republic under different permits have not hired me because of the restrictions of the permit itself.  It is not that I do not meet their requirement, because I have had those three jobs before and I have done them well.  I have friends who would substantiate that.  It becomes very restrictive for people.  It discourages others who are already in the system who qualify for the permits.  Many people do not apply for it because they see people who have it who are not working.  There are hoops that one has to jump through as to how the permit works which have to be explained to an employer, because many employers do not know how it works.  It is different.  Everybody else goes in with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, or an Irish residency permit card or an EU passport and we do not have any of those things. </p><p> It is restrictive in that sense.  Many people will still be stuck in direct provision without this right to work and our recommendation to address that is for people to be given immediate access to the labour market when they arrive in the State because it increases the prospects of integration.  It means a person is not going to be staying idle in a direct provision centre that is in a remote area like Knockalisheen, or Mount Trenchard in Foynes, where they have no access to public transport, for example.  That is another barrier for people who want to work.  Once one has a job, it may be actually difficult to get to work if one lives in a direct provision centre that does not have any access to public transport.</p></speech>

That is a stark reminder of the ongoing, sheer and shocking level of human rights abuses in our direct provision centres.  I am slightly alarmed if our mental health services are providing a sticking plaster approach by way of sleeping tablets.  What is the experience of people living in direct provision with regard to mental health services and support?  Do our guests have any suggestions on how that can be improved?</p></speech>

The biggest problem is that no services at all are being provided to us in the centres.  In order for a person to be able to access the help that they need, one would have to attend his or her GP to receive direction to get the help that one needs.  The biggest problem with that, as we already know, is that many people coming in to seek asylum are from traumatic backgrounds and have experienced some kind of trauma.  It would be crucial and vital to have such a service at the reception centres.  The only thing that is there at the moment is one or two posters in the centre signposting a person to places like the Samaritans or to Spirasi, for which one has to get an appointment through referral from one's solicitor or from one's GP.  Often, it takes a very long time to receive an appointment to be seen by Spirasi.  That is why we find that many people tend to turn to things like sleeping tablets or alcohol. They develop a lot of addictions like gambling because they are trying to find a way to cope with living in that situation.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Khambule might give the recommendation now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lucky Khambule" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#F00500"><p>The signs and indications are there as to the effects on mental health of being in direct provision.  Suicide attempts have increased in the past 18 months.  Last year alone, there were approximately five deaths in direct provision, some of which related to the mental health of people who were on these sleeping pills.  This is not a qualified opinion but we feel that the provision of the tablets as a means of addressing the mental health issue is the wrong one.  The psychological traumas that people face in direct provision are the things that need to be addressed in a very serious way.  Otherwise we will see more deaths happening in direct provision because we are ignoring the signs that are there on mental health issues.</p> <p>  A fresh example happened a month or so ago, where a lady had attempted suicide in one of the centres in the country, where she even left a message to be sent to a manager of that centre to take care of the babies in her absence.  She had a history of mental health illness and we are not addressing that.  Instead we are punishing people for the actions that they take, without understanding what they go through.  It is a serious matter and needs to be taken seriously.  As my colleague said earlier, people arrive with traumatic experiences already.</p> <p>  The other problem that people face is that they need prescriptions to get depression pills.  The fact that some do not have access to medical cards makes it hard for them to even access those pills if they have been prescribed, because it takes time for them to get those medical cards.</p></speech>

Speaking from my personal experience, I have three children myself.  My youngest is nine years old.  Over the past few months he has been showing signs of depression, to the point that he has come and said to me that sometimes when he feels sad he feels like killing himself.</p><p>This is a nine year old saying it to me.  I am already facing personal mental health challenges but now I must face the extra burden of these children seeing me go through this and possibly experiencing their own mental health issues because of our position.  It is very important that children are not overlooked and mental health services can be focused on the children as well.</p></speech>

I followed the live discussions and comments but if one has not gone through the trauma, one will not understand.  People do not understand the events or what happens in direct provision.  I have suffered depression.  I have three kids.  I have migraines and I have almost had a stroke because of what I always face.  My kids have been bullied in school.  I have been through Tusla social services because my child was bullied at school but it was turned around to seem like my son was in the wrong.  There was a point where it seemed my kids would be taken away from me.  There was a recent incident with my daughter.  She opened someone's top in school and I tried to explain things to the teacher but she could not understand.  I have set a meeting so I can discuss this with her.  These are kids and when they are at school the teacher is the parent and when they are at home, I am the teacher; we must work hand in hand.  There was an incident that I witnessed of a woman who tried to commit suicide.  The kids also reacted.</p></speech>

I left direct provision in 2016 and it is a tough transition.  I had that first-hand experience.  We first had to look for a house and it is very hard to find one.  One must get on with one's life.  We do not know which direction we have to take.  There was a lack of support while I was in direct provision to set me up to succeed as quickly as possible in Irish society.  I did not have a problem with language but if a person has a problem with language, how could he or she stay in direct provision for five years and then move on with no support?  There is not much transition support to help people leave.  I found a place of my own and although my activities are in Dublin, I had to go all the way to Wicklow to find a place.  Fortunately, I work as well.  My life is on the positive side but it is a very hard transition.</p></speech>

We should remember that there is not much of that in the direct provision system, and the location of the direct provision centre also has an effect.  I would not really look at my experience as I had to put myself out there in an active way, so it was easier for me to integrate after direct provision.  There is a need to support people moving from direct provision but the support needs to start while people are still in direct provision.  It should happen with education and methods of coping in the community.  We cannot start building to integrate in a community if a person has lost the will to live because he or she is in direct provision.  Life must start from the first day in Ireland and not from the day the person has his or her application approved.  That is too late.</p></speech>

If the committee is to make a recommendation like that, we must figure out what will replace it.  We have an obligation to provide shelter and comfort to people coming to the country seeking protection.  Is this a housing problem?  Is there a concern because we cannot really sort out the housing problem in the country at present?</p></speech>

For 20 years we have considered accommodating asylum seekers as something that should be dealt with via the Department of Justice and Equality through a very narrow remit using private providers and old buildings on the outskirts of towns.  That should change.  We must provide accommodation for people who come here and the direct provision population is approximately 6,500.  If we take away the number of people who cannot leave, backlogs and delays in decision making, it might be possible to get that down to something like 5,500.  It is not a large number of people.</p><p>Using the existing budget and engaging better providers to provide that accommodation would form the building blocks of a new system.  I implore the committee to have a bottom line of own-door accommodation, the right to cook for oneself and one's family and a broader right to work and live in a community.  These are the red lines we want to see.  We need to design a procurement process that will allow housing bodies or other new entities to provide that accommodation.  The current procurement process on eTenders is timetabled to go through the different regions of Ireland in 2019.  A crucial problem with this is that it requires a provider to have a property with 50 beds or more.  Every housing body with which we have worked and our colleagues from MASI who have lived in the system will say putting 50 people in one building will be problematic sooner or later.  We need to redesign the procurement process.</p></speech>

The problem with them is that unlike non-profit bodies, they are probably guided by profit.  Non-profit bodies are guided by a mission statement, memorandums and articles, a board, expertise and a desire to help people.</p></speech>

It is vital that we hear not only from organisations working with asylum seekers and refugees but also from people with direct experience of the direct provision system.  People seeking asylum in Ireland do so with international protection.  Sometimes it is lost in the debate that they are here because they are fleeing persecution, conflict and oppression.  I presume that applies to all of the persons present from MASI.</p> <p>  I will not put anybody on the spot because obviously I appreciate it could be traumatic.  Does any of the delegates wish to share his or her reasons for seeking asylum?  If not, does anybody have a story he or she would like to tell of a friend or somebody he or she knows in the direct provision system in order to give the committee an insight into the reasons people flee and are in Ireland seeking international protection?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bulelani Mfaco" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#H00800"><p>I applied for asylum in 2017.  I am from Cape Town, South Africa.  Most people's reaction when they hear this is that there is no war in South Africa.  They expect the person seeking asylum to come from a war-torn country.  That is the general misconception.  International law has held that one must have a well founded fear of persecution that may arise, for instance, from politics, religion, race or membership of a particular cultural group.  I am a queer man, a gay man.  In South Africa it becomes very difficult to live openly as a gay man, particularly if he happens to be from a very poor background or a township.  Rich people experience the same persecution, but black people in townships experience it much more.  There are more targeted killings of queer people.  I had stones thrown at me and have been spat at.  I have been called all sorts of name.  At one point I was held in a shopping centre and humiliated by security guards.  They picked me up and made fun of the way I was dressed.  I used to be very effeminate; apparently, I am now manly.  Gay people go through all of the trauma of having stones thrown at them just because of their sexual orientation.  In January 2017 in South Africa I heard about what had happened to a lesbian woman who lived down the road from where I lived.  She was the third person on our street who was openly gay; the other was another man.  She was abducted and shot dead for no other reason than her sexual orientation.  At that point I decided that that was it; I was not going to wait and hang around to be the next one to be killed.</p> <p>  When I got to Ireland, I was placed immediately in Balseskin, just like everybody else who was seeking asylum.  We stayed there for about five weeks.  What happened in the very first week frightened me because for the first time in my life I was not allowed to work.  I had been working since I was ten years old.  I used to help my grandmother to sell fruit at the taxi rank back home.  Now I am told that I cannot work.  What do I do?  I sleep, wake up, shower and eat every single day.  Days become weeks, weeks become months and months become years.  It is very disheartening.  One begins to lose hope the place where one has sought sanctuary is actually the compassionate place one thought it was.</p> <p>  I was moved from Balseskin to Knockalisheen where I was placed in a room with a homophobic man.  When he heard that I was gay, he said, "I don't like shit in here."  I am sorry for my language, but that was how he said it.  We still had to share a bedroom and live together.  In the first few weeks in Knockalisheen, when I was queuing in the canteen, I heard homophobic slurs from other asylum seekers from the same region, the same homophobic slurs I had heard in South Africa.  That created a lot of anxiety that I might be killed.  Many people who are murdered because of their sexual orientation will first hear those slurs before they being attacked.  When I told the international protection officer in Knockalisheen, they could not be bothered to do anything about it.  One then begins to lose a sense of hope.  I did not trust anybody and still do not trust anybody in Knockalisheen.  When having food in the canteen, I often sit on my own with my back against the wall.  I will not sit there with somebody behind me because I do not feel comfortable being in that space.  However, I have no choice because I have to queue for food in the canteen.  It becomes very difficult to go through life when one has live in such a situation and I do not control when I will be out of it.  I had my first interview only this year to assess my claim for asylum.  For all of that time I was sitting there and my file was gathering dust in the international protection office.  I was finally called for an interview in March, but I am still waiting for a recommendation.  I am told that if it is positive, I might even have to wait longer for a declaration from the Minister in order that I can get out and live independently. </p> <p>  We are subjected to petty bureaucratic processes in direct provision centres.  Recently a notice was put up indicating that we were required to produce an ID card if we needed to receive our post.  I have been in Knockalisheen for over a year and receiving my post without having to produce an ID card.  No asylum seeker in this country is issued with an ID card.  No Irish person has an ID card, but I am being asked to produce one.  They use the permission to stay in Ireland card as an ID card.  That card was issued for the purposes of showing a police officer or an immigration officer that I had permission to stay in Ireland.</p><p>Yet, every single day that I need an ironing board or need to check my post or get a tissue or any petty everyday thing that people use in their houses when they are living their lives, I have to produce all kinds of things.  It becomes disheartening.</p><p> One of the issues is privacy because we do not have much privacy.  We may be forced to share a bedroom with someone who may happen to be homophobic.  For a person who is gay and seeking asylum because he has been persecuted on the basis of his sexual orientation to be subjected to the same kind of treatment is cruel from the State side.  We have staff members in direct provision who undermine the right to privacy for individuals too.  I was sitting in my room one day and someone knocked once and then opened the door.  It was a lady who worked Knockalisheen direct provision centre.  She knocked once and opened the door.  I was sitting in my room getting ready to have a shower, so I only had my underwear on.  The next time it happened because a manager in Knockalisheen walked into the male showers in the men's block.  We have a block specifically for single men.  There are several of them.  She opened the door to the male showers.  She looked and then closed the door and said she was sorry as she walked away.  It was the men's shower - what did she expect to see?  Privacy means nothing to them.  We have had similar incidents in Hatch Hall accommodation centre, where a staff member and another resident have walked into a room where a person was naked.  We have heard the experiences of children who feel unsafe because of the creepy way that men look at them.  It has been reported in the news that direct provision centres have women who feel unsafe sharing intimate living spaces with other people.  Some of the women would have suffered torture or sexual violence.  For such a person to be placed in a position where she feels unsafe again is very cruel.  It shows we are not really responding to the person's call.  When a person comes here and declares that he is seeking protection, he needs protection.  To place such a person in a position where he feels unsafe is very cruel on the part of the Government.</p><p> We have had these experiences along with many other lived experiences from people who live in direct provision.  I am not the only gay person who has experienced homophobia in direct provision; there are many others.  It is apparent across the board.  One woman locked herself in the gym in Knockalisheen because she felt unsafe sharing the gym with men.  Now, they have decided to reserve certain hours for women only in the gym.  The problem is that the woman will still have to share other intimate spaces with everyone else.  That minor tweak does not really change the situation when it comes to personal safety very much, especially for people who have had traumatic experiences.</p></speech>

It is not a story.  When I hear the word "story" it is like a tale that is simply being told.  These are serious cases.  We have been through a great deal.  I will talk in a neutral matter and not specifically about my case.  The reason women are fleeing Zimbabwe is child marriages.  The issue is still active, as I speak.  Committee members can check the BBC interviews in which young girls are being interviewed about why they had a child when they were 13 or 14 years of age.  These girls come here and tell their case.  The officers tell the girls they are lying.  How can they say I am lying when they were not there when the incident happened?  I am telling my case because it happened to me.  I am seeking protection and the officers are telling me that I am lying.  It upsets me because I have been trying to prove to the officers for the past three and a half years that I have been through this.  Then, at the end of the day, the officers are telling me that I can go back home and that I cannot live here.  They say a certain part of my country is okay and that it is better for me to live there and that I cannot live in another country.  That is my experience.</p></speech>

It comes in the form of sexual exploitation and in terms of work.  When people are not allowed to work legally, it creates and openness for whoever wants to exploit them.  We have had people coming to Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland who have worked from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and were only paid between &euro;25 and &euro;27.  It becomes very difficult for such a person to live a normal life because they do not have a sense of what their rights are once they are given permission to live.  They might continue with that exploitation.</p> <p>  We also have people in direct provision being offered money for sex because people know that there were people getting paid &euro;21.60 per week.  The figure is now &euro;38.80.  People have to live.  I have been offered money for sex.  There are children and women who have been offered money for sex.  We do not know the extent to which the exploitation is happening but we have had reports from our work and from other people.  RT&Eacute; produced a programme called "Taken Down".  The producers were doing research because the show is set in a direct provision centre.  One of the things they came across was that people were being offered money for sex.  People know where the direct provision centres are.  People know that there are people there who are vulnerable.  Then we have sex pests coming around trying to exploit people.  That needs to be highlighted as well.</p></speech>

I am grateful to them for sharing the reasons they sought asylum.  I think it is important because sometimes the debate around this issue neglects the fact that people have come here after fleeing persecution, oppression and violence.  It can be forgotten that people have suffered from trauma that most of us present can only begin to imagine.  Yet, the system is retraumatising people by putting them through what I believe to be a traumatic system.  I agree with Mr. Henderson and the representatives from Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland that this system is failing the human rights of people and it needs to be replaced.</p> <p>  I want to put the question to the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland and the Irish Refugee Council representatives.  Last week Mr. Justice Bryan MacMahon said to us that in his view, while it was far from perfect, the direct provision system had improved.  I want to get the response of the representatives to that.  Can they tell us about their experience of the Garda National Immigration Bureau and how that office conducts itself as well as the Garda generally?  I am putting that question to both groups.  I will have a final set of questions following that.</p></speech>

The primary manifestation is emergency centres.  There are a little over 500 people in emergency centres.  These are hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation that the State has procured or contracted to provide accommodation on an emergency basis.  We have used the phrase "off-grid".  We do not really know where those centres are located.  Fundamentally, the people in those centres, hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation do not know where the external services that could help them are located.</p> <p>  There have also been issues with people not going through Balseskin reception centre.  If that were to happen, the people affected should have received a medical card.  People have not been getting medical cards.  They have been located in areas where the general practitioner list may be full.  A significant number of children are in emergency centres - 88 children.  Like children in homeless bed and breakfast accommodation, they have struggled to get education.  Indeed, I do not know if they get any education at all.</p><p>We are gravely concerned about that situation.  </p><p> On wider improvements, as we understand it, there has been a narrowing of the gap between capacity and occupancy rates in the direct provision system in the last two years.  There are fewer beds and centres are now simply overcrowded.  That has meant that reforms envisaged by the Government arising from the McMahon process have had to be curtailed or limited to an extent.  </p><p> On the third point, we refer the Deputy to Nasc, an NGO in Cork, from which the committee will be hearing in June.  It has produced an important report which analyses the extent to which the recommendations have been implemented.  The picture is less clear than what may have been suggested by the Government.  The emergency centres are of real concern and we do not see this changing over the course of 2019 owing to the numbers within and existing capacity within the traditional direct provision estate being full.</p></speech>

For example, regulation 3 requires that people be given information when they first arrive on their rights and entitlements and organisations that may be able to help them.  In our experience that is not happening.  People are arriving in, particularly from the emergency centres, who do not know where they should be going, how to make an application for asylum, how to get legal aid, how to apply for a PPS number or a GP card, or how to gain basic access to medicines and prescriptions.  They are arriving and it is simply a case of fire-fighting.  This means that the benefits of reforms which may have been introduced or which are under way following the McMahon report are not being felt in practice.  There is a fire-fighting exercise under way in the Department of Justice and Equality, alongside which we need to see a commitment being given to medium to long-term reform of the system overall because conditions are just unacceptable.</p></speech>

It is nice to see him here.  During the many years I spent in Cork he was always making himself known in the direct provision centre.  Everyone there knows of his work, which we appreciate.  I remember that he arranged for lines to be drawn around a bus stop opposite the centre as there was a danger to the children.</p> <p>  A comment was made to the effect that the situation had improved.  From MASI's day-to-day interaction with the people involved, things have got worse.  I repeat things have got worse.  The situation in which the Government finds itself in having to provide emergency accommodation should not have arisen.  There should have been a better plan to allow us to respond to the large increase in the number of people coming here.  There has been an immigration crisis since 2015.  If we are now only thinking about what we need to do, it shows that we did not think hard enough before.  </p> <p>  Some of the things that came from the work of the working group include the single application procedure and the introduction of the International Protection Act 2015.  We were told that it would cut all waiting periods to nine months.  We were also told that the system would be capable of getting through everything within nine months.  That meant that one would be out of the direct provision system within nine months, but that did not happen.  There is an 18-month backlog of people who have not been called for their first interview.  There are people who have not been a chance to present their case for refugee status.  Some do not even know when they will be called, which is a problem.  </p> <p>  To give an indication of how bad things are, I can point to two centres where action was taken.  Two months ago in west Cork the residents had had enough and demonstrated.  There was also a demonstration in Mosney.  That indicates that there is something wrong.  What is also alarming is the squeezing of residents by local management to discourage people from speaking up or making complaints.  I know that some complaints have been recorded by the Ombudsman, but the numbers are low.  That is because people are being told that if they complain, their cases and applications will be affected.  Fear is stopping them from saying what is not happening.  </p> <p>  Management in some centres has so much power that it can issue notices that disrupt everybody.  I will give two examples.  In one of the centres a notice was issued indicating that people were not allowed to use their phones, laptops or iPads at certain times.  For no reason, a curfew was imposed which prevented people from communicating with others.  Some people are studying and use their time to study.  Others have families in different time zones.  How can someone wake up and have it in mind to impose such a rule?  In another centre residents have what we call counter fridges.  Sometimes fridges are donated to people with kids or who need to store medications in order that they will be able to store them in their room.  The centre in question made a rule that residents were no longer allowed to have fridges in their room.  Management actually confiscated fridges from people's rooms, usually when they were not there. It just came into someone's room and ransacked it. A lady might have come back to her room to find that her wardrobe had been turned upside down.  That is the kind of life people are living in direct provision centres.  That is a big problem because things will explode.  When people are treated in that way, the time will come when they will say enough is enough.  We can avoid this just by being compassionate and dealing with people as human beings.  That is all that we request, even from the people who are there.  Hotel managers have no reason to treat people who have suffered torture in that way.  They are only interested in the bottom line.  Some have even gone to the extent of having residents in a centre volunteer because of downsizing.  Why are they doing this?  They are maximising profits.  They want to replace people who are salaried with others who are vulnerable and will agree to anything.  They want to use them to provide the services and do work that is supposed to be done by the State.  That needs to stop.  The issue needs to be highlighted in order that people can be held accountable.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB.  Our experience of the GNIB relates mainly to the length of time it takes people to receive their GNIB card.</p><p>Once someone has been granted the right to stay in Ireland, be that on a refugee, subsidiary protection or leave-to-remain basis, the GNIB is key.  Without the GNIB card, one has nowhere to go.  In our interactions with the GNIB, delays are a problem.  We do not really have much contact with the rest of the Garda unless officers are called because of a complaint against someone in the centre.</p></speech>

It was recommended that there should be a single application process, but I am not sure if it is being applied.  I had to apply again for the single procedure process in 2016.  I received a refusal, which I then had to appeal.  That was refused and I had to go to the High Court, which said that my case should be heard again.  I went for my interview two months ago, but I am still waiting.  My experience there was dehumanising.  They stopped looking at why I had come here to seek asylum and went into my personal life.  When I explained something, they told me that I was lying.  It was dehumanising.</p> <p>  If I am going for an interview, the tribunal members should be more knowledgeable about what is going on in my country.  They kept pressurising me and saying that I had been a refugee in Swaziland because I had a travel document.  That is how it is in our country, though.  We have travel documents that we use in the southern part of Africa.  There is more to be done in respect of the tribunal members.</p> <p>  It is mental torture for someone to keep on repeating what he or she has gone through.  When someone asks me why I am in the country, I do not say anymore because I am tired of crying.  I cannot keep on saying what happened to me.  For how long would I be saying that?  I need to move on.  It is dehumanising to make someone sit there and do that.  This is not a story - it is something that we are going through.  A mother tells people what her children are going through, but the response is "You are lying."  How can one lie about one's children suffering?</p></speech>

I promise I will not take long.  I will touch specifically on many issues that have been mentioned, particularly single mothers and children in direct provision.  After the Ombudsman for Children stated that such environments were not fit for human habitation, let alone raising children, I do not understand how mothers with children are still in direct provision.  I do not believe that the Department of Justice and Equality or the IPO considers asylum seeker mothers and children as human beings.</p> <p>  Men are giving children creepy looks in small passages that actually serve as the children's playgrounds.  Naked men walk down those passages to the bathrooms.  Let there be sense.  Let this become a normal human situation.  I am a father.  My youngest is 21 years old.  I have to walk in that passage with my towel tied around my waist to go to the bathroom.  There are children, from three years old to 16 years old, boys and girls, playing there because there are no playgrounds.  The system is just not fit for any purpose.  When we say that direct provision should be abolished, we do so because it is not an environment for human beings.  I could invite committee members to spend a night with me in direct provision in Viking House where I sleep with three other people in the same room.  I have measured it - it is 4 m by 4 m.  There are four of us in the room.  Within that area, we have our wardrobes and a bathroom.  We are all men.</p> <p>  There is no area in the centre where, if members came to visit me, they could sit to talk to or greet me.  That is not human living.  The jailer-prisoner attitude that prevails is not for human beings either.  When I go to sleep in Viking House tonight, I will tell people that I am going home, but is it really home?  When I get there, anyone who wants to see me has to sign in.  If that person is lucky, someone will call me so that we can go outside.  There is no reception or anywhere people can just sit down and talk.  I do not know what training RIA has put in place for the people who work in the centres, but they feel that they are jailers and we are prisoners and that they are doing favours for us.  Kitchen staff throw people plates of food.  Sometimes those plates fall and people laugh.  This is happening to adults, who are in a queue.  They will then beg for food.  If someone happens to miss a meal, he or she knows that it will stay missed even though the food will not have been served.  Obviously, if I miss my meal, there will be leftovers, but they cannot be served to me because I have returned outside the meal time.  That is not human living.  I have to wake up at 8 a.m. to ensure that I have breakfast before 9 a.m. because if I get there at 9.02 a.m., the door will be closed.  I call this place "home", and I have been there for the past three years, but I still cannot get that meal.</p> <p>  I attend school in Dublin.  I understand the problem with accommodation here.  I live in Waterford and travel to UCD and back.  That is six hours on the road every day.  I am a full-time student.  I cannot get a packed lunch from the centre.  I must use the &euro;38 that I get to pay for the travel and food that I need to go to school.  That is well and good with the RIA and the IPO, but it is not natural.  A country of Ireland's status should not be doing this to people.</p><p>I do not believe it should be done.</p><p> We have spoken about improvements.  I disagree completely with the suggestion made by Mr. Justice McMahon a week ago that this is improving.  I wonder how he considers it to be improving when people are running direct provision for profit and to become even more rich.  Can that still be called an improvement?  The centres that have moved slightly by providing cooking facilities have also set up shops that are still owned by these people.  Why does this segregation exist?  When it was decided to stop requiring residents to queue for food, why was it decided to require them to buy their food in a shop owned by these people if they want to cook in the kitchen?  There is a Centra shop at the gate.  I could buy what I want there if it were not for the voucher system.  We are told to report what we want to buy so that the authorities can order what they need.  We have to tell them in advance what we want to buy the following week when we bring in our vouchers.  That is not on.  That is not life.</p><p> I would like to speak about education and work permits.  I suggest that giving people the right to work has actually put them in the negative, rather than giving them better opportunities.  If one wants to get schooling or training or do anything, one is required to have a work permit.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is responsible for this area, will not approve any training if one does not have a work permit.  Unfortunately, the people who do not have work permits are in the majority.  They tend to be the people who have been in the system for the longest periods of time.  This means they are being deprived of the opportunity to study.  I am studying at third level.  When one is in direct provision, one is not supposed to be studying above level 4.  Monaghan Institute will not take one for training into any course above level 4, even if one is prepared to pay international fees.  I do not see that as an improvement - I see it as getting worse.</p><p> I will conclude by speaking about the amount of time that people who have received refugee status have to wait.  Two gentlemen in direct provision in Tramore who have been given refugee status have been waiting eight months for the Minister to send them a letter on moving out of direct provision, which will enable them to go to the GNIB to get a GNIB card.  They have been told that their refugee applications have been approved, but they have had to wait eight months for this letter.  It is really not on.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibanda referred to the suggestion that being given the right to cook represents an improvement.  A food hall has been introduced in my centre.  When I go there, I mostly get water and fruit because I cannot eat the food that is there.  I wonder whether it would be possible for people to get vouchers to go into shops to get what they want.  The food is being bought in SuperValu.  If I were given a voucher, I could avail of the wider selection in that shop to get what I want.  We are told we can write down what we want, but because I am a difficult person, they do not bring what I want regardless of what I write down.  I understand that not too many people might want to buy what I look for.  I ask the committee to consider my suggestion that we be given vouchers that we can use ourselves.  In the case of people who spend all their time in direct provision, the vouchers are not sufficient for the whole week.  We are given 45 points to use for seven days.  If we want to get a meal, such as a lunch, it costs four points.  If we used ten points a day, we would need 70 points a week, but we get just 45 points.  Toiletries are not included.  We still have to get toiletries and all that by ourselves.  I do not know how the points are weighted.  Many parents have told me that the points they get do not suffice for the entire week.  Children are living on bread.  When we talk about improvement, all I can say is that it has not really happened.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their helpful and thought-provoking contributions.  I had intended to ask a number of questions, but I will let them be for now because some of the witnesses' observations have clarified matters.  I agree that direct provision is not fit for purpose.  It is not a fit place to raise children.  It is not a fit place for anyone to live.  During previous discussions, comparisons have been made with institutions of the past.  Some people have debated that.  As far as I am concerned, this institutionalisation of people is a form of warehousing.  This system reflects very poorly on Ireland as a country and needs to be replaced.  It is clear from what has been said here today that far too often, the system is unfortunately adversarial.  I am not sure it needs to be like that.  I will leave it at that.  I have no further questions.  I thank the representatives of MASI and the Irish Refugee Council.  I hope we can produce a report at the end of this process that does justice to these hearings.</p></speech>

My head is spinning.  I am blown away by the reality of the situation.  I knew it was bad, but I was not aware of how horrendous it is.  It is important that I repeat something Mr. Mfaco said at the end of his presentation.  I hope it is okay for me to do so.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We are human beings like all of you.  All we ask is that we be treated as such.  The very fact that people have to ask the Government to treat them humanely should shame all of you. </blockquote> <p>I feel absolutely devastated by what I have heard.  I am ashamed that I live in this country.  I am ashamed by the way our Government is treating people in direct provision.  There is no representation here today from our Government.  It is probably too hard from them to hear what the reality is.  We do not know.  I am grateful that the witnesses are here today because we need to hear the reality of what it is like to live in direct provision.  I am shaking with anger.  I am saddened to hear that in this day and age, people are going through the experiences that have been described.  When we talk about the Magdalen laundries, we say it was terrible and ask how these things happened.  It is going on here today.  That is the reality.  When I spoke last week to a man from the US, he thanked God that the abuses which happened years ago in the Magdalen laundries have come to an end, but I told him that abuses are continuing.  I informed him about the case of a woman who was living in a direct provision centre in the midlands.  When she was nine months' pregnant she went into labour, but she had no money to get a taxi so she had to walk to the hospital.  That is what is going on in our country today.  The man to whom I was speaking burst into tears and cried when he heard this story.  What the hell is going on?</p><p>In this country, we do not treat animals in the way people in direct provision are being treated.</p><p> I have taken down many notes here and I want to touch on a couple of points, if that is all right with the Chairman.  A story was told here last week on the right to work and it had an impact on me.  A man in direct provision, with his wife and three children, was asked by one of those who presented here last week about how he was getting on with his legal status.  He replied that he did not care about his legal status at this time and that all he wants to do is work.  He stated that all he wants to do is get up in the morning, go out to work, come back and tell his children that he went to work that day.  Moreover, he said that he does not even want to get paid for it.  He just asked to be given his dignity.  Deputies Jack Chambers and O'Callaghan touched on it today but that is why we need to see an effective right to work.  It is vital.</p><p> There is no doubt but that we need to get rid of direct provision.  This report is so important.  My recommendation would be to get rid of direct provision and treat people with respect and dignity.  I cannot even imagine what it is like for those children.  These people are coming from trauma.  I work in an area of trauma in a different field but I know what trauma does to people.  I see its impact.  As for them coming here from a traumatic situation where people are being tortured, sexually violated and sexually abused, only to be treated with such disrespect and absence of dignity, I do not know to where our humanity has gone.</p><p> I am sorry, but I need to be able to say this because what I am hearing today is so upsetting.  Even though I was aware it was bad, I did not realise it was so bad.  One must present a card for an ironing board.  The point that private companies operate these centres frustrates me.  Last year, we paid more than &euro;70 million to private firms operating direct provision centres and yet, where one wants to cook one's own food, which is a basic human right, one has to go to a shop to buy it.</p><p> I seek the witnesses' thoughts on the integration piece.  I apologise, as I am upset by hearing everything, but I wish to hear their thoughts on efforts to help asylum seekers integrate into Irish society.  There are a few points I wrote down; I hope this is okay.  First, although we have an official Government migrant integration strategy, asylum seekers are excluded from it.  They simply are not mentioned.  This suggests that while the State will actively try to help integrate migrant EU workers, for example, I gather I would be right in stating this is not the case with asylum seekers.</p><p> Second, from reading about the design of the direct provision system, it seems that there is almost a fear of genuine integration running through the heart of the rules.  The logic seems to be that if we let people put down roots to work and embed into the committee, it would be harder were their application to be ultimately refused and, therefore, many in the centres live at a physical and social distance from local communities.  Can we hear about those experiences?</p><p> I also want to hear about their experiences on the right to work because that is really important, and a little more on the importance of having cooking facilities, which is a basic human right.  Many direct provision centres still do not have those facilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bulelani Mfaco" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#N00200"><p>Knockalisheen is a mixed accommodation centre.  There are several families living there and there are a lot of single men.  Four out of the six blocks are occupied by single men.  There are single ladies as well and many of them find it difficult to share communal spaces with men.  When Donnah must go and queue in the canteen with children to get food, we queue with the children.  One day one child went in to ask for a doughnut and was told that they had given him one already.  The child wanted another doughnut.  It is just a doughnut.  Sometimes people do not even take those doughnuts and they serve them the following day, but they did not give it to the child.  It is a child.  It becomes difficult for parents.  Donnah is a parent.  I am sure she will speak about the difficulties parenting in direct provision.</p> <p>  From an integration point of view, the Reception and Integration Agency forgets what "Integration" in its name means.  I do not think the people there even know that the word is in the agency's name because all they do is receive people.  They take people's forms.  What they give a person when he or she arrives in a direct provision centre is the house rules.  They will tell a person when his or her meal times are.  These varies from centre to centre.  One will be told in the morning one will have breakfast, in the afternoon one will have lunch, and the time in the evening one will have dinner.  In most of the centres where there are no cooking facilities, one is also told what to eat and when to eat it.  One does not get to decide what to eat.</p> <p>  The strangest aspect for many people is that one goes into the centre and sees people eating and enjoying their food.  Then one finds a friend sitting and asking, "How on earth are they enjoying this?  This is terrible.", because tastes vary.  We do not all like the same food.  For example, we do not all like the same spices.  When one walks into a canteen and smells the same spices, it almost smells the same every day.  It is a canteen.  If one goes into a hospital canteen or a prison canteen, it will have its own smell.  When one lives in a direct provision centre, one recognises that every single day.  When I leave here, I will go back to Knockalisheen.  The moment I see the sign "Knockalisheen", I will be dreading it because I know the experience of having to live through waking up in the morning, a shower, going to eat and having no sense of purpose.</p> <p>  Meaning in life is lost when one is not allowed to work.  One sees people coming in to do their work.  Irish people who work in direct provision centres go in and report for duty every morning and one is reminded every day that one is not allowed to work.  They are living life and one gets to sit and watch people live their lives.  It is even worse in centres that are in the centre of cities.  For example, those who live in the direct provision in Limerick city centre must watch people go about their daily lives and they are reminded every day that they are not allowed to go and do ordinary things that people do every day.</p> <p>  It becomes difficult to talk about integration when one is warehoused in a direct provision centre, such as Knockalisheen, where one has not access to public transport and one cannot go anywhere.  Where one is given &euro;38 a week without public transport, how will one socialise?  What kind of social life will one live?  As humans, we are social beings.  If any Deputy or Senator in the room has a dog, he or she will know that one needs to take a dog out for walks, etc.  If one only kept a dog in one room and gave it shelter and food, that dog would not be satisfied with life.  In fact, it would be cruel not to take the dog out for a walk and let it do what dogs do, but we allow that to happen to people in the asylum system, to take away all the things that make us human, that is, all that human beings do.  For instance, one cannot work.  Since the beginning of time, if one studies the history of mankind, one will know that human beings have always worked to provide for themselves, for their loved ones and to improve the human experience on earth.  Here, however, one takes a person, because he or she applied for asylum, and says that person is not allowed to work.  Then it becomes difficult for the person to integrate into the community while he or she is in direct provision.</p> <p>  One cannot speak to me about integration while I am still segregated.  I am using a segregated bus.  When we get off the bus in Limerick city centre, we see all these brown people.  One actually sees Irish people staring at us, as if to ask, "Where did this bus come from?  Look at those brown people."  They do not look like the committee members.  They look different.  It only hurts them.  Everybody knows the bus is from a direct provision centre.  When the bus shows up in a school, some of the schoolchildren are ashamed that their friends might know where they live but everybody knows that school bus will take them to a direct provision centre.</p> <p>  Every Thursday, we get a cheque from social welfare.</p><p>To claim that &euro;38 per week allowance, one queues at the post office and produces one's PPSN card and cheque.  Everybody in the queue in that post office then knows that one lives in a direct provision centre.  It is written on the cheque receipt itself that it is a direct provision allowance.  One is constantly reminded how bad one's life is and that one is not considered part of Irish society.  One is divorced from social life.  One cannot really socialise on &euro;38.80 while living in Mount Trenchard.</p><p> There is no public transport in Knockalisheen or other direct provision centres.  I had a hospital appointment, for example, which was at 9 a.m.  I explained that to the community social welfare officer at Knockalisheen and asked if a supplementary allowance could be paid to cover travel.  It was outside the normal bus schedule at Knockalisheen where there are three services a day.  The first leaves at 10 a.m., the next is at 1 p.m. and the last is at 5 p.m.  If one misses that, one is stuffed because one must then walk for over an hour.  I needed to get to the hospital at 9 a.m.  The officer said regional travel was not covered.  The regional hospital is approximately 9 km from Knockalisheen.  I had to Google that when I was wondering how to get there.  I had to sit and argue with her over why I needed assistance to get to the hospital.  I needed to go to hospital and see a doctor yet she simply said "We do not cover regional travel".  It is dehumanising for a person to have to explain a very basic need for medical assistance.  One needs to get to a hospital.  It is almost as if they want us to get on our knees and beg for these things.</p><p> If I was not in a direct provision centre, I would have provided for my own medical expenses.  The Department of Justice and Equality knows that.  Where I come from, I worked and was studying and was able to provide for these very basic things.  Now, however, we have to go and argue with bureaucrats and managers in the centre over the basic everyday things that people go through.  It became very difficult for me to sit there and look at her to say "I have to get to a hospital".  In the end, she said they would call a taxi.  I was checking the metre.  She stopped herself before suggesting I should walk there.  At 9 km, I would probably have had to leave at 6 a.m.  It is dehumanising for me to have to go through the process of explaining the need.  It is self-explanatory that I have to get to hospital and receive the treatment I need.  When that happened, I felt discouraged.  It becomes very difficult to go through the same process again with the welfare officer.  If I have another appointment, I will still have to go to see her.  When the RIA says it is providing X or Y, it can tick a box.  It says it has done this and that and that one is entitled to a medical card.  While I have a medical card, I cannot put it under my feet and fly to the hospital.</p><p> That basic things are not there for people makes it very difficult to even hear the word "integration".  It sickens me to hear it even from NGOs who come to direct provision centres and say they want to help integrate people.  It is not helping to integrate a person if that person goes back at the end of the day to sleep in a direct provision centre.  That alone should tell one that they are segregated from the communities in which those who say that live themselves.  Residents do not live among communities, they live among people like themselves.  That is where the fundamental problem is.  We cannot begin to talk about integration while we still have direct provision.  One cannot talk about integrating asylum seekers when a person can be removed from the State at any point.  There is no integration there.  If one wants to integrate people, one integrates them into the social life of the country so that they can socialise and one integrates them into political life.  We have seen people run for election.  One integrates them into the economic life of the country so that they can work and become productive and contributing members of society, thereby ending the profiteering.  I talk a lot but before I stop I refer to one direct provision centre in Cork which had three bunk beds in one tiny room.  There were six asylum seekers in that tiny room.  That tiny room earns the company &euro;6,300 per month.  No one looking for a house to rent in Ireland would have to pay that much for a room.  We allow it to happen here because it is happening to people who are not from here.  It is happening to asylum seekers because the view is that they should be grateful that they are here and that they are given a bed and food.  That is what we are told.</p><p> We are called welfare scroungers and in the recent election campaign we were called freeloaders.  No asylum seeker has ever asked the Government for a plate of food.  No one arrives at Dublin Airport and says "I would like to have food please".  I am told I am being provided with food and a bed, but I never asked for any of that.  I asked for protection.  It becomes very difficult to even begin to talk about integration for us when we have been warehoused in direct provision centres without access to very basic everyday things and are being treated inhumanely by managers who can waltz into one's room without any consideration for one's privacy and without considering that people have suffered traumatic experiences.  The State is warehousing vulnerable people with children, including women who feel unsafe in direct provision centres.  We have had reports of sexual violence from AkiDwA and of the experiences of women feeling unsafe in direct provision centres.  I said in response to a member earlier that people come here with fear already.  When one puts them in a direct provision centre where they will experience the same fear, that alone tells one the system is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Donnah Vuma" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#O00200"><p>I find it shocking that people have said there have been improvements or that the recommendations have been implemented when people continue to live in a state of forced poverty.  One of my biggest issues with the working group report is that no one came here looking for comfort, as Mr. Mfaco said.  We are not looking to be comfortable in direct provision.  We do not want the direct provision system reformed or made comfortable.  Many of us came here to seek protection.  We did not unpack our experiences, skills or expertise in the countries we left.  We came here with them.  That means we are able to work.  We are capable and qualified to do so.  All we want is to be allowed to work so that we can provide for our families.  As I have already mentioned, I am a mother of three.  Unfortunately, I have been living in this system for five years and it was only yesterday that I received a decision on my case.  It is finally out of the High Court to which I appealed the decision that was made on my original application for refugee status.  It is still unclear what is happening there because I have no contact with my solicitor.  I have not been updated as to what it means that the case was successful in the High Court.  That is a major problem which many of us face.  We do not have proper legal advice.  While legal aid is available in principle, one may only get to see one's solicitor once on the day before an interview.</p> <p>  It is a great challenge to raise a children in direct provision on an allowance, which used to be just &euro;19.10.  I cannot begin to explain to the committee the challenge of having to save money from a &euro;19 payment to meet the expenses associated with raising children.  My eldest child is in her third year of secondary school but I take the committee back two years to when she started in first year.  The initial cost of starting school was approximately &euro;900.  I had no idea where that &euro;900 was going to come from when I was on an allowance of &euro;19.10.  To try to meet that &euro;900 expense, let alone the expenses for my two other children, I had to save money from that &euro;19.10 to supplement the &euro;150 back-to-school payment the State gives everyone.  My greatest problem with that is the limitations it imposes on the development of children.  They cannot participate in extracurricular activities.  Since my children have been in the school system here, they have never been able to take part in extracurricular activities.</p><p>I would not be able to pay for my children to do so in any case out of the &euro;38.80 allowance to which I am restricted because I do not have the right to work.</p><p> The same issue arises for children in secondary school.  As an example, my daughter will be going into transition year in September, which includes a school trip next January with an option to go either on an exchange programme to the United States or to Austria on a ski trip.  This is a trip in which everybody in her class is partaking.  She knows she has a passport because we got it when we came to Ireland, although we had to give up those documents at our point of arrival when we sought asylum.  How do I go about explaining to my child that she cannot take part in an activity that might have a huge impact on the rest of her life and in which all her peers will be able to participate?  This is one of the restrictions and barriers we face as parents.  It is only a miracle that will allow my child to go on the trip given that it costs &euro;960.  While I do not have the right to work, how am I supposed to be able to meet that type of expense?</p><p> I am taking the opportunity to highlight the most serious issues, but I also want to give the committee examples of the simple oppression we face in the centres on a daily basis.  I had a recent incident where I needed an extra roll of tissue.  We are given basic toiletries, including tissue, toothpaste and shower gel, at our centre in Knockalisheen, but it happened on this day that we ran out of tissue.  As embarrassing and humiliating as it is to have say this at the committee, I was in the bathroom when I realised there was no tissue.  I called my 12 year old daughter and asked her to run down to reception to get a new roll.  She did so and was mocked by the two security staff members on duty who told her to go back and get her mother to come out of the bathroom and fetch the tissue herself.  Apparently the manager had told them they were not allowed to give tissue to children.  What is wrong with giving a toilet roll to a 12 year old?</p><p> Another incident I wish to highlight is one of which members may already be aware.  My son was sick one night and needed a simple slice of bread and some milk.  I am not allowed to cook for my children or have food in my room.  Previously, I was able to access these things but on this particular day, the manager had decided to impose a new rule.  I went to reception at 1 a.m. in desperate need of a slice of bread and milk to help my sickly child, but I was denied it.  The Minister subsequently requested that an inquiry to be made into what happened, as a result of which some sort of apology was given.  I do not know whether it was directed to me, but some kind of apology happened and the staff were supposed to receive training on the issue.  I am not sure whether that training was about how to treat people humanely and with more respect but, as I said, I have now had a situation where my child was denied tissue and I was told to come out of the bathroom and fetch it myself.</p><p> That raises a serious question about the type of people, communities and society the direct provision system is shaping for the future.  If I am put in that centre on an allowance of &euro;38.80 per week, I am being taught how to be dependent on the system, and I am teaching my children the same.  I am teaching them how to be helpless.  By the time I move out of that centre and am on a social welfare payment of &euro;180 per week, there is no way I will want to move myself out and find work.  It will be a promotion for me to go from &euro;38.80 to &euro;180 per week.  The process is automatically teaching my children the same system of dependency.  It is a very dangerous situation that is being created.</p><p> Children in direct provision are not even allowed to attend a school of their choice but are instead confined either to the schools in the local area or a school to which they are referred by the centre manager.  My child goes to a school that is a bit out of the way for where we live, being some 20 km away, but it is the school to which her peers from primary school chose to go and so she wanted to go there.  The bus that takes her to school stops less than 1 km from the centre.  The first bus out of the centre to take children to school is at 8 a.m. but my daughter needs to be at the bus stop at 7.45 a.m.  I have asked the centre management many times to make an adjustment, which would not be solely for my child but also for the few other children who need an earlier bus service.  Our request has been denied repeatedly.  This means that from my &euro;38.80 allowance, I have to pay a lady &euro;40 every week to take my daughter to the bus stop in the morning and bring her back to the centre in the afternoon.  I do not know how we are expected to survive under those conditions.</p><p> The same teenaged daughter has no idea how to boil an egg.  For the five years that I have lived in direct provision, my children have not known the taste of my cooking and are subjected only to what is served in the canteen.  My nine year old eats rice and gravy on a daily basis, as Mr. Mfaco, who sees him in the canteen, would be able to confirm.  I am sure my son is the one who asked for a second doughnut and was refused.  It is the one thing he likes.  Otherwise he is on a diet of rice and gravy endlessly because it is the only thing he can stand to eat.  That is not a normal situation and not the way that any child should be growing up.  It would not be acceptable to Irish people, Irish communities or Irish society to take an Irish child and put him or her in that situation and subject him or her to growing up in those types of conditions.</p><p> We and others have stated over and over again that direct provision is not fit for purpose.  We are not looking for comfort, as I said.  We are just looking to live as normal human beings and to be able to contribute to the communities that have welcomed us in many situations.  We are looking for the opportunity to give our children a better life than what they have experienced here and in our countries of origin.  We just want that opportunity to have sanctuary and safety and to be able to live normal lives.</p></speech>

That argument can be made because everybody there cooks for themselves and there are playgrounds for the children.  Whenever direction provision is discussed, there is a concentration on Mosney but no mention of Monaghan, for instance, where the playgrounds have been closed, or Kinsale, where residents are not allowed to cook.  We are asking for focus to be placed on those other centres rather than just advertising Mosney as the good place out of the whole system.</p></speech>

The system has recently been brought under the remit of the Ombudsman.  There have been 148 complaints this year.  Does the IRC feel there are adequate safeguards in place in every centre to ensure that the residents' rights are respected, particularly in respect of sexual abuse and even mental health issues that arise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052900002#Q00200"><p>Those are serious problems and the testimony of everybody today has spelled that out plainly and clearly to all of us, ourselves included.  The simple remoteness of some centres may make it difficult to access mainstream services, as has been well explained.  Let us not forget that existing mental health services in Ireland are already stretched.  GP lists may be full and one may have to travel to a GP.  As Mr. Khambule explained, there have been several incidents of suicide and I can think of three within the past three years.</p> <p>  There are clearly deep problems and there is a framework for that to change.  The law that was passed in June of last year states that the Minister for Health shall ensure that a recipient has access to emergency healthcare and such healthcare as is necessary for the treatment of serious illnesses and mental disorders.  There is, therefore, a framework and a clear legal obligation on the State to ensure that people with such mental health problems are given proper assistance.</p> <p>  The two organisations here today and six other organisations released a statement last Sunday highlighting the fact that there is no vulnerability assessment procedure as required by that law in Ireland.  In June, it will be 12 months since that law was passed.  If there was a vulnerability assessment procedure, that would mean that if people were to arrive, they would be assessed and a determination would be made on what special reception needs they have such as if they have children and all the issues around children that Ms Vuma has explained, if they have health needs and if it is appropriate that they are accommodated in somewhere such as Knockalisheen.  That has not happened and that is a clear absence of, gap in or non-implementation of law and that is seriously problematic.</p></speech>

I hope they never give up the fight to abolish direct provision centres.  We will do everything and by the way we have a great Chairman to whom I want to pay credit.  We will do our best to highlight the issues that the witnesses have given us information on.  I appreciate their honesty.  It has been an unbelievable eye-opener for me and I thought I had a fair idea of the injustice that is going on here but the detail the witnesses have given us is important and I thank them so much.</p></speech>

It has been a tough meeting.  I have been a member of this committee for almost three years and Mr. Sibanda made probably one of the most insightful and thoughtful contributions I have heard to it.  To then see him in the condition he is in now and to hear some of these stories is a bit of a wake-up call and a dose of reality for us.  My view on direct provision is not much good to the witnesses because they are living it and they articulated the experience of that vividly today.</p> <p>  I am not as kind as my colleague, Senator Black.  The Government party is not represented here today because it does not care.  It knows full well what the situation is in direct provision because this is not the first meeting about this.  These meetings, presentations and engagements have happened consistently over a long number of years and, therefore, we need to consider a dose of unfortunate reality as we move forward collectively.  There are people in society and in government who think it is okay to lock people away in direct provision, who put the interests of private companies ahead of human beings and who think the culture that prevailed, as Senator Black said, during the period of the Magdalen laundries is okay now because we are not doing this to Irish people, even though the same Government oversees children who are born here sleeping in hotel rooms.</p> <p>  That is a culture we have to acknowledge before we hopefully get to the stage where direct provision is abolished.  That is a sad and unfortunate fact of Irish life that we need to challenge.  The committee's report could and probably should comprise the transcript of this meeting.  That is not to take away from any other contributors but the most important people in all of this who need to be heard are those living in direct provision.</p> <p>  The Chairman, whom Senator Black rightly acknowledged we are lucky to have in this regard, will lead a delegation from the committee to visit a number of direct provision centres next month.  I do not mean to be facetious about this but I remember when inspectors visited my school we were told to buck up our ideas, tidy up and put on a good show, so I ask the witnesses to be as frank as they can and to tell us what we should look out for and what questions we should ask.  I am sure their contributions will inform those of us who are going on that trip.  If there are any specifics that we should look out for and ask about on the day then the witnesses can be sure and certain that we will ask them but if there is anything beyond what they have said this morning, please let us know.</p> <p>  I do not want to come across as too negative.  I always go in hope.  One of the staff in my office always says to light a candle as opposed to curse the dark.  We can get to a point where we get rid of this stain on society.  This is how we are treating people as a nation of emigrants for generations, who went all over the world seeking refuge and seeking support.  It is a great shame and the message from this meeting is that when people are trying to exploit fear, ignorance and hatred, we are duty bound to help to inform people about what our fellow human beings are going through and to shine a light on what is happening in direct provision.</p> <p>  I am grateful to the witnesses for taking the opportunity to come here.  I wish we could do more and I wish I could give them the answer today.  Members will do their best.  We are up against it and the witnesses are up against it to address a political culture that thinks it is okay to do this.  That is the greatest shame.</p></speech>

The manager of the centre I am in will say everything is perfect and well, but things are not okay.  One will be shown the kitchen and people cooking but, in the centre I am in, mothers are struggling to cook their meals because they have got small babies they cannot bring into the kitchen.  By the time they find someone to mind their babies, the kitchen is closed.  If one visits during the day, one finds the kitchen is functional and one will have the impression that everyone is cooking.</p> <p>  If one visits, one will be told the centre provides transport, but our transport is being provided by the private sector also.  Therefore, we have to beg.  We try to keep active as much as we can.  I tried to register a couple of people for the upcoming local elections.  The vote is one of the only rights we have and we need to use it.  We register the people and ask for a bus to take us to vote.  I was told the bus would pick people up at 10 a.m., leave them at the polling station and pick them up at 11 a.m.  The polling station is less than ten minutes away.  Emo is not a busy place so one can vote quickly and come out within five minutes.  Therefore, people have to wait for 40 minutes.  I asked one of the employers why the bus was not sent at about 11 a.m. and sent again to pick people up around 11.30 a.m.  The response is that the centre is not obliged to provide the transport and is just doing people a favour.  I was upset and made a point about treatment.  I said that if transport is provided as it was, no one will want to get on a bus, and the staff will say people do not want to be active.</p> <p>  Asylum seekers cannot be integrated because they are not legal in the country, but they are staying in the system for five years.  It would make sense if they were in it for only a year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1273" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019052900002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I remind committee members, staff, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting.  They also cause problems in broadcasting the proceedings on television and radio and in web streaming. </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>It is proposed that any opening statement, submission or other document supplied by witnesses or other bodies to the committee on the topic of this meeting be published on its website after the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>We will have two sessions today, the first of which is on flooding at Ballycar on the Galway-Limerick railway line.  It will be followed by a discussion on opportunities for investment in heavy rail.  This is the third of our series of meetings on these topics.  </p><p>The Galway-Limerick railway line is regularly under water at Ballycar.  The flooding is frequent and persistent and, owing to climate change, will only get worse.  It is an example of brown water flooding which also occurs elsewhere in Galway and in counties such as Roscommon, Mayo and Clare.  The area is slow to flood and slow to drain.  When the water inflow at Ballycar is greater than the outflow after persistent heavy rain, the turlough fills up.  The water outflow could be augmented by a pipe running from the turlough, bypassing the bottleneck that is the sinkhole, draining water into Lough Ash and the Shannon Estuary.  However, we need to ensure we do not increase other environmental and infrastructural risks.  </p><p>Mitigating the flood risk at Ballycar requires a collaborative, multi-agency approach.  We must avoid a silo mentality in that regard.  While the Office of Public Works is the national lead agency for pluvial, alluvial and coastal flood risk mitigation measures, Geological Survey Ireland takes the lead in investigating brown water flooding.  Clare County Council is responsible for flood risk mitigation in County Clare, while Irish Rail is the rail operator and responsible for railway infrastructure.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is concerned with special areas of conservation, SACs, while the Irish Aviation Authority has infrastructure which could be at risk from flooding.  Addressing the flooding is important if confidence in the rail service is to be maintained.  Passengers need to know that the service is reliable.  The committee sees the Galway-Limerick railway line as phase one of the western railway corridor project which we hope to see extended to Tuam and Claremorris and eventually Sligo.</p><p>The committee is delighted to meet representatives from the various bodies represented at what is our third meeting on this subject.  I thank committee members for supporting me in bringing it forward.  Prior to the intervention of the committee, the agencies involved were not talking to each another and there was some passing of the parcel, for want of a better term.  </p><p>In his opening statement Mr. Hedderly will highlight the collaborative efforts of the various agencies involved.  I am encouraged that the deadlines put forward last November have been lived up to and that serious work has been undertaken in a joint effort by the agencies.  I invite Mr. Hedderly to make his opening statement on behalf of the various agencies involved.</p></speech>

Collectively, we welcome the opportunity to update the committee on developments since November 2018 when we previously attended.  As noted in November, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has engaged RPS Consulting Engineers to develop a feasible engineering solution to the flooding issue at Ballycar with an updated report due in spring 2019.  A draft report has been prepared by RPS and was issued to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Clare County Council and the OPW in early April.  The report identified a preferred option for the alleviation of flooding on the Limerick to Galway railway line at Ballycar consisting of attenuation of some flows upstream of the railway line in Finn and Rosroe loughs, removal of the underground restriction between the swallow hole and spring downstream of Ballycar Lough, construction of a diversion pipeline and channel to divert excess flows around Newmarket-on-Fergus and Lough Gash, upgrading of existing stream channels and culverts, and construction of a flood protection embankment along the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, infrastructure in Urlanmore.  Following an initial review of the report, it was agreed that the option of diverting some flows to the Owengarney, or Ratty, river should be further investigated and the recommendations in the report updated as necessary.  This requires the completion of additional topographical surveys and hydraulic modelling, which is being undertaken by RPS.  Following the finalisation of this report, the most appropriate technically and environmentally feasible option to address the Ballycar flooding issue will be considered by the bodies and the appropriate route for the progression of the works, including funding, will be investigated.</p> <p>  This represents the joint position of the four bodies.  We are committed to the concept of sustainability and to the delivery of optimum service of key strategic infrastructure and will continue to work together to resolve the problem on the rail line at Ballycar.  We welcome any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

GSI carries out its role as a key knowledge centre and data repository with a library, archives and extensive digital data holdings.  It provides an extensive advisory service, particularly to local authorities, and has statutory roles as a national archive and consultee on planning in areas such as county development plans, wind farm development and foreshore licences.  In addition to supporting Government and local authorities, GSI provides data and advice to industry and research and acts as a project partner to all aspects of Irish geoscience, especially in European projects.<br/><br/>GSI has developed expertise in the area of groundwater flooding, especially in understanding complex karst systems, including turloughs, as they can be important pathways for pollution.  The 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government, under the area of climate change and flooding, contained the following objective: &quot;[in relation to] Turlough Systems: We will provide resources to the OPW to commission studies into individual problematic (prone to flooding) Turlough systems, if requested by a local authority or another relevant State agency.&quot;  GSI has been tasked with gathering historic and new information to deliver on this objective and initiated a new dedicated groundwater flooding project in collaboration with researchers at Trinity College Dublin and the Institute of Technology Carlow.  The core objectives of the project are to establish a permanent monitoring network to provide long-term quantitative flood data as well as producing national historic and predictive groundwater flood maps.<br/><br/>Since the previous Oireachtas joint committee meeting, the GSI groundwater flooding programme has been focused on producing a national groundwater flood map while also installing and maintaining monitoring equipment at groundwater flood sites.  A national maximum historic groundwater flood map was produced and supplied to the OPW in April this year.  Work on a predictive flood map is ongoing and the map will be supplied to the OPW later this summer.  The predictive map will present not just the likely extent of groundwater flooding, but also the probability of a given flood occurring at applicable sites.  These maps will assist the OPW in fulfilling its obligations as required under the second implementation cycle of the EU floods directive.  In addition, Geological Survey Ireland also recently had discussions with Met &Eacute;ireann regarding potential groundwater flood forecasting capabilities.<br/><br/><b></b>In respect of Ballycar, Geological Survey Ireland has been taking part in the technical subcommittee meetings regarding the flooding in the area.  Monitoring stations have been installed at Ballycar and Lough Gash turloughs. The stations record water level data at hourly intervals which are freely available upon request.  In addition to these monitoring stations, Ballycar and other flood prone areas along the western railway corridor are being monitored using Copernicus satellite imagery.</p></speech>

The key question, once this preferred option is put together, is how it will be funded.  Has there been any discussion among the groups that are working together on the question of funding?  What are the next steps that need to be taken?  Will there be any public consultation on the preferred option that will emerge?  Is there any timeframe for construction works on this scheme?  Perhaps Mr. Kenny of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann could answer those very easy questions.</p></speech>

I will start by saying we have had excellent collaboration between all the organisations, which has been very useful in arriving at a preferred solution.  There is some survey work to be completed.  It is ongoing at the moment and I suspect it will take another four or five weeks.  After that, the report needs to be completed.  I would prefer not to indicate what the project is likely to cost until we finalise the report.  On the next steps after finalising the report, we then need to do a cost.  The report will be able to indicate a cost for the project.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will do a cost-benefit analysis, at which stage we will need to find a funding mechanism for the project.  After that, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would need to commission consultants to do a detailed design, an environmental impact assessment report, EIAR, and all of that.  Any public consultation will come into play once we know the solution, and we are nearly at that point.  When we get into environmental planning and all of that, there will obviously be public consultation at that stage.</p></speech>

Obviously we understand there is going to be significant cost.  However, it may be premature to have those discussions before we have nailed down the outline design and agreed on some kind of costing.  It does need to happen.  The scale of funding for that line is something Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would have to look at.</p><p>We would need to make an application for those kinds of funds for that line because it does not warrant that kind of expenditure as it is.

In November 2018 we had an in-depth discussion on the problems with the site at Ballycar and the impact it is having on national transport infrastructure.  I welcome that this committee, with the Chairman driving it, has brought about collaboration between all the stakeholders involved, something we did not have prior to last year.  The report is almost complete.  I note that survey work will be complete within the next month or so.  Then at least we will have a hard-copy report with recommendations for the best solutions.  Of course, we will then have to deal with the biggest problem, which is funding.</p> <p>  I look forward to seeing the report.  When it is published, the committee should get the opportunity to discuss it to see how we might assist in bringing forward the solution recommended.  We know it will not be easy.  It is a piece of national rail infrastructure.  It behoves the Government and State agencies to do what they can to address the problem and this committee should work towards that.  I thank the witnesses for the update.  The hard work lies ahead now that the report is almost complete.</p></speech>

We look forward to them reporting back to the committee.  As Senator Coffey has said, we are here to assist.  The committee will certainly come behind the report and assist in trying to draw down funding to implement it because it is badly needed.  It is an issue that has been overlooked for too long.  We will assist the witnesses when the report is complete and a preferred option is identified.</p></speech>

This is our third session with representatives from Irish Rail.  Officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the National Transport Authority, as well as other stakeholders, have already appeared before the committee.  Failure to invest in public transport results in poorer interchange facilities, congestion and increasing burning of carbon.  A relatively modest investment is clearly in the public interest.  We must be careful to avoid analysis paralysis, always waiting for the next consultant's report while investment is held back by a kind of glass ceiling.  The committee would be delighted to hear firm investment proposals from Irish Rail.  I call on Mr. Barry Kenny, Irish Rail corporate communications manager, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Mr. Meade has previously outlined to the committee the scale of our operations and our investment proposals.  I will briefly recap on our operations, updated for the full year of 2018, and advise the committee of the developments since our November 2018 attendance, and how these will benefit the national heavy rail services we provide.<br/><br/>Our team of over 3,800 people maintain a network of 2,200 km; operate 4,900 train services each week; carry over 923,000 customers each week; operate 144 stations in 23 counties across the country; and transport almost 90 million tkm of freight by rail in 2018.  As the port authority for Rosslare Europort, we bring 130,000 freight units, over 800,000 passengers and over 21,000 trade cars through annually.  Once again over the past year, a record number of customers travelled on our services.  Some 47.9 million passenger journeys were made, up from the previous high of 45.5 million journeys achieved in both 2007 and 2017.<br/><br/>This growth is most welcome and is set to continue but it also places acute pressure on our existing resources, across both urban and interurban services.  This is why our investment plans are so crucial, both to cater for existing demand and to allow us to expand the role we play in meeting transport needs.  As the chief executive has told the committee previously, we are ambitious for our rail service, for how it can deliver solutions to congestion and environmental sustainability for Ireland.<br/><br/>Before I address progress in our investment programme specifically, I wish to advise the committee of a significant development in the ongoing &quot;steady state&quot; funding for the organisation.  We have previously mentioned that during the economic crisis, the company was significantly underfunded for many years.  The NDP committed to resolving this shortfall by 2021.  We are pleased that this year, 2019, has seen the shortfall resolved through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, meaning we are now adequately funded to maintain the network and services we are contracted to provide.  This ensures a solid foundation to play the fullest role possible in the future and exploit the investment that is planned.<br/><br/>Rather than reiterate previous statements, I will focus on key investment developments since we last appeared before the committee.  However, I am happy to answer questions on all aspects of our investment programme.<br/><br/>As mentioned, we are experiencing record demand and to address this we need new trains, along with enhanced infrastructure capacity.  On Monday of this week, the process to order the largest and greenest fleet in Irish public transport history began as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, supported by the National Transport Authority, NTA, sought expressions of interest from global train manufacturers for up to 600 electric or battery-electric powered carriages over a ten-year timescale.<br/><br/>Under DART expansion, a &euro;2 billion investment under Project Ireland 2040, the capacity of the rail network will be transformed through investment in up to 300 new carriages, electrification of lines within the commuter belt and key infrastructure works to allow more trains to operate across the entire national network.<br/><br/>The ambitious tender that commenced on Monday for up to 600 carriages allows for both the planned fleet expansion and replacement of the original DART fleet, which by the end of the current national development plan in 2027 will be almost 45 years old.  That indicates the benefit of any train carriage asset that we order and will ensure that a framework is in place for more carriages to be ordered if further growth in demand occurs.<br/><br/>The tender notice appears in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>and on eTenders.  We expect virtually every major global train manufacturer to be attracted by this, such is its scale.  It will ensure customers on our rail network benefit from up-to-date facilities and technology, and that there are scale benefits in the competitive tendering for the NTA-funded investment.<br/><br/>While electricity-powered trains are expected to make up the overwhelming majority of train orders, the tender process also provides for a possible first tranche of battery-electric hybrid trains.  This is to ensure that, should funding or planning processes delay the electrification of the first of the lines beyond 2024, new trains will be available from that date to meet the surging demand from commuters. <br/><br/>However, the overall order will see the entire greater Dublin area, GDA, rail fleet and up to 80% of all heavy rail journeys in Ireland set for a potentially emissions-free future with electric power, as well as generating reductions in noise and cost savings in train operations.<br/><br/>The full national network will benefit from this investment, with existing intercity and commuter trains currently utilised to meet GDA demand becoming available to boost frequency and capacity nationwide.</p><p>We are also planning to convert the existing intercity rail car fleet, which is 234 carriages strong, to diesel-electric hybrid to reduce emissions on our national routes.</p><p> As well as this major order, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the NTA are progressing shorter-term options to meet the record demand we are experiencing.  With 47.9 million journeys in 2018 and capacity requirements becoming acute on national and urban routes at peak times, this includes negotiations under way between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and its supplier seeking to agree an order for at least 41 extra intercity rail car carriages adding to an existing fleet of 234 vehicles to enter service from late 2021.  This will allow us to increase capacity on key peak intercity and commuter services ahead of the service expansion facilitated by the major order detailed above.  A tender process is under way by the NTA for the possible purchase or lease of pre-owned trains, which also would involve modifications to fleet, particularly as Ireland's track gauge differs from that of other railways.</p><p> This month, the NTA published the Cork metropolitan area draft transport strategy, which sets out an exciting vision for sustainable transport in the Cork area.  Included is a strategy for the future of Cork commuter rail, which includes eight new stations on the Mallow, Cobh and Midleton lines, double tracking of the Midleton line, DART-style frequency on all three Cork commuter lines, future electrification, through running at Kent Station, and improved integration with other modes.  The strategy will now be the subject of public consultation undertaken by the NTA with which Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will engage.  It envisages a Cork commuter network with the capacity for 16 million journeys annually, a genuinely transformative scale of modal shift.</p><p> I have mentioned Ballycar, which is on the western rail corridor.  As the committee will know, both the current programme for Government and the national development plan committed to a financial and economic appraisal of proposals to extend the western rail corridor.  Working to terms of reference specified by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has appointed consultants EY-DKM to undertake the independent appraisal and public and stakeholder consultation.  The purpose of the appraisal is to establish if the proposed extension from Athenry to Tuam - phase 2 - and from Tuam to Claremorris - phase 3 - represents value for money.  We expect to commence the public consultation process next week and will invite members of the public and interested organisations to participate in this process.  We will seek information and views on current transport usage and current transport services, views on the extension of the western rail corridor to phases 2 and 3 and any other comments or observations.  EY-DKM is due to complete the appraisal and present the report, including findings and recommendations, to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by the end of September 2019.  The Department will then undertake an independent peer review of the report and its findings and recommendations to advise and inform policy decisions arising.</p><p> Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has continued to liaise with Waterford City and County Council on the plans for the Waterford north quays, which incorporate a relocated Plunkett Station as part of an integrated transport hub.  As well as progressing our own signalling and station layout design to accommodate increased service frequency, and freight operations, we are facilitating all necessary site investigation and studies for the wider north quays project.</p><p> Beyond this, the infrastructure studies necessary for detailed design to enhance capacity in the central Dublin area and thus overall national capacity are progressing, and plans for station facilities, including but not limited to additional car parking, accessibility and customer information, are being reviewed in co-operation with the NTA.  It is clear that as a country and a society, the sustainability of our economy into the future and the impacts on our environment are becoming a greater concern for our citizens and our customers.  As the most sustainable public transport mode, we see an investment programme that will not only effect modal shift from private to public transport but minimise further the impact on the environment of each journey made with us.  With an accelerated electrification programme, this will also have cost benefits to our operations, thus yielding a return to our economy and society by all measures.  I welcome the committee's continuing support for these goals and am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

It is very clear that Irish Rail is doing a significant amount in terms of investment in infrastructure with a particular emphasis on environmental sustainability.  This is very positive.  There appears to be significant investment, which we were starved of for many years.  I wish to raise the issue of the western rail corridor, which was mentioned by Mr. Kenny, with regard to an appraisal involving value for money.  I would like further comments regarding services for the west, both freight and commuter.  I am especially familiar with the Westport line and believe there is definite under-utilisation of that line.  We must also take the Galway and Sligo lines into account.  What are the plans in terms of increasing the number of customers on that line and Irish Rail's significant focus on environmental sustainability with regard to freight?  Commentary on those two issues would be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019052900002#D00300"><p>In terms of the western rail corridor, we are working to terms of reference established by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I think people probably worry when they hear the phrase "value for money" and wonder whether it is a narrow financial assessment.  It is not a narrow financial assessment at all.  Infrastructure requires public support.  It requires something that does not just mention the bottom line of an individual organisation.  It looks at the economic return, the benefits to society and the connectivity it provides.  They are the terms of reference to which EY-DKM will work when looking at the financial and wider economic benefits the extension would yield.  The public consultation will allow people to express their opinions freely.  We know there are many opinions on the topic.  That opportunity will be there.  We will advertise that extensively and ensure people in the region and beyond are fully aware that this consultation is taking place.  Ultimately, after the Department's independent peer review, it will become a policy decision because, obviously, public funding will be required if the line is reinstated based on the outputs of that.  That will be a decision at Department or political level but it will be a comprehensive and independent study.  The terms of reference have been set out and EY-DKM will work to them and report to us and the Department.</p> <p>  Regarding wider services for the west, thankfully, the passenger growth I mentioned has continued in the west as well.  Looking at last year as an example, the Dublin to Westport line grew further.  It was relatively modest at 570,000 to 582,000 in the year.  The Dublin to Galway line grew up to 1.4 million journeys through the year.  With the various suite of figures, it would be 1.4 million journeys on the Dublin to Sligo line.  The figure was 577,000 for the Westport to Ballina line.  I got the Galway figure wrong.  It was just two million journeys during 2018.</p> <p>  The growth we are seeing is spreading nationally.  In the early days when passenger growth was coming back to us, it was driven at an urban level primarily but now it is growing nationally.  Overall on intercity journeys, it outstripped DART and commuter growth last year by 8.5%.  There is probably more capacity within the existing services on the intercity lines versus how it would be on the DART or commuter lines, but nonetheless we are coming up against the same constraints we have.  That 41-carriage order, which is the shorter-term measure, will benefit both intercity and commuter routes.  We will be looking at heavily loaded services in the peaks to provide additional capacity in the first instance on individual services.</p><p>When we proceed to the bigger order, the trains start to come through and we increase our overall pool of trains, and with the works on infrastructure in areas closer to the city where infrastructural capacity is more at a premium, we will be allowed to operate more trains at the time in question.  The first wave is about longer trains and the second about more trains.  It will be late 2021 to 2022 when the longer trains become available.  It will be 2024 and later before the expansion of services.  In short, that is how we are working.</p><p> We have increased services.  It is not long since there were three trains each way per day on the Dublin&ndash;Sligo line.  There are now eight.  The number on the Westport line has increased from three to five.  We would like the frequency to increase further.  We are updating our overall strategy on intercity services to ensure there is clarity and direction to service frequency improvement.  As evident from the Dublin-Cork line, which moved to an hourly service all day, we genuinely believe there is a genuine step change in the number of people who travel with us.</p><p> The Westport line, for example, has a connection off the Dublin&ndash;Galway line.  With a mix of direct and changing services, there is no reason the Dublin&ndash;Galway and Dublin&ndash;Westport services could not be hourly, which would be transformative.  Frequency is not just about more trains; it gives customers more flexibility and makes the overall service more attractive.  While Sligo has more of its existing infrastructural capacity utilised, it is a matter of determining how we can grow it further.  We see potential in this regard right around the network as the investment funding comes into play.</p><p> With regard to freight services, we have recently increased the volume of the Ballina&ndash;Dublin Port freight services.  We continue to work with the likes of the Irish Exporters Association and freight forwarders to identify opportunities.  Many of them tend to be linked to significant investment programmes.  I refer to identifying traffic best suited to rail freight, tying in with planning processes.  We have a number of options in this regard.  We are probably in non-disclosure territory as we discuss the matter with potential customers.  We are confident, however, that the scale of rail freight operation can continue to grow in the coming years.  In the past couple of months, the Ballina&ndash;Dublin operation has increased.  I hope that addresses the points made.</p></speech>

I am mindful that circumstances have improved.  The last train to Westport from Heuston Station is at 6.15 p.m.  The last to Cork leaves at 9 p.m.  Mr. Kenny has acknowledged that the number of customers using that service has increased.  We believe there is a lot more potential.  Many have raised this issue with me because they are commuting.  As he rightly said, service users need flexibility.  Could Irish Rail be more mindful of the capacity of greater frequency to increase flexibility, particularly in terms of the service to the west?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019052900002#E00300"><p>On that point, after a prolonged recruitment embargo, we have a new intake of drivers.  Driver training classes are taking place.  As the driver pool grows, it will address one capacity limitation we have.  It is an obvious next step.  There are a number of routes, not only the Westport route, on which there is certainly an appetite for a later last service.  One has to establish whether there is a firm business case  but there is an appetite for later services.  We will certainly consider this openly with the NTA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.584" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019052900002#E00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity for the committee to engage with Irish Rail executives.  I acknowledge the progress being made with the company.  I acknowledge it has been through a number of difficult years but now business is growing.  I need not tell the delegates that, with the increasing population and increase in tourism, Irish Rail has to be fit for purpose as a national transport provider.  I know it is planning for this.  On top of this, there is a greater appetite for sustainable travel.  Rail is one of the most comfortable and sustainable types of travel.  We need to support it.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the rolling stock and its renewal.  I presume that much of the existing stock comprises diesel engines and that the company will make an investment to replace them with electric vehicles.  Could we have some more detail on that and the plans over the next two to five years?  It is a matter of public interest.</p> <p>  The NTA has a role.  The frequency and timing of train travel to meet the needs of service users, be they workers or college students, need to be reviewed to ensure service provision meets demand.  What are Irish Rail's plans in this regard?  Most important, how does it intend to attract new service users?  There is great potential for Irish rail to exploit.  People are becoming more conscious of the environment and sustainable travel.  There are now opportunities for Irish Rail to attract new generations to using rail.  Mr. Kenny might refer to that.</p> <p>  What I want to speak about next might seem a little parochial but it is a national issue.  I refer to Plunkett Station, Waterford, and Waterford Port.  The witnesses will be aware of the ambitious growth plans for Waterford city under Project Ireland 2040.  They will also be aware of the importance of regional development, which is set down by Government policy, and the importance of regional access and connectivity.  Taking all these into account, it is critical that we review where Waterford city and its rail services are currently and where they need to be over the next five to 20 years.</p> <p>  As we speak, even without Project Ireland 2040 and the demands of an increasing population, there are issues with Plunkett Station.  There has been flooding on the track.  From time to time, the station has to be closed.  There is a cliff face above the station that makes it vulnerable.  Remediation works had to be carried out.  There is a serious disconnect with other modes of transport.  The train station is not beside a bus station.  Passengers who use the Waterford&ndash;Dublin service or Waterford-Limerick service have to walk across the bridge to avail themselves of other services.  That is also unacceptable.  The witnesses will be well aware of these.  Even without increasing demand, all these issues have to be addressed.</p> <p>  The good news for Irish Rail - it is a challenge also but good news because there is an opportunity - is that with the arrival of the strategic development zone at the North Quays, there is an exciting development plan now being presented by Waterford City and County Council.  The relocation of Plunkett Station is critical to the development plan.  Much work has been done on an integrated transport hub for the North Quays.  This could enhance rail services and connect them to all other modes of transport while eradicating many of the difficulties with the existing station.  It is critical that Irish Rail be fully engaged in this project.  It has the backing of the Government and the local authority.</p> <p>  It was said in the contribution that Irish Rail is liaising with Waterford City and County Council.  Is Irish Rail working on the development plans?  A planning application is to be made shortly.  Without disputing it or interfering with that in any way, I make reference to the fact that there is a strategic development zone with the support of the local authority.  It is critical that Irish Rail be supportive of the relocation plan for Plunkett Station.  How deep is the engagement?  Can further information on that be provided to the committee?</p> <p>  With regard to the frequency and timing of rail services, the Waterford&ndash;Limerick rail service is not as used as much as we would like and as it should be but there is still potential for it if we can sell it and time trains to match work and college hours.  The N24 is probably one of the worst national roads in the country.  I often hear people who support rail travel complaining about how the good road is taking business away.  This is ironic given that the Waterford-Limerick is one of the worst.  I am sitting beside my colleague from Limerick.  There should be increased use of the rail service.</p><p>What is Irish Rail doing to sell that or to make it more attractive to rail users?</p><p> On heavy freight transport, as Mr. Kenny will know, the Port of Waterford has a railway service directly to the port with a lift-on lift-off service, which is important for the sustainability and viability of the port and getting business to the port because lorries are not needed, the ships can berth and the cranes can lift directly from the ships onto the heavy freight train.  Again, that is an asset that we are under-utilising.  For the information of the committee, of all the freight transport that comes into Ireland through the UK landbridge from mainland Europe, over 80% of that goes through Dublin Port.  There is potential for both Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford, especially with the onset of Brexit where we will have to have more direct links with mainland Europe.  There are opportunities for these ports to expand and grow their services.  The infrastructure is already there and the railway is already there and the Port of Waterford is on side in trying to develop that business.  I am interested to know if Irish Rail has any deep engagements with the Port of Waterford to exploit those opportunities to increase its business and to increase the business of the Port of Waterford.  The Port of Waterford estimated that there is the potential to treble or even quadruple the current business by using the lift-on lift-off rail service at the Port of Waterford if we can get direct access from the EU and access through the UK landbridge.</p><p> I know I have raised a lot of issues but most of them are about improving and enhancing rail services in the south east of the country, which is identified for substantial growth under Project Ireland 2040.  I want to see infrastructure being put in place ahead of that growth and to attract new users.  I am interested to hear the responses of the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019052900002#F00200"><p>On the change of the fleet, outside of the Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Belfast routes, on the national network we predominantly operate our passenger services with diesel railcars.  They are not locomotive-hauled, they have integral diesel engines in each carriage.  That is a relatively young fleet.  Thankfully, before the economic crisis hit we were in a position to replace the old orange trains which members will remember, which dated from the 1960s to the early 1980s, with these trains.  We have 234 carriages in that fleet, which is our largest single fleet and that is the fleet to which we will be adding 41 carriages with those negotiations at the moment with the supplier.  I alluded to the point earlier that as an asset, a train lasts a long time.  It is not like a car or other vehicles in terms of their renewal.  It is a good 30-year-plus asset in any circumstance.</p> <p>  We are working with Rolls-Royce MTU in trialling a hybrid unit on those trains in order that they would become diesel hybrid trains in due course.  That would allow us to both reduce the cost of fuel and to reduce the emissions by a third.  Those trials are ongoing.  Ultimately, we are using some of those trains in the commuter belt because it is answering a need that we have right now, whereas they are more suited to intercity travel overall.  As new trains come into our fleet, it will allow us to make sure they get to their more natural service and it will allow us to increase the frequency and capacity of individual services.</p> <p>  We also need to look at the line speeds around the network.  It is fair to say that while we have competitive times, when the motorway network was developed it eroded the competitiveness.  We are carrying out certain works and in recent years we have done much work on the main Dublin-Cork route, off which branch the Waterford, Limerick and Tralee routes, so it is the route that impacts more directly on most intercity customers.  That has given us some moderate benefits in journey time by addressing the trackbed.  It is something we need to move on with and we need to start re-railing on those lines.  As well as that being a necessary safety investment, we could also yield journey time improvements from that.</p> <p>  Speed and frequency will be huge in attracting new users but we must also make the service easier to use.  I am probably pre-empting Senator Kieran O'Donnell because I know he is a regular customer of ours.  I refer to issues such as Wi-Fi and the ease of doing business on board.  We are in the process of renewing the Wi-Fi equipment on board the services because it can be a productive time when customers are on board.</p> <p>  We have completely recast our promotional fares and our booking system, which gives alternatives in flexibility.  We all know that when we are looking at airline websites some people will just go for the low fare and the limited flexibility that they must travel on that service.  Some people, business people in particular, need greater flexibility so we have three major ticketing types now to meet those different markets, namely, low fare; semi-flexible and fully flexible.  We will soon begin the process of introducing barcode ticketing.  Thankfully, after the under-investment we will now be able to do these things such as moving on from the collection of tickets at machines by having tickets on mobile phones.</p> <p>  On Waterford station, I have in-laws in Tramore so I hope for the usual dry days because they always tell me to walk across the bridge before they collect me at the far side because of the access into Plunkett Station so I am well familiar with the point the Senator is making there.  We are very much engaged with the north quays development.  It is not a matter of us answering when asked.  We see the huge benefit that is there.  Right now, as the Senator knows, post the rockfall which was experienced, we have a single track and a single platform operational.  We have quite an old signalling system and that will need to be upgraded over the next five to ten years as well.  We are looking at having double track alignments with two new platforms into the north quays site, which would integrate bus transport as well.  That track layout would also provide for improved connectivity for rail freight to the Port of Waterford.</p> <p>  In Rosslare Europort, we are a roll-on roll-off port.  The Senator mentioned that the Port of Waterford is a lift-on lift-off port so we can be complimentary to each other and Rosslare Europort, the Port of Waterford and New Ross Port Company have been working together.  Brexit is obviously key.  I am sure we would all agree that it seems there is a great amount of doubt again about what the ultimate outcome of that will be.  We already have the various agencies operational at Rosslare Europort and they were ready for March 29 and there will be improved road access to Rosslare Europort for roll-on, roll-off.</p> <p>  We had a Ballina-Waterford container business but unfortunately the operator of that discontinued it.  The volumes were not resulting for the operator but we continue to operate wood pulp from the west of Ireland to Waterford.  While we have scope to grow now and are working with the exporters and others to identify those opportunities, for Plunkett Station the works and investments associated with the north quays site will allow for greater exploitation of that again into the future.  We will be deepening our co-operation with the Port of Waterford and New Ross Port Company because the three ports effectively mean there is a network of ports in the south east that can meet the needs of business and the needs of those business operating through our ports, for whom connectivity to both mainland Europe and to Britain is so crucial.</p></speech>

On the north quays, it is such a critical piece and an opportunity to develop infrastructure, not just for the city but for the entire south-east region.  I understand that planning permission is due to be sorted in the next few months and a private developer is working with the council to develop the site as well.  This is something that is going to happen in a number of months, it is not just a plan or something that is sitting out there.  Aside from Irish Rail's liaison and co-operation, is there a funding ask from Irish Rail on this or is it something with which it will be approaching the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport separately?  As I said, if the north quays project was not happening, Irish Rail would have to invest in Plunkett Station anyway due to the issues that are there with the track in its current location because of the rockfall from the cliff and the fact that it is only a one-platform station, as Mr. Kenny said.</p><p>Investment is required there anyway.  Will Irish Rail be setting aside the proposed investment and putting it along with additional investment to relocate the station?  It is a substantial ask and is a substantial project.</p><p> I do not want it being said that Irish Rail is a problem when the others are moving on.  It is important that all stakeholders work together.  This is an opportunity for Irish Rail.  There will be growth in the population.  We expect growth in tourism in the south east.  I believe we can attract far more users to that service once we have an adequate train station and an adequate integrated transport hub, which is the plan.  That will happen in a number of months rather than years.  I am keen to hear as much as Mr. Kenny can tell me about the plans for the funding of that project.</p></speech>

It has been indicated that it would cover the integrated transport hub, as well as including railway facilities.  We have been setting out what our current operations are and what the benefits will be.  As the Senator has said, there is considerable benefit to us.  Ultimately, we will seek the funding source if it is the case that it is not within the footprint of the North Quays development.  Clearly it is and this is probably on account of good planning heretofore.  It is something we have seen in other parts of the country.  Where public transport infrastructure is provided, it benefits the development materially.  In turn, the development significantly helps to fund that situation.  That is certainly the basis on which we are progressing as we recognise the benefit to our services from that integration.</p> <p>  We are looking at all aspects of it.  I mentioned the track layout, platforms, freight access, signalling and rock cutting in terms any necessary stabilisation that needs to take place there, as well as the alleviation of flooding.  We have done some works, thankfully.  In recent years we have seen a reduction in flooding but with climate issues we have to stay ahead of it.  We know that from Ballycar.  That is an area where we have increased the track level in years past.  Yet, only a short number of years ago, notwithstanding repeated increases in the track level, we had our worst-ever flooding.  We have to stay ahead of that.</p></speech>

I wish to compliment Irish Rail on putting out that expression of interest to the global manufacturers of trains.  It is ambitious and I wish to compliment Irish Rail on that.  It is encouraging to hear that the expression has been made to help move into a greener form of transport in the country.</p> <p>  My next comment is on ticketing.  Is it possible to get a through ticket using Luas and the bus services?  Is that an area where Irish Rail could do more work, especially if we include through tickets to Northern Ireland?</p> <p>  I welcome the improvement works in Ennis.  They will improve accessibility, especially for people with disabilities.  Planning permission was recently granted by Clare County Council to Irish Rail to improve services at Ennis Station.  This is very much welcomed.  Can Mr. Barry give an overview of the works planned?  Can he outline a timeframe for the delivery of this important project?</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the need for a rail spur to Shannon Airport.  I have put forward the suggestion that a light rail service would be beneficial for Shannon Airport and for the region.  It would also provide connectivity to the national rail line.  A short light rail service should be looked at between Shannon Airport and Sixmilebridge.  A total of 10,000 people work in the industrial estate in Shannon.  It is a major location for people and there is a great deal of employment there.  Sixmilebridge is an expanding population centre too.  There are opportunities there.  Would Irish Rail give consideration to putting together a feasibility study on that?  Mr. Kenny might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  Irish Rail had some difficulties yesterday in Heuston Station with signalling.  Can Mr. Kenny give an update on that issue?</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Kenny, the Irish Rail chief executive, Jim Meade, and Mr. Hedderly for their continuous engagement with this committee.  I look forward to Mr. Kenny answering the questions that I posed.</p></speech>

We also have the city centre add-on, as it is known.  This covers the Luas and Dublin Bus services into the city.  There is a wider Northern Ireland ticketing option.  It does not only operate through the Enterprise service.  There is through ticketing there.  We do not have the full suite in some ticketing machines but we are expanding the number of tickets through our machines that are available at all times.  Full integration is a different question.  In urban areas, Leap has been established and it covers all modes.  The investment and further expansion of Leap is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority.</p></speech>

Does Irish Rail have ideas to try to improve the service there?</p></speech>

We are increasing the scope of the ticketing available.  Certainly, our most popular cross-route tickets are available.  Ultimately we want to get to a situation where point A to point B anywhere on the rail network will be covered.</p> <p>  The question of buses would probably need the involvement of the National Transport Authority, as would the question of all-mode ticketing, in particular because we have a range of licensed non-commercial services and licensed commercial services.  Not all operate under the same model.  The authority would need to ensure that where Luas or other bus operators come into play there is fair allocation.  A considerable amount of back-office work would have to take place.  That is why the NTA is the lead agency on that question.  We have worked and successfully delivered in several parts of the country with the through-ticketing option.  Anyway, I certainly take the point in terms of making website ticketing more comprehensive to cover all those cross routes and routes into Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  The stations in Ennis and Carlow have been in our investment programme for accessibility improvements needed on the national network.  They have been top of our list for some time.  Again, the NTA has provided for increased funding for accessibility works.  The planning permission is there.  I will get the precise timescales of the work but it will start later this year.  We will see improvement delivered.  It is crucial that as we invest generally, the service is accessible to everyone in society as much as possible.  We had considerable progress in this area up to 2007 and 2008, but unfortunately the progress has not been what we would have wanted in the interim.  Anyway, it is coming through again and it being done on a prioritised basis.  We target the stations where the works were not done before and where we have the highest throughput.  Ennis and Carlow are progressing this year.</p> <p>  The suggestion for Shannon is not included in the current national development plan.  The NDP provides for several studies, including the western rail corridor, which we have mentioned.  The plan also provides for Navan to be assessed.  The commitment is in place for 2021 there.  It also provides for an examination of high-speed rail options rather than upgrading the existing lines.  The last major study for a Shannon link was probably ten years ago.  It did not approach the cost-benefits needed.  Ultimately, for there to be another study it would need to be funded.  Sometimes there is a view that we have a discretionary pot and we can choose to pursue certain projects, but we would need funding to be specifically provided or it would have to be required of us to do such a study.</p><p>It was a long way from being viable at the time, at the height of the Celtic tiger.  I do not have anything more explicitly positive to offer the committee in that regard, but I will engage with our strategic planning manager and provide updated information on the issue.</p><p> On the issues at Heuston Station yesterday, first I must apologise to those affected.  We experienced very significant disruption.  We do a lot of ongoing maintenance work and upgrades of our existing signalling equipment.  Investment will be made in a major national train control centre.  The problem occurred at 5.38 a.m. yesterday.  As morning peak services start to ramp up, it is one of the worst times of the day to lose signalling control on all lines to Heuston Station.  There was a software issue.  Upgrades of the equipment used were being carried out and there was a software fault.  The company with which we are working in installing the new equipment brought in specialists.  On the issue of resilience, we were able to have our back-up local control panels staffed by 7.40 a.m.  I do not want to say there is necessarily anything positive about what occurred, but it tested our resilience.  The issue was resolved yesterday afternoon.  We kept the local control panel staff on standby yesterday evening and this morning to ensure we would have people to deal with any recurrence of the issue.  We are satisfied that it was resolved yesterday afternoon.  All I can do is apologise to those who were affected by it.</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny knows me well as I have contacted him many times.  I regularly travel to Dublin on the Limerick to Dublin railway line.  I am a great believer in rail, which is my favourite mode of transport.  I will begin with the positives.  </p> <p>  Irish Rail has improved through the years I have used it.  Punctuality is exemplary; staff service is very good and value for money and the range of tickets available have improved considerably, particularly if one books online in advance.  Broadband coverage has improved but not sufficiently.  Mobile coverage is disastrous, as I have mentioned to Mr. Kenny many times.  I cannot understand why we do not have proper mobile coverage on trains.  One cannot hold a telephone call that lasts more than two or three minutes.  That is unacceptable in the modern age.  One could survive with the current broadband service, but one cannot function with the current level of mobile coverage.  If there was proper mobile coverage and enhanced broadband, rail would become the preferred mode of transport.  Irish Rail offers first class tickets, but it could offer business class tickets, of which there would be a significant take-up.  Travellers would be able to get work done during the journey.  However, business travellers cannot use the train because the mobile coverage is so poor.</p> <p>  Another issue I have raised with Mr. Kenny is that the offering of food is not broad enough.   The same food that was available on trains 20 years ago is offered - a sandwich and a cup of tea.  A little diversity is required.  Travelling by train is not conducive to maintaining a healthy diet.</p> <p>  What has Irish Rail done to enhance mobile coverage?  The frequency of service is excellent and I have no issues in that regard.  The number of people using trains has increased considerably in recent times.  The big issue for me is mobile coverage, which is disastrous.  We talk about bringing in various features on trains.  If the mobile coverage issue is sorted out, the demand for investment will follow because many more people will want to use train services.  What is the story on mobile coverage?  I have raised the issue on many occasions with Mr. Kenny, sometimes out of frustration while I am on the train.</p></speech>

I am grateful that he has noted the improvements in service.  Our on-board Wi-Fi which the Senator noted has improved is based on an aggregation of mobile signals.  I will not ask who is the Senator's mobile provider or whether there is any issue-----</p></speech>

We will improve the equipment on trains to enhance the Wi-Fi, but, ultimately, mobile coverage on trains is based on the mobile networks.</p></speech>

In many cases, I know where mobile coverage will drop.  If one is going through hills or valleys, it will disappear, but once one gets into an open area it is fine.  If I have to make a phone call, I know where to make it to avoid being cut off.  It is a hobby horse of mine because I passionately believe proper mobile coverage along the Dublin to Limerick line which is also the Cork line between Limerick Junction and Dublin would revolutionise the train as the preferred mode of transport.  On some trains, I get from Colbert Station in Limerick to Heuston Station in two hours, which is phenomenal.  One could not do that by car.  Has Irish Rail looked at this issue?  Could it link up with the mobile operators to investigate what must be done to sort out the problem of mobile coverage?  Will Mr. Kenny commit to Irish Rail doing so?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the commitment Mr. Kenny gave to my colleague, which I welcome.  The Shannon to Limerick railway line has long been in the offing.  Deputy Carey and I were members of the mid-west regional authority together and pushed this matter at the time.  A feasibility study of the line was carried out by the authority in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Mr. Kenny is probably aware of it and I am assuming it is purely an inadvertent oversight in his statement.  He referred to Cork and Waterford.  However, Limerick currently has a Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transportation plan under way and I hope that as part of that when Irish Rail makes its contribution it would speak about it.  Apart from the commuting aspect, and there is already a rail line in Sixmilebridge and Cratloe, having a rail line from Shannon to Limerick would allow Shannon Airport to enhance the offering with regard to both Galway and Limerick.  There would be spur from a line.  Perhaps Irish Rail would examine that.  I believe it is a major element of infrastructure that is being missed.  If one flies on any of the Ryanair flights worldwide the airports might be an hour from the destination but there is a rail link into the city.  We would like to have the same for Limerick.  Galway would benefit as well.  Can we take it that Mr. Kenny might consider that?  Jacobs Engineering Ireland Limited has been appointed consultants on it by Limerick City and County Council, which is the lead authority along with Clare County Council.  It is the first time Limerick and Shannon have been linked as a metropolitan area.  I assume Mr. Kenny is aware of that so can we take it-----</p></speech>

The reason Cork was mentioned specifically was that it had been published since our previous appearance before the committee.  We are very clear that there is a greater role for rail not only in Dublin, because people focus on congestion in Dublin, but in all our cities, as well as interlinking.  That is why the CMADTS and its equivalents will be so important in terms of development of services.  Ours is one of the agencies that will be statutorily required to be consulted.  We will outline where the opportunities are, which is everything from additional passing loops to allow for more frequency on services to whether there are opportunities for new stations-----</p></speech>

Mr. Kenny spoke about balanced regional development.  There is a need for a high speed rail line from Limerick to Dublin.  There is no reason that one should not be able to get from Limerick to Dublin in an hour.  What would be involved in the infrastructure for something like that to happen?  If we are talking about proper and balanced regional development, we do not want Dublin to be so congested.  I do not have a problem with people living in Limerick and commuting to Dublin to work.  I get the train from Limerick and I see many people are commuting, particularly from Thurles.  Limerick is just a little further away.  It is about linking the regions.  Where does a high speed rail service between Limerick and Dublin fit within Irish Rail's strategic plan?</p></speech>

One is talking about 2040 to be completely emission free.  However, if that full order of electric trains comes in by the end of the national development plan, 80% of journeys on our network would be on electric power trains.  Ultimately it is what is generating the electricity.  The trend in electricity providers is towards more sustainable and emissions free generation but the direct emissions on 80% of journeys at that time will be gone.  We will also have reduced the emissions of intercity journeys by a third because we are going to make those trains hybrid as well.  Once we get the very urgent short-term extra intercity rail cars our strategy is that they are the last diesel trains we ever order.</p></speech>

I always look at speeds.  One can get the 5 p.m. train from Dublin on Thursday and it gets one to Limerick in under two hours.  If it was cut down to an hour and a half that brings it within daily commuting times.  What is the timeframe for getting to the dual carriageway with the rail lines?  Will that include the Limerick Junction rail link?</p></speech>

I am grateful to have the opportunity to attend this session of the joint committee to discuss the Department&rsquo;s work on its statement of strategy and in the implementation its investment programme under Project Ireland 2040 - Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage.  I look forward to the discussion with and hearing the views of committee members.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by Mr. Conor Falvey, the assistant secretary with responsibility for our culture programme which encompasses culture policy, oversight of the national cultural institutions, Culture Ireland, the Creative Ireland programme, the audio-visual action plan, among other areas.  Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; is the assistant secretary with responsibility for the heritage division which has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Monuments Service, the Heritage Council, national parks and nature reserves, as well as supporting all aspects of the built and natural heritage.  Representing the Gaeltacht and island communities, as well as promoting the use of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht, are M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Conaire, priomhoifigeach, an Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht; Sorcha de Br&uacute;ch, priomhoifigeach, Oile&aacute;in, An Foras Teanga agus Logainmneacha; and Se&aacute;n Mac Eoin, priomhoifigeach, Gaeltacht agus Plean&aacute;il Teanga.</p> <p>  The Department plays a key role in protecting, preserving and promoting Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language, built and archaeological heritage, as well as its biodiversity and unique landscapes.  It encompasses a wide range of functions from support for the arts and culture, conservation and safeguarding our biodiversity to supporting sustainable communities.  Its remit also extends to Ireland&rsquo;s global identity and national well-being, as well as fostering enterprise and tourism development.  The work of the Department speaks directly to our understanding of ourselves and our national identity.  It anchors us in our past, through the safeguarding of our cultural, built and archaeological heritage; gives context to our present, through the Department&rsquo;s decade of centenaries programme; and sets out the values we want to protect in our future, through the national heritage plan - Heritage 2030, among others, to include the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  The Department is also a key driver of well-being across government, through opportunities to experience and participate in arts and culture; engage with our natural environment in national parks; and appreciate our language and heritage, including the islands.  It occupies a unique space within government with its very broad policy and programme remit, as well as having a presence in every part of the country in national parks and monuments, cultural centres, schools and local authorities and through our direct involvement with Gaeltacht and island communities.</p> <p>  The Department delivers on its broad remit to support and promote culture and creativity in Ireland in partnership with the eight national cultural institutions, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland.  It works closely with the Heritage Council and Waterways Ireland to protect and safeguard our built, archaeological and natural heritage.  In supporting and sustaining Gaeltacht communities the Department works with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, while also partnering with Foras na Gaeilge in promoting the Irish language more generally.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga which has a statutory role to play in safeguarding the Irish language also falls under the aegis of the Department.</p> <p>  In our work we engage directly with communities across the country, through the work of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Monuments Service and our colleagues in the Gaeltacht division.  We work directly with and through local authorities, most recently to deliver a national programme to foster creative communities.</p> <p>  Our statement of strategy which covers the period 2018 to 2020, inclusive, was prepared in accordance with the Public Service Management Act, following the appointment of the Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan, to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We are now just over one year into its implementation.  The Department's overarching mission is to promote, nurture and develop Ireland&rsquo;s arts, culture and heritage; to support and promote the use of the Irish language; and to facilitate the development of the Gaeltacht and the islands.  Our core functions are to provide policy and funding support in the development of the arts, culture and creativity, including cultural infrastructure development; to provide for oversight of Ireland&rsquo;s national cultural institutions; to protect and preserve Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage in line with national and EU legislation, national policies and strategies and to support sustainable development; to preserve our built heritage as part of the regeneration of cites, towns, villages and the countryside in accordance with the principles and values of Project Ireland 2040, and to protect our unique archaeological heritage.</p><p>We also assist in the sustainable development of island communities, including through the provision of transport links.  We promote North-South co-operation through the work of Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.  These functions are translated into action through a number of policies and strategies, including Culture 2025, the audio-visual action plan, the 20-year strategy for the Irish language and the associated five-year action plan, the tourism interpretive master plan for national parks, the national biodiversity action plan and Heritage 2030, which is still at consultation stage.</p><p> To deliver on this policy framework, we structure our work across three policy divisions, namely, culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht, which are supported by a corporate division.  Each division is led by an assistant secretary or director and we meet weekly as a management board to oversee and monitor our progress.  Each division has responsibility for a particular high-level goal or goals under the statement of strategy.  Goal A which falls to our culture division provides that the Department will support and develop engagement with and in the arts, culture and creativity by individuals and communities, thereby enriching individual and community well-being, and promote Ireland's arts and culture globally.  Goal B relates to the work of the heritage division.  It sets out to conserve, protect, manage and present the built and natural heritage for its intrinsic value and as an inspiration to creativity and environmental appreciation, as well as a support to local communities, regional economic development and sustainable employment.  Goals C and D rest with the Gaeltacht division and provide that we will support the use of the Irish language throughout Ireland, strengthen its use as the principal community language of the Gaeltacht and facilitate the sustainable development of island communities.  Goal E which involves the Gaeltacht and heritage divisions provides that we will work to promote North-South co-operation, particularly through the work of An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland.</p><p> At the core of the delivery of these strategies will be the development and enhancement of cultural, linguistic and heritage infrastructure under the Department's &euro;1.2 billion programme of investment, Project Ireland 2040.  Other priority areas for the Department are the delivery of supports for the arts and culture, including the audio-visual sector, the delivery of the Creative Ireland programme to promote individual, community and national well-being and the completion of the decade of centenaries commemorative programme.</p><p> In the heritage area we are in the process of developing a new national heritage plan, Heritage 2030, for protecting, preserving and promoting national heritage.  We have just completed a comprehensive consultation process and will be developing the plan in due course.  Our activities to promote the Irish language will continue to focus on implementing the five-year action plan for progressing the 20-year strategy for the language.</p><p> Project Ireland 2040 represents a once in a generation opportunity for the Department to protect, preserve and enhance cultural, linguistic and heritage infrastructure.  It has the potential to be a transformative investment, conserving our unique culture and heritage and enhancing opportunities to experience it, while also stimulating tourism and local economies.  The Department's investment plan under Project Ireland 2040 is an important vehicle in delivering sustainable communities, valuing the built heritage through regenerating town centres and creating spaces for people to express themselves artistically or through the Irish language, while also providing direct support for the development of local enterprise.  It has also been transformative for the Department in bringing together for the first time all aspects of our heritage, namely, cultural, linguistic, the built and natural, under a single programme of investment with an holistic vision.  A cornerstone of the Department's investment programme is the &euro;460 million that has been set aside for the regeneration of the national cultural institutions.  This year we have made progress on a number of key projects.  We will see completion of phase 1 of the National Library of Ireland and the commencement of subsequent phases.  There has also been significant progress made in the National Archives project which will complete the decanting of its collections this month to facilitate the construction phase.  I understand we will see the project tender completed this year.</p><p> The Department continues to progress other projects through the appraisal and evaluation stages of the project life cycle, including the Natural History Museum and the Crawford Gallery in Cork.  We also support the development and enhancement of regional cultural infrastructure through a number of schemes and initiatives.  In terms of our culture and creativity programme, we have a major new strategy for the audio-visual industry which is guiding the &euro;200 million Project Ireland investment in expanding this vital creative industry.  This year alone, the Department will provide funding support of more than &euro;16 million for Screen Ireland to deliver the strategy and support the Government's ambition to develop Ireland as a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.</p><p> We are looking forward to the launch in September of Galway 2020 as the European Capital of Culture.  Although it has been through some difficult times, a feature which is common to many capitals of culture, the programme will be ambitious and commence in late 2019.  </p><p> A further strand of our programme under Project Ireland is the investment of &euro;285 million over ten years in the built and natural heritage.  An important delivery vehicle for this investment is the tourism interpretative masterplan for key tourist sites and heritage amenities in the national parks in partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It will see us leverage our investment to maximise the value for money of projects throughout the parks and reserves network for the enjoyment of 4 million visitors every year.  We are also working closely with colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development in investing in a wide range of new trails and other visitor amenities in national parks and nature reserves.  In addition to work in national parks and wildlife reserves, we are working to deliver on commitments to protect the built heritage through the built heritage investment scheme and historic structures fund which leverage private funding, local authority structures and central government grants to protect the built heritage, while utilising local craft and construction resources.</p><p> The national planning framework under Project Ireland specifically recognised the importance of protecting unique Gaeltacht and island communities, underpinned by a funding provision of &euro;178 million to 2027.  In that regard, we are working to deliver key capital actions in the five-year action plan for the Irish language, while also supporting &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in fostering enterprise and supporting communities across the Gaeltacht.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will invest some &euro;10 million in these communities this year.  In addition, we are working in partnership with Dublin City Council, Conradh na Gaeilge and others to develop a flagship Irish language and cultural centre in Dublin city centre.  The project has recently completed its feasibility study stage and we are preparing to move to planning.</p><p> Over the lifetime of Project Ireland we will invest in a number of piers projects to enhance access to island communities.  These are complex projects that require significant planning in terms of environmental impacts, sustainable development and community engagement.  They are also some of the most complex in terms of construction, given their location and often challenging sea conditions.</p><p> That is just a snapshot of what we are seeking to deliver and progress throughout the year and into 2020.  We continue to work closely with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the overall management and oversight of the programme.  With the growing ambition for the Department under Project Ireland 2040, we need to ensure it is capable of delivering on these ambitions.  To that end, we have undergone an organisational capability review in the past six months.  The review process which was signalled in our statement of strategy and is part of a wider Civil Service renewal initiative has seen us look closely at our capabilities in demonstrating leadership in our sectors, developing policy and strategy and implementing and evaluating our work.  The review was undertaken by a team from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with our support, and overseen by an independent external review panel.  It is at the final stages of drafting and once finalised will be presented to the Government.  It has been a useful experience, one which will enable us to enhance the Department&rsquo;s capabilities to deliver on its statement of strategy.  Increasingly, it is clear just how broadly our work impacts on the lives of everyone in Ireland, as well as on how we view and present ourselves on a global stage.  With such a broad remit, our collaborative approach with the national cultural institutions and agencies, other Departments, North-South bodies, the public sector and the committee continues to be essential to the delivery of the high-level goals in our statement of strategy and Project Ireland  2040.</p></speech>

I also thank them for all of the great work they are doing.  I need to highlight a few things that need to be done in the vicinity of Killarney and the national park.</p><p>While the national park in Killarney is a massive attraction for the town, Kerry and the whole south of Ireland, there are issues which must be dealt with.  The primary issue is one of access.  Traffic queues and jams going through Killarney is a big issue.  I ask that the officials here would liaise with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, because as it stands the only access to the park out the Muckross Road is through the town.  There is no need for that to continue and I do not think it will.  Cars are parked on the national secondary road, starting at Kenmare Place in Killarney all the way out the Muckross Road, day in, day out, coming in and going out.  People from around the country, whether Limerick, Cork or elsewhere, must go halfway around Killarney town.  It is a major obstacle.  I fear that people will think it is not worthwhile to continue to Muckross House or out to the national park if they meet this blockage every time they try to go out there.  We ask that there be liaison with TII and that the link road or bypass, which was supposed to go ahead in 2004, be followed through, and that a road be built from Lissivigeen to Castlelough in Muckross.  I am highlighting this today because it has been put to me at various forums over the years I have represented the people of Killarney and south Kerry.  It is a major obstacle which needs to be addressed.  It must be taken on board by the highest level of Government.</p><p> While we are talking about roads, the issue of deer arises.  At this stage they are everywhere but the biggest numbers are in the national park.  There have been serious accidents at Ballydowney to the west of Killarney.  They are coming into the Demesne in Killarney town.  People are afraid of stags.  I have nothing against deer but there needs to be some way of ensuring that people who travel on our roads are safe.  We know that a woman with three young children was killed at Ballydowney because she swerved to avoid a deer.  That cannot and should not be allowed to be repeated.  I called in the D&aacute;il Chamber for the Army to undertake a cull, but there are other ways too.  In Canada and other places, perhaps in the Baltic countries, there is a system where if an animal is coming on to the road, that a sensor picks it up and a light will flash to alert any oncoming motorists.  I have not done any research on that but the facility is there.  Killarney is surrounded by deer.  Some 18,600 vehicles go through that road daily, which is only one part of the town, and people's lives are being jeopardised.

The width and capacity of the paths need to be increased.  A growing number of cyclists and walkers are using these paths, which is laudable, but they do not have the capacity.

It cannot go into it at all.  I am asking the National Parks and Wildlife Service to see to this because people are driving on it and walking, but it is a hazard and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Another matter about which I am very concerned is the burning that took place in the national park this year.  Some years ago, when I was on Kerry County Council, I asked that the national parks would ensure that they would have fire belts all around their property where possible and to divide properties in their ownership so that if a fire started in one place, it would be prevented from spreading elsewhere.  This is only common sense.  I do not think this has been addressed properly.  We understood that like the North of Ireland, people would be allowed to burn all through the month of March but this year, the Minister, in her wisdom, said she would not allow burning in March.  I am sure she must not have gone to Kerry because what people in Dublin do not realise is that in Kerry, we had a great deal of rain in February.  As March progressed, it got dryer and that is when the fires started.  People in Dublin need to realise that it rains in Kerry on far more days than it rains in Dublin and we need to have the month of March to have controlled burning.  Thousands of acres were burned in the last episode.  Much of it started inside the national park, and no one knows how.  Those issues must be addressed.  I appeal to the Minister that in future years she consider that we get more rain in Kerry, in Killarney and Mangerton, where these fires start ------    </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that Killarney National Park is one of the oldest of Ireland's national parks.  I believe it was started in 1932 and along with Wicklow National Park it gets almost 1.5 million visitors per year.  I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; to address the details of the issues raised</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.663" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019052900002#F00300"><p>I counted seven questions but if I forget to answer any of them, I ask that the Deputy Healy-Rae remind me.</p> <p>  I am very familiar with access and traffic in Killarney town.  Killarney has always been a bottleneck.  That is to some extent the price of success and it is also partially caused by the difficulty of getting around the town.   In the context of the existing bypass on to the N72, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is very co-operative about ceding part of the demesne to the bypass.  We are very aware of the problems.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that the appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding the proposed revamp of the car park at Muckross House has been overturned and we will proceed with the project.  We are in constant contact with the local authority on traffic management issues and we are acutely conscious of them.  As the Chairman pointed out, our remit is not around the extension but there is no doubt that we will be consulted on it.  We are acutely aware of the importance of getting visitors safely to and from the national park.  We will continue our dialogue with the local authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland with regard to dealing with this long-running traffic management issue.  Deputy Healy-Rae will be well aware that Killarney is an absolute bottleneck but we will certainly do our bit around that.</p> <p>  On the deer issue, fencing Killarney National Park, our largest national park, is not feasible and I know the Deputy is not suggesting that we do so.  We have a new management regime in place in Killarney.  We have taken a very serious look at the deer population.  More than 270 deer have been culled this year.  We have to be very careful to achieve a balance in this regard.  There are reasons for doing so related to animal husbandry, public safety and so on.  The cull is larger than in previous years for a variety of reasons.  The demesne is part of the national park and the deer can access it.  The Deputy is absolutely right-----</p></speech>

Deer are wild animals which will roam.  Our responsibility extends to the wild animals within the national park.  We take our animal husbandry role as seriously as we take public safety issues.  Anybody who approaches a stag, particularly a rutting stag, is asking for trouble and they should not do so.  The Deputy will be well aware that we have erected signs to that effect.  If there is a technological solution, we will look certainly at it.  We are looking at a variety of technology interventions in the area of fire prevention, to which I will return, and habitat and species management.  For the Deputy's information, we are working in a partnership with the Canadian authorities' administration of its national parks and we will ask it to share any technological solutions they might have.</p> <p>  We are very mindful of the dangers on the road.  I know the N72 very well.  It is a dangerous and narrow road that is built across some of the most scenic countryside in the country.  People need to exercise due care while travelling on the road.  We work with Kerry County Council on signage and speed calming and so on.  We will continue in our dialogue with Kerry County Council, the local chamber of commerce and others on raising awareness of the dangers of speeding or driving with undue care on the road.  We are conscious also of the numbers of foreign visitors who may not be used to driving on the left side of the road.  We will continue to address these public safety issues.</p> <p>  The roads within the national park are shared facilities and cyclists and walkers need to use them on that basis.  The Deputy will be aware that we have invested significantly in the roads in the park.  I acknowledge that the Deputy brings issues to our attention.  We are very grateful for his local knowledge in that respect.  I am not sure if the Mangerton Road is an accommodation road but I will examine the issue on the basis of the information the Deputy provided.  I doubt the potholes are of the size described because they would be craters.  We will certainly look at that issue and if we can find the wherewithal within our budget, we will seek to address it as best we can.  It must be borne in mind that we have relatively limited resources, which we try to use to best effect especially in the public facing parts of the infrastructure.  We will, however, take a look at Mangerton Road.</p> <p>  The burning was very regrettable.  To be clear, the area involved was 175 acres, not thousands of acres.  There are firebreaks within the park.  These fires are wildfires for a reason.  The direction in which they move depends on prevailing conditions.  At the time, the ground was extremely dry in Killarney.  It was a tinderbox.  Ironically, what arrested the spread of the fire were the efforts of our park colleagues, the fire brigade and the rhododendron because the rhododendron was fresh growth.  I say this without any hint of irony.  That is just a fact.  Every time there is a fire, we learn from it and invest in firebreaks based on the direction in which fires might move.  We recently deployed drone technology in Wicklow as a prevention measure and as a detection and fire management measure.  It was extremely useful because it was the weekend of an orange fire alert.  We will look to this technology.  The key message is awareness.  We are still trying to determine how the fire in Killarney started.  It could have caused by a cigarette that was disposed of carelessly or a barbecue.  We are currently investigating that.  We do not allow the lighting of fires in national parks for a very good reason.  It is very hard to police every hectare in an area of 87,000 ha., nor can we legislate for a lack of cop-on and common sense.  This is how we address the awareness issue.</p> <p>  On the extension of burning into March, the Deputy contributed to the lengthy debate on the Heritage Act.  The analysis conducted by the National Parks and Wildlife Service involved an analysis of meteorological data from every station in the country.  Based on this analysis, the advice given to the Minister was that rainfall in the six months of the open season for burning was significantly lower than the 30-year mean rainfall.  This applied across the country, including Kerry and I am very familiar with rainfall in the county.  The analysis conducted by our regional teams indicated that in the circumstances there was no justification this year for opening the pilot scheme that is allowed under the Heritage Act.  The Minister accepted that advice.  At the end of February, there were a significant number of wildfires in Wicklow and the Air Corps had to be called out to help quell them.  The fires caused a significant amount of damage.  This fed into the decision because it showed, as the Minister stated in the press release, that the extension of the season would not be wise in circumstances where ground conditions were extremely dry.  Our meteorological data from each of the stations showed that ground conditions were so dry that it was not advisable to extend the burning season into March last.  I accept that the weather changed in March but that was after the burning season in any case and farmers had the previous six months in which to burn.</p> <p>  The Heritage Act aligns the hedge-cutting regime with the road safety regime.  That is a very important change in that the road safety regime takes primacy.  In his contributions to the debate on the Bill, Deputy Healy-Rae made that point very well.  The provision in the Act addresses that long-standing anomaly, which needed to be addressed.  It also provides for the extension of the hedge-cutting season into August by allowing the trimming of a season's growth on the road-facing side of a hedge.  This is a welcome measure under a two-year pilot.  We are working on the regulations around that, which will be published for consultation quite soon.  I hope I have addressed the Deputy's questions.  I am not sure if I left anything out.</p></speech>

They referred to the audio-visual programme and I assume some funding in the Department's programme goes to film festivals.  I have to commend the officials if they are funding film festivals following the festival in Schull last week.  It was phenomenal for our local community.  It was slightly out of season and shows the benefit to the rural community when any funding goes to good use.  Schull was packed with all sorts of famous and ordinary people who came to enjoy the film festival for a week.  I know that the organisers have many plans for the future and they will, hopefully, come before the committee in September to explain where they have come from and where they are going.  I would appreciate if the Department would keep in close contact with them because this is one of the best rural film festivals in the country.</p></speech>

I commend any support that has been given to film festivals such as the one in Schull.  It will be interesting to hear what the organisers have to say when they come before us in the months ahead.</p> <p>  There are eight islands off the coast of my constituency in west Cork that I often visit.  They may be poorly populated but they need a voice.  I do not think I have ever heard anyone on an island giving out about the ferry service and I assume that is a product of the work of the Department.  We must call a spade a spade.  The service is good and provides great connectivity between the mainland and the islands and people are happy that is in place.  However, there are issues and I ask the Department to liaise better with the islands on them.  For example, the people of Sherkin Island are trying hard to have a chaperone.  We must encourage young people from the island to live there to continue its growth.  That is not happening at the moment.  The chaperone issue probably applies to every other island - Whiddy, Bere, Long, Cape Clear, Dursey, Heir or Garnish islands.  Parents must accompany their child on the ferry taking them to the mainland when the school on the island is closed.  There is no one to stay with the child, to get them on and off the ferry safely.  It means that one of those parents cannot work and, most likely, their only option is to leave the island and live on the mainland.  That is not good enough.  We should be promoting living on our islands.  I have brought this up repeatedly but it is a like a football that is being kicked from one side to another with each Department saying the issue is not its responsibility.  No one has come up with a solution.  There are special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools and there must be some kind of system available through the Department of Education and Skills whereby the equivalent of an SNA could accompany those children to and from the ferry in order that their parents can work and will continue to live on the island and keep the islands populated.</p> <p>  Another issue is social housing because people need houses on the islands in the same way as on the mainland.  There are great islands in west Cork, like Bere and Whiddy islands, which need new life.  The only way that can happen is through investment in social housing to give their young people an opportunity to have a home and live on the island, where they want to live.  These young people are being forced off the islands because there is no social housing.</p> <p>  The following is probably true of most islands throughout the country but I can only talk about west Cork.  There are community councils for the islands and I ask that an umbrella group be set up on these islands and that those representatives meet departmental officials once or twice a year to iron out issues and forge a closer relationship with the Department.  My brother ran in the local elections and I canvassed the islands because I wanted to hear what they had to say.  People on Bere Island told me they cannot get access to the mooring.  They want to come on and off their boats safely and they cannot access moorings when they sail to Castletownbere.  They are going through very dangerous situations to be able to access the mainland.  These are small but very important issues.</p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae has touched on the issue of burning.  I chaired a meeting when this passed through committee and my assumption was that the Minister would be totally out of order if he changed the recommendation of the committee.  My assumption was that burning would be allowed in March and that is what a majority of us here agreed to in a vote after everybody was entitled to debate the matter.  That has now changed.  If one lives on a farm in a rural community, especially in west Cork where the fog and dampness does not blow over until May or June, March is the only opportunity for a controlled burn.  That has been stopped by a Minister who received an instruction from this committee that burning was to go ahead but the powers-that-be have struck it off with a pen.  Someone in Met &Eacute;ireann seems to have more control than we have, from what I can gather.</p> <p>  Does the budget the Department has for the arts amount to &euro;363 million?  I stand to be corrected on that.  I was frustrated that 48 local, voluntary community projects in Cork did not secure funding from the rural regeneration fund.  I represent the people of Cork.  Some of those voluntary community groups spent &euro;500,000 in local community money to get projects off the ground and they were still told they were not going to get funding.  The Department has a budget in excess of &euro;300 million and it received money under rural regeneration funding.  I know the Department will say that it applied for that funding and is entitled to do with it as it wishes.  I accept that but the system is unfair.  The Department should not be tapping into other budgets where local, community, voluntary organisations have not a hope of competing because they do not have the expertise or funding to tick the boxes.  They are not getting any help from the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The Department will say that money was there to be taken up but where did the money go?  Did the Department get &euro;8 million?  I stand to be corrected on that but 48 voluntary groups in Cork received nothing.</p></speech>

We are subsidising ferry services to 14 different islands, including those to which Deputy Collins referred.  Since 2013, that has facilitated 2.5 million passenger journeys.  Clearly they are lifeline services and I am glad he has not had any complaints about them.  We are cognisant of the issue to which he referred and I will ask Ms de Br&uacute;ch to talk about that in a moment.</p> <p>  I am glad we are supporting the BA in visual arts on Sherkin Island with &euro;120,000 in funding.  </p> <p>  Social housing is not a matter for this Department but we work across Departments.  In fact, everything we do in our Department is through working with other Departments because our reach extends into everything.  We are happy to take up the issue of social housing with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about the rural regeneration fund.  The Department's budget is &euro;356 million and we received &euro;9 million in rural funding.  That is a policy issue for the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The funding we received was on the Gaeltacht and heritage side so it was all about investing in our national parks.  It is about rural communities, as is the case for much of what we do.  We also do a lot in respect of improving infrastructure in Gaeltacht areas.  We will put that funding to good use for citizens in rural areas, including Glengariff.  Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; might fill us in on the project there in a moment.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear Deputy Collins' feedback on the festivals.  The Department funds festivals directly, as does the Arts Council.  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g is a day of creativity for young people organised by Creative Ireland and there will be 700 events across the country next month.  We are very much seized of the idea of empowering local communities.

The Department has put up funding for an additional sailing in the morning but I understand there remains an issue in the afternoon.  There was a recent meeting involving Senator Lombard, the Department of Education and Skills and SIDS to try to come to a resolution.  I take the point entirely that it is a very important issue.  We are working very closely with the different community groups to try to improve the services and to keep them running as they are lifeline services.</p> <p>  The point about the umbrella organisation is well made.  There is Comhar na nOile&aacute;n and Comharchumann na nOile&aacute;n and the Department has met both in the past couple of weeks, along with the Minister of State.  We will attend meetings with them on a regular basis throughout the year to make sure we are aware of the issues that arise on the islands and can intervene as early as possible to offer solutions.  The inter-agency group in Cork, involving the county council, the HSE, the Department and all the players, functions very well.  It fosters healthy debate and meets on a quarterly basis when representatives come from all the islands to air their issues.  It is a model that we are trying to roll out in other counties that have islands.  It helps us to get in there early and come up with solutions.</p> <p>  We are also looking to develop a cross-cutting islands policy so that we can be an advocate for the island.  We are not responsible for things such as housing but we can advocate for the island communities and it is my role to do that.  I am glad to hear the members appreciate the work that is being done with the ferries.  The numbers on Sherkin Island, and some of the others, have gone up substantially in recent years and it is great to see this added life on the islands.</p></speech>

We have a fairly good track record at dealing on a cross-Government basis in other policy areas, particularly in respect of our engagement with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the issue of language in the Gaeltacht.  We are taking on extra staff to address the islands specifically.</p></speech>

These projects have to be rurally based.  There are 78 reserves and six national parks and they are the fulcrum of local social and economic activity.  They had been under-invested for a number of years but they are suited to the rural development fund because of their spin-offs.  We take an all-of-Government approach to this.  We are not competing with local communities and many projects are in partnership with local authorities.  If the Deputy would like us to work with communities in the vicinity of Glengariff, or any other national park or reserve, we would be very happy to do that.  The parks and reserves do not work or survive without engagement with the local community.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy for chairing the committee dealing with the Heritage Act 2018.  It was a lengthy process and, while I do not have the Act in front of me, I recall what section 7(1) states, which is that the Minister may make regulations to allow the burning of vegetation during such periods in the month of March, and in such parts of the country, as she may determine.  She made the decision after a public consultation and based on advice from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, as well as other information following the consultation of which met data were a part.  The Deputy will recall that there is a six-month open season for burning, from 1 September to 28 February.  There was a great deal of discussion regarding what would determine the approach and it was decided that the weather in the previous six months would be taken into account.  Last autumn, and in the early part of this year, the weather was exceptional.  People were walking around in tee shirts in February and the underground conditions were very dry, with fires in Wicklow and other parts of the country.  This had an impact on parks and it required a huge amount of effort by ourselves, the fire services and the Air Corps to bring the fires under control.</p> <p>  It is a pilot initiative and nothing the Minister has done is repugnant in any way to the decision the Oireachtas, and the committee, made.  When it comes around again next year, we will again consult with the public and Members of the Oireachtas before giving advice to the Minister on how to proceed.</p></speech>

It states that the Department would work with local authorities to identify such spaces.  I assume that spaces come under part 3 of the plan, which covers investment in local arts and cultural infrastructure nationwide.  I cannot see it coming under other commitments, such as in the financial area.  Has the Department started this process?  What work has been done?  Can our guests clarify whether the &euro;40 million includes the spaces to which I referred?  A building always seems to be the answer to everything but I hope the right questions are being asked.  Will the building be relevant in ten years' time?  What art forms will be practised in ten years' time?  How will they improve the financial well-being of artists who earn around &euro;10,000 per year?  A building should be the end point of a much deeper development.  The financial commitments identified in this plan could be greater and, given that artists are struggling to make ends meet, is it wise to not prioritise spaces as much as we prioritise national cultural institutions?  Some of the national institutions have not been looked after for a long period but they are all in Dublin.</p></speech>

The work they are doing is not just nice to have; we need to have it.  The National Library is in the process of moving its books out of the west wing, which will secure them from fire and damage, from a health and safety perspective.  Safeguarding the collections is important.  The Senator is right that we have not invested in this in decades because of the recession and other factors.  They need that investment.  We saw from the National Gallery of Ireland the inspiration that it provides when new spaces are opened, and the feeling of security for the collections.  Mr. Falvey might like to pick up on the artists' spaces.</p></speech>

That issue has come back strongly in feedback generally.  It came back in our Culture Ireland engagement with the art sector at the end of January as well.  There are fewer marginal spaces that artists can move into because of development and the growing economy.  It is more difficult now.  Dublin is probably the area where the issue is most acute.  It is worth seeing what we can do in the first instance in the city.</p> <p>  More generally on the national cultural institutions, through the Government capital and current funding is available, and the two are not always interchangeable.  The Department made a bid under the national development plan to maximise resources.  The outcome was a substantial programme for the national cultural institutions.  Historically, there has perhaps been some under-investment in the national cultural institutions.  There is a demand, as the Secretary General has identified.  In the National Library, for example, there has been a risk associated with the storage of the collection of books in the west wing, which has been well known for some time.  That has now been addressed by the development of the new storage in the old National College of Art and Design building adjacent to Leinster House.  In the coming weeks, as those materials migrate, the risk will be mitigated significantly.  There are other issues relating to everything from access for people with disabilities to the Natural History Museum to issues at the National Concert Hall in respect of the operation of that building that require to be addressed.  I would not like to characterise one as being necessarily at odds with the other.</p></speech>

Quite a number of arts centres were built under the access schemes in the late 1990s and into the 2000s.  The question was more around what the priority was and if &euro;40 million was enough to deal with emerging demands and the maintenance of those facilities.  In fairness, we are in something of an evolving situation with the rate at which economic growth is taking place.  The pressure on artists' spaces is an evolving and emerging issue to some degree.  There is scope within the national development plan to respond to those pressures.  We are engaged with the local authorities in the areas where those issues are most acute.</p></speech>

We have also increased funding to the Arts Council significantly in the past year.  The Minister secured a &euro;7 million increase in its funding.  Money that goes to the Arts Council goes to artists.  It is another piece of the jigsaw in terms of supporting artists but we are cognisant of the issues in urban areas particularly, the pressure on buildings generally and the impact it has on artists.</p></speech>

It will not do anything to address security in people's lives.  The capital funding is an opportunity to offset some of the costs and pressures on people.  The negative effect of not having creative people in our city centres is well documented.  There is creative flight; I am seeing friends go to Berlin or London.  More could be done.  Political priorities have to be set for the period up to 2027.  I do not see artists' spaces as being prioritised with the likes of the cultural institutions.</p> <p>  I will move on to the hedgerow conversation that has been going on over the past six weeks.  There have been high-profile hedgerow cutting cases which led to destruction before cutting was restricted under the Heritage Act.  I refer to cuttings in Offaly performed by Irish Rail, on the N7 performed by Kildare County Council, and vegetation cutting in Trinity College, Dublin.  The protection of national heritage and biodiversity and conserving our natural and built heritage are commitments from the Department in this plan.  Considering that all of the cases I mention were performed by State bodies, possibly outside of the law, is the Department aware of them and will action be taken?</p></speech>

They are being investigated.  We are in discussions with the bodies involved.  I cannot go any further than that at this stage.  There may be very good, valid safety reasons that these works were undertaken.  They are being looked into at the moment.</p></speech>

We had the copyright Bill back in the Seanad.  I accepted an amendment from the Department deleting an amendment I had previously had accepted in the Chamber relating to a digital deposit scheme.  The witnesses spoke about safeguarding collections being a priority.  There does not seem to be much urgency from the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  I am constantly told it is the remit of either the officials or the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  Can I have an update on the digital deposit scheme?  We are losing our digital memory very fast and most web pages disappear within 100 days.  We are losing our national memory.  I am anxious that a lead is not being taken on the issue.</p></speech>

I can get an update on that for the Senator.  In terms of digitalisation generally, that legislation is not ours but there is a fund under the national development plan for digitisation which is aimed primarily at national collections or other projects in terms of cultural content.  That is about promoting access and engagement and providing opportunities for people to engage with national collections who may not be able to make the physical journey to visit a national cultural institution in Dublin.  I will get the Senator an update on the role of the National Library in that matter.</p></speech>

This makes it less of a Dublin cultural institution and opens it up to the rest of the country and the rest of the world.</p><p>The National Archives received &euro;120,000.  Everybody is aware of what we did with the census data and the major success that was, apart from preserving what is there.  The Crawford Art Gallery in Cork received &euro;18,000 for digitisation and the Church of Ireland representative church body library received &euro;100,000.  The Irish Traditional Music Archive received &euro;100,000 and the Contemporary Music Centre received &euro;20,000.

The sum of &euro;10 million for digitisation is a minuscule amount in comparison with what is required, given the scale of the amount of material involved.  Approximately 95% of museums' material is in storage and has never been digitised.  We do not even know what is there or what has gone missing.  There is value in putting this online, available or at least recorded in some way.  I appeal that we do as much with the national collections as possible.  I acknowledge the fund is there over the period of the strategy.  I have been trying to get the Minister to fast-track the publication of the census in advance of 2026 for a range of reasons.  It is not the only relevant collection and every national institution has a wealth of material that it wants to share with the world.  We have the opportunity to do it.  I know this takes much money and there is only a certain amount of expertise in the country but it is a bugbear of mine.</p> <p>  I have many other questions but the hedgerows and the roads of Killarney took the time today.

With the 2011 census and earlier census data, a project of "semi-digitisation" already had been done and this made the process much easier.  We have to go right back to the drawing board for the 1996 data.</p></speech>

There was a 1911 census and nothing else until 1926, leaving a 15-year gap.  With regard to the decade of centenaries, I have argued that these data could be made available.  It is in the lap of the Minister because of the 100-year rule.  Given the interest stirred up by the decade of centenaries and the major interest in one of the more successful digitisation projects dealing with pension records, more families will look to their own heritage and genealogy.  Much is being done online now, which also helps.  We can look at the number of hits on these sites from abroad to see how this is a tourism resource, aside from being an historical and genealogical resource for us here.  The material can encourage people to come to Ireland and find out where this, that and the other happened.  I will publish slightly changed legislation in the next week or so to try to encourage the Minister to bypass the 100-year rule.  In the past it was suggested that the period should be 75 years and this was approved but then ignored by the Seanad.</p></speech>

There is a proposal to reconstruct as much of the archive records that were lost, as 700 years of material were blown up on 30 June 1922.  It is a very exciting project but it is still at an appraisal stage.  It offers potential, both in partnership with the National Archives of the UK and the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland in the current context with a North-South and east-west dimension.  There are many positive elements and they can go to a great many sources to explore for duplicates of records that could be recreated digitally and made accessible as part of the commemorations programme.  It is a recommendation in the advice that has been accepted by the Government and is subject to appraisal now.</p></speech>

I have heard Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g advertised quite a lot nationally and it is wonderful to see.  Are the witnesses confident the professional artists taking part will receive a professional fee for their expertise?  I heard a figure of approximately 700 projects and that is really important.  Will the witnesses speak about the Irish involvement in the Venice Biennale?  Is there any collaborative or conversational relationship with the North of Ireland show in Venice as well?  Is the work in silos or is there any sort of collaboration?</p> <p>  We spoke a little about film festivals and there is some nice literature.  To get parochial, what is the departmental involvement with the Clones film festival?  The Market House in Castleblayney has been very much in the headlines.  It is a building of huge significance, both in historic, cultural and heritage terms.  It was used as a signature piece for the architectural Biennale in Venice as well but it is really falling apart.  I have had meetings with the Department about this and I know Monaghan County Council owns the building.  What is the involvement of the Department to ensure that building is safe and can be conserved, with a plan for its future put in place?  Senator Warfield spoke about artists' spaces and there are not that many of them in Monaghan or Cavan.  We have the Tyrone Guthrie Centre but we could do with much more space and this would be an ideal venue for something like that.</p></speech>

I can confirm it for the committee.  We had big success in last year's Venice Biennale of Architecture, in that it was curated by our own architects.  Mr. Falvey can speak to this year's arts Biennale.  A delegation from the Department went to it.</p> <p>  I imagine the Clones film festival is funded by the Arts Council.</p><p>I do not have the details, but we can definitely come back to the Deputy on it.  </p><p> On the market in Castleblayney, Mr. &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; might talk to the Deputy further about it.  In fairness, as the Deputy has engaged in quite a lot of dialogue with us on it and asked the Minister a number of parliamentary questions about it, we are familiar with the issue.  There is an historic structures scheme in place to deal with such buildings.  Again, we liaise through the local authorities to enable them to come up with proposals for us.</p></speech>

It is supported by the Department in partnership with the Arts Council of Ireland.  Representatives of both the Arts Council of Ireland and the Department, through Culture Ireland, attended the opening of the event in Venice.  Culture Ireland also liaises with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland in its primary role of supporting artists in travelling overseas to build audiences, establish networks and support their work.  In that bilateral engagement it also engages on other matters.  We primarily see the Arts Council of Northern Ireland as separate, but we do have a relationship with the agency in the Department that delivers that support.  It will run until November this year.  We were intending to provide the committee with information on showcase events supported by Culture Ireland and Irish artists who are being supported in travelling overseas, including to the Edinburgh festival and Venice, etc.  For the information of the committee, in case there are events or showcase events that might be of interest-----</p></speech>

Mr. Falvey talked about a delegation from the Department going to see the show.  To me, it is the critical show internationally for the contemporary arts and it is really important for Ireland and this committee to at least be represented at it at some point.  I know that it will be open until November.  Is it not protocol for the committee to be represented at it?</p></speech>

We were delighted to facilitate the recent meeting with Catriona Ryan and our colleagues.  Ms Ryan is head of the built heritage division.  We are continuing to liaise with Monaghan County Council and Paul Clifford and his colleagues on what is possible.  We are in the business of salvage and repurpose, if I can put it like that.  The Deputy is right in the context of what her colleague, Senator Warfield, asked about artists' spaces, for which there is funding available on the heritage side.  Buildings are best when they are reused or repurposed, as distinct from just being a pretty picture.  We would welcome proposals from Monaghan County Council under either the historic buildings fund which will be opened again in November for projects next year or the built heritage investment scheme.  As the Deputy knows, last year the Heritage Council of Ireland singled out Castleblayney in the context of historic towns, but, unfortunately, it was unable to accept funding for the building because of the state it was in.  However, our door remains open to the Deputy and Monaghan County Council to discuss what might be done.</p></speech>

We are losing venues and places in which to dance and socialise.  They are culturally significant, not just drinking factories such as those on Harcourt Street.  They contribute to the culture of the city and we are losing them.  They are being strangled by the licensing laws.  Workers in this sphere pay most of their money to get taxis home because there is no public transport available.  We spoke about how the Department interacted with all other Departments.  Twenty-four hour transport services are one issue, while the licensing laws at night and the Department of Justice and Equality are another.  This is probably an area in which relationships and collaborations are forged and artists make money, but the culture of the city has been hollowed out by hotels and tourism interests.  It would not require a huge amount of money from the Government to reform the licensing laws to make it more rewarding for artists, creative people, promoters and musicians who make their money during these hours and do not necessarily need a grant.  There is a living to be made and basically we are holding people back.  I welcome the moves being made in that regard.  It is something about which I have been talking for a while in the Seanad.</p><p>Will there be a report?  If so, can we expect it soon?  Will it include recommendations from across Departments for those Departments? </p></speech>

We have an interest in night time culture.  Culture Night has been a great success in recent years.  We want know to what extent one could increase the usage of cultural institutions such as rolling opening times later in the evening and so on and the feedback on culture and creativity issues.  The issues that the Senator raised were brought into sharper focus with the closer of the Tivoli Theatre and District 8 back in the autumn.  There was newspaper coverage on the impact the closures would have on the sector.  People have given us their views, which we have condensed into a range of issues that have been identified.  However, many of them are outside the remit of the Department.  As the Senator will be aware, structures have been put in place in other jurisdictions such as night tzars or night mayors, and different terms have been used, to facilitate that engagement and address issues that he raised.  We will be in a process of bilateral engagement next with some of the other Departments involved, and perhaps Dublin City Council, to condense the information into a number of concrete measures that could be brought forward for consideration.</p></speech>

We know what the issues are and a night tzar or night ambassador should not be the main focus at this point.</p> <p>  Earlier this year I attended a meeting with 300 other people in the Sugar Club.  There is significant demand and appetite for change in this area.  The Catholic Church does not run the dance hall anymore.  This follows on from civil marriage and repeal of the eighth amendment.  In terms of a political meeting, there were way more people at that early event than I have seen at any meeting on securing marriage equality and repeal of the eighth amendment.  This issue suits the Department and we need champions like the Department to run with this cause. </p></speech>

The committee did excellent work compiling a report on what needs to be done to make the public transport system more accessible to people with disabilities and mobility issues.  The Minister gave a clear commitment when he came to the launch of that report that in order to ensure the recommendations were implemented in an efficient and timely manner that we would set in stone dates for when he would appear before the committee and answer questions on the implementation of the recommendations.  He agreed to that and now the only reason he is not accepting the invitation to be here today is because there is no progress and he has nothing to update us on.  He is seeking an extra month in order to buy himself time.  Great credit is due to all the committee members who played a full part in producing that report and also all the stakeholders who took time out and the advocates for people with disabilities who appeared before the committee and participated in this process.  It is very wrong for the Minister not to have accepted the invitation to appear today.  We should write back to him outlining my concern over his non-appearance today.</p></speech>

After all the work that had been put in reaching out to and liaising with the various groups, we published a very detailed report.  When we expressed the importance of continuous follow-up, the Minister gave a commitment to examine the progress made.  It sends the wrong signal when the Minister does not prioritise giving this committee a progress update on accessibility in our public transport system for persons with disabilities.  The committee needs to make clear to him that it is the wrong signal.  Given the commitment he gave, we should ask him if possible to rearrange his diary and give this matter priority.</p></speech>

The All-Ireland Cruise Ship Action Group was formed by a group of businesses in Dublin, Cork and Waterford which will be severely impacted by the Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s decision to severely reduce the numbers of cruise ships entering Dublin Port from 2021.  Our members include Ireland&rsquo;s leading and iconic retailers, tourist attractions, transport operators, hotels, restaurants and other businesses impacted by Dublin Port&rsquo;s decision.  A number of trade associations, including Dublin Town, Retail Excellence Ireland and the Restaurants Association of Ireland are also members of the All-Ireland Cruise Ship Action Group.</p> <p>  My name is Lorcan O&rsquo;Connor, managing director of Carroll&rsquo;s, and I am joined by other members of our group: Richard Guiney, chief executive of Dublin Town representing 2,500 businesses in Dublin city centre; Niamh McCarthy, managing director of Excursions Ireland, which is on the front line of the cruise industry at Dublin Port; and Bryan Rankin from Retail Excellence Ireland.</p><p>I will begin by providing a broad background to the issue and I will then pass over to my colleagues, who will go into more depth about how Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s decision will impact on business and tourism, not just in Dublin city but also in Belfast, Cobh, Waterford and the wider tourism industry in Ireland.</p><p> For the past 15 years, Dublin Port Company, along with many stakeholders, State bodies, trade associations and the wider tourism sector have been actively promoting Dublin as an international cruise ship destination.  Thanks to this hard work and dedication by many people over the past 15 years, the promotion of Dublin and Ireland as a cruise destination has been an outstanding success.  Countless individuals have devoted themselves to this cause in the hope of building the cruise industry in Ireland and Dublin Port Company has been central to this.  In 2019, 175 cruise ships will pass through Dublin Port, bringing almost 500,000 tourists into Dublin city, generating more than &euro;50 million for the local economy.  Next year, even more cruise ships will visit Dublin, with even more cruise passengers.  However, in 2021, the hard work and the stunning growth of the past 15 years will wiped out by the actions of the port company</p><p> Earlier this year, the port company announced, without prior warning, that from 2021 it will restrict the number of cruise ships entering Dublin Port to 80.  Most of these 80 cruise ships will be small vessels carrying between 250 and 400 passengers.  Only 35 will be the large cruise ships we have become accustomed to seeing in the port.  Dublin Port Company announced its decision effective to destroy the cruise industry without prior warning, consultation or engagement with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, this committee, local businesses, Dublin City Council or the other Irish ports, namely Belfast, Waterford and Cobh, which will be severely impacted by this decision.</p><p> The cruise companies market Ireland as a destination, and in addition to Dublin the cruise ships stop at Belfast, Waterford and Cobh.  Without access to Dublin Port, cruise companies will no longer stop in other Irish ports and will take their business to other European destinations.  Dublin Port Company completely failed to communicate its decision or the flawed rationale behind it to any of the local, national or international stakeholders involved.  Furthermore, the company immediately disbanded Cruise Dublin and withdrew from a number of cruise trade associations, namely, Cruise Ireland, Seatrade Cruise Global and Cruise Europe.  This will have a dramatic impact on its chances of persuading cruise companies to return to Ireland in the future.  The reaction of the international cruise industry community to this has been total shock, and many have commented on how badly Ireland's reputation has been damaged.  This will have a dramatic knock-on effect for years to come.  Many cruise companies have said they will never return to Ireland.  Furthermore, Dublin Port's decision sends out a signal to the tourism industry across the world that tourists are not welcome in Ireland.  I thank the committee for allowing us to come before it to make this presentation.</p></speech>

The most significant aspect for us with regard to Dublin town is the engagement by cruise tourists with the independent retail sector in the city centre.  We have a visitor assistance team that visits each of the ships that comes in so we have a good handle on what people do when they arrive here.  Approximately half go on pre-organised excursions throughout the country and Ms McCarthy will be able to provide more detail on this.  The other half spends its time in Dublin city centre.  The tourists take the hop-on hop-off tours.  They spend quite liberally and very much engage with independent retailers.  They have a strong interest in buying Irish designed products.  They buy a lot of crafts, art, jewellery and Irish manufactured fashion.  Their spend is significant and certainly the feedback we have received is that this type of tourist turning up and spending kept many businesses in business during the dark days of recession.  Their spend of several thousand euro was the make or break for quite a number of businesses and for the sources of their products.  From our perspective, the spend is significant and we believe that at a time retail is challenged by online competition, losing it could lead to closures in the independent sector.</p></speech>

We are the people who deal with the cruise lines directly.  I have been in the business for 25 years and I have seen it grow.  I did the very first call in Belfast in 1996 when there was one and this year we have 150 calls.  It is the same in all of the other ports.  I have taken great pride in being part of growing the business and creating jobs, as Mr. Guiney has said, and building a strong economy through the cruise industry.</p> <p>  I find the way it was handled and communicated to us and our clients disappointing.  We heard it second hand as did our clients.  Our clients have invested a lot of time and money in this country.  They have favoured Ireland over other regions.  We must remember that cruising is a movable asset.  The ships can go where they want.  Ireland is popular and all of the cruises to here are sold out.  While the companies want to sell all of Ireland, Dublin is the number one attraction.  If Dublin is not on an itinerary the ships will not call to the other ports.  It is like going to France and not visiting Paris or going to the UK and not visiting London.  Dublin is the seller.  It is the marquee port.</p> <p>  From our point of view, as Mr. Guiney touched on, during the recession this was the one part of the tourism industry that continued to grow.  It still is the fastest growing sector of the tourism industry in the world.  We only have to look at the order books.  More than 100 ships are on order until 2026.  Cruising is huge for Ireland.  The guests love Ireland.  This land of the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte is closing the door at a time there is uncertainty with Brexit.  I do not mean to bring up Brexit but, let us be honest, who knows where we will be after it.  Dublin Port feels it is in a position to stay "No" to a sure thing and, from our point of view, this is not acceptable.  We need to try to find a way for cargo and tourism to live alongside each other and flourish and grow.  We are an island and we have ports north, south, east and west.  Cargo can go anywhere but guests want to see our capital city.  They want to spend.  They want to go to the Guinness Storehouse and the stores.  They want to go to Carroll's and Brown Thomas.  They want to see Trinity.  It does not matter where cargo comes in.  We need to find a way for all of our industries to flourish and grow together.</p></speech>

It is important to talk about the unseen hand and the unseen damage this unilateral move by Dublin Port, without consultation, will have, should it go through, in every town on the tourism trail, which are in every county in Ireland.  My colleagues agree this has been a fast growing business and trade.  It has grown quickly since 2012 and employment has grown with it.  Tens of thousands of our employees are sustained by the cruise ship industry.  This move will do away with them.</p> <p>  Ms McCarthy will outline the details later but the importance of this is that the cruise industry depends on certainty and being able to book some years in advance.  What this move has done is remove this certainty.  It means the cruise industry is unable to plan ahead and, therefore, must look at alternatives.  The damage it is doing to the Irish tourism brand is scary and, if we are not careful, irreparable.</p> <p>  It is useful to look at the arguments Dublin Port has put forward in support of the decision.  When pushed, it talks about the importance of freight to the port to the exclusion of everything else.  Retailers, better than anybody else, appreciate the importance of freight but it is simply untenable to do away with cruise ships coming in to Dublin.  The two most coalesce, as they do in every major port and city in Europe.</p> <p>  Another motivation put forward was Brexit.  When this was first mooted and put forward we were right in the crosshairs of Brexit.  Now, frankly, 31 October is a date that is coming at us but no one knows what it will entail.</p><p>We are seeing some concrete and damaging moves being made by Dublin Port without the consultation required.  This is a national strategic utility and there must be the consultation required.</p><p> In media commentary on this issue Dublin Port was big on describing the importance of Brexit and how the port needed to prepare for it, rightly so.  Port representatives talked about some of the huge vessels that were being brought in, so-called Brexit busters.  What was not talked about was the damage being done to our vital tourism industry.  In the course of the "Morning Ireland" interview I recall hearing that they admitted that the use of space in Dublin Port was perhaps less than optimal.  They were frank about it.  I suggest the use of space be looked at carefully and that every unit of space be looked at for freight before such a drastic decision is made.</p><p> There is a certain type or profile of tourist cruise ships bring here as opposed to those who come on a flight.  Needless to say, they are high net worth individuals with dollars and euro to spend.  For members of my group, this is exactly the type or profile of visitor and tourist we need to bring to the country.  Instead, it seems we are making a decision that is diametrically opposed to it.  This is the time to act and we look to the Houses to assist in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not have the in-depth knowledge given of the group's representatives, but I did hear the news that the port was to restrict cruise traffic.  On the face of it, something does not add up.  That was my initial impression when I heard the news through the media.  The group's representatives mentioned Brexit and the increased cargo.  It is a great problem to have overall.  It seems Dublin Port can cherry-pick whatever business it wants to have.  That is what seems to be happening.</p> <p>  The important question is where do we to go from here.  I know that it has been mentioned, but when the recession hit, tourism was the saviour of the economy.  When I was Chairman of this committee, several groups appeared before it to provide welcome news.  They talked about trying at every level to increase cruise traffic into Ireland.  The group seems to be suggesting it has become a matter of cargo versus cruise traffic and that cargo has won out.  From a Dublin Port perspective, is it more profitable?</p></speech>

The point is that what a ship weighs and its cargo are worth a great deal of money to the port.  However, port representatives have admitted in their briefing documents to the Minister that they appreciate our sector is more profitable for the wider economy.  Before Dublin Port officials closed their social media channels, they were trumpeting how much came through and how good it was for the local economy in Dublin.  As part of this process they closed their social media channels because we were retweeting the positive stuff they had put up about it and they did not particularly like it.  They had told everyone that they had grown the sector, that they were marvellous, that it was worth &euro;50 million to Dublin and that it would be worth far more.  They then had to take down those messages because the view had changed.</p></speech>

None of the ports was consulted in advance.  Obviously, this decision will also affect their business, but none of them was asked.  Cruise Ireland members jointly and collectively advertise Ireland as a cruise destination, but none of them was told in advance.  None of us was consulted.  As business people, we all appreciate that the port makes more money from cargo.  However, I have worked on cruise ships throughout the world and it is the same in every port, but they still manage to increase both alongside each other.  That is the issue.  Why does Dublin Port not recognise this?  Last year it was still selling Dublin as the premier destination.  If that was the case, from where is all of this coming?  Why has it stopped suddenly?  Brexit has been many years in the making.  Port officials have known about it.</p></speech>

In such cases we are dealing with extremely high-end or high-worth individuals.  They will go to the likes of Powerscourt Townhouse Centre and South William Street where they may spend several thousand euro.  We are looking at an average sum of &euro;250 or &euro;300 per head, but some will spend a great deal more.</p></speech>

A total of 3,260 passengers were on board, all of whom had flown in through Dublin Airport and stayed in hotels in Dublin or elsewhere in Ireland prior to embarking.  They joined the ship and another 3,200 disembarked and did the same.  There are five this year.  There will be ten next year and we are planning to have 20 in the following year.  That is with one company only.  There are other corporations seeking to use Dublin as a home port.

The problem is that we keep getting conflicting documents.  The port put out a document in March stating that it would not take any turnarounds from 2021 on.  It is probably the most lucrative business, but it will be gone.  When briefing the Minister a couple of weeks later, however, the port pointed out how valuable the turnaround business is.  It is telling people that it will not take such business on the one hand and, on the other, it is briefing the Minister and saying that the business is valuable.  This is all vague.  The port claims that there will be 80 ships, but when one looks into that number, some of them will only have 100 or 150 people and will put in at berths on Sir John Rogerson's Quay.  Those are small ships.  Where larger ships are concerned, the port is stating that it will have a capacity of approximately 36.  The problem is that it will only accept those ships on three days.  When companies seek to book, they are told that they can only pick two of those three days just in case the port, which is looking at this a couple of years out, needs the third for freight.  Since Dublin Port is tidal, there are restrictions on when ships can come in.</p></speech>

In the context of the independent of Dublin Port, it is clear regarding how the port makes decisions on its operations.  According to the briefing, although the Department's officials continue to monitor developments at the port in respect of its cruise ship business and capacity, these are operational matters and commercial decisions for the board and management of the Dublin Port Company, which is an independent commercial operation in respect of which the Minister has no day-to-day role.</p></speech>

In making our submission on this issue, I consulted Dublin Port's annual report.  It is clear from the back of the report that the Minister is on the board and is in a position of influence over matters of such national importance.  It is for that reason that we want to meet him and ask him to intercede.  It is frustrating for my members to see a response like the one the Deputy cited.  It is like the Department is washing its hands of the issue.</p></speech>

From what we have seen, there is plenty of freight capacity at the other ports.  To some degree, however, Dublin Port feels that it can suck in all of that more profitable freight business.  It is setting up a cost-benefit analysis on a cruise terminal that will cost &euro;100 million.  It states that it makes &euro;2 million per year on a season that is relatively short, lasting only a couple of months.  The cost-benefit analysis is set up to fail.  It is never going to show that Dublin Port Company should build a port terminal.  Dublin Port has sought central government funding for this infrastructure, but there is an idea that the report will be considered once it is published.  We are being told that there will be cruise business for two years, it will decline for two years while the works are under way and it will then be grown again.  If so, why then would the company leave Cruise Ireland, Cruise Europe and the other cruise groups and close its social media accounts?  The company has stated that there will be no turnarounds after 2021.  In the briefing document supplied, the Minister was vague.  Terms such as "We might", "We will" and "We would like to" are used.  Those are the kinds of answer we are getting.  We would love to get Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly into a committee meeting like this so that people could ask him hard questions, including about his intentions.  Everything is always "We might need" or-----</p></speech>

We already know that the economic return for the port is minute.  That is the same in every port around the world.  Instead, this is a question of the greater economy.  As Mr. O'Connor stated, the port is a facilitator of bringing tourists to our country.  If Dublin Airport decided that it would be cheaper or easier to bring in cargo planes than to look at every passport, would we just accept that?  It is the same issue, only on a smaller, but growing, scale.  How can one of our largest pieces of infrastructure make this decision, given that doing so will affect so many people country-wide?  I do not understand how we can sit back and say that, because the port is a commercial company that makes money, we will let this go and hope that everything will be okay.  It is not okay.  If it happened at the airport, it would not be okay.</p></speech>

I was called out urgently.  They will make a decision on the turnarounds by August.  If this decision is not overturned, they will relocate their ships to Amsterdam and the business will be gone.  Every time a turnaround is planned, a company invests five years' worth of advertising and marketing.  One can imagine the money that goes into that.  These ships are full and 3,500 people fly in to join the cruises.  That is a great deal of marketing in the US.  If that business moves to Amsterdam, it is gone.  Why would it come back once Dublin Port says that it has room for it?  It will not come back.  With those companies go all the other cruise lines.  That is what happens - they are like sheep, so they will all go.  We need answers now.  Everyone says that this is still two years away, but it is not.  The companies will make the decision now.</p></speech>

It concerns fewer than 30 ships with a capacity of 3,500.  As Mr. O'Connor pointed out, the rest are carrying about 200, which is a long way short of 3,500.  One is looking at bringing the figure down to one fifth or one sixth of the number.  Therefore, the loss to Dublin alone is &euro;35 million or maybe up to &euro;40 million.  If the boats do not come to Dublin, they will not be going to Cobh and Belfast.</p> <p>  This is one of the issues that has really given rise to concern among us.  We are given numbers but as soon as the surface is scratched, it is found that the position is quite nebulous.  The committee also needs to take into account that Ireland is suffering reputational damage.  As Ms McCarthy stated, the large cruise liners made a decision to use Dublin as a home port and believed that if they could grow it in that context, it would become a major hub.  When they made that decision, they started spending a lot of their money marketing Ireland to tourists in America and elsewhere.  Within a number of months, without consulting the companies, the decision was made by the port to cease the trade.  The companies spent money in good faith marketing Ireland to very wealthy tourists and then found the decision had basically been reversed.  We have had some contact with and anecdotal evidence from people who are active in the market, particularly the North American market, suggesting there is a lot of upset within the tourism industry there.  Basically, the question being asked concerns what is going on not in Dublin or Dublin Port but in Ireland.  Therefore, we need to consider reputational damage.</p></speech>

On the meeting between the Minister and Dublin Port Company on 20 March 2019, it appears that part of the suggested solution to what is proposed is additional capacity, working with the ports in Cork and Belfast with a view to their taking on some of the additional business.  It is stated that the Department officials are maintaining contact with Belfast Harbour with a view to supporting efforts to retain cruise tourism on the island of Ireland and maximise any additional opportunities arising.</p></speech>

I am aware that they have because I am associated with Cruise Ireland.  I know the Department has written to those concerned saying it will support them.  Ultimately, we and the ports themselves are very aware of the fact that Dublin cannot be replaced.  Tourists want to visit Dublin.  Ultimately, that is the issue.  With regard to turn business, Dublin has the international airport.  Dublin was chosen because of the proximity of its airport to the port, pre-clearance at Dublin Airport and the significant airlift between North America and Dublin.  While the work of the ports in Belfast and Cork is amazing, both are undergoing development, which is a little ironic considering they were not aware of the Dublin's stance.  The authorities are investing money in their ports but they may be or will be losing.  If we believed they would take all the business, it would be great but, ultimately, the cruise guests want to see Dublin.  It was said to me in March that if one cruise line can get one of the two days and another cannot, guests will pick the ship going to Dublin.  As a result, a cruise line is losing out on this valuable revenue.  Dublin is the top seller.  All the cruise lines will state that.</p></speech>

We have had communication from Rosslare.  I am not sure what I can do as a tour operator.  The port officials contacted us seeking to find out how they could help with this issue.  I told them to contact who they need to.  Greenore and Drogheda ports have space whereas the cruise ships have to come to Dublin.  They are only here for a day so it is really not an option for them to drive passengers from Rosslare to Dublin for a day tour.  That is the issue.  The other ports are willing to take the extra business but they are also very aware that this is a dark cloud hanging over their business.</p></speech>

I happen to know Drogheda port a little better than the others.  There are fantastic facilities there that could afford a solution for freight and really help the surroundings.  Let us face the fact that the tourists want to come into the capital city.  It is one of the real advantages we have in addition to sea and mountains.  We are all set up for cruise ships.  We just want the trade to continue.  That is all we ask for.</p></speech>

The briefing documents given to the Minister indicated this.  We are going to turn away the tourism business and cruise business in case we need the facilities for freight.  Guaranteed money is being turned away in case the capacity is needed.  That is in the ports' own documents.  It is not a case of having to have the space but of needing it just in case it is required.  The three days became two days because it was believed the third day might be needed for freight.</p></speech>

The answer was that the third day needed to be kept on the off chance that there was freight.  The port official was asked why, if the port were guaranteed a booking two years in advance by cruise ship, the ship would be refused on the off chance that the space may be needed for freight in two years.  The answer was that the port needs the space for freight.  A definite issue needs to be addressed.  Questions have to be asked about the management of the space in the ports.  I am no expert but if we could visit that it would be very valuable.  We should not have to choose between cargo and freight and tourism.  In a few years, and if there is a recession, if the cargo ships are not coming in, the cruise ships will not be doing so either.  They will be in Amsterdam &mdash; they are movable assets.  We need to be very mindful that the current stance is very short-sighted and characteristic of tunnel vision.</p></speech>

There are new areas for customs and excise and agriculture.  In addition, the port now has a huge inland port near Dublin Airport.  To say that no efforts are being made to remove activity from the port is not correct.  Very significant efforts are being made.  Representatives of the port explained to me that the dock is needed when cargo comes in because people and industries depend on those goods.  They cannot tie up the berth for cruise ships forever.  That is their problem.  They would love to do so, but the economy is their priority.  I hear what the witnesses are saying and I acknowledge the great importance of the cruise ship industry.  There is a significant need for them to meet the key decision makers in the port to get clarity on all of these issues.  If the committee can facilitate that, it should do so.</p></speech>

What was his stance on this issue?  Ms McCarthy outlined that alternative ports such as Drogheda, Greenore and so on could be used.  Did the Minister commit to examining those options?  What liaison did he have on the issue?  Although Dublin Port is State-owned, we seem to have very little input into it.  I acknowledge it is an independent commercial business, but tourism and the need to build on tourism are also at stake here.  Most of the witnesses learned of the decision second hand.</p></speech>

Some of these issues were discussed and the Minister promised to revert to those in attendance.  As far as I am aware, that process is ongoing.  I did not attend the meeting and am not aware of what occurred.  That was the role of the chairman of Cruise Ireland in addition to his role at the Port of Cork.  Apparently, they are still in discussions.  I am unsure whether other ports have been contacted to see how they could help with freight.  Obviously, we have connections in those ports and we have not heard of such inquiries being made.  We need to stress the urgency of this matter.  If we do not get it looked at now, it will be too late.  I am in the port every day - I am known as the harbour queen - and I see the constraints and how busy it is.  Nobody is denying that.  We need cargo; we all avail of everything that is brought into the port.  We understand that and nobody is questioning it.  However, consideration should be given to how the cargo could be distributed to other ports such as Rosslare, Greenore and Drogheda rather than only Belfast and Cork.  I acknowledge that Dublin Port is under significant constraints - I have seen the evidence of that, such as terminal 7 which will be used for Brexit inspections.  Nobody has sat down with representatives of the other ports to see whether there is anything we can do.</p></speech>

If the other ports come back to say it would be totally impractical and would not be fit for purpose and so on, so be it, but the lack of engagement or investigation to ascertain the options is worrying.  That should be to the fore in this process in which the witnesses have not been included.</p></speech>

We also want answers in respect of rejoining the tourism organisations.  If the intention was for the port to come back stronger and provide more berths, why did it pull out of the advertising organisations?  It should have been on the front line reassuring its clients that this is for the greater good, that investment is being made in the port and that a new terminal will be built.  Why is the Dublin Port Company not telling its clients that?  Something does not add up here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.892" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorcan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019052900002#J01500"><p>It comes back to potential business.  Dublin Port is not guaranteed any freight business.  The CEO of the port, Eamonn O'Reilly, is saying that it will not take the cruise business, but it is hoping to get certain freight business and is taking certain actions to prepare for that.  I refer to a statement by Mr. O'Reilly on 11 April following discussion of the pressure on land at Dublin Port.  He stated: "Our container terminals are operating at half of the target land utilisation we set for them in our Franchise Policy in 2014."  He continued: "One of the impacts of Brexit is that we have to achieve these targets sooner.  The Dublin Port Dwell Time Initiative provides essential financial incentives to move cargo through the port more quickly."   Basically, people were able to store rusty containers at the port for a year without being charged.  Five years ago, the port company set out a policy document stating that it needed to utilise its land better and would begin charging for container storage.  It is only starting to do so now.  This was identified as a problem five years ago in the context of a lack of space but the port still has not done anything about it and is only now starting to consider it.  The temporary solution to a lack of space in the port, particularly for the turnarounds, is a marquee measuring several hundred thousand square feet which operates somewhat like an airport check-in area - people arrive, go through a security scanner, check in their baggage and get bused to the ship.  In the case of turnarounds, that is paid for by the cruise companies.  To address a possible lack of usable land, people should be charged for the storage of empty rusty containers, which would free up a significant amount of land.  That space could be used to house a marquee, which would keep the turnarounds going.</p></speech>

This is a business decision.  It is a business strategy that has been outlined by Dublin Port, which has every right to so do, but the knock-on effect on a national basis is such that we cannot allow it to happen.</p></speech>

Although I have never been on a cruise, more and more people are going on them.  In the document furnished to the committee, Dublin Port argues that new berths would have to be constructed at the North Wall quay extension to cater for large numbers of cruise ships, such as more than 200.  That would require co-financing and-or long-term financial guarantees from cruise lines.  Has that been formally put to the witnesses in any shape or form?  What are their thoughts on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.895" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorcan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019052900002#J01800"><p>It is referred to in the briefing document to the Minister but many of the details are left vague.  Initially, we were told that the number of cruise ships would be cut back for two years and the port would then start building up the business again.  However, the document indicates that the intention for 2024 to 2025 is to increase the business towards 150 ships.  I do not know whether that will be done incrementally from 30 to 35 to 40 and so on.  Increasing the number of ships towards 150 means nothing.  There is no timescale for getting to 150 ships and there is no commitment to get back to current levels.  We are now at 175 ships but the port company is talking about moving towards 150 ships.  We do not know what that means.  The development of a new terminal would depend on the Government committing money to the project as a piece of infrastructure for the country similar to Luas cross-city or metro north.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-29a.897" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorcan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019052900002#K00100"><p>It is difficult when one is talking to other people.  Carroll's Ireland operates in Cork, Dublin and Belfast and, as such, we get three bites of the cherry.  We get the ship at Cork, Dublin and Belfast, which is hugely beneficial.  We talk to local people in Cork and Belfast and there is a feeling that because ships have always stopped at Cobh and Belfast, they will continue to do so.  We will be as happy as anybody else if we could keep the same amount of business in Cork and Belfast.  The reality, however, is that the cruise companies are saying that Dublin is where it is at.  People have to fly into an international airport.  If they fly from the United States into Dublin Airport, using the port tunnel they can be in the port and checking in to board the ship within 20 minutes.  This is a huge selling point for cruise companies.  People flying into London, for example, have a two-hour train or bus journey down to Southampton.</p> <p>  We need honest answers.  If the company is saying it wants to actively grow the cruise business, why close down all the cruise social media and leave all of the cruise organisations?  It is like when someone renovates a shop and does not want to annoy the store's customers.  The owner will want to keep them on board and ensure they come back to the business.  In this case, one would expect someone from Dublin Port to fly out to talk to the cruise companies face to face.  My understanding, however, is that the cruise companies got an email stating the new position and informing them that their costs would be doubled for the next two years.</p></speech>

During the local elections, I was in the proud county of Cork which sees itself as the real capital.  It is rare to hear people in Cork advocating for something in Dublin.  That message was heard loud and clear on this issue, however, because people know what impact this decision will have on Cobh, Cork and south.  That was very noticeable.  </p> <p>  What I am hearing here is that a balance needs to be struck.  A silo-type approach is being taken.  We cannot afford to be in that frame of mind given the risks arising from Brexit.  The Port of Dublin has taken Brexit very seriously and that must be acknowledged.  We must also question why Rosslare was given such a low priority in the national development plan.  Given the port's capacity, relieving some of the congestion in Dublin would seem to be logical.  There is a bigger picture to be looked at in this.  The Minister clearly has influence on Dublin Port.  There is a difference between influence and power but this influence is important for the overall economy.  Other matters also need to be considered.  Given the role Cobh played historically, it would be an important story to see people wanting to come back to the town as opposed to seeing it as a port of emigration.</p> <p>  On the issue of Belfast and the North, given the concentration on the Border and Brexit, it is impossible not to see that other practical matters will be important in looking at the all-Ireland economy post Brexit.  From that point of view, the Port of Belfast is an intangible positive which we must ensure we do not lose.  Rather than considering this matter from a purely Dublin Port point of view, we must put other issues into the mix.</p> <p>  Dublin Port must also look at its business case.  We should meet the Minister, Deputy Ross, to argue that this business case must be recognised and that some means must be found to be fair and balanced.  We will not find a balance without looking at the business aspect of Dublin Port.  Writing to a Minister whom we could bump into in a corridor seems like a circuitous way of getting to speak to him.  We can speak to him individually to press home the point that is being made about the timing, urgency and importance of this issue.</p> <p>  Wider issues also need to be considered.  I had an opportunity to speak to individuals involved in the coach industry.  Certainty in respect of cruise traffic creates a different dynamic for that industry.  This is important from the point of view of both the operators and those who work in the coach sector, which is also a good area of employment.</p> <p>  We have heard the views of the witnesses loud and clear and we know what we have to do.  It is important to understand that we must find a balance by recognising that Dublin Port has been proactive in looking at the challenges of Brexit while also acknowledging that, within those challenges, we cannot leave behind a sector of an extremely important industry.  This is what we need to do.</p></speech>

It recognised at that time of recession that there was not much freight and that cruise ships were an area of growth from which it could make money.  It also had space to do so.  We believe business and retail are at the top of the economic curve.  Given that freight is determined by need in the economy, our worry is that when we hit the next recession and find that we do not need as much space for freight as we thought we would, we will at that stage have told the cruise companies they were not welcome and we no longer wanted them.  If we ask them to remember us and say we would love to have their business back, the concern is that they will say they are sorry but they have moved on to somewhere else.  In that scenario, it would take us years to get back to where we are now.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity for this informed discussion with the witnesses.  When the news was breaking, I thought the problem was that there was only one access route to Cobh, namely, the Fota Road.  It was a matter of concern for a former county council colleague, John Mulvihill.  Now we see what the problem is and the impact it will have.  I have been to Cobh when some of the big cruise liners came to Cork.  It is remarkable, spreading good news to the hinterland and towns such as Blarney and Midleton.  The coaches can canvas for the passengers to travel on and they venture out to the historic sites and the distilleries.</p> <p>  Most of my questions have been answered.  I can safely say from what I have heard that Dublin Port reacted too late to the threat of Brexit.  We saw the Government fast-track emergency legislation through the D&aacute;il last March, on foot of the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.  I understand the witnesses had not been forewarned about the expansion programme in Dublin Port.  We can safely say that Brexit is being used as the issue.  If there is a proper Brexit deal, we might keep the cruise ships performing.  I think they can work hand in hand.</p> <p>  What is the health and safety record of the cruise liners coming into Dublin Port?  Have there been major incidents with cargo ships?  Must the cruise liners vacate their location to facilitate the roll-on-roll-off ferries to get the cargo from Dublin straight down to mainland Europe?  Other Deputies have mentioned that Rosslare Europort should have been upgraded.  I see that the Port of Cork is opening up access from Cork to Santander in Spain.  My concern is that when Dublin is in trouble, we all suffer.  I am sorry to see that happening.  I had hoped that Cobh would get extra cruise liners when Dublin Port was not able to facilitate them.</p></speech>

I would love Belfast also to get cruise liners.  We are trading in both locations and know the situation.  The worry for us is that Cork and Belfast are very small tight knit cities, so when a cruise ship comes in with 3,500 people and they arrive into the middle of Cork, or Belfast it is significant, whereas the passengers arriving in Dublin are dispersed so it is not as obvious when a cruise ship arrives in port.  It is substantial business in Dublin but I would definitely say that in Cork and Belfast businesses will close once this happens because it is such a game changer when a ship comes in.  It is 3,500 people arriving on your doorstep and in the smaller cities it will have a much greater impact.</p></speech>

I think everybody recognises the importance of the cruise ship business, the employment and its significance for the growing economy, while at the same time everybody realises that Dublin Port must primarily deal with exports and imports and the landbridge is hugely important to our economy.  Having been there recently and looked at it in some detail, the actual difficulty for the port is that if Brexit is harder than any of us would like, and none wants it at all, it will mean delays to inward and outward movement of goods.  They are talking about trying to restrict delays to a maxim of 30 seconds per vehicle.  That might sound like nothing but it is a major problem.  One could have significant congestion in the port and in the city.</p> <p>  I realise that one has to see the operation to believe it.  I have been to Holyhead to look at how the port facilities are dealing with Brexit and to Dublin Port.  Dublin Port is doing a fantastic job to protect our economy and that is absolutely crystal clear to me.  I am sure it will be clear to members when we see that.  Second, the additionality of extra space that Dublin Port requires, which the witnesses say they have seen, is very visible.  There are acres upon acres of new facilities for vehicles to back up, if they have to and for inspection of cargoes and separately for agricultural commodities.  As I said earlier, the port has an inland port up at the airport.  They are all elements that are of major importance and must come first.  We must find a way of meeting the needs of the witnesses as well.  I think it is done by constructive engagement.  I would not accept that Bord F&aacute;ilte would not or could not express its view.  We live in a democracy.  If it has a view, it should be expressed.  There is no hidden agenda from anybody in getting at the facts.  The facts are that cruise liners are a very important business and we must support it if we can find a way to do so, but there is a priority in Dublin Port.  Dublin Port has plans and is saying that it has and will be providing extra facilities for cruise ships from the year 2025, I think and will -----</p></speech>

I will be happy to debate them with the witnesses.</p> <p>  To say that Dublin Port is not concerned is not true.  To say that it is not trying to find an alternative for the cruise liners is also not true, because it is.  The question is whether we can make that work faster.  Dublin Port is saying that it has to provide new facilities at North Wall and so on and it would require co-financing or long-term financial guarantees from cruise lines.  That is an indicator of looking for business commitments from your colleagues to develop this facility.  </p> <p>  I want to make the point that Dublin Port is doing a great deal of good and has been very productive to help the cruise liner business.  </p></speech>

We hit out fairly hard and he had this opportunity going into the meeting with the Minister to come up with a briefing document.  This was not out before.  The decision had been made.  It is easy to put something down after the fact and say this is what we hope to do, and this is what we plan on doing, but this was not a strategy before he cancelled the cruise ships going forward.</p></speech>

The bodies were primarily set up by hoteliers.</p><p>They only count tourists who stay in hotels.  A tourist who comes in and buys a cup of coffee or a gift from any of their members is not valued in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Dublin Tourism figures, which basically look at bed nights and so on.  The turnaround business is where we could prove that these are people who will stay but if they are in Dublin for a day, they are only here for eight hours.  They will not stay in a hotel or wherever but they will shop for a gift, buy a cup of coffee or whatever.  I am part of the Dublin Town initiative, and I was part of the Dublin City Business Association before that, and we criticised the tourism authority for not taking that into account.  We need to get out of the hotel bedroom mentality and look at tourists coming in for a day on cruise ships or on ferries from the UK.  That is all part of the tourism offering.  There is still the mentality within F&aacute;ilte Ireland that unless it is a hotel bed night, it is not a proper tourist but these people are contributing a huge amount to the economy.</p></speech>

The problem is that there are conflicting documents coming from Dublin Port.  They can be downloaded from the website; they are public documents.  Dublin Port has come up with conflicting reports and it has given vague answers such as "We might", "We hope to" or "We will try".  We are looking for a commitment.  It would be one thing if Dublin Port is saying it will never go for cruise ships again.  It is saying that it wants the cruise business but everything it is doing behind the scenes suggests it does not want the cruise business.  It should be honest and tell the truth.</p></speech>

However, they showed me the properties they had identified that are currently occupied by private entities, which were port-owned properties.  They are ceasing their leases and putting out people who have other activities in the port.  They just want 100% port-related activities run by them, because they need all that space.  However, Mr. O'Connor's point is right.  We will do our best.  Following this meeting I will make it my business to contact the port authority to get a meeting between the witnesses and it.

Everybody knows that, although not all the intricate details, yet it was only actioned this year.  I would imagine that has been in the planning so why have the companies been told this when they have invested in their turnarounds here?  That is our question.  As I stated at the outset, I have been doing this for 25 years.  It concerns my reputation as well.  I have gone out there, through my own company funding, to promote Ireland when F&aacute;ilte Ireland was not a member.  When it did not give me or any of my colleagues sitting beside me any funding, I went out and promoted Ireland.  I did not do that single-handedly but, together with the ports and my colleagues, we have created this industry in Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has never given us funding.  We have never been recognised because, as Mr. O'Connor said, we do not offer bed nights.  I take it personally that somebody has that power to turn away an industry that we worked so hard to grow and that is growing across the world.  Ports are crying out for these ships and they will be gone in a heartbeat because when we do not want them, Lisbon and Amsterdam will take them.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

This is not a freight versus cruise ship issue.  We are saying we can have both.  We probably need investment in other ports across the country that handle freight.  Freight is coming into Dublin that is driven from Dublin to Cork, Waterford or wherever.</p></speech>
