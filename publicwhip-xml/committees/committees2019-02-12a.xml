I welcome Mr. Ray Doyle from the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and Mr. Seamus Scallan and Ms Elizabeth Scallan from Wicklow Calf Company Limited.  I thank them for coming before the committee to discuss the issue of live exports.  The joint committee is having an ongoing discussion on the future of the beef industry and we have heard in recent weeks about difficulties in the sector.  The committee has decided to see what we, as a collective, can do to try to move things on.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Doyle to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Doyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021200002#C00200"><p>Ireland has more than 6.7 million cattle, producing approximately 2.4 million calves annually.  This results in almost 1.7 million cattle being presented for slaughter, of which we export almost 90%.  Almost 1.8 million cattle and 750,000 sheep were traded through the livestock marts in 2018 and live exports number between 200,000 and 300,000 animals depending on the year.  This trade in live animals is vital to maintaining competition in the marketplace and acts as a countervailing force against the beef processing sector which is dominated by four private companies.  Ireland has always been a provider of live cattle for export to Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, other European countries and third countries such as Turkey as well as countries in north Africa.  As a nation, we consume approximately 10% of what we produce and in 2018, Ireland produced more than 480,000 tonnes of beef meat for export.</p> <p>  The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is only approximately 75% self-sufficient in beef meat and must import approximately 350,000 tonnes of additional beef to satisfy national demand.  Ireland supplies the vast majority of this imported beef meat as one would expect given our proximity to the UK market.  In 2018, Ireland produced and exported more than 250,000 tonnes of beef meat to the UK representing almost 70% of total British beef imports.  With Brexit only six weeks away, we should be promoting live exports to all possible countries to counteract the potential drop in sales volumes into the UK, especially if a hard Brexit were to result in large tariffs on beef and sheep meat.</p> <p>  It will not be in the Irish beef and sheep farmers' best interest if this valuable source of competition is lost with little or no real scientific argument to back it up, other than emotive stances taken by non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  The beef processing industries and large multiples would be delighted with a ban on live exports as it would allow them to stifle and manipulate to the greatest extent possible the prices the primary producer receives.  The meat industry and UK multiples are fully aware that prices rise when live exports are buoyant.  Ensuring the live trade is hindered ensures a depressed live trade price and a cheaper price for the raw material for them.  Irish and all European farmers need to get a fair and true market value for their stock and this can only be achieved when there are multiple avenues of competition for livestock. </p> <p>  Irish livestock marts adhere to stringent EU legislation, as do the companies that export live animals.  Maintaining high animal welfare standards is not just the right thing to do.  It is also good business practice as any animal that becomes poorly or dies during transport represents an economic loss and nobody wants that to occur. </p> <p>  It is of great importance that the live export sector is heavily regulated.  Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 has been enacted to the letter of the law by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  If all EU countries ensured compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005, the NGOs would have very little cause for complaint with EU transporters of cattle and sheep.  The real issue with live animal transport in the EU is that current legislation is not being enforced in some eastern European member states and the reaction by NGOs and some Members of the European Parliament is simply to ban the transport of live animals.  This is flawed logic.  The consumer demands high animal welfare standards and ICOS agrees with that approach.  However, we need to promote, foster and enhance full compliance in other EU countries because simply banning the transport of all live animals could potentially cause bigger animal welfare issues in the future.  For example, if lesser quality dairy calves could not be exported to the Netherlands and Spain, as they have been for the past few years, what would happen to calf prices?  Would this trigger animal welfare issues because animals would be become worthless?  What we currently have in the form of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 does exactly as it states, namely, it provides protection of animals during transport.  As long as member states abide by the regulation, there is no animal welfare grounds on which to crudely ban all live exports. </p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has transposed in Irish law a very stringent interpretation of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005.  While on a practical level some exporters and farmers might not agree with all aspects of the legislation, it safeguards our live exports into the future.  Everything has to be done in full compliance with the regulations on stocking densities, disease status, planned routes and unloading at lairages, for example, in France, where calves are fed, given a rest period and then reloaded.  All of this has to be properly managed and that is the case.</p> <p>  All transport of live animals, especially animals from Ireland, comes under serious scrutiny from prominent animal welfare groups during peak calf export season.  Certain animal welfare lobby groups and action groups monitor us very closely, as do the regulatory bodies whose job it is to supervise this activity.  The issue is, therefore, in the public eye.  Some lobby groups intentionally stir up emotive arguments on the transport of young calves in particular because these animals are usually only a few weeks old.  However, calves are managed properly during transport.  It is vital we continue to manage these and other animals in the best possible manner to protect the markets that want to purchase Irish livestock.  We want to protect our reputation for raising quality livestock.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Scallan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021200002#C00400"><p>I will address the live export of calves and the number of calves that can transported by ship each week.  Last year, some 166,000 calves were exported from Ireland.</p><p>We think that something along the lines of 200,000 calves will be going out this year because of the price of beef, farmers and new entrants coming into the dairy sector, and other issues.  We are going to have an awful lot more calves to go out.  The issue we are having with our business is that we are limited by the space available in Cherbourg, France, when our calves come off the boat.  There are only two licensed premises in France.  These are capable of handling 4,000 calves a day, three times a week.  These operators say that they can take 12,000 calves a week.  What I have been saying to different organisations to which I have been speaking is that this capacity is not 100% right because it leaves out the fact that we have calves coming from the UK, from Northern Ireland.  Approximately 1,500 calves a week come down here and go out in the ships.  This leaves capacity for 10,500 calves a week.  In two weeks time we will be in full swing in respect of the calves.  We will be getting 10,500 calves out a week when, at this time of the year and considering what is happening with the numbers and so on, we should be peaking at 18,000 to 20,000 calves in each of our five or six busiest weeks.  There is, however, no space in the lairage.  Lairage is like a hotel over there in France where the calves are fed.  The calves come off the ship and rest for 12 hours before continuing on their journey.  The two lairages licensed at present can only take 4,000 calves.  If we discount the calves from the North, we are left with capacity for 3,500.  We cannot get the calves out because there is no room.  We have the customers for the calves, we have the capacity to handle them at our export points and we have the trucks to bring them.  The ships are not a problem at the moment.  The problem is the lairage.  </p><p> There has been a lot of discussion about the new Irish Ferries ship, which will sail on alternative days.  I met with farming organisations and some people from the Government and spoke to them about the issues we were going to have last October.  I was the only one who raised the issues and who said that I saw a problem coming in respect of the export business this year.  Everybody said that the ship was coming, that it would go on alternative days, and that we would be all right.  I said that was not true, that this ship would not come until May, and that it would be no good to us in May because the markets would be flooded by then.  The problem arises when the weather turns bad.  This happened on Thursday of last week.  There was no sailing for the calves on Thursday so that boat went out on Friday.  One ship took no calves out because its operators felt the weather was not correct for it to sail.  This ship is not as big as the one Stena operates out of Rosslare.  The boat left Rosslare with calves packed to the gunwhales and we went to the lairage.  There was no more room.  We had another two trucks of calves which we could not send.  It was okay that day.  The capacity was there.  We had 4,000 calves and they all went out.  We are going to have serious welfare issues in respect of the calves when we get two bad days together.  These farms cannot handle holding the calves over.  We cannot buy the calves off the farmers if we cannot export them because we have no room at the far side.  </p><p> The whole problem with this issue is that the livelihood of every farmer depends on the two men who own the two lairages that look after all our business is France.  We need a back-up and a contingency plan for bad weather so that, when the weather is going to be bad, we can use the alternative lairage which we were able to use for the last number of years, which is four hours further than Cherbourg.  We cannot use that lairage any more because of the legislation which was introduced.  There is capacity for an extra 4,000 calves per sailing which we cannot use.  We are snookered every way.  </p><p> The price of calves is going to collapse in Ireland.  With the price of beef there is going to be an awful lot of extra calves coming on the market this year.  Farmers are not interested in buying them because we are losing &euro;200 or &euro;300 per carcass.  People are not going to buy the calves.  The dairy farmers who are keeping them are not going to keep the extra calves because there is no money in it.  Everything is so costly to keep.  What are we going to do with the calves?  We need to find a plan.  In coming here today I am hoping that the committee will be able to look into the matter and see about an alternative plan for the weather and a plan in respect of the two people who are - I will not say "controlling" because that would not be a nice thing to say - doing their business in France and who have their lairages there.</p></speech>

Another problem is now coming down the line, which we must address and into which we must get the people who represent us to look.  We ship three decks of calves out on the trucks, 100 calves to a deck, for a total of 300 calves.  Different people in Europe are trying to bring in a law whereby calves coming from Ireland or anywhere else will have to be transported on only two decks.  This will mean 33% fewer calves per truck.  Coming back to the farmers again, it will not be me who loses out, but the farmers.  We will only be able to go out with two thirds as many calves if this legislation comes in.</p></speech>

As we are an island, we should be looking to see what measures we can get so that we are able to get our calves out.  As I see it, what is coming this year will have a devastating impact on the whole cattle business.  All of the calves left at home will have to be reared or whatever.  They will not be reared; they will be killed.  We are going to have to have a big look at welfare issues and costs in respect of what is coming down the road.  We are going to have a series of problems when the bad weather comes.</p></speech>

What he said to me was true enough.  He is 57 or 58 years of age.  He said that he had spent enough money on this business area.  He has an excellent set-up.  The welfare provisions are top of the range.  Everything is done, 100%.  No one could complain about his workmanship, the way he looks after the calves, or his premises.  He said that he did not have the money to put into the lairages.  I suggested that we could go to the farming organisations and that we could all put some money in together to build extra space in the lairage out there.  There is another thing at which we want to look.  We definitely need to have two more lairages operating in Cherbourg.  If anything happened to either of those guys tomorrow morning or if their businesses closed down, where would we go with our calves?  How would we get our calves out?  We can only travel for nine hours, take a one-hour rest, and then travel nine more hours.  It takes our best effort to get to the lairage in time and to keep within the letter of EU legislation.</p></speech>

The witnesses have outlined the importance of the live export sector to our beef industry.  There is massive price pressure on beef farmers this year and it is proving to be the most difficult year of many difficult years in recent history.  There will be massive pressure on the industry unless live exports grow in comparison with previous years.  The number of calves being produced, particularly in the dairy herd, is certainly growing.  Without additional outlets and volume we will only add to the domestic difficulties we have with prices.</p> <p>  Mr. Scallan outlined the difficulty relating to the two lairages, which is the other main factor creating a blockage.  He said that this year we should be in a position to export 200,000 calves.</p></speech>

Unless additional lairage capacity is sourced in the very short term, what numbers are likely to be exported over the coming months?  How many operate in the space in which Mr. Scallan operates?  How many people are in the business of exporting calves?</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle and ICOS do a lot of important work in this area.  There are issues around mart rules and the gathering of cattle for live exports, with some of them sourced on farms.  How relevant are the four-movement rule and the 30 day rule for live exports?  Are there outstanding issues relating to the conditions attaching to export licences for various countries?  Are they unnecessarily cumbersome or more onerous for us than for other live-exporting countries?  Are there opportunities to develop further live export routes and markets?  Are there any where we could make progress with a different policy impetus or more attention at national level?</p> <p>  Mr. Scallan spoke about the domestic situation with bad weather.  What do we need to do to provide capacity when weather causes disruption?  Are there alternative ports to Cherbourg?  I am aware that timelines are tight in the context of the legislation.</p></speech>

Live exports are essential from the point of view of balancing the beef market and we cannot overestimate their importance.  Mr. Scallan said 200,000 calves were our target and that we had the ferries, so the issue was lairage.  Is there more potential for the market if we had the transport facilities?  Are other countries going into veal units?  Some 40,000 cattle per week are being killed, and if we take 200,000 calves out, it will not be enough to bring our market back into equilibrium.  How many extra customers might there be and could we displace other countries with veal units?</p> <p>  Is another port an option?  Will Mr. Scallan expand on the timelines and say if it is possible to go into a Dutch port with calves?  How far does he have to travel from Cherbourg to the veal units after the rest period?</p> <p>  The density on trucks is a red herring and designed to make it uneconomical for us to export.  We had this argument seven to ten years ago and we made costly alterations to the trucks we took to the Continent.  I remember going to feedlots in Spain and Italy and looking at our weanlings, which caused us problems at the time.  We had to get our house in order because if we do not bring healthy animals to these places, we will not hold customers for very long.  No one wants an animal that arrives sick or unhealthy.  We had to make sure the weanlings were weaned and vaccinated.</p> <p>  We have no export outlet for older animals, that is, animals aged 12 years or more.  Could any such markets open up for us?  Is there any possibility of expanding the number of weanlings that can be exported, especially the dairy variety that are kept on farms?  The factories' focus is on getting Friesian bulls killed rather than the price.  Farmers with bulls aged under 24 months are on their knees, begging meat processors to take the bulls off them and they are making less than a culled cow from a suckler herd.  Is there any possibility of opening live markets for that type of stock?  This might put extra pressure on processors.</p> <p>  Bord Bia is a promotional body that seeks to secure markets for us.  Are the witnesses happy with Bord Bia's efforts to secure markets or do they feel its focus is more on processed meat?  Should more resources be put in to drive the numbers up?  Dairy cow numbers are going to continue to increase fairly significantly.  We have been killing nearly 40,000 cattle per week for the past three months.  It is as plain as the nose on one's face that, while the factories can kill them, they cannot sell them at an economical price for us.  It is not financially viable for farmers to produce beef at the prices being paid at the moment.  It would be great if we hit the target of 200,000, but even that would not be sufficient to put the market back into equilibrium.</p> <p>  The 12 hour rest period is, in my opinion, very reasonable.</p><p>I know calves that have been fed and had 12 hours rest in a warm bed will be in peak condition for continuing the journey.  This issue has been raised before.  Mr. Scallan said extra lairage space could be found four hours further from Cherbourg, but how near would that be to the final destination?  Is it possible to get into a Dutch port?  By how much would the current regulations on travel times be exceeded if live transports went to a Dutch port near the final destination?</p></speech>

It is clear that the live export market is needed to maintain prices for farmers, and we all recognise that.  I am interested in lairage, one of the key points that has been raised.  Mr. Scallan referred to the time factor and said that calves stop for 12 hours rest and feeding, etc., and then move on again.  In general, how long is the journey after that?  If additional lairage were available, would it have to be in that exact location or are there alternatives in the region?</p> <p>  On the regulations on export licences, particularly for heavier, finished cattle, which Deputy Cahill mentioned, I know Algeria and other markets have been opened up to some extent.  I believe there are difficulties, however, and cattle are not being exported to Algeria.  I would like to explore this a little and see what needs to be done to ensure that this can happen safely.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the various NGOs, lobby groups, etc., that are always looking at this under a microscope to find out what is happening and so on.  This may not be a bad thing, though, because it shows the world the quality of cattle and animals exported from Ireland, and that we can meet the highest standards.  I do not think scrutiny is a problem.  The problem is ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to deal with the regulations.</p> <p>  If longer journeys are required, for example, to north Africa, is it difficult to get boats and transportation in place to facilitate them?  Will the new boat that is coming online assist in that regard?</p> <p>  A point was made about the increasing numbers of cattle, and we all see the expansion of the dairy herd.  While this is certainly very good for people in the dairy business - they are making plenty of money - the excess calves coming from that market will pose a problem unless they can be got out of the country, as far as I can see, because there seems to be no other route for them.  The issue here is whether we have markets and whether we can find them without having to travel very long journeys.  That is one of the key questions.  If very long journeys do not need to be travelled, one mitigates much of the criticism because it is focuses on live exports to places at the far end of eastern Europe and further afield.  If we can keep the trade closer, we will overcome many of these issues.</p></speech>

The answer to that is "Yes" and we can also find them in Europe, where there are good markets.  The problem at present is that while the markets are there, the people involved in the exporting are not gelling correctly to follow up these markets.  There are very good markets in Poland, which is in the EU, but we are not using Poland to get in and sell our cattle.  Then we can go to the Balkans, which import many calves from different countries, including Russia.  My son and I went to Bosnia 18 months ago to have a look.  I was amazed by the way they fed the cattle and the big feedlots used out there, although I do not mean big feedlots with 400 or 500 cattle.  They were very interested in coming and there was no problem.  I went to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which went out of its way to get the licences approved and looked at all the things that had to be done.  We had meetings with officials and they could not have been more helpful.  The problem with many of these countries, however, is the ships.  The problem we must investigate is whether we can get the ships.  We need Bord Bia and others to come together and to sit down with ICOS and everyone else to find out what we can do to explore these markets, which are available for our cattle.  If a ship that can carry 4,000 cattle comes here, we need to have it chartered by perhaps ten people instead of one person.  This would create considerable activity in the market and increase the price of the cattle.  An awful lot of things can be done if we make a start.  After this week we will form a committee to explore where we can go with the cattle.</p></speech>

I am also talking about the likes of ICOS sitting down with us because it has the market system and people from Bord Bia.</p> <p>  To respond to one of the questions asked a moment ago, we do not get a fair crack of the whip with Bord Bia in terms of exports.  It is there for the meat industry, not the export industry.  We pay Bord Bia a weekly levy of &euro;1.90 per animal that leaves.  It should try to bring people in from the Balkans, Poland and other such countries into Ireland or bring the right people out to see where we can go ahead with this.  We need to get all these people sitting down together.  We have never got the exporters to sit down together.  Beef Plan is trying to put together a forum and represent exporters, speak on our behalf and so on.  The aim is to form an association.</p></speech>

The way it is at present, it does not matter who one is.  The bookings must be shared out with everyone.  We are unique in the way we do our business because we buy all our calves off-farm so we export all our cows mainly of a Friday and do perhaps four, five or six trucks or whatever of a Saturday.  Now we cannot do that.  We cannot put our plan together because all the space has been taken up.</p> <p>  I left out one other very important point there.  Our three sailing days are Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  If we are entering into the middle of Holland, we have a serious problem.  Due to their religious beliefs, people in that part of Holland will not accept calves coming in on Saturday evening and they have to work at the calves on Sunday.  This means that while going to Holland on Thursday may not be a non-runner, people do not want the calves landing on a Sunday as they have to do the work on them.</p><p>We are really working with two days to export all the calves, a Tuesday and a Saturday.  I do not know how we will find a way around that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Doyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021200002#G00200"><p>I will try to remember what members said.  Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of live exports and the four moves.  That is affecting our trade of cattle to the UK.  The UK labelling regulations have stymied that trade.  The four moves in 70 days is the basis of the bonus payments that factories initiated and we have discussed them here before.  It is a construct of the UK multiples.  How that will change after 29 March remains to be seen.  Will it change that?  Will it move back to no stipulations whatsoever?  Will that allow our free trade of live animals to reoccur in the UK?  It probably will not because we will have a tariff on the live animal just as we will on the dead animals.  The four moves is definitely hindering the live export of cattle to the UK.  If one looks at Bord Bia figures for the past ten years, we have been steadily decreasing our live exports to Northern Ireland and the UK on the back of the tightening of the labelling regulations and, as I said in my opening remarks, the tightening by the multiples of the beef processing sector to try to stymie beef prices as well as they can.</p> <p>  The 30 day tuberculosis rule on the export of weanlings has been an EU construct in place since 2000 and even before that.  It does not greatly affect the trading or export of many weanlings out of the country.  There was a change two years ago in the interpretation of sales of animals directly from a mart but we still facilitate that through negotiations by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with Europe and it does not hamper that trade greatly, but it is still an extra layer to our live exports.  The push from the Government on the tuberculosis forum to eradicate it by 2030 would significantly transform our ability to export animals.  There are certain requirements, even for carcass beef, for certain Chinese markets that have stipulations on sourcing animals that had tuberculosis and also, drifting into another Deputy's question, export to north African countries.  There are stipulations in the veterinary certificates from some north African countries relating to tuberculosis and when animals could have had a breakdown.</p> <p>  Mr. Scallan addressed lairage issues.  The lairage issue in France and the export of calves is a by-product of the dairy industry and the type of animals going to the veal units.  We have had an extra 300,000 of those animals born in the country in the past five years since quotas was ceased.  I contend that it is a national issue which we will have to grapple with.  Members have been told that we have a problem with the lairage in France, but this lairage is merely disembarkation lairage.  It is a shed that the animals need to exit the truck, be fed and watered, rest for 12 hours and be put back on the truck.  It is not a control point.  We do not need IT systems or a rigorous inspection by departmental staff, whether the French or Irish authorities.  I know I am giving a simplistic answer.  I believe it is a national interest issue.  If the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could rent a lairage or large areas of sheds, that would suffice to ensure that these animals have disembarked the trucks.  This is an issue for approximately six to eight weeks of the year but not for the rest of the year because the capacity of 4,000, albeit low, is more than adequate to soak up the volume of calves.  We have an issue for perhaps six weeks of the year.  It is completely understandable from the point of view of the Frenchman running these two lairages.  Why would he provide a service to Irish farmers for just six weeks?  It is a business decision.  Because of that and since it is a national issue for us, we will have to solve it, though it will be solved on French soil.</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, it is an issue of time rather than distance.  The problem is that they have to reach the greater Cherbourg area, so if it was extended 20 km or 30 km farther south, that may be it, since a person would be caught for time.  The problem with the time is that it is administered by the French authorities.  They administer penalties to our transporters.  For want of a better phrase, the French authorities will not allow us to sneak past, not that we want to.  The transport times are best practice.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about other exports and Bord Bia issues.  Bord Bia is our national authority for marketing our beef and lamb, both dead and alive.  This dovetails into a question that Deputy Cahill raised.  There is an adage at mart manager and dealer levels that one needs a good live trade to keep the dead trade alive.  Even though the numbers are quite small, at 200,000 animals out of 1.7 million slaughtered, that is still 9% to 10% of the total.  That is enough to keep the trade honest and to keep another bidder for animals.  We need to expand on that.  The north African markets are really the only markets for those older, larger one to two year old bulls or bullocks.  In 1994, we exported 250,000 live Friesian bullocks from Ireland.  That is one category alone, ignoring the weanlings and the calves going to the veal units.  I think the total figure for that year was in excess of 400,000.  That was a fantastic source of competition and I am sure that Deputy Cahill remembers selling animals that ultimately ended up on that boat.  It was great to have that extra source of competition and to remove that poorer quality, for want of a better phrase.  It is probably a poor phrase because the north Africans do not have a problem with that animal and it is quite reasonable in their eyes.</p></speech>

It is very visible in the veal units in Holland in its promotion of Irish livestock, but it needs to do more.  It is a bit of a difficulty for Origin Green to square with the promotion of live exports because we have so many enemies to live exports.  The NGOs and some consumers of Irish products are quite happy to consume Irish beef but they are not that happy to promote and endorse live exports.  It is therefore a difficult line that Bord Bia is walking, but it needs to put more resources towards this and in some way promote live exports across the world.  Across the world really means north Africa, some Balkan states, Turkey and beyond.  It needs to put a bigger effort into that because of what is happening with Brexit.  It is supposed to represent all beef and sheep, whether dead or alive, and perhaps it needs to be better resourced.</p> <p>  I do not have a figure off the top of my ceann for the maximum number of calves exported in any particular week.  I have a figure in my mind but it might be incorrect.  It is approximately 13,000 but that is maybe only a guess on my behalf and Mr. Scallan may have a better answer.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny asked about the additional time for rest lairage and the penalty.  Perhaps Mr. Scallan can answer this better but fixed penalties are issued to hauliers that breach the EU time regulations.  From memory, it is approximately &euro;500 per breach but that accumulates if they are caught repeatedly.  That was the issue that has maybe led to us discussing it here.  There was a change a year and a half to two years ago.  It was not a problem for the hauliers to make it to the next lairage point but the change in legislation completely undermined that and has led to this issue occurring now.  It did not happen in the past.</p></speech>

The driver can drive for nine hours, stop for one hour and drive for another nine hours.  It is known as 9-1-9.  The ferry journey takes 16 or 17 hours and when the transport leaves the ferry, the driver must go to the nearest point to feed the calves.  Wherever he drives in Europe he must apply the 9-1-9 rule.  If he does not reach the destination in 19 hours, he must stop for 12 hours to rest and feed the calves before continuing.</p></speech>

There are only three or four vessels that jump through the hoops of EU registration and approval and are licensed to take animals out of the country.  Various stringent parameters apply, for example, they must be stable.  These boats are off in various parts of the world because live exports go around the globe.  It is sometimes difficult to get one's hands on one of these boats.  The number that comply with EU legislation and our Department's standards is quite low.  That trade occurs only when it is economic.  The amount the north African countries can pay is sometimes quite small.  Letters of credit have to be generated and some of the north African countries have been politically unstable in the recent past.  That happened too in the Turkish market which was showing plenty of promise for us until a year and a half ago when the currency took a nosedive.</p> <p>  We do not have home markets for these animals.  We do not have a well developed meat industry.  The Dutch have because it has been a tradition for them.  They have ready access to the raw material to feed these animals, such as milk powders.  We do not have that tradition. </p> <p>  The core point is that the suggestion that the EU may completely ban live transport of animals from the EU to third country markets needs to be resisted with the assistance of this committee, the Department and beyond in Europe.  Such a ban would be the thin end of the wedge as far as the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, are concerned.  If they got live transport of animals from the EU to third countries banned, we would lose our potential in the north African markets and the Turkish market.  They are being lost because there is no consistency in the EU 27 to enact a law that has been in place since 2005.  The Bulgarian border is the flashpoint with the third country of Turkey.  The combination of Turkey and its issues, and the control posts, has led to the notion that we should simply ban all transport of live animals simply because one member of the EU has an internal difficulty in manning its control points.  This could suddenly mean we lose live transports within the EU.  The NGOs would be delighted to have third country exports banned because they would then go for banning all live transport of animals.  They have a notion that this is all integrated and an animal should not be moved unless it is going direct to slaughter, or they do not want them slaughtered at all.  That is fine if that is their belief but if there is an integrated approach that we cannot transport an animal, it will annihilate farming as we know it.</p></speech>

We had a good market in England years ago but, as time passed, we were unable to send Irish cattle to England and have them killed in the slaughterhouses there and <i>vice versa</i>.  I cannot understand this because we can send Irish calves to Spain, which takes them from maybe eight or ten different countries, and Holland and it does not make any difference where the cattle come from, yet we cannot have our cattle killed in England.  Traditionally, we could send the cattle to England by boat or ferry but that all stopped in recent years.  I cannot understand the reason for that.  Our cattle cannot cross the Border into Northern Ireland to be killed and <i>vice versa</i>.  However, when the factories in the North are short of cattle they will come South and buy the cattle and bring them up to the North.  I cannot understand why this trade has stopped.  It hampers this business because in England there is a big market for the store cattle, the bulls and heifers.  Whether the market is being controlled, or who is controlling it, that is there to be seen.</p></speech>

They do not want them if they are heavier than that because feeding in Spain is much cheaper than here, as are labour and electricity, and the weather and the climate are different.  They can feed the cattle much more cheaply than we can.  They are interested in them only up to a certain weight.  We must look to the north African countries to export the Friesian bulls because the market for Holstein Friesian cattle in Ireland is getting worse and worse.  The only reason we are not in serious trouble is that we have been able to export the calves.</p> <p>  If there are movements on the cattle, the owner is penalised &euro;70 or &euro;80 because the supermarkets do not want the cattle moving.  In this country for hundreds of years, farmers have moved cattle.  Some people keep them for six months before selling them on and the next guy keeps them for six months and sells them on.  A lot of money was stirring for the local communities, with people buying different things but all of this has been stopped.  We cannot sell our cattle.  The factories want cattle bred and fed on the farm then sold into the meat plants.  There is a monopoly with regard to these movements and we must look into it very carefully to find out what the problem is.  I notice there are people buying weanlings to go to Spain.  It does not matter what movements the cattle have made.  Ireland and England are the only countries of the 27 EU countries that have this issue about cattle making four movements.  I believe this is a big factor in people in this country rearing calves and cattle because there is such an emphasis on the penalty if an animal moves four times, with &euro;70 or &euro;80 taken off its price.  </p> <p>  In response to Deputy Kenny's question about the ships going to different ports in France, we can do that and reach the other lairage areas in time but there are no ships to do it.  Irish Ferries and Stena Line are not especially interested in cattle for the peak times.  They are bringing lorries to France which then travel onwards to other destinations.</p><p>It does not pay them to go to another port with five, six or ten trucks of calves.  I see a lot of problems arising down the line in the export of calves because of the activities of Animals Angels or animal rights activists.  If we do not all work together to exert a lot of pressure in Europe, we will have a serious problem down the line and I am not talking about in ten years' time.  It will arise in one or two years' time.</p></speech>

The problem is not with lairage in Ireland arises when we get to the far side.  The welfare issue in Ireland arises when calves cannot be exported.  Are farms capable of handling all of the calves when cows are calving?  We need to move calves out as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  The other point about exports, on which people involved in the export industry should have been consulted, is that there was a plan to allow calves to be sold when they were ten days old.  They are entering the market system, being bought, possibly by exporters, and held for four days because they cannot be shipped anywhere in Europe before they are 14 days old.  If I am right, the rule in Holland is that they may be sold when they are 15 days old.  From a welfare perspective, we must bring forward a plan which would show other countries that we were not selling calves at a very young age, that we were keeping them to give them a chance to develop before they were allowed to travel.  Legislation should be brought forward to prevent calves from being sold before they are 15 days old.  This would be better for everybody and the health of calves, but we are not being consulted or asked for our opinion on many of these rules.  That is why we must form an association to speak to the right authorities and say we must find a way around-----</p></speech>

There are certainly monopolies in those jurisdictions which are preventing the slaughter of Irish cattle.  The same applies in respect of the guidelines on cattle younger than 30 months.  If the factories are stuck for cattle, they will not give a damn if cattle are 40 months old, but if there are plenty of cattle available, they will find a problem with everything.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Doyle and Mr. Scallan.  Do they agree, in respect of bed and breakfast arrangements, that taking cattle to marts where they might not be sold should not be classified as movement?  In Ireland it is classified as such.  We could actually help in that regard.  Mr. Doyle was right in saying, in respect of the food chain in England, stipulations had been put on us, but there are certain movements which should not count.  Should we look at movements between Bord Bia-approved farmers who work under the same regulations?  </p> <p>  Is Mr. Scallan saying it would be advisable for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to work with exporters to find alternative accommodation in France?  As he rightly pointed out, there will be a glut of calves between February and April.  In sending stronger cattle rather than calves is there a problem in obtaining licences and having the paperwork in order?  Are exporters being held up in that regard?  </p> <p>  I have a straight question for Mr. Scallan about Bord Bia.  Representatives of the meat factories are brought on trade missions.  Has Bord Bia ever brought exporters of live cattle on trade missions to other countries to promote the export of cattle on the hoof?</p></speech>

The Chairman has said I have to be careful about what I say, but I have to be very honest.  We have been involved in the business for the past 20 years and I pay my levies to Bord Bia every week, but I believe it does nothing for me and that it is a waste of my money.  It is a waste for exporters.  We have to look at something different because its mind is set on the beef industry and selling beef.  It is not in place to do anything about live exports.  I am getting no help from it.  Between off-farm sales and what went through our books this year, we are talking about the guts of 40,000 calves, but I am getting no help from it.  One issue arose and I requested information from it, with a view to meeting some people in Poland.  The email went to the wrong address and I waited for six weeks for someone to come back to me about arranging a meeting to sell calves to Poland where there is a market, by which time the information was of no use to me.  Personally, I believe we have to look at many things.  Bord Bia is good for the beef industry, but it is of no help to exporters.</p></speech>

The reality, as the dogs on the street know, is that once the kill goes above the figure of 30,000 each week, we are in trouble.  The factory can pull down one's trousers and the farmer is left with a lower price.  They are the facts.  Whether we like it, that is what happens.  What is the potential as between calves and bigger cattle?  That is what I want to know.  To look again at Mr. Scallan's figures, 2.4 million calves are born and 1.7 million are slaughtered.  Therefore, we are talking about a figure of 700,000 cattle.</p><p>Are we capable of pushing that up with our calves, weanlings and Friesian bullocks of over a year old?  Are there markets we could utilise to keep the scales balanced in view of the number of cattle being killed in this country?</p></speech>

There is a lot of potential, but it is not being explored at the moment.  If we had the right people working for us and the right committee lined up, we could look at these different countries.  It is very hard to have a foot in two camps and one cannot work both for the meat industry and in exports.  One needs a body of people who can look into exports, and there is a lot of potential in the Balkans, as well as Poland.  We lost our biggest market four years ago.  We sent Ros&eacute; calves to Holland at between four and five years old but they were a bit rough.  They were not sweet and were not really good enough for the Spanish market but they were good enough for the Dutch market.  As a result of TB in Ireland, Holland decreed that once an Irish calf entered a rearing shed, it could not leave.  The Ros&eacute; calves were to be reared to ten weeks and then shipped to elsewhere in Holland or to Germany, but we lost the market.  We should never have lost it.  It was a very important market because it kept the price of the Friesian calves up in Spain but all the extra calves now have to go to Spain.  As a result of TB, the calves that we send to Holland cannot move out of the units they go into and they have to stay there until they die at one year old.</p> <p>  There are no problems with other markets because one can move cattle and sell them.  We have to have ten ships so that they can be called on at any time, and two or three are not enough.  The potential is there and we have the livestock to ship.  We have the best animal welfare in the whole of the European Union.  The Department has always been more than fair and very helpful when we have looked for certification, but the biggest problem we have is the four-movement rule.  The number of people involved in this in rural Ireland is getting smaller and smaller.  If I buy a calf in the market system, bring it home, and then resell it to a farmer, it involves three movements.  Is that right?</p></speech>

He suggested it might be good for the farming organisations or the Department to secure further lairage there.  How far did Mr. Scallan get with his conversations on this matter?  All business is based on supply and demand and Mr. Scallan seems confident that he could get rid of at least 200,000 calves if he had the lairage and the facilities.  How do the potential customers pick up the cattle that Mr. Scallan cannot supply on account of the regulations and restrictions?  If they find it difficult to find other suppliers, would they be interested in getting involved by part-funding additional lairage so that they can get calves which meet all the health and welfare regulations?  Can they get their calves readily enough elsewhere?</p> <p>  Brexit aside, will Mr. Scallan explain the land bridge?  How does going north across England via the land bridge compare with going to Cherbourg?  Is it a runner or not?  There may not end up being a land bridge, of course, but how would it compare, timewise and in the context of the regulations?</p></speech>

He said it was more in our interest to expand capacity than it was in the interest of a private business person in France.  Is there not already a capacity issue there?  We do not have the capacity to ramp up live exports but we would need to do a lot more than now to address the problems with the number of calves we have to deal with.</p><p>As such, there is, in effect, a capacity issue regarding our ability to grow exports in the way we need.  Is that a fair assessment?  Some of this may have been answered.  Mr. Scallan places a great deal of emphasis on the fact that there are customers and ships and the problem is the lairage facilities.  Is Mr. Scallan saying there is demand in our markets which we are not meeting?  What countries or markets is that happening in?  How much are we missing out on?  Can Mr. Scallan or Mr. Doyle quantify the loss?  We want to export more live animals but are we missing opportunities right now because of the constraints described?  Mr. Scallan is an exporter.  At what point is he finished with the job of exporting?  He brings the animals to the lairage; does he bring them onwards or does someone pick them up?  How does it work in general?  Mr. Scallan has contracts with people.  Are they flexible contracts?  If he had 4,000 calves a day and the entire exclusive use of a ship and the lairage, could he meet the demand?  Does it work like that?  The main emphasis today has been on expanding the lairage as a solution.  Are there other elements to a solution?  I want to be clear as we go forward on what we need to do to increase actual live exports and our capacity to export.</p></speech>

Farmers in Kerry are very concerned, especially about calves from dairy herds, the numbers of which are increasing year on year.  That is especially so since the then-Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, advised farmers they should increase milk production.  If one increases the number of dairy cows, one will increase the number of calves from the dairy herd.  As Mr. Doyle said, to ensure we have a vibrant dead trade, we must have a good live trade.  It is a major issue and a lot of meetings are taking place among farmers on the new phenomenon of the beef plan.  The major topic of discussion is dairy calves and their export and we are delighted to meet the witnesses face to face given its importance.</p> <p>  Regarding the lairage issue, whose responsibility is it?  How can the Government, the Minister or the members of the committee as political representatives help the witnesses with lairage in another country?  If that was dealt with, more calves could be taken out of the country so the nub of the matter is how we can help, if at all.  Depending on the answer I receive, I might come back in later.</p></speech>

I come from an area that depends greatly on the live export trade.  At this time of year, we are coming into the peak calving season.  I have watched today's proceedings closely.  The issue of lairage has been touched on but I want to ask about the following.  Exporters agreed to the 12 hour rest period to let calves get nourishment and a chance to lie down and rest.  Afterwards, there is a journey of ten to 20 hours.  Why are we worried about giving calves such a long rest?  Does the calf need 12 hours rest?  There is a contradiction in that the calf can then be sent on a 20 hour journey on an empty stomach, to be blunt.  Do we need the 12 hours or could we get out of the lairage after five or six hours?  In that case, the calf's welfare would be better maintained in that it would at least have some bit of nourishment rather than to travel on an empty stomach after 12 hours.  That could increase the turnover.  Could we allow livestock to move sooner than 12 hours?  Do we need the 12 hours?  Is it right to have 12 hours?  Even the animal welfare people must understand that to give calves 12 hours lying down and then load them into a cattle box to travel on an empty stomach is a contradiction.  Should we not allow the animal to move within five or six hours?  If one travels to Australia and has to stop over in the Middle East, one is happy to get out and walk around for a couple of hours before getting on the flight again.  One does not want to be hanging around but would rather keep the show going.</p></speech>

If one asks them to do things like that, they will only laugh.  They are buying cattle in other countries also.  If they tell us they want 500 or 2,000 calves this week, they are not interested in how I feed them or what I do with them.  All they are interested in is the price at which I can supply quality healthy calves and get them to a destination.  It is all down to a financial thing and the welfare issue.  As we ship the calves from Ireland, our farmers and exporters should be the ones looking at building the sheds.  We want to sell a product, whereas they are buying.  It is up to us to see how we can help.  We can speak all day about it, but the issue we have is the contingency plan to get the calves for the six-week period.  That is what Mr. Doyle has said here too.  We need to get those calves out.  We need to get something done immediately.  We need to have a plan to move the calves if the weather is bad and a plan to increase the lairage capacity.  People in Holland and Spain are getting calves from Lithuania, Latvia and Germany too.  Everyone says the Irish calves are very good.  I have seen the German, Lithuanian and Latvian calves and they are every bit as good as the Irish ones; however, the Irish calves are healthy.  They are a different calf and they are better bred, but there is no difference when one looks at them.  Calves coming from Germany come 40 weeks of the year and they need the baby calves in Ireland then for ten or 12 weeks.  After that, it is fine.  One can come and it is not a big issue.  When the calves start to come again in Germany, they start to take the calves from there again.  They are really only interested in our calves when calves are scarce.  However, if we had a plan whereby calves were going on a weekly basis, they would set up a feeding plant to take our calves the whole time.  We only have the calves leaving Ireland for 20 weeks, really.</p></speech>

The answer was that option was a non-runner because Bord Bia is a Government body and it was not going to put money into something like that.  It was too late then to do anything about the issue.  We had four or five months where we could have done something.  As Mr. Doyle stated, all we need is a shed.

Something needs to be done with the calves coming onto the market now because they are not wanted in Ireland.  We have to find a way to deal with that.  Something should have been put in place already.  I went to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and explained that this problem was coming.  I have told the Department and everybody else that this problem was coming since October.  I feel that because we have had no representation as a body of exporters we could not get anything done.  If we had been standing as one, perhaps we would have been able to achieve something.  The problem is on top of us now and we must organise to get something done very fast.</p></speech>

One of the problems we have is the way our dairy industry has evolved.  It is predominantly grass-based and extremely seasonal.  About 700,000 calves will be born this February out of a total of 2.4 million.  Some of our competitors in Europe are calving all year around.  They do not have this big bulge of calves to deal with and those calves are transported small distances.  Calves from Germany that end up in veal lots in The Netherlands are only on the trucks for four or five hours.  There is no problem in that case in complying with the 9-1-9 regulations.  The 12 hour stop is an EU regulation so we cannot change it.  We cannot get away from leaving the calves for that 12 hour period.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin asked if we need more markets.  We do, of course.  Deputy Fitzmaurice clearly stated that once we go over 30,000 animals slaughtered per week we are price takers at farm level.  We have been at 40,000 per week for four or five months of this year and the resultant weakness in the beef price can be seen.  That is the issue with these calves.  We could do with every single market we can get to try to bring the market back to equilibrium.  At present, calves go to veal units, older calves go to Spain and older animals still go to North Africa.  We need to keep and develop all of those markets as much as we can.  One of my points concerning Bord Bia related to that issue.  It needs to best resource live exports.  I do not know what portion of Bord Bia's overall budget is put towards live exports.  Perhaps that needs a fresh look from Bord Bia's point of view.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Doyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021200002#M02000"><p>I could give an answer too, but I do not think I will chance it.  That issue most definitely needs urgent attention from Bord Bia.  As I said, it is conflicted from an organisational point of view and looking over our shoulders, as we are, at NGOs, vegans and vegetarians and how best to navigate that area.  Live exports are a hot potato for many people to deal with at the moment.  We are trying to navigate this issue in our discussion here today.  Cherbourg is just one small aspect of a greater issue.  It speaks to the need to remove as many animals as we can off of our island.  We are unique in this situation.  As I stated in my opening address, 90% of our cattle - it is less so in the case of sheep - have to find a home somewhere else.  They have to be consumed somewhere other than our island.  Every other European country more or less consumes what it produces.  We are always going to be caught, from a political perspective, by rules and regulations on transport.</p> <p>  I will wrap up by saying this issue on transport is one of non-conformance throughout the entire EU.  Some member states have, however, made unilateral decisions to even trump those present regulations.  Transporters with three decks of calves, or two decks if the animals are over six months old, are not allowed to transit through The Netherlands, for example.  It goes beyond EU legislation on animal welfare and that has been done for that country's own benefit.  This a natural progression and we are going to have to deal with these increased restrictions on animal welfare.  We have no problem complying with what is there.  This one particular issue in Cherbourg, however, is a symptom of our expansion, our seasonality, and that it is not economic for this lairage to be run in the fashion we would like it to be.  I also refer to increased monitoring of EU regulations.  If we went back two or three years, there was no problem with our transporters going directly to The Netherlands.  That was probably wrong because legislation was being breached.  </p></speech>

We are meeting very exacting standards as it is.  If welfare standards are raised, then the economics of exporting go out the window.  We changed our lorries ten or 12 years ago at great expense.  Our calves and weanlings arrive in perfect condition.  There comes a time when we have to state that these animals are able to lie down in the lorries where they are comfortable, ventilated and have water.  They have everything when they are travelling.  If we give into demands to increase standards, then the hand brake is going to come up at some stage and it is not going to be economical to transport those animals.  I would be holding ground on this issue.  Our calves are arriving in perfect condition now.  We are the only island country within the EU and we have to travel.  Once we are getting our calves delivered in good condition, we should state that enough is enough.</p></speech>

My point was perhaps misunderstood.  Certain countries within the EU are trumping the regulations and seeking to go beyond them.  We are fully compliant.  I fully defend Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 as being a perfect standard to ensure good animal welfare.  We are complying with it and are happy to comply with it.  Some countries, unfortunately, are taking a unilateral decision, and some consumers are also taking a unilateral decision, to impose standards that I agree will be uneconomic for us to comply with.  We have to deal with the cards we have, however, and one of those at the moment is the issue in Cherbourg.  Our bigger issue is to promote live exports to deal with our increase in calf registrations of 400,000 in the past five years.</p></speech>

It is a delicate subject, as the witnesses have stated.  They are dealing with it regularly.</p><p>We have no problem complying with regulations but a valid point has been made by Mr. Doyle about what could be coming down the line and we must be aware of that.  It is crucial that we can develop further markets.  We have started a process in the past number of weeks of considering the future of the beef sector, and there is a major question mark over it.  Many people have plenty of opinions but there is no silver bullet solution to the matter, as we know.  Live exports will be a crucial part of the issue.  If we produce 300,000 or 400,000 calves on an annual basis over and above what was produced previously, we could only manage that by getting them out of the country as quickly as possible.  We have to do it as efficiently and as economically as possible.  This is a crucial sector of industry that must be developed further.  The contribution of witnesses today has been very important and we are delighted to have them to discuss the matter so we can do our bit to move on the issue.</p></speech>

A couple of weeks ago Scottish calves were going out through Ramsgate and animal rights people were there.  They started banging on and punching the lorries, as well as throwing objects at them.  If the Irish calves travel across the United Kingdom, we will have great difficulties because the English have such an issue with the export of live animals.  Most of the boats on the east coast - the calves would have to get to that coast - would not take the Irish calves.  P&amp;O will not take calves on boats going from England.  A small boat that carries six loads of calves goes from Ramsgate but most of the shipping companies do not want to carry the calves because of the problem with animal rights activists.</p></speech>

Interestingly, the number of Irish students in the South declined by 38% in the five years leading to the 2015 to 2016 year.  In contrast, the number of Northern Irish students studying in Irish higher education institutions increased by 24% over the same time period.  Numerically, the figure stood at 1,200, with 980, or 82% of the total, pursuing undergraduate programmes.</p> <p>  This is only part of the picture.  In the 2017 to 2018 academic year, more than 10,000 students from the Republic of Ireland were in UK higher education institutions, with more than half pursuing undergraduate programmes for the first time, while a further 44% were undertaking postgraduate studies.  In the same year, there were 2,426 students from the UK in Irish higher education institutions, with 63% of these doing undergraduate studies.  Clearly, not all of these students are eligible for SUSI supports.  In the 2017 to 2018 academic year, 1,475, or 14%, of the Irish students attending UK higher education institutions were in receipt of a SUSI grant, which amounted to &euro;5.2 million.  In terms of the number of UK students in Irish higher education institutions, 205, or 9%, were eligible for the SUSI grant.  This amounted to &euro;720,000.</p> <p>  Since my appointment, my goal has been to protect the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place between educational institutions on a North-South and an east-west basis.  There are examples of this at all levels.  I look at the north-west strategic partnership, where Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Donegal Education and Training Board work closely with the University of Ulster and North West Regional College from the North to ensure further and higher education provision are closely aligned with the skills and industrial needs of the region.  In many senses, the Border does not figure as these educational institutions seek to develop a shared education and skills strategy.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge the commitment of those educators at all levels who have built collaborations across the Border.  They deserve commendation and our appreciation.  The foundations they have built must be protected and strengthened.  Indeed, there has been a shared education ecosystem between Ireland and the United Kingdom since the foundation of the State and even before that.  It is hugely important that we protect and preserve this collaboration in the interests of our young people and in the interests of the quality of our education and training system.  In this regard, we are working to maintain the common travel area, which will protect much of the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place in education on a North-South and an east-west basis.  The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education and I view the amendment that is the focus of today's engagement as one of the key responses of the Department to the challenges of Brexit.  It will facilitate student mobility between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the wider UK, and enable me to meet education obligations under the common travel area.  I will now ask the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education to take the committee through the proposed amendment.</p></speech>

I am particularly keen to protect the excellent co-operation and collaboration between the higher and further education systems of Ireland and the UK and the students, teachers, staff and researchers who benefit from the co-operation.  The importance of the maintenance of the common travel area cannot be understated and we are making this a priority of our Brexit preparations with our UK and Northern Ireland colleagues.</p> <p>  The mobility of students and their continued access to support payments are central to the education ecosystem of which the Minister has just spoken.  We know we must make legislative amendments to underpin these key aspects of student mobility.  I will explain the nature of the amendments proposed, which are broadly technical in nature.  They are designed to legislatively permit student support payments to be made to eligible Irish students in the UK and to UK students in Ireland.  As things stand, the SUSI grant can be paid only to students studying in the EU.  Once the UK leaves the EU it will become a third country.  The proposed changes will allow the Minister for Education and Skills to prescribe certain types of students, institutions and courses as approved for the purposes of the SUSI grant system.  This will provide the Minister with the power to extend the SUSI grant scheme to encompass the UK post Brexit.</p> <p>  The Bill has five heads, with heads Nos. 1 and 5 focusing on interpretation and title and the commencement date, respectively.  Heads Nos. 2, 3 and 4 cover the definitions of an approved institution, approved courses and students.  Head No. 2 of the Bill, on approved institutions, allows the Minister for Education and Skills to recognise certain publicly funded higher education institutions in a prescribed country as approved institutions.  Head No. 3 describes what an approved course is.  This allows the Minister to prescribe certain courses in a prescribed country as approved courses for the purposes of the SUSI grant.  The impact of these two heads of the Bill is to enable the Minister to provide for the UK to be a prescribed country to allow the payment of the SUSI grant to Irish students who pursue an approved course in an approved institution in the UK.</p> <p>  Head No. 4 of the Bill extends the definition of a student to include nationals of a country prescribed by the Minister.  This will ensure that UK nationals will maintain eligibility for the SUSI grant.  The proposed amendment to the Student Support Act 2011 will enable Ireland to maintain one of its key commitments under the common travel area, which is the maintenance of the right to study in either jurisdiction.</p></speech>

My fundamental question is why ithe Minister is not in a position to indefinitely allow people born on the island of Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland, to be treated the same as EU students going to college on a unilateral basis?  Is this envisaged?  It will be the case for students starting next year but not for students starting the following year.  I suggested some time ago we could just do it unilaterally and, hopefully, the British would do the same.  There is already a chilling effect on the movement of students on this island and east-west movement because they cannot plan for the future and many of them are making plans at present.  May I ask supplementary questions later?</p></speech>

What discussions has the Minister had on what will happen?</p><p>Presumably there will be a transition period, but whatever form Brexit takes, we must look to the longer term in relation to the long-established patterns of students from Ireland travelling to Britain for higher education and <i>vice versa</i>.  <br/><br/>I read the House of Lords report on Horizon 2020 and Erasmus.  I gather from it that they will support British students to travel for Erasmus and support continued interaction between EU States and the UK on Horizon 2020.  Can the Minister clarify from our side if those Horizon 2020 programmes which are shared between British and Irish institutions will be affected or in respect to Irish students travelling to Britain for Erasmus?<br/><br/>I raise the Middletown Centre for Autism and whether Brexit has implications on it.  It is a joint project between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is close the Border but located in the Republic.  It provides services for children on the autism spectrum.  Does the Minister know whether Brexit will have any effect on it?</p></speech>

The Minister's opening statement noted the increase in students from the North studying in institutions in the Republic.  That figure only goes up to 2016; however in September there was a 20% decrease in similar applications for Trinity College Dublin.  One would imagine that might be students and parents panicking due to the uncertainty of whether fees might increase this September or from September next year.  Will the Minister give a definite commitment that fees for students from the North will remain the same?  </p> <p>  How well equipped is SUSI to deal with this matter?  From my own experiences, SUSI operates in a very regimented, black and white way, with very little wriggle room if different scenarios arise.  It can be quite difficult to deal with and it can take a long time to get case information to it.  The Minister is saying that people should not be affected but I can envisage SUSI telling them that their address states that they are outside of the eligible area.  SUSI, with all respect, can be difficult to deal with and is likely to have those difficulties.  How ready is it for this?     </p></speech>

There are a lot of hypothetical questions such as what happens if it is a disorderly or orderly Brexit.  Regardless of which it is, this legislation will still be needed.  We will still need to change the legislation either way.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked why students from Northern Ireland will not be treated the same as French or Spanish students.  Part of the Brexit deal between the European Union and the UK, which was accepted at Westminster, was that there would be provision within the backstop to ensure that there would be singular alignment.  That was not accepted by the UK.  Discussions are ongoing as to where that will take us.  Central to what we are doing here is the protection of the common travel area.  That is sacrosanct in every piece of work we do, whether it is on a North-South or east-west basis.  The key mechanism for that is the Good Friday Agreement.  At all times, whether it was Declan Kelleher and his colleagues in Brussels or officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Good Friday Agreement had to be protected in all its parts.  Part of that was the flow of students, wherever they wanted to study, workers' mobility and so on.  We are in a position where we do not know what will happen in the next six weeks.  We must be vigilant but one thing is sure, as someone who comes from Donegal, we cannot contemplate going back after the great work that has been done over the past 20 years with communities coming together.  Education has been an integral part of that.  It could be students who can now do a joint course between Queens University Belfast and LyIT, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, or students being able to do a combined course between the Ulster University in its Magee campus in Derry and Letterkenny.  These are practical examples of education transcending any kind of physical border.  Our duty is to ensure that we protect this.</p></speech>

It is very important to highlight that at all times we will encourage the continued movement of people whether it is North-South or east-west.

The question was about the treatment of students from the North of Ireland after 2019.  The Minister made an announcement in January in relation to 2019.  My question is why has the Minister not announced it unilaterally forever.  People are making plans today for 2020.  The Minister says he wants to uphold the free movement of students but he is actually doing the opposite by leaving that uncertainty there.  It is no skin off our nose, as a State - in fact, it is hugely beneficial to us - if we tell students from the North that they are welcome.  However, the Minister is not saying that.  In fact, he is saying the opposite.  He is telling them that it is okay if they come here this September but after that we do not know.</p></speech>

I had to move really quickly to provide certainty to the parents in Northern Ireland.  I met one of the mothers in Belfast two weeks ago.  She said they had been in a very bad place because they did not know whether the student contribution fee of &euro;3,000 was going to be protected.</p><p>What will happen in the following two years is a reasonable and fair question.  It was asked in the D&aacute;il where I answered the Deputy's question.  I will be happy to work with him to ensure we bring that certainty to the matter in the future.  In the first week of January I had work to do for September.  I did it to bring that certainty to the matter.  If the question is whether we have to move on from it, I am happy to do so.</p><p> The Horizon 2020 programme is within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Nevertheless, Erasmus+ is an important programme, under which more than 30,000 students are studying in the United Kingdom.  Discussions are ongoing on the matter which will not require any legislative change.</p><p> On the issue related to the Middletown Centre for Autism which was raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in the context of Brexit, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland is anxious to protect the work of the centre and the service it provides for children on the island of Ireland.  I share its determination in that regard.</p></speech>

We know that there is a lot of uncertainty.  My officials in the Department of Education and Skills who are present have been working on the matter for two and a half years.  We have been told that the legislation we need to pass relates to the SUSI grant.  The rest depends on Brexit and what is decided about the common travel area.  There are risks.  As has been well publicised, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Erasmus+ programme may lead to the termination of opportunities under the programme for collaboration between schools and other educational institutions in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  In particular, it may affect staff and student exchanges.  It is also possible that if the United Kingdom leaves the programme, a number of the 30,000 students under it will divert to Ireland and thus create greater challenges for us in the higher education sector.  Approximately one month ago the European Commission published a draft amended regulation to enable EU students currently in the United Kingdom and UK students currently in other EU member states to complete their exchange beyond 29 March.  I welcome this.</p> <p>  To reply to Deputy Thomas Byrne's question, everything revolves around the end game and the decisions that will be made, especially on the common travel area.  We have begun discussions on what will happen next year.  Once a decision has been made on the common travel area, we will be able to address the various contingency plans that need to put in place for the future.</p></speech>

In the context of Brexit, what steps has the Department taken to attract academic talent who may be considering leaving Britain?

What efforts is the Department making to ensure Irish research will be multipolar and international?  All of the presentations in the Brexit and Horizon Europe workshop proceedings mentioned that the issue of researcher mobility was crucial, while one of the speakers stated mobility in Europe was a key aspect of research.  There is real concern about whether we will be able to compete for graduates if we cannot train our own.</p> <p>  The area of climate knowledge is fast-paced and changing and the need for skill sharing and mobility has become twice as important.  What efforts are we making to ensure we will be more independent and self-reliant in acquiring skills for the green economy?  At a previous committee meeting on apprenticeships I noted that there was a severe lack of engineers and construction workers for retrofitting and other green build activities, whereas most of those who are available have had to be trained abroad.  The United Kingdom is the closest country in which people speak English.  In advance of Brexit, what efforts are we making to cultivate these skills, given that many of them were built in the United Kingdom because of EU directives and regulations, including the nearly zero energy building standard.  According to the Irish Green Building Council, 54% of Irish organisations that participated in the World Green Building Trends 2018 SmartMarket report expect their projects to be green by 2021, well above the global average of 47%.  The projections are led not only by client demand but also EU regulations.  When the regulations change after Brexit, from where will our skill set come?</p> <p>  The Minister indicated that Horizon 2020 was within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but I think it is within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  The United Kingdom is the second largest recipient of funding under Horizon 2020.  It has received 15.2% of the grants distributed, or &euro;5.7 billion, under the programme thus far.</p><p>As well as funding nuclear research projects, Horizon 2020 supports scientific partnerships with countries across Europe and beyond, provides access to large-scale international research facilities and joint infrastructure, and offers fellowships for talented researchers to spend time working abroad.  In the wake of Brexit, is there a way this funding could be accessed by Ireland?  Could it be used to return to our recent high standards after years of cuts and decline?  As the UK loses access to Horizon 2020, many UK academics will be looking for English language opportunities.  What steps are we taking to attract academics from the UK, including the many brilliant Irish academics?</p></speech>

Funding has been increased.  For the past two budgets, the fund for the Irish Research Council is &euro;2.5 million for young researchers.  Science Foundation Ireland has been working on this for the past two and a half years since the result of the Brexit referendum, as have our higher education institutions.  From my previous role, I know that Science Foundation Ireland would have been talking to the various higher education institutions, even in the UK, to see if we could collaborate and perhaps share senior academics.</p> <p>  A question was asked about English language units.  I am bringing the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This Bill will ensure that we have a very high-quality product in English language schools.  I have got it through the first part of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members will be delighted to hear that it is coming through the committee.  It is hoped it will go through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  Regarding academics wanting to work in Ireland, we have increased funding in the budget.  I have put in place a three-year budget for my senior leadership initiative for academics in terms of gender only.  We are hoping that those academics will be appointed here from Ireland or indeed from the UK or elsewhere.  It is about having key people and world-class lecturers coming to Ireland.  This did not just happen in the past week or month.  I very much want to make the point that all Departments and all of the enterprise agencies, including Science Foundation Ireland, have been working very closely to internationalise our education.  This project has lasted approximately two and a half years.  We have our contingency plans if there is a no-deal, crash-out Brexit.</p></speech>

If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of March, the UK's participation in Erasmus will prove to be a difficulty.  Obviously, we are working on every potential outcome and this legislation regardless of whether Brexit is disorderly or orderly.  The Deputy also asked about the decline in numbers in terms of the North-South element.  I raised this question during my first fortnight in the job.  I have looked at those trends.  Traditionally, many students from my county would have studied engineering in the likes of Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University in Jordanstown.  That would have been a traditional route.  Capacity is built around the IT sector.  I know the likes of Letterkenny Institute of Technology in my county, Dundalk Institute of Technology or GMIT in the Deputy's county, which aspire to and are applying to become technological universities, have strengthened the choice available as well.  I know many Irish students go to Europe.  I am looking at the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, support we give to Bulgaria, which is more than 81,450.  The Netherlands is the highest at 349,473, so there is a lot of movement of Irish students to Europe as well.  The major piece is the number of students from Northern Ireland coming south.  There is a piece of work that needs to be done there in terms of why that is happening.  It is obviously down to choice - parental or student choice - but I would like to do a piece of work on that as to why that is happening.  It would be important.</p></speech>

The budget for apprenticeships and further and higher education was increased.  The Deputy is right.  It has been a slow burn with regard to apprenticeships.  We have been working with the Apprenticeship Council to get that message out.  I have met the various stakeholders and will meet businesses in the next week to try to ensure that the message is out there that apprenticeships are viable.  New professional apprenticeships are on stream.  Again, it is a slow burn.  It is a very slow burn when it comes to women taking apprenticeships.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, who is responsible for further education, I assure the Deputy that we are working on that to ensure that the take-up of apprenticeships increases.</p> <p>  The other group we work with is the expert group on future skills needs, which looks at the gaps in the market and gaps in employability.  It then informs the Department and the Ministers of the day about which areas need to be looked at.  I thank our higher education institutions, institutes of technology, technological universities and our nine skills fora.  It is very important.  They have been working together so that they can be flexible and react to the market.  For example, if a company is coming into a region, the relevant institute of technology, university or technological university will be able to respond to the needs of the regions.  That has worked.  I will list some areas where it has worked very well, including Sligo and, in particular, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's area of Limerick.</p></speech>

Approximately 19 such apprenticeships are coming on stream and there are approximately five new ones.  When the expert group on future skills needs points out to us areas and gaps in labour needs, the colleges and institutes of technology come together and offer those courses.  All of that is in hand.</p></speech>

A recent study has shown that employers, particularly multinational companies, are equally satisfied from people coming from either higher education or apprenticeships, so they value them.</p><p>There is still a piece of work that we can do together but there are agencies and different organisations looking at new apprenticeships.

To young people listening in, there is a set of opportunities for people who might like to look at apprenticeships.  I ask them to look at careersportal.ie and apprenticeship.ie.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is the same in the Minister's constituency of Donegal.  There is great concern among students and parents about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  What will the implications be for the students?  The Minister also mentioned students coming from Northern Ireland to the likes of Sligo Institute of Technology or Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  Does the Minister see any implications for them?</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's comments on apprenticeships.  I was involved in the business for many years prior to being here.  So many businesses were looking after apprentices but for quite a number of years this fell flat and there was nothing happening.  To try to get apprentices such as block layers, electricians or various other people is difficult now.  They are very scarce on the ground.  Any incentive that could be made available to employers to take them on would be helpful.  We are out of the recession.  During that time, builders and various others were very reluctant to take on any young people, male or female, as apprentices because of the cost factor.  Now things have changed.  I would like to see that everybody would be encouraged to take on new apprentices.  There are a lot of people who would have loved to go down that route but were discouraged because there were no opportunities or incentives for them for a number of years.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give me some detail on that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State outlined some of the work she is doing on it but, with the greatest respect, we have a serious crisis.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of State in trying to tackle the problem but unfortunately, as Deputy McLoughlin outlined, the problem is very stark and it is staring us the face.  We have a serious housing crisis and getting the necessary qualified people to build those houses is a serious problem.  They are not there at the moment.  I spoke to a small builder at the weekend who told me it is impossible to get young people to come into trades like block laying, plastering or electricians.  They can walk into any job and get the same amount of money, let it be in a supermarket or wherever.  They are not going to pull on a pair of boots and go onto a building site when they can get the same money a lot easier elsewhere.  We need to incentivise employers to take on apprentices.  We need to pay them properly.  At the moment it is simply not happening.</p> <p>  I will move on to the issue of clarity for families that are thinking about sending their children to colleges in the North of Ireland.  The Minister and I, being from Donegal, understand, and Deputy McLoughlin also outlined, that for students along the Border, going to a college in the North is nearly the first option.  There are currently about 2,000 students from the Republic attending colleges in the North.  It is our first port of call.  There is uncertainty out there.  I have no doubt that the Government is attempting to bring clarity to a very difficult situation.  People are planning a long time in advance, so it is important that we get clarity for them as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Much focus and attention has rightly been brought to the difficulties that Brexit will bring.  On the potential opportunities that may exist for us as an English-speaking country, based on the Minister's own perspective and the work he has done so far, how optimistic would he be that there are opportunities for us?  Has he honed in on what they are and where they exist?  What kind of progress are we making in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#F01600"><p>From my own perspective, it is certainly welcome that legislation is being brought forward to deal with those who are on SUSI maintenance grants in the UK.  They will know there is certainty in respect of the finance for continuing their education.  We did a stakeholder engagement in 2017 with a number of organisations and third level institutions on the possible impact of Brexit.  Two years later, we know a lot more in some ways but not a lot more in others.  In 2016, there were 12,000 Irish students in the UK and 2,000 in Northern Ireland.  In a difficult scenario, what would our capacity be in the Republic of Ireland for dealing with an extra 14,000 students?  That question is very concerning when we see our third level institutions creaking at the seams at the moment.  That leads us on to the concern about student accommodation, which is very difficult in its own right, particularly in Dublin.  Have the Minister or the Minister of State any thoughts on that?</p> <p>  Aside from the question of SUSI grants and capacity in the light of Brexit, the whole issue of student mobility, visas and residential permits is an important one that we need to look at.</p><p>In terms of international education programmes, I agree there are possible opportunities for Ireland.  Grant Thornton published a report on international education with respect to Dublin but a report certainly should be commissioned regarding possibilities across the country, given what the IDA Ireland has referred to in terms of opportunities outside Dublin.  It would be a way of helping to support colleges outside Dublin.  That is an important area to examine.  In England in 2014, &euro;1 billion was drawn down under Horizon 2020, which funded 9,000 researchers.  That is quite incredible.  If we in Ireland upped our game in terms of being able to attract that type of funding, it could lead to great dividends for us.  It was only when Chuck Feeney, through Philanthropy Ireland, gave us a very large tranche of funding a number of years ago that we were able to get to where we are at now, which is quite a high rating.  I believe we are rated 12th in the world but prior to that we were rated extremely low.  I would be interested to hear the Ministers' observations in that regard.  The Ministers might now respond to the last four questions.</p></speech>

I will give some of the statistics on them.  In 2018, there was a total of 5,468 registrations for apprenticeships, almost 5,000 of which were for the traditional craft apprenticeships and 590 were for the 25 new apprenticeships.  I am sure the committee is aware that Mr. Martin McVicar spoke at the launch of the new original equipment manufacturing apprenticeship, which was launched by Ministers, Deputies McHugh and Humphreys.   There were approximately 100 employers and businesses represented at it.  New apprenticeships are coming on board.  The new insurance practice apprenticeship is being run in IT Sligo.  There are also industrial  electrical engineering, polymer processing technology, manufacturing technology, manufacturing engineer and accounting technician apprenticeships, the latter being a traineeship run in my constituency which was launched by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan when she was Minister.  There is also a commis chef apprenticeship which was established in response to the lack of commis chefs two years ago when businesses and restaurants were crying out for them.  There are also chef de partie, sous chef and different financial services apprenticeships.  There are also auctioneering and property services, logistics associate,  laboratory technician and butcher apprenticeships.  There is a myriad of them.  Do not dismiss it because it is really important.</p></speech>

Under registered employment agreements it is worked out exactly what apprentices will earn.  Many of them earn way above the other jobs the Senator mentioned and not only that but apprenticeships provide a career path and training and one can take up an apprenticeship in one locality and region.  Across the institutes of technology especially, and the colleges of further education, wonderful apprenticeships are being offered.  It behoves all of us now to ensure that message is got across rather than one to the effect that there are no apprenticeships.  We need more students to apply for them.  It was mentioned recently that the mothers of Ireland are helping their children to choose what options they want to pursue after the leaving certificate.</p></speech>

Hopefully, that will happen by the middle of March..  Deputy McLoughlin asked what protections are in place for parents and students.  He also spoke about certainly for students who want to study in Coleraine or some other institutions in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The job we are trying to do here is very specific.  We are trying to minimise disruption and in doing so we are ensuring that disruption to any movement thus far, be it in preschool or at primary, secondary or third level, is minimised.  We also want to build on the contribution education has made to the movement and mobility of people through the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the space in which we find ourselves.</p><p> Deputies spoke about fees.  We have moved to ensure that the contribution of &euro;3,000 for students from the North who want to come south is in place for September and for the duration of their course, whether it is a three-year, five-year or six-year degree.  While this is ongoing - to go back to Deputy Byrne who feels his question was not answered - discussions on an overall agreement continue.  This will involve the common travel area and trying to come up with an agreement.  Going back to Deputy Byrne again, any future fees in the 2021-22 or 2023-24 years will be decided in the context of that agreement.  While this is all ongoing, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, is in discussions, as are my officials and I, with the Department for Education in the United Kingdom on getting certain principles agreed surrounding the protection of education in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South and east-west.  I am not in a position to say what will happen after the end of March, but our job and duty as legislators is to ensure we do everything to minimise that disruption.</p><p> To respond to Senator Gallagher's question about what we are doing to ensure we attract more international students, we are examining this issue and engaging comprehensively with our EU counterparts.  We are part of the European Union.  Someone from Boston has no problem travelling to California or elsewhere on the west coast of America to study.  Irish students are now going to Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and Italy.  If we can have a reciprocal arrangement, our doors are open.  To give the committee another example, by 2021 we will have lifted the derogation on the Irish language in the European Union, after which time an Irish student with three languages - English, Irish and French, English, Irish and German or English, Irish and Italian, for example - will be able to apply for interpreter and translator jobs.  If the UK is not in the European Union, that will obviously give us an added advantage.</p></speech>

A figure of 14,000 was referred to.  There are 4,000 postgraduate students and they will have made career choices.  We do not expect them to come back.  Regarding capacity, 5,531 beds have been completed in the past year, 4,825 are being constructed and 7,901 planning permissions are being sought for accommodation.  We are working in the area and are on top of it.  I go back to what the Minister said about internationalisation.  We are very conscious that the English language is very important to our economy and country.  As for our international students, we are very conscious that we need to be globally connected.  We are growing the numbers of international students in line with best practice such that 15% of students within our higher education institutions will be international students.  We are sure we will meet our target of increasing the number from 33,000 to 44,000 by 2020.</p></speech>

My Department has already made a call for written submissions from the general public and stakeholders on what should be in the next strategy statement.  This led to our receiving almost 400 submissions.  In addition, I have been meeting various stakeholders as part of my introduction to my new portfolio.  This has given me the opportunity to discuss with various education partners the issues they consider to be of importance in the coming years.  Additionally, last Thursday I had a very successful meeting in Letterkenny with regional representatives of many of the key actors in the education and training sector.  This was a very fruitful event and there were a range of suggestions made and ideas put forward which I have noted and will consider.  I have also been immersing myself in the job, back in the classroom, meeting stakeholders, students, teachers and representatives of the board of management, whether in Cork, Kilkenny, Dublin or other parts of the country.  I intend to continue with this because I am hearing many issues being raised, and at the coalface is where one will find out what is needed and where the weaknesses and strengths are.</p> <p>  I am here to meet and consult this committee and hear its views as to what should be in the statement of strategy for my Department.  I am aware that under the terms of the Public Service Management Act, the statement will be submitted to the Oireachtas once it has been finalised.  However, I requested this opportunity to add an additional consultative step rather than presenting the committee with a finished article before it had the opportunity to contribute its views.  I am here in listening mode and I look forward to hearing the contributions from members on what they consider to be the key priority strategic actions for my Department in the next few years.  I emphasise that my focus today is on the strategic level.</p> <p>  The strategy statement is an important document for any organisation.  It is a key opportunity for a Department to define the direction to be taken in a policy context.  My Department's strategy statement is an overview and a statement of direction for the education and training sector over the next three years.  It introduces accountability at a Civil Service level but also allows the Minister of the day discretion in the work he or she wishes to carry out.  For this reason, I ask the committee to set out today what strategic direction it wants the education and training sector to travel over the next three years.</p> <p>  Obviously, we are all very aware of the various constraints that operate from the point of view of finite resources and the like, but I want to focus today on what can be achieved and on setting out a level of ambition for the sector into the future.  For my part, I am very keen to continue the work towards an education and training system that empowers learners and gives them the resilience, skills and training they need to prepare for living successfully in a complex and changing world.  I want to release the potential of learners, enabling them to achieve their personal goals and supporting them to make the best of their opportunities as they move forward in their lives.  I want a system that can respond to the changing needs of learners, one that is adaptable, accessible and challenging and remains consistently relevant.</p> <p>  The education and training system needs to equip the 21st century learner with core competencies such as critical thinking skills, language skills, ability to use technology and written communication skills.  These core competencies will enable learners to adapt, work with others, think critically and be creative not just when they leave school or college, but throughout their lives and careers.</p><p>The committee is aware that the Department has engaged in a significant reform agenda in the past few years and there is no doubt that much has been achieved.  I pay tribute to my predecessors for their work in that regard.  I want to continue to make progress to embed initiatives and strategies that are under way and reform at a pace at which the system can deliver.  I am also conscious that the education and training system works as a partnership between the various players involved, including providers, learners, parents, patrons, management bodies, teachers, lecturers, administrators, the ETBs and the State.  It is important that this be explicitly recognised and the spirit of partnership evident in the sector be nurtured and built on.</p><p> To clarify for the committee, as well as the strategy statement which will set high level priority actions for the next three years, the Department will be developing annual action plans over the lifetime of the strategy.  The committee will be familiar with the model of my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Bruton, who had annual action plans.  My intention is to have the strategy statement which will identify the strategic direction to te taken and then annual action plans which will set out the more immediate actions to be implemented in order to make progress towards achieving the longer term strategic goals.  I intend to publish a 2019 action plan shortly.  However, it will be defined by the objectives set in the strategy statement.  That is why it is important for me to have this session to hear the views of the committee on the content of the strategy statement and have the opportunity to take them into account in developing and working up a new strategy statement.  </p><p> As I am conscious of the time constraints, I will not keep the committee much longer.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of committee members.</p></speech>

One of the problems we have had with action plans is that some of the key issues were not dealt with.  Issues such as teacher supply were hardly mentioned; in fact, that issue was denied.  The biggest problem facing the Department is teacher supply.  It will probably improve at primary level, but the shortage of teachers at second level is having a massive impact on the teaching of many subjects and the running of schools.  It is also having a huge impact sna Gaelcol&aacute;ist&iacute; freisin toisc go bhfuil s&eacute; deacair m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; a fh&aacute;il a bhfuil s&eacute; ar a chumas acu a bheith ag m&uacute;ineadh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge i me&aacute;nscoil.  This is a huge issue for the Department and not enough is being done about it.  Many small things are being done, but they are not enough.  What is the exact status of teacher supply panels at primary level, in particular?  Has the issue of teacher supply panels ever been considered in the context of gaelcol&aacute;ist&iacute;?  It might be a model that could work, although, obviously, it would be much more complicated at second level.</p> <p>  The biggest issue for the Department is demographics because the country faces a problem.  There has been a massive increase in population on the east coast at the same time as the school population is supposed to stabilise and reduce at primary level.  The Minister has a huge problem in that the demographics are pushing the requirement for new buildings in my constituency and nearby constituencies and areas in Cork and Galway.  In other parts of the country difficult decisions about schools are being taken at local level.  Does the Department have an overall vision?</p> <p>  I will say again because I have the opportunity to do so that I am disappointed with what is happening in Ashbourne.  Since I last raised the issue in the D&aacute;il, numerous parents have contacted me - I will meet some of them this week - to say they cannot find school places for their children.  I was attacked in the local newspaper by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, for raising this issue, but these parents do not know what to do.  They are being given a list of schools up to ten or 15 miles away, instead of in the local town.  I have raised the issue multiple times and it shows up flaws in the forward planning-demographics section of the Department.  If it cannot see that there is a problem in Ashbourne, where else are there problems in forward planning?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the purchase of sites and the Department becoming involved in commercial matters in general.  Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the expertise of civil servants does not match that in the private sector.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with them, but they do not have the expertise that is available in the private sector.  I wonder whether we should have an outside agency to deal with land acquisition, in particular, for schools because it costs a huge amount of money.  The Department does a fantastic job and the best it can.  I know that the staff are so conscious of the budget, but the budget for sites is increasing all the time and the list of schools that do not have a permanent site is not reducing.  This major issue needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  On what we are teaching children, the teaching of history as a subject has cast a shadow over the Department of Education and Skills.  Last week I had a meeting with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and can confirm that if the Minister does not put history back as a core subject in the junior certificate syllabus, we will make a commitment that if we are in government, we will do so.  I strongly encourage him to do this, regardless of the advice of the NCCA on it.  It is an important statement to make that we value history, that it is an important subject and that it was a mistake to remove it as a core subject.</p> <p>  On the delegation of powers to Ministers of State, I note that there is no delegation order under the Technological Universities Act.  Is there a reason for this?  From the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last week, it appears the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, does not have powers under the Act, that they are all with the Minister.  Is that an oversight?  Perhaps it is necessary.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has raised the issue of apprenticeships.  There is another Minister of State with responsibility for that issue.  It would be better if apprenticeships were included as part of the higher and further education brief in order that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, would have official responsibility for them.  If we are really treating apprenticeships and higher education on the same quality scale, as we are, why are they being dealt with by two Ministers of State?  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, deals with research and innovation in another Department.  He also deals with the issue of school buses, which is an odd one to throw at a Minister of State because it means that he or she is busy for one part of the year.  He also deals with apprenticeships which would fit much better in the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, although I am concerned she does not appear to have the necessary powers.</p> <p>  Another issue that is of crucial importance, one on which we have made a submission, is that of DEIS.  There were some changes to the programme, but a full look at it has not been taken.  I will be looking at it again in some detail.  Special needs education accounts for a huge part of the budget, but we need to ensure the money is spent effectively in the best interests of children.  There is also the issue of the National Educational Psychological Service.  </p> <p>  I must now leave to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber, but I will return.  However, I may not be here in time to hear the replies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#J00300"><p>I thank the Minister for outlining the strategy.  It is welcome that he has come before the committee to get our views on this wide-ranging area.  </p> <p>  I have some questions about the pilot project to teach politics and society.  I understand it is going very well and has been very successful.  The Minister mentioned the importance of critical thinking and ensuring the education system instils this skill among students.  What are his feelings on the roll-out of this subject?  Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned history.  The subject of politics and society incorporates history and is quite complementary.  In this era of populism the education system has a role to play in informing students in order that they understand how politics works, how the various parties work and how to analyse media critically when reading or listening to debates.  It would help to provide for better civic engagement among not only young people but also throughout society.  It is a crucial subject.</p> <p>  On the importance of empathy, NUI Galway has Ireland's first UNESCO chair in children, youth and civic engagement.  The importance of empathy has been scientifically proved.  I understand the United Nations will include it as one of its sustainable development goals.  Well-being is also one of the goals.  UNESCO is carrying out a pilot project throughout Ireland, in which For&oacute;ige is very much involved.  It involves the teaching of empathy which actually can be taught to transition year students in secondary schools.</p><p>It has been scientifically proven that it can be taught and the policy is evidence based.  What is empathy?  We use the word all the time.  It is more than compassion.  It is a critical problem online, not just for young people but for everybody, as people feel they can say anything online and there is no empathy.  It means not only identifying with how somebody may be feeling when one says something online, but also putting oneself in someone else's shoes to understand how he or she might feel and acting on it.  That is the basis of empathy, although I have tried to simplify it in a few sentences.  Empathy has been recognised internationally and UNESCO is championing it.  Given that the chair is in Ireland and UNESCO is funding the initiative, it would be good for the Department of Education and Skills to acknowledge it and it could be implemented as part of the well-being programme.  </p><p> The evidence suggests that somebody could score ten out of ten on a test of well-being but that does not mean that he or she has empathy.  One could be feeling fantastic with great self-esteem but one's empathy levels may be low.  The term "well-being" is used so widely that there is much misconception about what it means, that is, whether it means going to the gym, doing meditation or something else.  We are doing a good job on well-being within the education system but a module on empathy could be tacked on successfully, even on a pilot basis, as UNESCO rolls the initiative out throughout the country.  </p><p> Given that the United Nations is also considering the matter in its sustainable development goals and given that scientists have proven that it can be taught, empathy would be an important module for society, and Ireland would show great leadership in examining it, even on a pilot basis.  We have the relevant expertise and there is research and evidence behind it.  At another committee of which I am a member, we have discussed online safety and bullying.  The key is to put oneself in someone else's shoes, try to understand how he or she is feeling and act on it, rather than just saying one feels pity and walking away.  It will help people and I do not mean only young people.  Rather, it will help even us in the Oireachtas.  It is a matter that extends across the board and we need to lead by example.  It is not just me who recommends it; scientists have carried out evidence-based research and the recommendations are being rolled out around the world.  Canada and the United States are leading countries in this regard and there is a UNESCO chair in Ireland.  The funding is available and UNESCO is not asking the Department to provide it.  It is available and it is being rolled out.  It could be nicely tacked on to the well-being programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the departmental officials.  Early years to fourth level is a broad discussion and I will begin with the former.  While I know the running and funding of early education is primarily a matter for a different Department, apart from the Early Start programme, which I think is the only relevant programme within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  Early years inspectors have been appointed by the Department to assess the quality of education in early years.  Has there been a report on that?  It is relatively new and I do not know whether any of the officials present cover that area, but it is important that there is a high-quality experience for children, particularly for children who do not have many books or sources of vocabulary in their homes.  The Department has provided for inspectors in that area.  While I understand that the relevant officials might not be present, if that is the case, will the Department revert to the committee on the matter?</p> <p>  On curricular reform, Deputy Naughton mentioned politics and society, and computer programming is another new subject.  Has a report been done on the ongoing junior cycle reform in schools?  I presume a significant part of the strategy will relate to how it is gradually implemented in the curriculum over the years, as well as the systems for examining young people.  Similarly, what plans are there for leaving certificate reform?</p> <p>  I fully support efforts to increase the take-up of apprenticeships, which is crucial.  The Apprenticeship Council has made significant recommendations for further apprenticeships in various areas and there needs to be more of the traditional apprenticeships.  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to the importance of apprenticeships for the green economy and I support her in that regard.  Much of the apprenticeship issue concerns getting the message across to parents, schools and young people that apprenticeships are just as valid as higher education, or in some cases even more valid because there may be more job prospects due to gaps in the economy.  It is important that parity of esteem with those who go on to higher education is given to young people who choose apprenticeships.</p> <p>  Higher education is another matter for the committee and I am concerned that we are waiting for an economic assessment in respect of the committee's consideration of the Cassells report and the recommendations and various options therein.  Is there any update in that regard?  Given the period that will be covered by the strategy, it is crucial that decisions on the issue are made.  While it will ultimately be the Government's decision, the committee has a role in it but we cannot move further until we receive the information.</p> <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Thomas Byrne's suggestion for a private body to acquire land for schools.  I disagree fundamentally because acquisitions should be done through the Department and the Office of Public Works, OPW, and in conjunction with local authorities, as is often the case.  In my constituency, there are two new post-primary schools, one of which is up and running while a site has recently been identified for the other.  The acquisition was arranged by the local authority, the Department and the OPW.  I do not see a role for a new body to become involved.  It can be effective if it is done well and in conjunction with the national planning framework, NPF.  While Deputy Byrne referred to the growth in population on the east coast, the intention under the NPF is that there should be much more regional balance, with much more of the growth in population happening in the other cities and in towns and settlements around the country.  To answer the question about planning for schools, it must follow the demographic of which the Department is aware, namely, the number of children whose parents are receiving child benefit, in order that the Department can know what will happen in the immediate future.  I presume the Department works with the NPF on long-term planning.  Although it is probably not a matter for the Department, it is important for the country that there is a regional balance.  </p> <p>  DEIS is another issue but I am sure other members will raise it.  It is important that we continue to support DEIS schools and that children who live in disadvantaged areas receive the supports they need.  There is also a case for helping those children whose parents are economically or otherwise disadvantaged and who happen not to live in DEIS areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#K00300"><p>Deputy Thomas Byrne asked about teacher supply.  This is an issue in secondary schools, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and Irish.  There are also many issues with substitute teachers in the primary school sector.</p><p>A group is working on this.  We had an advertising campaign pre-Christmas and will continue to do that and look at different interventions to try to attract and invite people who may be interested in coming back from places like the south-east of Great Britain or the United Arab Emirates.  Teacher supply will remain a priority for me.  There is an ongoing conversation about teacher supply panels.  Our officials are working closely on the idea of regional supply panels for substitute teachers.</p><p> Deputy Thomas Byrne also raised the issue of population and school places with reference to Ashbourne.  There are population pressures regardless of whether we are talking about Ashbourne in County Meath or Kildare, Wicklow, Louth or Dublin.  The population pressures are growing.  To tie it into the question raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Department works very closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and looks to where housing estates can be built and planning.  The GIS is very much involved in it as well.  We can only continue to be as informed as the information available to us.  That was the thinking behind Project Ireland 2040, to see where the population pressures will be in the future.  Regarding tying the two issues in with the purchase of lands, there is the example of the memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the education and training boards, ETBs, and local authorities in the acquisition of sites.  There are examples where this has worked very well.  In some instances, it has not worked well.  Regarding the idea of an MOU, Limerick is an example of where that has worked and it should be heeded.</p><p> Deputy Byrne also spoke about the reintroduction of history as a compulsory core subject.  He will be aware that I have called for a review in this area.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, but the officials and members of the NCCA are very familiar with my strong opinion in this area regardless of whether it is the decade of commemorations, the recent conflict in Northern Ireland, own history of emigration, the work on the move from conflict to peace, or our global imprint.  That history needs to be told regardless of whether it involved peace, education, peacekeeping in places like Lebanon or the UNHCR, where we have a very high standard and acceptance in respect of working in critical places around the world such as Somalia, South Sudan, Jordan or Lebanon.  We must be very open to the fact that we have a dark history encompassing things such as institutional abuse.  We must ensure that we cannot just hide all that under the carpet.  People came forward, spoke and gave their testimonials and we must ensure that the history of that very dark period in this country is not washed down the stream.</p><p> Deputy Byrne also raised issues relating to DEIS and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, while Deputy Naughten raised the very important subject of politics and society.  It is working very well in the schools in which it has been piloted.  I have spoken to a number of teachers and students in the pilot schools.  It is a class I would recommend to my colleagues.  If they have not done so, I recommend that they go into that politics and society class because they know how to ask questions, engage and put someone on the spot.  It is a pleasure to be in there.  That politics choice will be rolled out to all schools in 2020.  Deputy Naughten also mentioned history in connection with populism in respect of the many challenges we face internationally such as the mass migration of people from sub-Saharan Africa looking for refuge.  Given the history of this country when we needed refuge, we must be very open to our contribution on a global basis.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about empathy, well-being and compassion.  He is correct.  Well-being means being well both physically and mentally but it also involves dignity - how we treat, relate to and interact with people and not just students.  One of the most significant ironies of life is that adults are great at lecturing young people and telling them how to behave and treat each other, but in respect of how we treat each other as adults, particularly in a large public forum like D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or Seanad &Eacute;ireann, sometimes the dignity piece leaves a lot to be desired, especially when we have such a legacy and footprint globally.  When Irish people went abroad to work, be it in education or in the missionary field, they knew how to treat people and there was an acceptance there.  We must continue to be very focused on that legacy and appreciation for the way Irish people treat others.  I know Deputy Naughten organised a meeting around that.  UNESCO is involved in the empathy piece.  If we are having the major debate around well-being, let us try to incorporate the empathy piece as well.</p><p> I have covered some of Deputy O'Sullivan's points.  I know she had a couple of questions about third level education as well.  I acknowledge the Deputy's work on junior cycle reform.  It was a significant piece of work that was not without its challenges at the time.  One of the lessons was that change needs to be done in a certain way.  Perhaps a period should be set aside.  I have learned from that for the leaving certificate reform.  We must bring it in gradually.  I am getting a lot of positive feedback.  Many risks were taken.  It required a lot of initiative at the time, whether it was the classroom-based assessments, the new subjects and the new short subjects.  With the core subjects of mathematics, English and Irish, the complete focus was around literacy and numeracy.  This is why I go back to history again.  There is no better subject than history when it comes to focusing on literacy so perhaps there is an opportunity there.</p><p> I will update the committee on leaving certificate reform.  We cannot have junior certificate reform without leaving certificate reform so there is a missing piece.  Our students are going to go through the junior certificate and will get used to classroom-based assessment, research work, team work and the critical thinking piece, so we must ensure that the leaving certificate follows through.  In saying that, we have a leaving certificate that is very much an integral part of our education system.  Yes, there are pressures, including exam pressures.  We have tried to take the heat out of that by adding two more days to the leaving certificate through the State Examinations Commission, SEC, this year.  One thing that must happen is the continuity between the junior certificate and the leaving certificate.  There must be a focus on that.  I will keep the committee updated on that.  I know it has contributed as a committee.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughten spoke about empathy and how we relate to each other.  What we are hearing from companies is that they want empathy in their employees, so it is not just for children.  It is also for adults.  The Minister mentioned the behaviour of adults.  On many occasions, I cringe when I see pupils from our primary and secondary schools coming to visit D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann who then see the behaviour there, so empathy is important.  That is what companies are telling us.  They are telling us that they expect top academic qualifications but they also want the soft skills.  Employers want these skills to ensure there is happiness in the workplace.  In the past, competencies just involved literacy and numeracy and now probably include digital literacy, but all of the other competencies like collaboration, being able to work together and empathy are important.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan was out of the room when I paid tribute to the work she did on apprenticeships, which is continuing.  Deputy Byrne asked about my delegation of duties.  I am in charge of what we would call the new apprenticeships but my specific duties involve being in charge of the apprenticeships that are coming through the institutes of technology and the technological universities.</p><p>Someone asked about the status of Cassells report.  It was sent to the European structural reform support programme before 31 October.  There is a body of work to be done in that regard.  It is not said often enough that &euro;157 million per annum in extra money has been pumped into higher education since 2016.  We now have the biggest budget for higher education since the foundation of the State.  There has been &euro;157 million extra per annum since 2016.  We responded to the Cassells report.  Of course I know that the report pointed out that more investment in higher education is needed.  We are looking for an economic evaluation from the structural reform support programme but there are data gaps within the Cassells report in respect of the very topics about which we have been talking today - apprenticeships and the money being spent on them.  I also want to know about retention rates.  What are the issues around retention rates?  Do we need to spend more money on that?  We are also going to look at graduate earnings and see how they will impact on students coming through because we want a fair playing field.  I will also be asking the programme to look at the full income base of our higher education institutions and at the international student premium and the money it brings into the system, which was not covered in the Cassells report.  </p><p> The Department itself is working on other areas.  We are working on upskilling and reskilling.  Again, it is very important that there is investment in these areas.  Investment should not only be made in higher education but in everything else that is happening in that space.</p></speech>

Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#M00500"><p>I will have to leave as soon as I ask my questions.  I am not being rude.  I will look back over the Minister's answers.  I would like to raise a few points rather than ask questions.  In his opening statement the Minister asked what strategic direction he wanted the education and training sector to travel in over the next three years.  There are some basic things we need to tackle.  One is access to education.  I refer to two problems with access.  One relates to children with additional needs who are still struggling to get spaces in schools or in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes.  The other relates to the many rural areas in which there are still issues around school transport.  We have debated school transport in this committee on a number of occasions and have had a number of questions back and forth, but it is still an issue for many people.  It comes down to the nearest school rule.  That is a bit of an archaic system.  Transport and the lack of special classes are still serious issues.</p> <p>  I am looking at the goals of the action plan.  Goal 1 is to "improve the learning experience and the success of learners" and goal 2 is to "improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs".  If we want to achieve these goals we have to ensure that the correct supports are in place.  I know there has been a lot of work done on increasing the number of ASD classes and special needs assistants, but there is still an issue, particularly at second level.  I put this to the Minister in our last round of questions.  In some counties we only have one or two options for people at second level.  That will not cater for the need, particularly over the next few years as more people come out of ASD classes at primary level.  The spaces are not there at second level.  They are some of the basic things we need to tackle if we want to give everybody equal access to education and equal opportunities.</p> <p>  Another issue is the quality of some of the buildings.  A number of months ago some people were presenting before the committee.  This is not just about prefabs, some of the schools are on waiting lists for new buildings.  The conditions in which some people are teaching are not good learning environments for students.  They are not good environments for teachers either.  They are some of the things we need to get right.</p> <p>  My last point is similar to one made by Deputy Naughton.  I agree with a lot of what she said about empathy.  She made some very interesting points in that regard.  The Minister knows that I am always going on about mindfulness, mental health, and mental well-being in schools.  If we are trying to decide on our strategy for the coming years we should not only focus on the academic aspects but let students know, from a very young age, that minding one's mental health and well-being is just as important as doing well academically.  That links into empathy and many other aspects of well-being.  We really should be rolling out mindfulness in all of our schools.  It does not have major cost implications.  It is something very basic which could be done.  The younger students are when things like this are tackled the greater the chance will be of success and of students adopting mindfulness in their everyday lives.  They are my main points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#M00600"><p>I congratulate the Minister.  Like Deputy Funchion, I will refer to his question about the strategic direction he wants the education and training sector to travel in over the next three years.  I would say that it should be one that has equality at its heart.  I agree with Deputy Funchion about equality of access and opportunity for our students, but we also need to address the elephant in the room, which is pay inequality and the crisis it is causing in teacher recruitment.  We have four-teacher primary schools not just in rural Ireland, but in Dublin.  When a teacher is ill or on a training course they cannot be replaced.  These are schools in which there are teaching principals so it can be the case that a teaching principal who has fifth and sixth class students has to take in first and second class students or even junior and senior infants.  Something has to shift.  We need to value our teachers, who are so under-resourced and overburdened at the minute.</p> <p>  We also need to look at the status of our non-teaching staff and to value them.  There are more than 3,500 secretaries in our education system.  The salaries of the vast majority of those are determined by boards of management, which leads to different working terms and conditions.  We have secretaries with no security of employment and no occupational pensions who are forced to sign on during the summer.  As former teachers, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor and the Minister himself will know that schools cannot function without their secretaries.  They are everything to students and staff.  There needs to be a shift in that area as well.</p> <p>  The issue of forward planning and new buildings has been brought up by my colleagues.  I brought this up when myself, Deputy Thomas Byrne and Deputy O'Loughlin travelled to Tullamore last year.  It relates to this thing of announcing schools.  Last year it was announced that a new primary school for the Goatstown-Stillorgan area in my constituency will open in September 2019.  The parent of a two year old or a three year old child will think that is great and that a brand new school will open in 2019 when the truth is the site has not even been identified.  Ballinteer Educate Together national school has been waiting for seven or eight years.  The project has been moved around and does not even have planning permission yet.  We now hear that the Department has applied for planning permission to locate it in an industrial unit in Sandyford beside a site on which it looks likely that 460 apartments will be built.  Traffic chaos and safety issues will arise from this school being located beside a construction site.  I do not understand the logic of announcing schools and then misleading the public by saying that the doors will open a year later when the site has not even been identified.  The Minister should at least be honest with the public and say that he hopes that this will happen but that we actually do not have sites identified for the schools we are announcing.</p><p>As elected representatives, people come to us saying that this is great news and asking where exactly is the location for the school.  Then the other school, which has waited seven years and does not have planning permission, wonders how they were successful when they have been moved around to different parts of the constituency.  Take Ballinteer Educate Together which is now temporarily located in Churchtown and is still waiting for planning.  That is something that needs to be addressed.</p><p> On strategy, does the Minister intend to integrate the recommendations made in the Joint Committee on Education and Skills report on relationships and sexuality education, and what is his timeline?  The committee also did a very detailed report on mental health.  I would love to see these reports inform strategy and be taken seriously rather than gathering dust on a shelf.</p><p> In the last quarter of last year, the Minister's predecessor was to have 500 teachers in DEIS primary and post-primary schools trained in the delivery of resilience building.  Did that happen?  How were those schools selected?  How were those teachers selected?  What are the criteria for deciding which schools or teachers received the training?</p><p> I agree with Deputy Funchion, and have said it many times, that a toolbox of skills to deal with a crisis is the most critical thing that we can give our children.  I am an advocate for mindfulness and resilience building, which was one of the recommendations of our report.  I, the Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and Senator Black have been instrumental in introducing mindfulness into Leinster House.  We think that it is very important that we in Leinster House lead.  The previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, attended the meeting we held before Christmas to lend his support to it.  The sessions are held on Wednesdays between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m., and six more are scheduled.  This is happening is Sweden and the UK.  If the Minister cares to pop in, he should do so.  That gives a signal that we are leading on the importance of protecting our mental health.  It would be a good signal if the Minister were to lend his support.  The typical excuse for Deputies, never mind Ministers, is that they do not have time, but that is exactly when one should pop in and do some mindfulness training.</p><p> What is the extent of the Minister's engagement with the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Bruton, on broadband connectivity?  It is not only an issue for rural Ireland.  In my time training in NUI Maynooth the overhead projector was as technical as it got, but now the technology is fantastic.  I was a music teacher and used YouTube to bring the music to the students so that they could see the performer.  Interactive whiteboards are also an invaluable tool.  How are people in Glencullen, which they tell me is not far from Grafton Street, coping?  I do not think a music teacher there has that access because there is no broadband connectivity.  It must be next to impossible in rural areas of Ireland.  There is inequality because pupils are not getting the same experience, and that is only in my subject, never mind any other subject.  Teachers are heavily reliant on this.</p><p> I would love an update on the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development in Ireland 2014 to 2020 if the Minister is in a position to provide it now or later.  That was focused primarily on educating children and students about sustainable development rather than seizing the opportunity to make the very schools themselves greener.  A quick example of that was apparent when the Joint Committee on Climate Action visited a school in Tipperary before Christmas.  It had done a great deal of retrofitting and put six solar panels on a roof which could take 30.  It is outrageous that that is the message we are giving our students, who if they ask why there are only six panels when it would fit 30 are told that there is no point because the school cannot get money back from the grid.  We must look at that.  There should be a solar revolution on every public building, including school buildings.  Schools are a perfect investment for that.  Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment about the need for the Government to bring in measures that would not just put the responsibility on the students who are doing fantastic work through the green flags initiative, for instance?  It would mean the Government stepping up to invest in and incentivising our schools becoming greener, which unfortunately did not happen in that school in Tipperary where there was no incentive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#N00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to join the committee today.  I thank the Minister for speaking so eloquently on the issue of history.  He displayed a very deep understanding.  He may be aware that I and my colleague, Senator Kelleher, and others have put forward proposals on Traveller history in education, and I believe that the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, is examining how it might become part of the curriculum.  It is, as the Minister said, part of all those parts of history reflecting the kind of diversity of experience, both good and bad, that people have had in Ireland and that has helped to shape our country.  I am hopeful of the outcomes.  Will the Minister give a timeline for when we might expect the completion of that review?</p> <p>  Also on critical thinking, I draw the Minister's attention to a very good but under-resourced initiative, namely, the Young Philosopher Awards and the Young Philosopher of the Year.  It is a very small project and certainly not on the scale of the young entrepreneur initiative or others.  It is very important, nonetheless, in promoting critical and philosophical thinking which is so important for our young people.  The initiative came out of UCD with 50 or 60 schools involved.  It is something that could be of great benefit, especially at a time when, locally, nationally and internationally, there are very polarised debates, so to be able to think philosophically and engage with each other is important.  It is a sign of the importance of critical thinking that the work of Paulo Freire is being pulled out of schools in Brazil.  It is because people recognise the power of when people are thinking critically.  We should look to reverse that trend in every way that we can.</p> <p>  Well-being has been mentioned.  We need to model this as well as teach it.  Insecurity for teachers is an issue in creating a positive environment.  This is particularly the case for school secretaries.  I know that school secretaries have almost a social work component to their jobs.  In many cases it is the school secretaries who help children, especially those children who are dealing with difficult situations such as their family's housing security, being in direct provision or navigating bureaucracies, which unfortunately our youngest people sometimes have to navigate.  They play a key role and it is very unfortunate that people, including students, do not know whether the same school secretary will be there in September because they effectively lose their jobs every year and must go on social welfare before returning to work in September.  That is not acceptable.</p> <p>  I sit on the Committee on Social Protection.  We held a joint meeting between the Committees on Education and Skills and the Committee on Social Protection - I think it predated the Minister's appointment - which focused on disability and the blocks to access.  I would love to hear the Minister refer to second chance education and how we can ensure that those who may be navigating the social protection system are being given quality education options.  Sometimes people can feel as though it is the luck of the draw regarding the courses they are offered and the time of year that they register as to whether they will be offered a college course.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the National Training Fund.  There will be statements on it in the Seanad this week.  There has been an indication that employers will be given a greater say in what training persons might do.  The National Training Fund is there to allow individuals to build their own career or capacity or perhaps to start a new career.  It is very important that it remain learner-centred rather than become an asset of companies.</p> <p>  I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, will join us again but I will raise the issues and we might follow up elsewhere.  I refer to goal 4, to "Build stronger bridges between education and the wider community" in the Action Plan for Education.  Will the Minister consider incorporating that goal into future procurement so that, for example, in the area of books for schools, we try to support situations linked to wider learning opportunities.</p><p>Green schools have already been mentioned in terms of energy, but the pollinator plants and wildlife corridors they can provide are also important.  </p><p> My question for the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, concerns frontier research, which is public research for the public good and which has a wider scope.  I have specific questions on the effect of Brexit on this area.  What measures are being taken to ensure that research projects in which Ireland is a partner of UK institutions at the moment are protected?  Are we carrying out appropriate transfers of data and research materials to ensure that they are based within the EU so that projects are not put in jeopardy?  Perhaps resources will have to be freed up to address what will be quite a logistical challenge.  Data transfer subsequent to a no-deal Brexit, if that happens, will be extremely difficult.  </p><p> On the recognition of qualifications, is there any scope to remove the current employment control framework for universities?  There will be a wide array of extraordinarily talented researchers and academics who may be searching for other English language locations.  At the moment, because of the employment control frameworks, leaving aside the issue or funding many universities are blocked from being able to hire those people because they are restricted in the numbers they are permitted to recruit.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1343" speakername="Tony McLoughlin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#O00200"><p>The Minister mentioned language skills, and the ability to use but not abuse technology.  I am concerned about the abuse of technology.  A number of speakers have mentioned concerns about the mental health of young adults and students.  The issue of online bullying and abuse also arises.  I do not know what can be done, but it is one of my major concerns, and I know of many of my constituents, including parents and young people, who are very concerned about what is happening at the moment.  This is a major concern for many people.</p> <p>  Some people spoke about the acquiring of land for future schools and various other things.  I have two gaelscoil in my constituency; one in Sligo and one in Manorhamilton.  Extensions to schools is another issue; perhaps that is not an issue for the Minister this evening, but the capital investment plan is one of the biggest issues I have.  The two major issues I want to highlight are the mental health issue which has been brought to my attention by so many people - parents and students alike - and online bullying, which is a major concern for many people.  It is getting worse.  What can be done?  It is something that has to be dealt with.  Much of this abuse is taking place within schools and online.  It is a major concern for me and for others.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#O00300"><p>I have the action plan for 2016 to 2019, and I took the opportunity to go through it again yesterday.  I assume we cannot automatically go straight into another action plan without looking at what was achieved through this one.  There is laudable and notable ambition contained within this action plan, and some very specific objectives, timelines and target indicators.  Is there going to be an opportunity to go through these at another time?  I do not expect anyone to go through it now, but I really believe that we have to assess where we are based on what was put in place by the previous action plan.</p> <p>  In terms of supporting teachers, one of the five goals we have is helping those delivering education services to continuously improve.  That is incredibly important, because many teachers are suffering from low morale.  Pay parity is an issue which arises quite regularly, particularly in the staff rooms of larger, newer schools, where 50% of teachers are actually on a lower pay scale.  That is completely wrong.  </p> <p>  The whole area of teaching principals must be looked at; it is something this committee looked at during our summer school session, when we discussed the possibility of allowing teaching principals one day a week in which to look after all of the administration and other areas.  Principals are the leaders of education within their schools, but when their time is completely taken up with administrative work it becomes very difficult to lead.  </p> <p>  I totally agree with what my colleagues have said about looking after staff on a whole school basis.  We have to support our secretaries and caretakers.  In many cases those people are the heartbeat of the school, and do so much unacknowledged work.  We have to support them.  Recruitment and retention is a problem, and we absolutely have to look at it.  </p> <p>  On special needs, the adequacy of special education access and funding is hugely important.  There are some very good autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, units at primary school level.  I visited one recently in County Laois, outside of my area, and brought it up with the Minister on a previous occasion.  Not one cent was given to that school to kit out the ASD unit, and that has to be looked at.  It is also very difficult to find places for children moving from ASD units in mainstream primary schools to ASD units in mainstream secondary schools.  While we have done quite a bit of work at primary level we are now reaching the stage that provision has to be made at secondary level.  The question of how we progress sections of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is also hugely important. </p> <p>  My colleagues have mentioned delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, and I want to reiterate that I believe it is a really good programme.  However, there are many children suffering from disadvantage who are in non-DEIS schools.  We have to address that.  We also have to address the assessment criteria used to allocate DEIS status in schools.  </p> <p>  Equality of opportunity is of great importance across the board, including third level and access to further education for older people, in terms of enabling access to life skills.  We should put a renewed focus on that.  </p> <p>  The objectives contained in the former plan for apprenticeships, which is finishing this year, were quite ambitious, and rightly so.  We have to look at expanding our capacity in terms of skills in the regions as well as nationally, and aim to have 50,000 people in apprenticeships by 2020.  I am not sure we are on target to reach that.  I want to make a plea to the Minister in terms of areas where apprenticeships can be accessed, including for early school leavers and others.  To be parochial for a moment, there were plans afoot to set up an apprenticeship scheme to cater for young people in the old Model school in Athy, which is a blackspot for early school leavers.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could look at that area in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019021200002#P00100"><p>I thank the committee members for their comments.  There is a lot of good stuff in all of this.  I would do the committee members an injustice if I kept them here for an hour to go through this line by line.  This now is not just a matter of public record, it is also going to be the blacks and whites for my team to put together the action plan.  Obviously not everything will be incorporated into the action plan.  We can work on themes that have emerged here today and I really want to do that.</p> <p>  I will do a whistlestop tour through a few of the issues that have been raised.  Senator Maria Byrne mentioned corp oideachas, which is PE as Gaeilge, and looking at how we differentiate between physical literacy, physical education and physical activity.  I want to try to work on giving PE its proper status within primary schools.  We are doing that at second level.  By 2020, PE will be introduced as a choice for the leaving certificate, as will computer science.  Senator Byrne mentioned the statistics which show that girls drop out of sports at the earlier age of 13 or 14 years and are twice as likely as boys to drop out of sports.  If we are serious about PE at the leaving certificate level then we must consider PE at primary school level.  I have learned, having informed myself about this subject, that there are specific modules within the training of teachers for primary schools so we have to figure out a way.  In terms of my own passion for the Irish language, I think there is a quick win in terms of the Irish language.  I mean if PE can be taught through the medium of Irish then students will learn or improve their Irish language skills in a fun, more creative and more enjoyable way.  Maybe we could enter a new era where people develop a love for the Irish language in that way.  I will keep the committee up to speed with this matter.  </p> <p>  Deputy Funchion talked about the nearest school rule.  We are reviewing that transportation arrangement as we speak.  She talked about special classes as did another member.  That is an evolving issue.  It is hard to comprehend the change since 2011, when there were nearly 500 special classes and today there are nearly 1,500 but that is still not enough.  The programme is still not done in the way that I would like it to be done.  I do not like the programme being diagnosis led.  We will look at a new model.  We are working on that at present and we will look at incorporating the HSE, my Department and the Department of Health.  To be honest, it was at this committee that I encountered this concept, and it was my first day here as Minister.  I am very interested in developing that model where if a speech and language therapist, occupational therapist or nurse is needed in a mainstream school then that is the place where we need to be going and continue to give parents the choice.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion also raised the issue of the lack of secondary school options.  The issue was raised by a number of members.  We have done a good piece of work on that at primary level but we have still a piece of work to do at secondary level.</p> <p>  On empathy and mindfulness, has Deputy Martin formally invited me to the event at 1.30 p.m. on Wednesdays?</p></speech>

She talked about pay equality and the issue of teaching principals.  I met a cohort of principals yesterday evening.  It is a very difficult space for half of the primary schoolteachers who are teaching principals.  It is an area in which I have given a commitment.  Recently, at the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, conference, I stated that I want to work on trying to alleviate the pressures on teaching principals.  It is a piece of work that I am going to work on and take seriously.</p> <p>  The status of caretakers and school secretaries was mentioned.  F&oacute;rsa now has a campaign.  I am on public record as saying that if there is to be a conversation it has to be within the parameters of the Workplace Relations Commission.  My officials and I are happy to engage in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of the language used when describing school openings, when a school gets its patronage and status as a school, be it a gaelscoil, an education and training board, ETB, or an Educate Together school then word goes out that a new school is opening and creates that perception.  We have to look and reflect because it is going to be temporary accommodation for a period before there is a full school.  There is a piece of work that we can do there.</p> <p>  Relationship and Sexuality Education, RSE, is under review.  That was started last Easter by my predecessor.  I will keep the committee up to speed on where we are at in terms of the issue. </p> <p>  In terms of resilience training and mindfulness, specific questions were asked around how schools get resilience training and how they get targeted.  I will get back to the committee on that particular question. </p> <p>  The strategy and the sustainable development goals, SDGs, were mentioned.  That is an area on which I have been working closely with my colleagues in the Department.  Young people are interested in the area whether it is the environment, sustainability, migration, social inclusion, disadvantage or economic disadvantage.  Teachers and students are embracing the area and I am interested in seeing whether we can add more value to that.</p> <p>  Broadband was mentioned.  I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton.  We have a strategy for the schools but I know that some schools still lose out, particularly primary schools in rural areas.  Senator Conway mentioned what a school in west Clare has done.  In between now and getting the national broadband plan the school is considering a wireless solution.  I know it is not a long-term solution but it does give the school 17 megabytes as opposed to the existing 3 megabytes.  </p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about the history review.  We plan to complete the review by the end of the first quarter, which is the end of next month.  I will keep the committee up to speed on the issue. </p></speech>

They are front of house; they do not just deal with administration but deal with many aspects of the school curriculum.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins mentioned mindfulness as well.

Such learning is embraced in a very positive way and is connected to the confidence piece as well.  I know from my experience of working in an estate years ago that there was a very diligent and active neighbourhood worker named Ms Mary English who went into houses drinking tea with and talking to women to try to encourage them to return to education.  Her actions were transformative and changed the lives of many of those women.  All of the people that she trained 20 years ago are tutors and facilitators themselves.  I am very interested in this piece.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about the future procurement of frontier research.  I will ask Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to get back to the Senator about that issue.  </p> <p>  Deputy McLoughlin mentioned online abuse.  Without question, online abuse is a challenge.  We must figure out a way to accept that technology is part of our new society yet allow creativity.  Obviously technology is a place where young people are creative but we must deal with the abuse bit.  Parents and schools must play their role.  Schools have the autonomy to decide whether they want to ban phones or simply not have them in school.  One of the elements that I have picked up in primary and secondary schools, whether it is in coding or encouraging more young women to study science, technology, engineering, mathematics, STEM, subjects, there is an appetite for the technological aspects of learning.  Whether it is Combilift in County Monaghan, where the company is now considering automotive forklifts, or elswhere, one needs the people with the skill set to do those things.</p><p>We are moving into that space.  We want to intervene effectively to ensure there is no online abuse.  To give one example of how young people are responding to it, I came across a young lad at the Young Scientists who is developing a software package that concerns how to spot online abuse - how to use computers to deal with a computer problem.  We must follow young people as well.  There are no better advocates in terms of ensuring that bullying is not part of the group than young people.  They will be the ultimate people who will do that.  I am confident that solutions will be found.  </p><p> The acquisition of land, the extension of schools and the capital plan in the future were all mentioned.  We have a ten-year bundle and are looking at &euro;8.4 billion so we will continue to work closely on that.  The Chairman spoke about the review of the 16 to 19 plan.  One of the things we are doing at the stakeholders meeting is asking what has and has not worked.  For example, we have achieved 85% of last year's action plan so much of it has been delivered.  We also ask them what the weaknesses were so we are asking that question.  </p><p> Some other issues that were raised include morale, pay parity, the fact that 50% of teachers are on lower pay and scale in some of the larger classes for younger teachers.  It is an issue.  I acknowledge that we cannot have a system where teachers do the same job for different levels of pay.  There is unfinished business and I want to continue to work with the unions and teachers to ensure we finish that unfinished piece.  I know we have an agreement up to the end of 2020 but it is something of which I am conscious.  Teaching principals were mentioned and I spoke about that issue.  Other issues raised include caretakers, secretaries, special classes in primary and secondary school and the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  Regarding the DEIS issue, we have, hopefully, identified that the full audit will be complete by the end of March.  We will then evaluate the results.  There will be a new DEIS system, a system that will be gradual but also more targeted.  Certain schools are in DEIS because of geographical considerations but it is a lot more complex so I keep the committee updated about that.  Access to further education was mentioned along with the specific issue of apprenticeships in Athy.  We must follow up on that.  </p></speech>

The action plan said that the teaching of resilience would be delivered by quarter four of last year.  Were those 500 teachers delivered?  The Minister can get back to me afterwards if needs be.  Regarding greening our schools, is the Government stepping up to facilitate schools to sell energy back to the grid?  Could the Minister talk to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment about that?  As a follow up to what the Minister said about delivering PE and doing it properly, there has been resistance.  Since I was elected here, on several occasions, I have raised the need to carry out an audit of schools to see which ones do not have PE halls.  I am aware of one in my constituency.  The school was built in 1980 and still does not have a PE hall.  Again, if we come back to equality, we need to establish which schools do not have PE halls because they are at a disadvantage in delivering that new curriculum.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for his briefing on the General Scheme of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019, which was very helpful.  There is no doubt that we will be engaging further as the Bill progresses through the Houses.  It is important that all of us work together on this extremely important matter that will have an impact on so many lives.

The following motion was placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and referred to the select committee:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves Ireland&rsquo;s participation in a European Defence Agency Project in relation to Military Search Capability Building, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</blockquote> <p>In commending the motion to the committee, I will outline briefly the functions of the European Defence Agency and the background to the programme in which Ireland wishes to participate.</p><p>The European Defence Agency, EDA, was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 &quot;to support the member states and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European security and defence policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004 the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the framework of the European Defence Agency.  It is an agency of the European Union that is composed of the Defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes to the annual costs of running the agency, including its annual work programme.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the areas of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities.  The primary reason for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  </p><p>The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 prescribes that participation in EDA <i>ad hoc</i>category A and B projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  Ireland has participated in a number of EDA projects since we commenced our participation in the agency in 2005.  All such projects have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and are targeted at enhancing our defence capabilities in support of international crisis management operations.  They include a force protection programme involving measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities.  This is a key issue for the Defence Forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas.  The projects also include a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection programme to enable the Defence Forces to remain at the leading edge of capability development in this key area through access to the results of the research, studies and development work packages undertaken as part of the programme.  There are counter-improvised explosives devices manual neutralisation projects to enhance the skills of our explosives-ordnance disposal personnel in dealing with such devices where the use of remote or semi-remote techniques is not possible.  The agency also has maritime surveillance networking projects, under which a system was developed to enable the sharing of information and data through a common data interface at differing security levels.</p><p> A project in respect of co-operation on cyber ranges in the European Union aims to maintain and improve cyber resilience, as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of member states' personnel.  A project on joint procurement arrangements for satellite communications aims to provide better value and capability satellite communications to EDA members.  All of these projects are designed to enhance the capacity of the Defence Forces to participate in international crisis management operations, whether through capability development or more economic procurement of required capabilities.</p><p> The proposal I am putting to the committee is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in an EDA project relating to advanced military search capability.  This is a key capability when working in a contested environment.  The Defence Forces engage extensively in specialist military search activities, dealing with unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and ensuring a safe and secure operating environment for military operations.  The Defence Forces engineer specialist search and clearance teams are regularly deployed on both home and overseas operations.  There are two specialist search teams operating overseas in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and they predominantly conduct route searches and area clearances in advance of vehicle or foot patrols.</p><p> The Defence Forces have also provided specialist search capability to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in support of aid to civil power operations during high-profile visits by foreign VIPs and for searches for bodies and weapons.  Examples of recent such deployments include the visits by the Pope, members of the British royal family and the US Vice President .  There have also been a number of searches for the bodies of missing persons and more conventional operations against paramilitary groups and criminal organisations.  The Defence Forces corps of engineers does not have specialist search teams at an advanced search capability level.  Advanced search personnel are capable of conducting hazardous environment search, working in confined space and operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  Participation by the Defence Forces in this project addresses this capability gap.</p><p> The aim of the project is to develop common processes, techniques and procedures for military search for contributing member states.  The overall cost of the project is &euro;2.8 million over six years and it will be funded by eight participating member states.  Funding comprises both financial contributions and contributions in-kind.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution over the lifetime of the project is &euro;157,500.  This comprises &euro;102,500 contributions in-kind associated with hosting an international seminar and a number of training events and a direct financial contribution of &euro;55,000.  Costs will be met from within existing resources in the Department.  Eight member states are planning to join the project.  Those states are Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Ireland.  The anticipated benefits of the Defence Forces participation in this project are as follows.  It addresses a current deficiency at the advanced level of engineer specialist search and clearance capability; the training to instructor level in this project will ensure that this requirement may be met in-house going forward; and the project provides an efficient and cost-effective means of qualifying teams to advanced search level and maintaining their currency, which would otherwise be prohibitive if it had to be procured in the market.</p><p> Additional benefits also arise from interaction with other forces and the sharing of tactics, techniques, procedures and experiences.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate "in multinational capability development projects within the framework of the European Defence Agency in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.".  This project is a prime example of how the Defence Forces can develop their military search capability to an advanced level and provide a pathway for ensuring that there is no future skills fade.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this project affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment in a cost-effective manner, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.</p><p> I commend the motion to the committee.</p></speech>

Nobody would deny the members of our Defence Forces the skills they need to do their work.  We note the needs outlined by the Minister of State in this respect and it will not cost too much.  There is a major "but" because this is moving us away from our traditional role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, apparently drawing us further into the idea of a European Union, EU, army, which many countries and various individuals are promoting.  I find that disturbing and extremely controversial.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned "crisis management operations" but what exactly are we talking about in that respect?  The Minister of State also mentioned military search but although such terms sound okay, we know there is much underlying them.  On the previous occasion on which the Minister of State was here, I asked about the skills relating to interrogation.  He stated that he would get back to me on what sort of interrogation skills were being taught or promoted.  I have concerns about this because it seems to be drawing us further into this European army and away from the traditional role with the UN peacekeeping operations, where we have really enhanced our operation and are well-known, regarded and respected.</p></speech>

The reply is on its way.  I have not signed off on it yet but I know it is ready for me to sign off.  That was the week before last and I was in the D&aacute;il twice last week dealing with matters.  In no way is Ireland promoting an EU army, and I have stated that on numerous occasions.  The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army and the concerns of the Irish people were taken into account in that respect.  The Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army or conscription to any military formation.  The treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Many people have spoken of such an army right across Europe, with some people calling for such an army, there is absolutely no provision in the treaties for the establishment of any such army.  The vast majority of member states are members of NATO, and for them NATO is and will remain the foundation of their collective defence arrangements.  I have never stated that we should be members of or look at being members of a European army.  In no way have I ever stated that we should promote such an idea.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to crisis management and many people attach different meanings to the phrase.  The complexity of contemporary conflicts and crises requires a comprehensive approach addressing the multiple levels of dimensions on which they evolve.  I can give an example of a crisis management situation with the Naval Service's participation in Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean.  That was a crisis that required management and members of the Irish Defence Forces were able to respond.</p></speech>

As stated in the D&aacute;il, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is supporting this proposal.  Questions arise about an EU army and there is rhetoric across Europe in respect of it.  However, there is no legal basis for that proposition.  If there ever was such a proposition, it would have to go before the people and they would not vote for it.  I do not support the concept.  We must divide rhetoric in European politicians from the basis of treaty law in the European Union.</p><p>As a legal construct, PESCO allows for an opt in and an opt out based on the democratic wishes of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is important to remember this.  Will the Minister of State outline for those who do not support this move what the consequences would be of not supporting it in terms of domestic practicalities or for UN mandated missions?  What would the skills gap be if we did not participate in projects such as this?  What would be the positive and practical consequences if we were not to support it?  Perhaps the Minister of State might give some practical examples of the enhanced skills from which the Defence Forces could benefit and detail the know-how that would be developed at home in allowing those who travel abroad on missions to develop the skill sets necessary to train others within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

Advanced search personnel are capable of conducting hazardous environmental searches, working in confined spaces and operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  Participation by the Defence Forces in the project addresses the capability gap.  Participation in the project will address a deficiency in advanced engineer special search and clearance capabilities.  The training to instructor level in the project will ensure this requirement will be met in-house.  It will ensure the personnel participating in the project will be able to return to Ireland with their experiences and further train other members of the Defence Forces.  This will allow more personnel to undergo specialist training.</p> <p>  The project provides an efficient and cost-effective means of training teams to advanced search level in the most up-to-date manner, which would be prohibitively expensive if it had to be procured in the marketplace.  We are able to use the skills we possess, but we will be updating the skills of the Defence Forces.  They were used for the papal visit during the search of the Phoenix Park and Ireland Airport West and the recent visit of Prince Charles to the naval base.  I understand they were used in other areas for other business also.  They were used in conducting searches when the President of the United States and also the former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden visited.  We are updating the skills we possess and they will be used for such visits.</p></speech>

While it has not been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, every single step taken in recent years has been blatantly flagged by those at the head of the European Parliament and the European Commission.  The objective has been stated clearly at European Council meetings and it is a little more than rhetoric, as pointed out by Deputy Jack Chambers.  Gradual movement in this direction is gathering pace, as is clear from the motions that have been brought before the committee on a more regular basis of late.  Some of them are innocuous, or seem to be, while some are more blatant in their intent, but they are all part of an overall jigsaw.  An apparatus is being formed to make it virtually impossible for the Defence Forces to stay out in the future.  Doing so is becoming more difficult; the more interdependent we become, the more the Army becomes dependent on the skill sets of other EU armies and the more our call signs and operational procedures will become the exact same as those of other countries.  Since the founding of the State we have enjoyed an independent foreign policy and the Defence Forces have upheld our neutrality proudly.  We need the best possible protection for Irish soldiers.  We also need the best working conditions and proper pay for them.  It is great to hear the Minister of State talk about the papal visit; we all saw the media headlines about the pay some soldiers received for being on duty and involved in operations for the visit.  The same applies to what happens on other occasions on which they are on duty for a lot longer than they should be, especially considering that we are living in a time of peace.  </p> <p>  I asked a question about this specific issue in the D&aacute;il recently.  The Minister of State answered that he could not respond to it owing to concerns about the security of the State.  The information I have is that the ordnance unit which comprises those involved in bomb disposal who most likely would be part of the groups the Minister of State would send abroad to learn additional skills is not operating at full capacity and is struggling to fill the time slots available.  If that is true, the Minister of State is signing us up to something in which we will probably not be able to participate and will be overstretching an existing resource.  It is not a skill that can be learned overnight.  The skill set is available within the Defence Forces, but my information is that corporate knowledge is being lost because the unit is not running at full capacity, which is an emergency.  I do not expect the Minister of State to go into detail on how many soldiers are allocated to the position or how many vacancies there are.  That is not why I raised the issue in the D&aacute;il.  The question I have asked is whether the Minister of State is aware that there is a shortfall and that there is a need to increase numbers.  Having said that, sending personnel abroad to acquire training in skills they might never need in aid to the civil power is not the way to increase numbers.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State has correctly said the European Defence Agency was set up in an effort to improve European defence capabilities, rather than the defence capabilities of individual countries in the fields of crisis management and peace making, as well as sustaining the European security and defence policy, as it stood at the time.  While Ireland may have signed up to the policy, the first goal of the Defence Forces is peacekeeping.  They have an honourable history in that regard.  They are also supposed to function in aid to the civil power.  The operations listed by the Minister of State were undertaken on that basis; they were not operations carried out abroad because, as far as I know, there is not that capability.  The Minister of State also listed other projects in which Ireland had been involved, including under the European Defence Agency.  While some of the projects can be considered to be innocuous, others are definitely not.</p><p>Their aim is to increase the interoperability of EU armies and the EDA.</p><p> More recently, the aim of PESCO is not only to enhance the capability but also the military spend.  Coupled with that are the changes that happened to European funding.  As of 2016, funding is available for military research and the sum of money that has been set aside, of which European military contractors are encouraged to avail, is not small.  It includes grant aids and so on to enhance the military apparatus within Europe.  It has moved from a few hundred million euros to a number of billion euros in the space of five or six years.</p><p> I do not expect to win over the Minister of State on the matter but I am opposed to it as being one part of a continuous change to the nature of our neutrality and the use of the Defence Forces in making us more dependent as a State in Europe on the European military apparatus.</p></speech>

Before members of the Defence Forces participate in any training overseas, we must ensure that we have the capability and capacity to respond to civil power requests.  I have been advised by military management that our participation in the course will not prohibit us from carrying out our work at home.  A core team of engineers, comprising 60 personnel over the duration, will go on the course, and one half of them will become trainers who will be able to bring their expertise home to train others in the same area.  I agree that it is a matter of enhancing the capability of our personnel, which is important.  As well as when our personnel respond to calls for civil power, when VIPs visit, they come to a safe environment, and personnel can put their training to good use overseas in operations on any of our peacekeeping missions overseas.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked from where the European Defence Fund comes.  Until 2020, the Commission will allocate &euro;590 million to the European Defence Fund, &euro;90 million to the research window and &euro;500 million to the capability under the European defence industrial development programme, which was exclusively resourced from redeployments under subheading 1a of the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020.  After 2020, the European Defence Fund will be financed from the EU budget.  The level of funding proposed is &euro;13 billion, which will depend on the outcome of negotiations on the multiannual financial framework 2021-27.  I reiterate that the guidance and advice of military management indicates that it is a good course in which we should participate.  It will give members of the Defence Forces enhanced capability, which I am sure all Deputies would support.  When members of the Defence Forces travel overseas, I want to be able to say we are sending the best, the best trained and the best equipped at any time.  The course is worthwhile and worth the money we are spending and investing in it.</p></speech>

It is only right and proper that the wonderful work being done by all of our personnel, of whom we have been proud and supportive over the years, is put on the record.</p> <p>  On the small amount of funding that is required for the project to proceed, as the Minister of State noted, the Defence Forces deal with unexploded improvised explosive devices and so on.  For the safety of our people, it is vital that we engage and, given the funding that is being made available, support the motion as a committee.  The corps of engineers needs to be specialised, which it is, and the finer points of its duties must be dealt with.  It must be given top priority.  The Minister of State referred to an overall cost of approximately &euro;157,000, which is vital for the Defence Forces in addressing the current deficiency in the advanced level of engineering specialists and searching-and-clearing capabilities.  I have seen at first hand what the Defence Forces have done at various places around the country.  Members of the Defence Forces must be protected and safeguarded, and they must have not only the equipment but also all the knowledge and know-how.  I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</p></speech>

If we invite foreign dignitaries or Heads of State, such as British royalty, the Pope or the President or Vice President of the United States, they should come here aware that they are in a safe environment.  If members of the Defence Forces are, for example, sweeping Knock Airport or the Phoenix Park, they should have the relevant skills and capability to be able to do so.  When peacekeeping overseas, too, they should have the training and expertise to be able to carry out their work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019021200002#E00500"><p>In recent times, whenever I receive a document from the Department of Defence, I get shivers down my spine.  There is an increasing feeling that we are being walked into circumstances.  There were references to capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  What are international crisis management operations?  It is as though we are ashamed of the fact that we are renowned worldwide for peacekeeping.  That is our speciality.  There are enough people with the necessary equipment who engage in military activity.  We engage in peacekeeping and we have a specialist ability to do so, built up over many generations.  I get the feeling that we are being dragged, slowly but surely, as if we are ashamed that we are only peacekeepers.</p><p>What are international crisis management operations?  The Minister of State indicated that a force protection programme is a key issue for the Defence Forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas.  We are being walked into something here and we should be extremely careful.  As a former Minister for Defence, I am very proud of the role played by the Irish Defence Forces in peacekeeping abroad.  Ireland is renowned for its peacekeeping efforts.  We have a specialist knowledge of these matters and we should be very proud of our peacekeeping, and continue to support it.  I get the feeling that we are semi-ashamed that we are not in with the big boys.  It is as if peacekeeping has gone out of fashion.  In my opinion, peacekeeping has not gone out of fashion and is more important now than ever.  We should not allow anybody to interfere with it.</p><p> The Minister of State said all of these projects are designed to enhance the capacity of the Defence Forces to participate in international crisis management operations.  That spells trouble because it is not international peacekeeping.  Our Defence Forces are not there for international crisis management operations.  We do not have the numbers and we do not have the capability.  I get extremely concerned every time I get a memo with this sort of language in it.  It is about time we stood up and said we are proud of the fact that we are renowned for our peacekeeping abilities.  That means having skills that are not available to very many people operating in the world of defence force operations.</p><p> The Minister also said that the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on defence, published in August 2015, states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate in multinational capability development projects within the framework of the European Defence Agency in support of the Defence Forces&rsquo; operations, capacity and capability.  What does all that mean?  It is jargon for saying we are shifting away from genuine peacekeeping.  I support previous speakers who said it was about time we stood up and said we are peacekeepers.  We are proud of the skills we have developed over many years on various operations throughout the world.  We do not get engaged in peacemaking, which means getting involved in conflict.  This is worth protecting and it is worthwhile for this committee to set out what we believe our Defence Forces should be doing.  They should continue to do what they have been doing, very successfully, down through the years as peacekeepers in various parts of the world.</p><p> I get the impression that people want to show that our Army is as good as the next.  However, ours is a peacekeeping army.  It goes on peacekeeping missions and does not look for conflict.  I get very nervous every time I see documentation like this because we are walking into something I do not believe the vast majority of the Irish people want to get involved in.  We are all very proud of our peacekeepers who have carried out their duties in various parts of the world and brought great credit to the country.  If we are going to become one of the others, count me out.  I do not think it is an advisable road to go down.  This committee should state that it wants our Defence Forces to be the best peacekeepers in the world.</p></speech>

However, members of the Irish Defence Forces have been participating in EDA projects since 2005.  I named a number of the projects they have participated in.  They include: a force protection programme; a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection programme; counter-improvised explosives devices manual neutralisation projects; maritime surveillance networking projects; co-operation on cyber ranges in the European Union; and joint procurement arrangements for satellite communications.  My view is that peacekeeping and the EDA are interlinked and have interoperability.  We cannot do peacekeeping without doing the training and education for our personnel or giving them the very best equipment.</p> <p>  On the previous occasion on which I was before the committee, the motion relating to Operation Sophia was going through and I stated that peacekeeping has changed.  The Deputy had a different opinion but I have been involved with the Defence Forces since 2011 and I have seen advances in technology in that period of which we have to keep abreast.  The threats we face today are totally different from those we faced when we first went to the Congo in the 1960s, at the beginning of our proud peacekeeping tradition.  The Deputy said the majority of the Irish people do not want to get involved in these things but I have a different opinion on this.  I believe that, when we send members of the Defence Forces overseas on peacekeeping duties, such as on the UNIFIL mission where we have 460 people or UNDOF, the vast majority of Irish people expect them to have the best of training, equipment and expertise.  If we had not trained and educated members of the Irish Defence Forces but left them as they were in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s, we would have had many more fatalities than we have had.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that peacekeeping had not changed, but I beg to differ with him on that.  It is still about keeping the peace but we need to have the necessary capability and capacity when we send troops overseas.</p></speech>

Peacekeeping has not changed - we have changed.  We have a very proud record in peacekeeping and have engaged in various missions abroad that were genuine peacekeeping missions.  It is still possible to participate in peacekeeping and we do not have to be involved in crisis management, which means situations of conflict.  We have built up a lot of respect for our Defence Forces.  They should, of course, have the necessary protection if somebody comes upon them but I am talking about the missions we go on.  We go on purely peacekeeping missions and do not get involved in operations issues, which require being armed to the teeth.</p><p>That is the point I am trying to get across.  We have done more for the world peace with our small groups of soldiers going abroad on peacekeeping missions than many large armies which go abroad up to their necks in equipment.  Let us not lose those skills.  Like me, the Deputy will have had the pleasure of seeing how our troops integrate into communities.  The Chairman will have also seen it.  They involve themselves in community activities.  They do not go in and march up the street with a lot of equipment.  They become part of the community, which is how they get the information and support they need from local people.  That is where we should remain.  We should not get involved with the other guys who want to have a lot of ammunition.  While it is a decision for people to make up their own minds on, we can do more good in the world by being experts in genuine peacekeeping and by maintaining our reputation in that regard.</p></speech>

He has always expressed strong views on this important issue.  They need to be given due cognisance and heed must be taken of them given his experience of seeing how policy has evolved over the years.  Does Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh have a question this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019021200002#G00300"><p>I do.  I asked a few questions earlier, but I have very specific ones on the briefing note we received.  Does the SOFA, which was signed last week, despite our opposition, cover participation in the four search events which it is expected will be conducted annually by participating member states?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is mentioned in respect of units co-operating with the Defence Forces when carrying out the high profile specialist search function during high profile visits by foreign VIPs.  Are garda&iacute; going to be trained by the personnel who have been, or who will be, sent on the six-year training course?</p> <p>  The cost is minuscule if one takes it some ways.  The note suggests that it will be &euro;157,500, including &euro;102,500 in contributions-in-kind, and that the net financial cost of Ireland's contribution will be &euro;55,000.  Is that per year or is it for the entire six years?  If it is the former, it is &euro;10,000.  I find it difficult to understand how one would host an international seminar and send soldiers on four training events at a cost of &euro;10,000.  How many personnel will be trained over the six years?  Will it be the same personnel and is the Minister of State adamant that tying those personnel up on these courses will not take from current or recommended EOD capacity in the State?  I do not refer to the overseas responsibilities because there are two ESSC units overseas.</p> <p>  Another question arises from that but it is not answered in the briefing note.  It seems to be suggested rather than guaranteed.  The briefing note states that the Defence Forces' corps of engineers do not have ESSC teams at an advanced search capability level.  One of the things the USA, the British and the Pope seemed happy enough with was the level the Army had.  Why are members getting trained to a level which is not required to have a US President, the Pope or the English Queen coming to our shores?  They were happy enough.  Did the State have to rely on a foreign army to train or dictate how searches were carried out in advance of those visits?  Given that this is an advanced search capability on the conduct of hazardous environmental searches, working in confined spaces and operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments, what additional equipment will be required to be purchased by the Defence Forces in future to ensure they carry out these searches independently of the other nations?  Will it be part of the interoperability of these searches that we will have to import or purchase equipment from either the European Defence Agency or other armed forces?</p></speech>

On my recent visit to Mali, I saw a presentation on improvised explosives and the way the technical nature of those has changed over the years.  It is very important for our personnel to be able to identify what type of explosive is being used, where it might be buried or laid and how to spot an anomaly in an area.  I do not have the proper military language in which to couch it for the Deputy, but these matters have become technical over the years and we must keep abreast of such developments.  The SOFAs will not apply as this is a course.  We will not need SOFAs for courses.</p></speech>

These four search events will be conducted in member states, including Cyprus and Spain.  That means operating with a potential liability if something happens.</p></speech>

There might be a little bit outdoors but I am not sure of the extent.  However, soldiers are not out in battle or anything.  I assure the Deputy of that.  There are 60 places on the course over the duration of the project.  Perhaps a number of people could be on the first part of the course and there might be a more advanced part of the course in two or three years to which they would return for further education in the area of explosives and so on.</p></speech>

I recall meeting chairmen of other foreign affairs and defence committees at a parliamentary forum organised by the Presidency of the EU.  Some small member states, which, like us, take great pride in their neutrality, suggested that smaller member states like ours should be involved in cybersecurity projects at EU level.</p><p>Trying to counteract cyber terrorism is a significant problem for the international community, one that knows no boundaries.  As we all realise, we can all easily become victims of it.  If we are not participating in it, perhaps it is the type of area in which we should be interested in becoming involved, particularly as a small member state with a strong attachment to its policy of neutrality.  Will the Minister of State come back to us on the matter if the information is not readily available?</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that our policy on cyber security resides in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This needs to change as a priority.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has criticised its strategic function and entire operation, there is a weakness.  It involves collaboration with European partners, but at an interdepartmental level we need to re-evaluate the basis on which the policy on cyber security resides in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment where it is seen as a technical or technological issue, rather than a security matter.  I am talking about the matter in an Irish, not a military, context.  The Chairman's point is valid.  There are significant opportunities for us in attracting foreign direct investment if we develop a better cyber security policy from a defence perspective.  There are also opportunities in the areas of job creation and enterprise.</p></speech>

Within this allocation, programme A, which relates to flood risk management, received an allocation of just under &euro;112 million.  With the ongoing challenge of climate change and more severe weather, this allocation is most welcome in supporting both capital infrastructural and non-infrastructural work to mitigate against flooding nationwide and to provide much-needed protection to homes and businesses.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, 29 flood risk management plans were published in 2018.  These plans contain 118 new projects to be progressed over the next decade, which will provide protection to 95% of those properties assessed in the plans to be at significant flood risk.  The first phase of the implementation has commenced, including 57 projects to be advanced by the OPW and the local authorities, consisting of 26 medium to major schemes, with values between &euro;1 million and &euro;40 million and 31 smaller projects, with individual values of under &euro;1 million.  The remainder of the projects will be progressed over the course of the next ten years.  In addition to this, the OPW continues to implement the prior programme of capital flood relief, which has ten projects at the construction stage and a further 24 schemes at the design and planning stages.  These new flood relief schemes, together with those 77 schemes complete or under way, will provide flood protection to approximately 33,000 properties at risk from significant flood events.</p><p>Programme B within the 2019 Estimates provides funding of &euro;355 million for estate management.  This facilitates the works of the Office of Public Works, OPW, in providing accommodation primarily, but not exclusively, for office use across 17 Departments, to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many other State agencies.  The current OPW office accommodation estate comprises of 870,000 sq. m, accommodating approximately 40,000 civil servants.<br/><br/>Estate management also supports funding for heritage sites and monuments.  In 2018, we have again seen an increase in visitor numbers at heritage sites and a corresponding increase in the Exchequer revenue.  The culture and heritage estate managed by the Office of Public Works continues to play an important part in Ireland's tourism infrastructure.  The OPW is happy to play its part in ensuring that visitors to Ireland who want to experience these sites have a full, fulfilling and engaging experience.  The commitment of the Office of Public Works in this area is highlighted by the nomination of OPW-managed sites in recent awards.  Kilkenny Castle, Newgrange, and the Phoenix Park were nominated for Ireland's favourite local attraction in the <i>Irish Independent</i>2019 reader travel awards, with the Phoenix Park selected as the overall winner.  This is in addition to the Phoenix Park receiving a gold international large park award from the World Urban Parks Association.<br/><br/>I have provided a brief outline of the broad-ranging essential works carried out by the OPW on behalf of Government and am more than happy to take questions on the OPW 2019 Estimate.  I also express my appreciation for the committee's time and input in considering the valuable outputs to be achieved through this funding.</p></speech>

There are a couple of things I would like to be enlightened on, if possible.  I understand the Cabinet meeting is probably finished and I would like to know, in the context of the revision of the Estimates which is being undertaken, what, if anything, the OPW has been asked to bear.  In terms of any potential reductions, where has the OPW agreed to take reprofiling reductions in terms of estimated spend?</p> <p>  Given the OPW's recognised and very valued expertise in building and development projects, perhaps the Minister of State can refresh our memories as to whether the OPW has had any role in the largest capital project in the history of the State, namely, the children's hospital.  Has it provided any oversight, information or advice to the various committees involved in the children's hospital project?  We all appreciate and know from our own constituencies the very good work that is done by the OPW.  I am glad to see the Minister of State's reference to the Phoenix Park.  The second issue on which I would expect the OPW to have some expertise as a consequence of its work is building inflation.  What is the OPW's estimation of building inflation over the past two years given that a lot of its projects work on a contract basis and it is well used to dealing with contractors?  On the children's hospital, we have heard some pretty staggering construction cost inflation figures.  I would like to hear about the OPW's experience of building inflation.</p> <p>  Returning to our last discussion about the Phoenix Park, I am glad to see the park has won another award.  What progress has been made on the issues we raised at that meeting, namely, the need to identify the costs in greater detail?</p><p>It is a project the OPW has been waiting to undertake for a number of years.  What is the state of play on it?  Is it likely to fall victim to the cutbacks being discussed by the Government or can the Minister of State tell us where the cutbacks are likely to be made?  </p><p> Another project OPW has announced is the bridge over the River Liffey to link the Phoenix Park with the War Memorial Gardens via the lower road.  The project is being put out for competition.  Will the Minister of State inform us what stage it is at and whether such a project is likely to suffer in the revised scheduling and because of the cutbacks in allocations?  </p><p> Communities throughout the country are also extremely anxious about flood relief programmes.  There are large-scale flood relief programmes in different parts of the country.  Is any of them being rescheduled because of the cutbacks the Government has indicated resulting from the runaway cost of the children's hospital project?</p></speech>

However, it has been widely flagged that a number of Departments have been asked about cutbacks in allocations.  The information given to my Department is that a figure of &euro;3 million is with the Cabinet, but I have received no information back on it.

None of the commissioners is sitting on the multiple hospital boards that are overseeing the children's hospital project.  I am aware that the Minister of State has no responsibility in the matter, but given the OPW's expertise which is better than that of most consultants, is the Minister of State informing the committee that-----</p></speech>

The chairman can deal with the other question.</p> <p>  On construction inflation, costs have gone up by 3.95% nationally.  This will have an impact when we price a job.  For example, on a scheme we announced some time ago we saw that because of inflation some extra funding might be required.  My apologies - I think I am reading it in error as the rate is 12%.</p></speech>

Going back to the expertise of the Office of Public Works, the projects listed by the Minister of State in the papers are complex, wide-ranging and based all around the country, including Dublin.  Is he not surprised by the rate of inflation about which he is reading for the children's hospital?  It is amazing that nobody in government thought to knock on anybody's door in the OPW to ask for some advice on such a project when costs were running away?</p></speech>

As Deputy Burton said, in the OPW we are experiencing rampant construction inflation.  The figures the Minister of State has quoted are the market figures of the Society of Chartered Surveyors and the trend is upwards.  This time last year we would have had a figure of 4% or 5% and been pricing our own building projects at a rate of 6% to 7%, thinking we were being conservative.</p><p>As the Minister of State said, construction inflation is recognised in the industry as being at least 8%.  The OPW believes it is running much higher and my personal guess is that it is 11% or 12%.  It is much higher again in specific parts of the industry, such as mechanical and electrical work which is a major component of the construction work on the national children's hospital that Deputy Burton asked about.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Buckley saying that level of inflation is being experienced in respect of the works in Leinster House?  What level of inflation has the OPW provided for in respect of the Leinster House works?</p></speech>

Having seen the work on a tour with Members today, the amount of work involved is apparent.  The figure will exceed &euro;15 million but I do not know by how much.  A certain amount of work was not foreseen.  This is evident when one peels back the lead flashing to see the damage, particularly around the chimneys and to the roof.  One of the standing walls is a stand-alone wall without netting and bricks.  It had to be stripped back and it is a very slow process.  However, having seen the amount of work being done to restore Leinster House to the way it was all those years ago, I expect the final cost to be higher than &euro;15 million.</p></speech>

Faults were found when the flooring was peeled back and work was needed to address them.  The ceilings had to be pinned up again, which takes time.  Leinster House is a protected structure so the work is time consuming and costly.</p></speech>

In other major projects such as Abbotstown, the National Aquatic Centre and so on, where independent companies were involved in construction, the OPW or people with experience of the OPW were heavily involved in those projects, partly for technical reasons and expertise, but also, I imagine, for reasons of proper management and oversight.  Is the Minister of State still telling us that no one from the OPW is involved in the national children's hospital project?</p></speech>

There are many areas, such as education or the wider health remit, in which the OPW is not involved in any formal way.  We have no involvement in project management or governance.  One will often find, and this will have been the case with the children's hospital, that the OPW might be called informally to give technical advice, as the Deputy mentioned, on specific points of architecture or structural engineering issues that might arise during a project.  It could be different things, such as site management.  The OPW worked with the Central Bank on its headquarters project even though we had no formal role but we were able to give our building expertise where required.</p></speech>

I got an improved allocation, of an extra &euro;9 million, and will lose &euro;3 million of that.  There is a lead-in period to most schemes.  Some &euro;9 million was announced for Carrick-on-Shannon last October.  If that work was to start today, it would probably only draw down &euro;1 million of that in 2019.  The lead-in period gives me the scope to do that.  As people know, I am hands-on with regard to flooding.  I may have one or two ideas that I would like to spend more money on.  They may be shelved for the time being.  I am happy that the schemes which have been announced will not be touched in any way.</p></speech>

Mr. Buckley was very helpful in his answers.  A number of figures have been given.  Mr. Buckley gave the committee his view from the prospective of the OPW that construction inflation was possibly running as high as 11% to 12%.</p></speech>

In the case of that contract - I am sure it applies to others - a guaranteed maximum price is set and there are certain exclusions which can give rise to an increase in price above the guaranteed maximum price.  One of the exclusions is national construction inflation running above 4% post-July 2019.  If Mr. Buckley is telling us that construction inflation is running at 11% to 12%, we are looking at an excess of 7% to 8% on what has been built into the contract.  If that level of inflation is sustained for a number of years, one is looking at a significant escalation.  Is that a fair way of looking at it?</p></speech>

Reverting to my earlier point, this time last year we were using a figure of 6% and thinking we were being conservative.  Now we realise 6% was too low.  A cost estimate is redone several times until one gets to the definitive cost in going to procurement and the placing of contracts.</p> <p>  On the type of contract the OPW would typically place, a contract worth &euro;100 million would be a very large project for us.  It is done at a point in time.  A contractor bids for the contract with a price which is then fixed.  The ultimate determinant in the contracts we place is the competitive process, including tenders.  Up until the time we proceed to competition, we are still estimating the price.  Five tenders might be received and we would then know the exact price.</p></speech>

The Deputy is talking about managing risk.  We have tried to move to fixed price contracts, with the risk being carried by the contractor.  That is the situation I am flagging, although it is difficult to make it work, particularly for large and complex contracts.  The scenario we in the OPW see most often involves something like a heritage building, for example, Leinster House, where we cannot specify in detail exactly what work is involved until we go in and get below the surface.  The Minister of State knows another scenario very well, that of flood relief projects, in which every river is different and it is difficult to anticipate the technical problems that will arise.  It is difficult to work with fixed price contracts.  Much of the current theory is that the risk should be shared in a structured way between the contracting body and the contractor.</p></speech>

The OPW sits within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which also hosts the Office of Government Procurement in the overall management of State contracts.  Mr. Buckley is saying the property arm - the OPW - does not use a contract model that provides for the contractor being compensated on an ongoing basis for construction inflation above a certain level.  In the case of the national children's hospital, however, that is a key part of the contract, in the drafting of which the OPW's parent Department was clearly very involved.  They are two different ways of managing contracts.</p></speech>

We would be party to the continual review of the Government form of construction contract which is managed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are a number of variations of the form over time.  The OPW has used variations in the heritage area, but 99 times out of 100 we use the straightforward fixed-price contract which works in the case of most of our work.</p></speech>

The industry has provided certain statistics for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the levels of flood insurance coverage in those areas and claimed that they are high.</p><p>They would argue that it is more than 80%.  Is the Department and the Office of Public Works, OPW, continuing to work on that issue? Drilling into those statistics a little more, I want to know about properties in low-lying areas that were previously prone to flooding but have now benefited from a flood relief scheme completed by the OPW which has proven to be successful.  Does the Minister of State have a handle on the proportion of those properties now able to get flood insurance? It seems that the statistics given by the industry to the OPW and to the Department are taking account of properties that always had insurance such as those that might be 100 m up a hill.  I am referring to the properties that are low lying and were at risk of flooding or may have flooded, that now benefit from this taxpayer-funded scheme that has proven to be successful, but still cannot get insurance.  That is my point.</p></speech>

Where flood relief schemes have been built and we have visited, we have spoken to those people and have been told that while it is slow they are seeing the insurance companies starting to insure them.  I see cases like this regularly as I travel around the State.  We have seen a bigger uptake.  Where the OPW has built defences we have seen insurance companies working with people to get insurance in place.  I can say this because I know a great number of people, for whom I have made representations previously, and especially more recently in Dublin with the Dodder River, who previously could not get insurance are now getting insured with insurance companies.  This is where we have flood defences in situ.</p></speech>

I was with the Minister of State on this morning's tour of the works with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The architects were able to explain to us that they had been through nearly 90% of the house and have uncovered the various issues.  They have reduced the risk to very little.  The Minister of State referred to the chimneys, which still have to be fully investigated.  When that is done we will, know the timescale and the costs.</p></speech>

That is not the question here.  The OPW has an overrun on the &euro;15 million and construction inflation may kick in on that overrun.</p><p>There is also a request, it is presumed from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to cut back OPW works to the tune of &euro;3 million.  The State has told Departments to make cutbacks and Deputy McGrath asked how the OPW was going to achieve this &euro;3 million cutback.  The Minister of State has told us there will be a delay in the OPW starting some projects and perhaps the savings will be achieved that way.  If that is to be the case, the OPW will not have spent all of its money in 2019.  Will the OPW be handing back money to the Department in 2019?  The Minister of State must have anticipated in the context of the budget that he was going to spend all of the money allocated to the OPW in 2019.  If, however, all the money the Minister of State estimated for spending is not to be spent in 2019 because projects are to be delayed in starting or in the amount of money spent on them as they go along, then all of the allocated money will not be spent.  The Minister of State is saying that he will not spend all of the money in 2019 but that there will only be a few weeks in the difference.  The overrun on the works to Leinster House must also be factored in and whatever else might happen to that cost because of construction inflation.  In examining his figures, and knowing the Cabinet was to meet this morning, where has the Minister of State identified hard figures to cut back the &euro;3 million?  It will not all be achieved by just staggering the start-----</p></speech>

With regard to moving up the delivery on flood relief schemes, we have gone from approximately &euro;45 million up to &euro;76 million this year and will go to &euro;100 million by 2021.  I am quite confident that once I announce a scheme for the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, system, which is the bible for the State when it comes to flooding, I will deliver on those scheme to protect people with regard to flood relief.</p></speech>

The weighting of tenders varies from project to project as the most economical tender evaluation process goes on, as I understand it.  My information is no better than that of Deputy O'Brien and is drawn from what is in the media.  I understand the children's hospital tender might have been 75% price-based.</p></speech>

We often have a tender 60% based on costs.  I have no wish to keep coming back to Leinster House as if it was the most important project in Ireland, but it is a good example.  Sometimes a critical or delicate project involves very fine conservation work that not everyone can do.  Thus, there would be far higher emphasis on quality, experience and track record in that area in such a case.  I do not know the exact figures off-hand.  Generally, in my experience, cost would be in the order of 50% or above 50% and it would not be unusual for cost to be as high as 75%.</p></speech>

Does the OPW take this into consideration when looking at the tendering process if someone comes in low?  I gather the EU directive refers to approximately 15% of the adjusted average.  If the lowest tender is 15% below the average of all the tenders, then it is considered an abnormally low tender.  Does the OPW do any work on that?  If someone comes in with a really low tender, does the OPW look at it or question it?  Is it overlooked because so much emphasis is put on the weighting system?  Is that the reason it is overlooked?  I am trying to get some information on how the process works.</p></speech>

I am not an expert on procurement in the area so I cannot quote exactly how the EU rules referred to by Deputy O'Brien are applied.  Certainly, one might think one would be delighted to see a quote come in at 20% or 30% below the other five or six quotes, but actually it causes nervousness because it is often a signal that something is wrong.  Perhaps the tenderer has left something out.  We would evaluate tenders in detail and ensure that is not the case.  Unfortunately-----</p></speech>

Let us imagine the OPW looked at a given tender and had suspicions that it was simply too low or was not going to do what it said on the tin.  Would the OPW be within its rights to simply ignore that tender?</p></speech>

Let us consider a hypothetical example involving a tender for three buildings.  If a contractor tenders for only two of the three buildings then there are rules on how to deal with that and either the contract would be eliminated or it would be revised.  I hope Deputy O'Brien does not ask me to quote the exact rules, but there is a transparent process and all the tenders are involved.  Those of us in the industry would be concerned in general &ndash; I am not talking about a specific contractor or project.  Everyone in public procurement and in the industry in general would be concerned about what we believe is a practice that has developed in the past ten years of certain contractors deliberately quoting low for contracts and then seeking to recover the price and more during the course of the work.</p></speech>

If an organisation does not accept the lowest bid, it can create legal issues.  One official from the Department of Health said the Department could end up on the steps of the Four Courts if it does not accept the lowest bid.  If the evaluators know the lowest bid is simply not going to cut it, then what recourse is there?</p><p>In a case like that, an organisation should be able to say that it will not accept the lowest bid and outline the reasons without fear of legal action hanging overhead.  How do we balance that?</p></speech>

Sometimes the situation can be analysed and we can see the quote is too low because of X, Y or Z.  That can be addressed and the tender can be eliminated.  That does happen.  However, there are situations &ndash; it happens at the OPW &ndash; where an organisation is forced in a certain way because it is a legal requirement in the procurement rules to accept the tender that would appear to be valid.  It does happen that during certain projects we spend more of our time in arbitration and conciliation - going through prices and dealing with claims - than on the building sites doing the works, which is where we should be focused.</p></speech>

In other jurisdictions there are provisions on the Statute Book so that if a tender is below a certain percentage of the adjusted average price then they can be eliminated without fear of the contractor taking legal action.  Is that something we should consider, on the basis of Mr. Buckley's experience?  Maybe I am drifting into policy now.  Would it be helpful to the situation if the threat of the lowest bidder taking legal action in certain circumstances was taken off the table?</p></speech>

Obviously, the clearer the rules of the game are and the clearer the legal situation, the better.  That applies to everyone involved, not only the contractor and the OPW or the State but also the person doing the work.  We are all concerned about being fair to the smaller builder and for there to be a level playing field.  The person who is honest and quotes correctly should have the best chance of winning the work.</p> <p>  I cannot comment on the methodology to get there and I cannot comment on how the system in Ireland compares to other countries, but certainly as a major public procurement body in the construction area the OPW, along with all the other parties involved, is concerned to work on the system, learn from experience and get it right.  There have been some concerning trends in the marketplace in recent years.</p></speech>

It seems that cost is always the biggest factor or consideration in the weighting and then quality is the second factor.  That may not be standard across the board but it seems to be the trend.  A significantly higher weighting is given to cost.  Is any weighting given to past performances of the contractor?</p></speech>

Certainly, track record in terms of whether a contractor has done the particular work involved or whether it has done projects of that scale can be taken into account.  However, behaviour or reputation as an "honest Joe" or otherwise cannot.  It has to be objective.</p></speech>

It is made up of pounds, shillings and pence, or euro and cents.  We can see exactly what it is.  Once we start putting a high percentage on quality or prior experience and so on, we are getting into a more subjective area.  If we are into more subjective evaluation, then unfortunately, we leave ourselves open to challenge.</p></speech>

If it is, then, as legislators, I, the Minister of State and you, Chairman, would be keen to change that system.  I simply want to know whether that is currently the system.  If a contractor has a reputation for consistently putting in low bids that end up costing the State significantly more, that cannot be a factor when an organisation is looking at a tendering process.

On profiled capital expenditure, he has a sum of &euro;19.4 million pencilled in in 2019.  There is a figure of &euro;3 million for a project in Blackpool; &euro;6 million in Douglas; &euro;5 million in Ennis south; &euro;3 million in Glashaboy; &euro;1.6 million in lower Morell; and &euro;800,000 in Sandymount.  According to the Minister of State's earlier references, the cutbacks are largely expected to be made through delays in flood relief schemes.  He suggested he would delay them by a number of weeks.  Does it mean that will take a slice out of the six projects or will he identify one or two which will experience a longer delay or delays?  How will he approach the matter?  I presume the projects in Cork are of a piece, or can they be treated separately?  Can the Minister of State give us some idea of what will happen?  Alternatively, are there other elements of existing programmes which could be cut?  I presume there is a certain level of energy in existing programmes and that it would be foolish to stop or delay them and that, therefore, what has been said applies to the new programmes.  Given that the schemes cover many properties of families and individuals who are waiting for them, the Minister of State might enlighten us on how he proposes to address the issue.  Will he tell us how he will identify the schemes that he will possibly hold back?  Will he hold back a clutch of them, or will he merely say, as there are a couple of &euro;3 million projects included, that the Government will hold back the first one, the project in Blackpool, because it is a tidy sum of &euro;3 million and can be easily done?  In what way will it be done?</p> <p>  I want to ask about the OPW's relationship with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The OPW is within the remit of that Department but independent.  I do not understand what the Department's involvement is in the oversight of the OPW's budget.  While the Department does have a role, the OPW does not in the national children's hospital project.  Does the Department look at the OPW's budget?  For example, does the Minister, Deputy Donohoe meet the Minister of State before the budget to have a chat with him about what he proposes to do?  Do the senior civil servants in the Department such as the Secretary General have a word with the chairman of the OPW or the commissioners in looking at both the capital and current budgets?  In my experience as a Minister, this happens on an annual basis for all elements of the budget, capital and current.  I wonder what is the experience in the OPW.</p></speech>

On the other six that are due to proceed to construction, some may be delayed in the planning process.  It may not necessarily involve those schemes but others that are also ready to go on which we will delay in the planning process to absorb the cut of &euro;3 million.</p></speech>

He has included a figure of &euro;76 million in the Estimate.  I have totted up the figures on page 5 and they roughly come to the &euro;76 million mentioned in the Estimate.  The Minister of State correctly states he will not touch the first lot of projects and some of the second lot and that the ones due to start in 2019 could be delayed.  There are then some unspecified projects.  Are they included in the third lot of projects?  If the Minister of State is to find the &euro;3 million in the Estimate of &euro;76 million, it has to be in it somewhere.</p></speech>

As I said, I gave a clear indication it is coming from the flood side.  I will have to sit down and see exactly where I will make the savings to which I referred.  I give an assurance that the schemes I mentioned will not be affected by this cut.  No one sitting at this table knows better than I the pressure on people throughout the country.  I have travelled around and I have seen it.  I fought tooth and nail since I came into the Department to get every shilling I have and I will continue to do so, particularly for those people previously mentioned.

Part of the Tolka river basin in my constituency is in an area called Barnhill or Baberstown.  Historically, there has been significant flooding in fields in this area every four or five years and also during periods of very heavy rain.  The area is marked on the flood risk maps.  However, the local authority describes the flooding as fluvial, rather than granting it another designation.  What it is stating, therefore, although there is a railway line, is that there is no need to undertake an in-depth examination because it has identified the particular flood risk.  People living in the area have photographs, as I do, of houses surrounded by flooding, yet Fingal County Council states the leve of flood risk does not matter particularly in planning.  Prior to the Minister of State's period in office, the OPW worked in the area for many years and probably completed flooding works in the vicinity of Dunboyne, Castleknock, Blanchardstown and, in particular, the two areas mentioned, Barnhill and Baberstown.  Westmastown is another.  The OPW carried out a lot of specific drainage works, particularly on the tributaries of the River Tolka, on which, as those from the OPW will know, there can be heavy flooding.  In Irish its name actually means "flood".  I am really at a loss to understand the reason the flooding has been described as fluvial and not as flooding that merits particular examination.  We have received this information in recent days and people are very concerned that a lot of properties will built in the fields which will be subject to the same risk of flooding.</p></speech>

It is of particular interest to us as we are very active in the area of research on microplastics pollution.  The statement submitted outlines the sources and some potential impacts of microplastics.  I reiterate our support for the proposed Bill.</p> <p>  I will present some of our current and previous work in which we investigated sources and pathways of microplastics.  I will begin with the sources of microplastics and what we know about pathways to the freshwater environment.  A desktop study in 2015, which was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, outlined some potential sources of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments.</p><p>The study identified some catchments which had potentially high-risk microplastic pollution.  We also did a smaller scale study in which we were able to quantify some of these microplastic levels and describe some of the sources.</p><p> With particular relevance to microplastics coming from industry, we visited some industry polymer companies.  In one of these, polymerisation processes took place, while another had machining of microplastics.  We found that even though these were quite well regulated plastics industries with their own on-site treatment, they still emitted substantial amounts of microplastics to the sewer.  As well as accidental emissions to a sewer, we also identified some allowable discharges to a sewer which take place due to the current lack of regulation of microplastics in industry.  In our plastics industries, there is an allowable suspended solid loading which is quantified in milligrams per litre.  This can equate to quite high levels of microplastics emissions.  This problem of allowable emissions has also been flagged internationally by Lechner and Ramler in 2015, as they quantified high numbers of microplastics coming out of an Austrian recycling industry.</p><p> As well as the accidental and allowable emissions to a sewer, there is also a potential for accidental spillages within industry, such as spillages onto factory floors or onto the surrounding hard substrate outside.  There remains potential for run-off in the storm water drain or perhaps direct run-off into freshwater.  The EPA has funded GMIT and UCD to carry out a project, Sources, Pathways and Environmental Fate of Microplastics, in which we are examining the potential for plastics to be found in the vicinity of plastics industries by sampling the sewer drain and assessing the potential for direct input by looking at nearby water courses.  This work is ongoing.</p><p> Pathways from the sources into our sewers have been examined in recent years by several researchers, including us.  In summary, many sources such as those emanating from industry, landfill, storm water drains and domestic use such as washing machines drainage enter the wastewater treatment plant system.  Upon entering, the microplastic loading is partitioned into what comes out in the receiving waters and what is captured in the sewage sludge.  We found there is a high capture rate within wastewater treatment plants of roughly 90%.  In Ireland, microplastics which are incorporated into the sewage sludge may find their way back onto the land due to spreading of sewage sludge practices.  The remaining 10%, which is not a low figure, ends up in our rivers and lakes.  We do not really know where the microplastics go from there or what impact they may have on the environment or human health.</p><p> Some other sources we are currently investigating include microplastics emanating from the construction industry, as it has a very high plastics demand, and from astroturf or artificial pitches and playgrounds.  We have carried out sampling and are currently analysing some of our data.  What we want to see is how plastics are spread or transported from these sources and if there is a danger to nearby water courses.  Preliminary results show that aspects of construction design dramatically reduce the leakage of microplastics from astroturf pitches.</p><p>They include microplastics from astroturf pitches, used in the construction of boundaries and other features.  Other sources and pathways for microplastics which we really want to investigate include how microplastics, once they become land-spread, are transported overland into nearby watercourses.  In our current study we are investigating the potential for and the mechanisms for overland movement and run-off from rainwater, as well as the vertical migration of microplastics.  This is being done via a series of experiments and fieldwork.  We are also investigating the potential for microplastics in the freshwater environment to be transferred through the food chain and monitoring microplastics in a number of watercourses, particularly in the River Slaney catchment.  Preliminary results of this work show that all of the river water samples obtained so far contain microplastics, the majority of which are microplastic fibres.  We have found that microplastics are present in all of the invertebrate species we have captured from rivers.  </p><p> There are certain points at which we might be able to intervene.  There is a high number of clean-up initiatives under way on beaches and rivers.  While this is very useful and important for the surrounding ecosystem, more emphasis should be placed on intervention at an earlier stage.  Of course, prevention is the best solution to the problem; therefore, we very much support legislation or regulations to reduce the production and use of plastics.  This might also be feasible through awareness campaigns, or consumer driven initiatives.  Furthermore, there is great scope for intervention at the product design stage.  Once microplastics or plastics reach the environment or are in use, effective waste management and potential change of industrial practices are very important means by which to decrease dramatically their leakage into the environment.  They can be captured and well managed once they reach receptors such as a wastewater treatment plant.  Technological upgrades to treatment plants to deal with microplastics and allow improved waste management of sludge derived from the plants could also help.  There are a number of clean-up initiatives available once microplastics reach the environment.  </p><p> The last slide shows my team which helps to make this research become a reality.  My colleague, Dr. R&oacute;isin Nash, will give the committee an insight into microplastics in the marine environment.</p></speech>

All habitats and species mentioned hereafter can be taken to have recorded the presence of microplastics.  Studies have reported the ubiquitous recording of microplastics in the Irish marine environment.  At GMIT, experienced marine microplastics scientists are answering a number of research questions involving identification and quantification in seawater, sediments and biota.  Our aims are to build on the knowledge base, particularly in an Irish context; to produce comparative standardised methodologies; to improve comparability throughout Europe; to increase ocean literacy through providing information on microplastics in Irish commercial species and taking an ecosystem-based approach to our research using Irish case studies.</p> <p>  Looking at the earlier studies of microplastics, much of the focus, both in Ireland and outside, was on building a knowledge base.  Dr. Amy Lusher wrote her PhD in GMIT on microplastics and began to show the ubiquitous distribution of microplastics in seawater of the coast and the presence of microplastics both in mesopelagic fish and True&rsquo;s beaked whales.</p><p>Dr. Heidi Acampora did her PhD in microplastics and macroplastics in GMIT where she began to show the high levels of plastics in beached seabirds through carrying out beach bird and colony surveys with the help of Citizen Science.  She helped to develop and apply European methodologies for necroscopies in Ireland.  The results of her research led to the use of an OSPAR ecology quality objective to reduce the levels of litter and plastic particles in fulmar stomachs in Ireland.  Current research by Andrew Power, a PhD candidate on a Marine Institute Cullen fellowship, is looking at seabird eggs to reduce the levels of hazardous substances in the eggs.  Niall Keogh, a PhD student, is building on the knowledge of the interactions of seabirds and marine litter, both inshore and offshore.  Dr. La Daana Kanhai recorded microplastics along latitudinal gradients, including upwelling, in the Atlantic Ocean and seawater sediments and sea ice in the Arctic Sea basin.</p><p> In the area of methodologies, research led by Dr. Anne Marie Mahon is exploring the use of different plankton nets to sample surface microplastics using Galway Bay as a case study.  This has resulted in providing recommendations on the sampling and processing of microplastics in surface waters in Europe.  The research will also provide valuable Irish data for the levels of microplastics in our backyard.  Building on this research, GMIT is particularly invested in quality control and rigorous scientific standards in the research of microplastics and it subsequently led to our involvement in BASEMAN, a JPI Oceans project, with funding supported by the Irish Marine Institute.  Research involving Dr. Jo&atilde;o Frias, Dr. Anne Marie Mahon, Dr. Ian O&rsquo;Connor and me has resulted in the production of European standardised methodologies for seawater, sediment and biota and recommendations for monitoring.</p><p> Research into commercial species is important to increase our knowledge base.  As ocean literacy increases and consumers become more aware of microplastics, they become very interested in the risks associated with seafood.  We have researchers who have examined the intestinal tracts of pelagic fish and the Dublin Bay prawn from fish grounds off the south and west coasts.  The blue mussel is regularly consumed in Ireland, while the common prawn is largely exported.  They have both recorded low levels of microplastics in their intestinal tracts.  We have several research projects exploring research questions in spatial differences and potential impacts on behaviour, etc.  The lug worm, best known for its use as bait, has the potential to result in bioaccumulation of microplastics up the food chain to its predators.</p><p> With so much research, national and international, focusing on individual species, we felt it was important to take an ecosystem approach to get a better overview of what was happening in a bay.  Therefore, Elena Pagter, a PhD candidate, and Dr. Jo&atilde;o Frias are using Galway Bay to build a more complete picture to inform both policy makers and the local community.  Based on the research presented and the fact that, for many products, there are numerous feasible alternatives that may be utilised instead of microplastics, we are in support of the general scheme of the 2018 Bill for the prohibition of certain products containing plastic microbeads.</p></speech>

As we saw at the last meeting of the committee, as well as in the presentations made today by my colleagues from GMIT, there is a lot of evidence that microplastics are a problem.  Our studies show that sediments contain microplastics both from historical and continuing pollution events.  Microplastics in the environment look like food to the organisms which consume them.  They then bioaccumulate which has direct impacts on the organisms and the higher predators which feed on them.  There is evidence of microplastics in both the blue mussel and nephrops in Galway Bay and on the west coast generally, which means that they are in the food chain, which gives real cause for concern.  This evidence adds to international research in the area which confirms the problem across the globe.  In Norway the same species have been seen to contain microplastics.</p><p>From that we can extrapolate that this is a real problem.  Rather than waiting for extensive research specifically in an Irish context, invoking the precautionary principle is a really good idea.  We welcome that the Bill provides that, rather than waiting for all this research over the next number of years, we will invoke the precautionary principle and act now to try to prevent additional primary microplastics entering the environment.</p><p> The clear definition of microbeads in the Bill, which is inclusive of all plastic particles in the size range, is welcome.  It was less clear in the previous Bill.  It is now clearly defined and it makes it easy to understand what exactly the Bill covers.  That is also welcome.</p><p> In terms of the penalty for breaching the law, my reading of it, which may be wrong, is that it would be &euro;500.  That does not seem adequate for the purposes.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.615" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n Dean" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021200002#J00300"><p>Yes.  I thank the joint committee for this opportunity to consult on the prohibition of certain products containing plastic microbeads Bill 2018.  The Irish Cosmetics Detergents and Allied Products Association is the IBEC group representing Irish companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of cosmetics, detergents and allied household products.  The cosmetics and detergent sector takes the issue of plastic aquatic litter seriously and shares the overarching goals of the Government and European Union to address this challenge.  I am joined today by Mr. John Chave, director general of Cosmetics Europe, a European trade association representing more than 4,500 companies and national associations in the cosmetics and personal care sector in Europe.<br/><br/>The cosmetics and detergent sector has taken positive action on the occurrence of plastic microbeads in the marine environment.  Building on voluntary initiatives taken by its individual members companies, on 21 October 2015, Cosmetics Europe issued the following recommendation to its members:</p><blockquote>In view of the public concerns expressed over plastic debris in the marine environment, and given the availability of alternative materials, Cosmetics Europe recommends its membership to discontinue, in wash-off cosmetic products placed on the market as of 2020: the use of synthetic, solid plastic particles used for exfoliating and cleansing that are non-biodegradable in the marine environment.</blockquote> <p>Results of 2018 data<b></b>collected by Cosmetics Europe show that between 2012 and 2017, the European cosmetics industry phased out as much as 97.6 % of plastic microbeads used for exfoliating and cleaning purposes in rinse-off cosmetics and personal care products.  The European industry is on track to achieve 100% phase-out of plastic microbeads by 2020.  Our voluntary action was taken in spite of it being widely acknowledged that the cosmetics sector is a minor potential contributor.  Studies estimate a potential contribution of between 0.1% and 2% of the total aquatic plastic litter.  This potential minor contribution is ever decreasing as progress has been made towards the completion of the phase-out of plastic microbeads.  In fact, by far the largest potential contributors to microplastic marine litter are from the breakdown of bigger plastics, for example, car tyres, plastic pellets and microfibres from clothes.<br/><br/>Similar to personal care products, the use of microbeads in home care products is very limited and is further decreasing as several companies have already announced their intention to reformulate their product in a more environmentally friendly way.<br/><br/>In the 2016 European Commission study to support the development of measures to combat a range of marine litter sources, detergents and maintenance products were not identified as key contributors to marine plastic litter.</p><p>The sector traditionally makes limited use of materials that could qualify as microplastics.  In acknowledgment, however, of the potential litter stemming from secondary microplastics during the washing of synthetic textiles, the industry is actively engaged in a cross-industry agreement, through the European Free Trade Association, with European industry associations representing the global value supply chain of garments and their maintenance.  The agreement, which is referred to in the European Commission's strategy for plastics, supports the need for further investigation and a better understanding for the prevention of microplastics released into the environment during the washing cycle.  It also aims to find feasible solutions based on science and research that can be effectively applied by industry, consumers and authorities. </p><p> In conclusion, voluntary actions taken by the industry are proving extremely effective at removing plastic microbeads from products.  Any proposed ban of microbeads in detergents and rinse-off personal care products must be supported by clear definitions to operate effectively.  The proposed definition of microbeads in the general scheme is too broad and, as a result, would prevent Irish manufacturers manufacturing rinse-off cosmetics and detergent products that would otherwise be permitted in EU countries.  It would also remove many products on the Irish market until they were reformulated.  The business and consumer impacts in the general scheme, however, do not take this into account.  Pending the outcomes of the European Chemicals Agency REACH restriction process, it is essential for the smooth functioning of the European Single Market not to create regulatory barriers to trade.  We encourage the scope of any proposed regulatory measures to align with existing member state legislation, such as is in place in Britain and pending in Northern Ireland, to avoid disadvantaging the Irish manufacturing industry. </p></speech>

Much research had been carried out but little was known about the source of microplastics and why they were there.  To date, we do not know exactly how plastics transition from land to sea, although we know that all plastics in the sea originate on land.  While some may be carried directly to the sea, we suspect that rivers are major corridors.  In our research on this particular project, we do not go down to the estuary but we have begun to add more research to bridge the gap between freshwater and the marine.  For example, we have an estuarine study starting this summer.</p></speech>

They can also be light and can be dispersed into the atmosphere.  Some researchers in Paris have examined the atmospheric fallout of particles and found that it can be significant.

There are regulations or guidelines regarding the application of sewage sludge.  For example, there are regulations regarding the distance from a watercourse and what kind of weather one should or should not spread in.  Some sewage sludge is applied untreated.  Most is applied treated.  These treatments, which we looked at in one study, have an impact on the microplastics.  They can exacerbate the problem by breaking the particles down further.  One of the main threats or reasons we are concerned about microplastics is the size.  The smaller they get the more environmental compartments they can penetrate.  They can go into the lower bottom of the food chain and can be transported up readily.  Once they go into the nanometer range, they can cross a cell membrane.  The smaller they get, the more concerned we are about it.</p></speech>

We hope that we will get an idea from that as to whether the microplastics will be mobilised after a rain event, therefore increasing the risk to local, nearby watercourses or whether they would be transported vertically and perhaps enter the groundwater.  Either way, it is not ideal.</p></speech>

Can Dr. Mahon tell us something about this eco-toxicology and how the plastic might attract other chemicals?  Not only does one have the polymer - that little bit of plastic - but one also has an accumulation of toxins around that.</p></speech>

There is the polymer itself which has inherent chemicals.  Some are plasticisers and some are additives to give that plastic whatever function it should have.  These plastics can leach and the smaller the particle, the more readily these processes will happen.</p> <p>  Additionally, microplastics can absorb pollutants in the environment and these have been used in various situations to mop up.  Some studies have been done to show that if a small invertebrate ate some microplastics, the level of persistent organic chemicals in the animal will have reduced once the plastics have gone through.  The problem is that they are a vector of pollution.  They can attract, for example, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and transport them.  Whether these chemicals absorb or desorb - or let go - of the pollutants is affected greatly by pH.  It is a concern that in the gut where the pH is lower, this could promote the release of the toxins.</p><p>Further up the course, the particles going through a wastewater treatment plant interact with many pathogens.  One study has shown that microplastics downstream from a wastewater treatment plant have more pathogens on them, which would be associated with that pathway.</p></speech>

She is absolutely correct that the major source of this problem is secondary microplastics.  There is a European process, as I think the committee is aware, which is looking at intentionally added microplastics across a range of industries, not just our industry.  There is, therefore, a slightly broader process in hand at European level which we can talk about a little in the discussion if members so wish.  However, I think my colleagues from GMIT would agree that intentionally added microplastics are only a small fraction of the problem and that the bigger problem is the secondary microplastics such as those resulting from tyre abrasion and so forth.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021200002#N01100"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  This is a very interesting topic.  It is clearly quite a technical area and, as such, the committee and the Department were right initially to engage with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and its researchers.  That was a good move and I acknowledge the support of the Department in encouraging it.  I acknowledge also the work we have seen in the witnesses' presentations, from UCD Earth Institute, the EPA, which has been involved in all this, and the marine and freshwater research centre in GMIT.  I am conscious of what Ms Dean said about commercial activities and the European Single Market.</p> <p>  Perhaps all the witnesses could talk about the EU REACH regulation, which basically involves registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals.  The regulation has not fully come into effect yet.  How then do we dovetail our legislation with the forthcoming regulation?  Will the witnesses talk about the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA?  It ultimately manages all the technical issues surrounding this whole issue.  The witnesses might talk us through that issue a little.  Ms Dean also mentioned REACH, and there was perhaps some suggestion that this all might be a little premature.  I do not agree.  When experts such as Dr. Kevin Lynch come before us and talk about the challenge that we now have microplastics in our fish and our food chain, that must ring an alarm bell for us.  We have known about this for a long time.  I also acknowledge the work of my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan.  She raises this issue constantly in the Seanad, is an expert in this area and has driven this legislation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  What is the story with REACH?  How does it dovetail with this legislation?  We better be ready and it would be better to move this legislation on.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to talk about two other issues.  What is their engagement with the local authorities on this research?  The local authorities are licensing bodies and are responsible for monitoring various hospitals, for instance.  In my local authority we had issues with the release of pathogens into the sewerage system.  There are many breaches of these licences across the 31 local authorities, but this is the local authorities' mandate so they do regular sampling and reporting, for instance.  I believe they do not report enough.  There needs to be a greater focus on these drain and attenuation tanks, particularly in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and the hospital sector.  There are huge concerns about pathogens coming into the water streams from the health and hospital sector, and alarm bells should be ringing there.  I have seen some of this myself so I have a little knowledge of it.  The witnesses might talk about this in the context of research.  May I suggest, if they have not already done so, that they engage with some of the local authorities and look at their data?  It is all about data.  This is a science.</p> <p>  Have the witnesses had any experience in the course of their work with Teagasc?  Teagasc, as they know, engages in outreach.  Regarding grant schemes under EU farm payment schemes, etc., and environmental initiatives, we know there will be soil cores and soil boring.  There is analysis of those.</p><p>The profiles of these cores show various pollutants in the soil.  These are standard with regard to various EU-funded agricultural programmes and a lot of information could be gleaned from them.  Alarm bells must be ringing now that we are told we have microbeads in the food chain.  We must sit up and do something.  I welcome the legislation.  The more scientific and technical research and validation we have with regard to the legislation, the better.</p><p> I would particularly like to focus on the Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association.  How have the private sector and industry been engaging?  Clearly, it is in their interests to do so as people are becoming much more environmentally aware.  People are looking at the backs of products to see whether they contain microbeads.  Many people are becoming very conscious of microbeads in the cosmetic and detergent industries, and in the agricultural and horticultural sector where we know microbeads are used in some fertilisers to assist in their distribution.  These are challenges and I would like to hear from Ms Dean because I am always conscious of industry but we want responsible responses.  It is not enough to say it will impact on profits.  The environment is critical for this generation and future generations.  I have long argued that people have become very conscious when purchasing of how a product impacts on the environment.  I would like to know more about the European REACH process.  I thank the witnesses for engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

Ireland is not the first country in the European Union to initiate legislation on microbeads.  The UK has legislation, as do France and Sweden.  Italy is implementing legislation and Denmark is planning legislation.  This presents a problem because if various member states have various legislative measures, potentially we will have an issue with the EU Single Market.  Something similar happened in the US with initiatives on microbeads at state level.  At some point, the US federal government stated the measures were breaking up the US internal market and that a federal measure was required that would be common throughout the US market.  There is a strong case on Single Market grounds for a European measure.</p> <p>  To give a little bit of history, there are two possibilities to address this at European level.  We could have a regulation or directive that goes through the European Parliament in an ordinary legislative procedure or we could have the ECHA REACH process.  Rightly and understandably, there has been a lot of concern, perfectly articulated by Senator Boyhan, about this problem and the need to address it, and not only on Single Market grounds because it is recognised that it is an environmental problem.  The European Commission decided not to go along the ordinary legislative procedure route but to go through the REACH process.</p> <p>  Essentially, REACH is a system for managing chemicals.  Within the REACH process, the European Chemicals Agency has the power and capacity to recommend to the European Commission that it restrict certain chemicals.  This is the process we are going through.  Why did it go down the REACH process and not the ordinary legislative procedure process?  At the time, it was thought that REACH was slightly quicker.  Sometimes the processes in Brussels, as anybody who has ever worked there knows, can take an awfully long time and there is a sense of urgency about this.  This partly explains why the Irish Government wants to push forward the legislation.</p> <p>  The ECHA process was begun at the end of 2017.  The speed element is relative because ECHA takes a little bit of time and there are several points to note about it.  It is completely harmonised so it addresses the Single Market problem.  This means whatever legislation Ireland chooses to adopt, and I fully appreciate the sense of urgency and the wish to push forward, will be subject to European legislation.  Essentially, if the domestic legislation is in conflict with European legislation, then the European legislation will take precedence in the normal way of the Single Market.</p><p>That is not a controversial comment to make.</p><p> This is not likely to be completed until approximately 2021.  It is difficult to say for sure when it will be finished.  The ECHA secretariat had a year to present a dossier.  It finished that on 11 January and published it on 30 January.  Committee members can see the ECHA's initial work on its website.  The second stage of the process must now take place, with the dossier to be considered by the committee for risk assessment, RAC, of the ECHA.  One of the requirements for restriction processes is that a risk must be demonstrated - not necessarily a litter risk, but a toxic one.  It is a slightly controversial part of the legislation.</p><p> There will also be a social and economic assessment under which the impact on industry will be considered, which members of this committee wish to discuss during this session.  That process will take most of 2019.  In 2020 or so, there will be a recommendation and, all things being equal, the process will be finished by around 2021.  The Irish legislation will be subject to that.</p><p> Members need to bear in mind that the mandate of the ECHA goes slightly beyond what Ireland is considering.  The agency covers intentionally added microbeads and microplastics.  They are a small fraction of a much bigger problem, but the agency is considering the issue across a number of sectors as opposed to just ours.</p><p> Other European countries are pressing ahead with their legislation, and there is a certain amount of political pressure to do so.  Legislation was recently tabled for debate in Portugal, but people there opted to wait until the ECHA had decided what it would do.  It is understandable that Ireland might want to push ahead and not wait for the agency, but the take-home point from this is that, after 2021, it is overwhelmingly likely that there will be a restriction on microplastic in some form.  It may be slightly broader in scope than this proposal, as it also addresses other sectors, and the Irish legislation would be subject to it.</p><p> That is my take on the ECHA.  Other witnesses might wish to add or correct something if they disagree.</p></speech>

Teagasc has some bore holes that it uses to measure phosphorous and nutrient pollution.  We have a link with it but, because a high volume of water is needed, we must wait for an opportunity, for example, heavy rainfall.</p> <p>  In terms of the cores, we and our partners in UCD have the equipment for taking cores.  We are specific about the number of replicates and where they are taken to the get the best information, so we rather that this be carried out independently.</p> <p>  We have had some interactions with local authorities.  In 2015, we were able to take samples from wastewater treatment plants and get some idea of what was coming in and going out.  Now, however, we are subject to Irish Water approval.  We have just completed an agreement that gives us permission to enter the wastewater treatment plant system.  That is planned for the coming year of our three-year project, which started two years ago.</p></speech>

There will always be conflicts with Irish Water, as it is a service provider that has service-level agreements, SLAs, with local authorities and a national remit.  What has GMIT's experience with Irish Water been in terms of this scientific work?</p></speech>

It took a long time to agree that and it basically took two years.  There were issues regarding vetoing of results.  As academics, we need to know we have use of our results to publish for scientific advancement and also for the well-being of the environment and human health.</p><p> The process has been a bit restrictive, as we could not sample where we initially wanted to for various reasons that were stipulated.  Examples included any treatment due an upgrade.  I would have liked to have had some treatment plants representing an industrial input but we did not manage to gain permission to those.  In the end, as it shortened the time in which we may have carried out the research, we had to keep it simple.  We got permission to study three wastewater treatment plants.  Ideally, we would have taken the samples ourselves but, unfortunately, that was not possible.  Contamination is a big issue, such as with clothing fibres, for example.</p></speech>

That must be of concern to the committee with respect to this work.  The examination could not be carried out by the witnesses, which must again be of concern.  We may have to raise that with Irish Water.  It would be helpful to have some more facts because when making a case, one must be armed with facts.  I presume the witnesses keep a log of dates, entries and requests.  This must be of some concern.</p> <p>  Dr. Mahon mentioned independence.  Teagasc does soil sampling bores all over the country and it is a very reputable organisation.  It has been tied to stringent guidelines by the EU.  There may, therefore, be a case there for greater synergies rather than duplication.  It is clearly in the body's interest and this can be policed right across the agricultural sector.  There may not need to be replication and there could be national impact.  Water tables and soils are important for accurate reading.</p> <p>  She can correct me if I am wrong in my interpretation but is Dr. Mahon saying that in certain cases with Irish Water, there has been talk of vetoing results?  That must be of concern when it comes to accuracy and uniformity of research.  It would be helpful to the committee if the witnesses had further details and was in the position to make them available.  We would like to learn more about that.</p></speech>

It took a long time to get to that point.  We engage with Teagasc but we have very specific questions that we want to answer.  One concerns sewage sludge and we want to go to fields where there has been spreading of slurry.  Unfortunately, it was not doing any sampling on those sites because it wanted to avoid human impact.  It just wanted to look at nutrients, etc.</p></speech>

That probably explains in part the length of time involved.  It was not unique to GMIT.  When Irish Water put together what it would sign off on and what would be allowed, it could not just refer to GMIT.  All the colleges had to go through their legal departments.  It was unfortunate that ours was a three-year project and we are only now getting into that towards the end.  The matter is multifaceted.</p><p>As Dr. Anne Marie Mahon mentioned, we will looking at taking Teagasc on board when we are doing more on our study.  At present we are trying to answer research questions and then we will test them in the field.  It would be brilliant to bring Teagasc on board and look at where it is sampling and not replicate it to see whether we could add more information to it.</p><p> On the role of local authorities and the industry, in all of our research projects we have an outreach element and try to involve the local authorities and the industry in any workshop or any information we produce and obtain information from them.  We would like to open a two-way dialogue.  </p><p> As regards the funding Senator Boyhan mentioned, we have not had a research question that would tie in with the questions Teagasc also needs to answer.  However, I believe this will happen down the line and that there will be more interaction with the industry.</p><p> We need to answer the questions the Senator has put to us before we ask industry to come on board and answer more questions.</p></speech>

He is quite right to express the view that consumers are becoming more environmentally aware.  Of course, the industry needs to responds to this.  I will take the opportunity to talk a little about the recommendation and the action to which Ms Siobhan Dean, director of Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association, referred to in her statement.<br/><br/>In 2012 and some cases a little earlier than that, some companies started to phase out plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing, which is for what they were mainly used in cosmetics and personal care products.  In 2015 we in Cosmetics Europe encouraged our membership to phase out plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing and made the voluntary recommendation that Ms Dean read in her statement, recognising, of course, that this was an issue on which people expected us to act as a responsible industry.  It is not enough for us in Brussels to simply put some words on a page and ask our membership to go out and think about it.  We undertook to follow up to find out whether it was the case that the industry was indeed phasing out plastic microbeads.  We conducted a survey in 2016, at which point we found that around 80% of plastic microbeads had been phased out.  When Cosmetics Europe<b></b>made its recommendation, it set a timeframe up to 2020, but there was a kickback.  People said it was very nice that the industry had done this, but why would it take it so long to implement it.  The reason Cosmetics Europe adopted that fairly long timeframe was that it was worried that it would be more difficult for smaller companies that were putting microbeads into their products to reformulate in time.  <br/><br/>As part of the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, process, Cosmetics Europe is required, like other industry sectors, to make submissions on the social and economic impacts which, of course, are important and something the committee needs to consider.  Cosmetics Europe conducted an additional survey and that is where the rather precise figure of 97.6% came up.  Let me reiterate that, according to the Cosmetics Europe survey, 97.6% of plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing have disappeared from the European market.  Why can Cosmetics Europe be so precise about this figure?  We represent more than 90% of the companies involved in the European sector and nearly all of the multinationals and, through associations such as the Irish Cosmetics, Detergents and Allied Products Association and the European associations, smaller companies too.  Cosmetics Europe conducted a massive survey and surveyed half of the entire market, which is pretty statistically sound.  The margin for error is less than 1%, compared to that in opinion polls where it is plus or minus 3%.  Cosmetics Europe can be confident, therefore, that most of the plastic microbeads used for exfoliating and cleansing have been removed and that if they have not already been removed, certainly by 2020 they will have more or less disappeared from the European market.  <br/><br/>Members may have questions about the companies that are not members of Cosmetics Europe and not covered by its recommendation, or concerns about imports from manufacturers outside the European market.  These concerns are fully understandable, but the committee needs to be aware that plastic microbeads for exfoliating and cleansing are, to a significant extent, not the real problem.  The problem environmentally is much more with secondary microplastics, tyre abrasions and other such issues raised by GMIT.  In a nutshell, the Senator is absolutely correct - the industry had to respond and consumers are now more environmentally aware.</p><p>We did respond.  We have made very significant progress in phasing out plastic microbeads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-12a.672" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021200002#S00200"><p>Let us take a step back from the very technical stuff for a second.  It is important for us to reassert at a very basic level why this committee has spent so much time on this issue, partly at the request of Senator Grace O'Sullivan and Deputy Sherlock at earlier stages and now at the request of the Minister.  We are all concerned as a result of our growing knowledge of the impact of plastics in general on our environment, whether first or second generation microplastics or single-use plastics.  It is becoming a bigger part of our policy debate, and that is a good thing.  The committee is unanimous in taking the view that these things are bad for our environment and that we need to have stronger regulatory mechanisms to reduce the number of them.  It is also important, however, that we do not have this debate in isolation.  I make these points partly with regard to the debate as to whether we should wait for the European Union process.  What has been going on in the European Union and European Commission in recent years with regard not only to microbeads but also to single-use plastics has involved quite a significant battle between industry and environmentalists with regard to how this enormous threat should be dealt with.  It is a threat and we need to be honest about that.</p> <p>  To put this conversation in context, the corporate budget for lobbying on the EU's position on single-use plastics is between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;1.75 million.  That is the amount of money industry is spending to advocate for what it wants to see, as it is perfectly entitled to do.  The general approach has been to favour voluntary agreements over statutory enforcement.  These agreements are often weaker than those we are discussing here, in a limited sense.  There are also far lower levels of transparency in the policymaking processes of many member states.  One of the reasons we are now seeing individual member states pushing ahead and saying that they are not waiting any more is because it has been taking so long to progress some of this at European Union level.  Clearly, it would be better if there was a single agreement at EU level, but it is highly likely that, when and if that agreement comes, it will give us a floor above which individual member states may decide to have higher levels of environmental standards.  My view is certainly that this would be a good thing.  I appreciate that we are talking about companies, jobs, and profits to reinvest in the economy, but we are also talking about our ecosystem and its future viability.  If I am ever asked to make a choice between adhering to Single Market principles or doing something good for the environment, I intuitively favour the latter, even if I do not know the finer scientific details with regard to where I rest on the question.</p> <p>  I will get back to the legislation because I have a couple of specific questions for everybody and I am genuinely interested to hear people's views.  Head 4 of the Bill deals with exceptions.  We had an interesting conversation with the officials when we were looking at the exceptions.  Some of the exceptions seem to be eminently sensible, such as products for medical or veterinary use and so on, but there was one at which I was surprised.  The heads of the Bill refer to "creams, lotions or gels containing plastic microbeads designed, manufactured and sold solely for the purposes of application to the surface of a person&rsquo;s skin to protect it from the harmful effects of solar ultraviolet radiation".  When we questioned the officials, they said that there are no products available on the Irish market that fulfil that function and which contain microbeads or microplastics.  It seemed odd that this would be included in the exceptions.  As microbeads do not add anything to the medical value of sun tan lotions and are purely cosmetic, it seems odd that we would open it up or create an incentive for people to add them to such products.  I would like the views of both the industry representatives and the scientists here on that exception.  Do they have any other comments on the exceptions generally?  Most of them seem sensible but that one stood out as a little bit odd.</p> <p>  Head 13 deals with the penalties.  The Chairman is right that there are a number of penalties, including a low-level, class A fine of up to &euro;5,000 and up to six months' imprisonment.  The penalty on court indictment is a fine of up to &euro;3 million and up to two years' imprisonment.  I presume the witnesses' concern is that the first one is likely to be used more often in respect of breaches.  Are they saying that the summary penalty is too low?  Are there examples of other penalties at a summary level, rather than involving going to court, that are at a higher level?  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?  It is important that there is a third sanction, which is that individual members of a board of directors can be held accountable.  This is a power the EPA has in enforcing waste management regulations and so on.</p><p>If the witnesses have specific concerns about that, I would be interested in hearing them.</p><p> I have a query about Ms Dean's reference to the fact that European industry is on track to achieve a 100% phasing out of plastic microbeads by 2020.  This point has been well made.  She seemed to suggest in the final paragraph of her presentation that she is concerned that the Bill, as drafted, will remove many products from the Irish market until those products are reformulated.  She pointed out that: "The business and consumer impacts in the general scheme, however, do not take this into account."  On the one hand, she seems to be saying that by 2020, which is around the time that this legislation, if passed, will be fully enacted and imposed on Irish industry, there will have been a 100% withdrawal of microplastics or microbeads from the products in which her industry is involved.  On the other hand, she seems to be saying that she still has concerns.  Am I misunderstanding what she is saying?  Are there certain categories of products which are still being produced or sold in the Irish market that will not be included in the 100% phasing out of microbeads?  Given that this legislation, if passed, will not come into effect until next year, what is the nature of Ms Dean's concern?  I want to understand her position fully.</p></speech>

I would like to tag on another question or two.  Would Ms Dean like to mention any aspects of the Bill that go too far, or do not go far enough, in her opinion?  Does she believe there is anything missing from it?  I hear what she is saying about other countries coming forward with their own legislation.  I think we are going slightly further than other countries.  I would like to get Ms Dean's opinion on whether we are going far enough.  I would also like her to elaborate on the products in the Irish market that will have to be reformulated.  How many products and what kinds of products are we talking about?</p></speech>

I take the point that everyone has made about second-generation microplastics.  I do not think anyone is disputing that.  Have any of the other EU member states that have started to look at this issue introduced legislation or regulations?  If so, could those of us who are interested in this matter be pointed in the direction of those measures?  I know this aspect of the matter was raised by Senator Grace O'Sullivan recently.  I would like to put a similar question to the industry representatives who are in attendance.  Have their counterparts in other areas of business made any attempts to introduce voluntary agreements or voluntary regimes in respect of second-generation materials, or is it only the first generation that has received this kind of attention?</p></speech>

While those of us in the industry are very supportive of this legislation from an environmental impact perspective, we have some concerns about the definition.  This is something we have highlighted with the Department.  The point I would like to make about the definition of a microbead used in the text - "synthetic water-insoluble polymer" - is that all plastics are polymers but not all polymers are plastics.  Therefore, the definition needs to be refined and aligned with other legislation, including that in the UK and pending legislation in Northern Ireland.  We have not done any research on the impact on products of the proposed definition that is used in the general scheme.  We are saying that the definition of microbead and the scope of that definition should be refined.</p> <p>  Many of the cosmetics companies here are SMEs.  When we surveyed those companies in 2015, they said they were not adding any microbeads into their products anyway.  We have no evidence at this stage that they have been introduced into Irish products.  Any international companies that have said they have microbeads in their products are phasing them out.  The microbeads covered by our definition of microbead are being phased out 100%, but that is not the case if microbeads are defined as they are in the existing proposed legislation.</p></speech>

It is also possible that they will be captured anyway in the European Chemicals Agency's REACH process.  At the moment, they will be captured by the proposed definition.  As there will be no transition period, companies will need to reformulate those products.  This means that if a ban comes in, they will be taken off the market.  It is possible that companies will need to be given a period of time to reformulate such products.  The general scheme does not include a statement on the impact on industry and on products of the existing definition being proposed.</p></speech>

All plastics are not polymers and <i>vice versa,</i>and sometimes a lack of precision in the definitions can lead to a much broader scope of regulation than was even intended.  This is why we were concerned about the additional omission of the word &quot;plastic&quot; because without that a range of polymer materials, which most people do not regard as plastic, is roped in.</p></speech>

The members have raised the issue of transparency and I will address that.  I will release to the committee the Cosmetics Europe submission to the ECHA from when we first started to engage with agency  That submission contains some detailed analyses of polymer materials that we consider to be plastic and some we do not.  There is also some detail around the questions on the formulations.  I agree that it is important to be transparent, and we, in the industry, lobbied on the single-use plastic directive.  That submission might help the committee address those issues.  Some polymers, for example, are liquid or solid in form depending on the stage of the process they are at.  Liquid polymers are generally not considered as problematic in this context as the solid polymers.  We regard the plastic polymers as being the centre of the issue.</p> <p>  I turn to the original question on the scope and what would be covered.  One needs to think about this in terms of the definition and the function.  Our voluntary recommendation talked about exfoliating and cleansing functions.  There is a small volume of microbeads in rinse-off products, which are not necessarily used for exfoliating and cleansing.  The quantity is small and, as a fraction of the overall microplastic problem, it is infinitesimally small.  Nonetheless, if one uses the definition without limiting the regulation to exfoliating and cleansing, one will capture microbeads that are in rinse-off products, which are not captured in the US legislation or the current French legislation.  They are, however, captured in the UK legislation.  I urge the committee to consider the UK legislation as a model.  Aligning with the UK legislation makes a degree of economic sense because the UK is currently a major trading partner, although that is turning into a particularly unpleasant subject.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it, if Ireland goes out on a limb, it will cause problems in trade within the EU and with the US and so on.  Ireland probably does not want to do that.  The UK definition is broader than the US definition and all of the other definitions currently in place in the Union.  The UK approach is something the industry can live with.  While there would probably need to be a lot of reformulation, we will just take that on the chin and do it.  Beyond that one can get into problems, and not just with trade.  There would also be the sheer cost of having to reformulate thousands and thousands of products.  When I release our ECHA submission to the committee, the members will see an analysis of different scenarios in which polymers could be restricted - not just microplastics - and what that would mean for reformulations and the impacts on industry.</p> <p>  In a nutshell, I urge the committee to align with the UK for the time being.  The UK approach goes slightly beyond what other jurisdictions are doing in the EU.  It means there would need to be some reformulation, but I believe that the industry could probably live with that.  Beyond that one is likely to get into problems.</p></speech>

Mr. Chave referred to the ECHA legislation that is going to come in.  He is the most knowledgeable person here on that.  The Irish legislation is a step towards that.  Are we taking a step back if we align ourselves with the UK definition of microplastic and introduce that in our legislation?  Will we still have to take a step forward in 2021 to get to where the Irish legislation is currently?</p></speech>

The reason I believe Ireland should align with the UK legislation at a maximum is that it would preserve the trade position.  When the ECHA restriction is in place, the position with regard to those trade elements inside the European Union is that all the bets are off because that is the new standard.  The way ECHA is going is frankly quite radical if we look at the additional proposals from the agency.  These are likely to go beyond the ECHA legislation.  I will offer one example.  Committee members may be aware of a polymer called styrene-acrylic coating, which is used to pacify some liquids.  When I buy a shampoo, the liquid is not clear because there is material in it to make it not clear - to make it opaque.  Hence, we use the term "to pacify".  I am not a polymer scientist but such people can have a legitimate debate about whether that material actually meets the definition of plastic and is thus problematic in this context.  It is highly likely that ECHA will maintain that it is and will regulate the material.  I may be wrong but I think that is likely.  If so, that would go beyond the UK legislation because it does not deal with that particular issue.  While the Department may go forward and put into place legislation in Ireland, it is quite possible that in some, but not all, respects what comes out of the ECHA process may go beyond that in two ways.  The first is that it will cover more sectors whereas the Department is limiting the sectors in this legislation.  The second is that it may address more materials than those currently covered in the national legislation.  Committee members should not get the impression that ECHA is a big friend of industry in this context, because it is not.</p></speech>

That is something they cannot ignore.  I think our colleagues would agree that the idea of toxicity in this context is quite controversial because it is being considered by the ECHA as it is part of its mission.  While we can see the issue of marine litter, the question of toxicity is more complex.  If the committee is interested in the subject, I encourage it to keep an eye on the analysis going through the ECHA which is undertaking a systematic review of all of the evidence in that space.  It is something in which our colleagues in GMIT will be taking a strong interest, too.</p></speech>

I sometimes worry a little about the kind of legislation there is in place in Ireland.  Some think that because Ireland has legislated for cosmetics, it has dealt with microplastics.  I suggest it has not even begun to deal with microplastics by legislating for cosmetics.  This problem is much bigger than the cosmetics and personal care industry which is an extremely small part of it and getting smaller.  To go back to a previous question, ours is the only industry that has taken voluntary action in this space.  I do not know of any other that has done so.  The broader question of how industry works to address big issues such as plastic marine litter will need to be addressed, regardless of whether this legislation goes ahead.  That is a much bigger project.  I do not mean to cast aspersions on what the committee is doing, which I understand.</p></speech>

This is not the only debate about plastics that the Houses are having.  We are all very clear on the fact that this legislation is a small piece of a larger approach.  As it is the first Bill in this sphere, it sets the tone.  If it is passed with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, it will demonstrate that the country is willing to show leadership on this and all of the other issues.  We are equally as focused on the big issue of single-use plastics which does not fall within the remit of this committee but within that of another.  This is one of the few areas of the debate in which we can get involved.  It is an indication of where we want to go.  Mr. Chave should not worry because we will come back for more after this.</p></speech>

Chuir mise eolas ar f&aacute;il maidir leis na riachtanais Ghaeilge do na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; tosaigh m&uacute;inteoireachta agus riachtanais na Comhairle M&uacute;inteoireachta.  Leis sin, cl&uacute;da&iacute;tear mic l&eacute;inn ag dul isteach agus mic l&eacute;inn ag teacht amach ag an deireadh.</p> <p>  Luaigh Dr. McMahon comhchreat tagartha na hEorpa um theangacha, the common European framework of reference for languages.  T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht leis sin mar tugann s&eacute; teanga com&oacute;nta le bheith ag caint faoi chaighde&aacute;in.  Molaim, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; molta agam cheana i bhf&oacute;raim eile, gur cheart go mbeadh na siollabais scoile nasctha leis an comhchreat Eorpach le go dtuigfeadh gach duine cad faoina fuilimid ag caint &oacute; thaobh caighde&aacute;n.  Is cuid den fhadhb le scr&uacute;d&uacute; na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta n&aacute; go bhfuil an caighde&aacute;n ag athr&uacute;.  T&aacute; n&oacute;s ag Coimisi&uacute;n na Scr&uacute;duithe St&aacute;it clo&iacute; leis an bell curve agus n&iacute; hionann sin agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil an caighde&aacute;n c&eacute;anna ann anois agus a bh&iacute; ann 20 bliain &oacute; shin.  D&aacute; bheimis ceangailte le comhchreat tagartha na hEorpa um theangacha, bheadh a fhios againn cad faoina bh&iacute;omar ag caint.  Go hiond&uacute;il is B1 at&aacute; i gceist leis an ardteistim&eacute;ireacht.  H4 n&oacute; 60% at&aacute; i gceist anois.  Tuigfidh daoine a bhfuil cur amach acu air sin nach caighde&aacute;n uaf&aacute;sach ard sa Ghaeilge &eacute; 60% i scr&uacute;d&uacute; na hardteistim&eacute;ireachta mar a sheasann s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair, ach sin an caighde&aacute;n at&aacute; ag mic l&eacute;inn ag dul isteach.  Maidir le mic l&eacute;inn ag teacht amach &oacute;n gcl&aacute;r leis an gComhairle M&uacute;inteoireachta, is &eacute; B2.2 ag leibh&eacute;al na hiar-bhunscoile agus B2 don bhunscoil at&aacute; i gceist.</p> <p>  Mhol m&eacute; ag deireadh an ionchuir a bh&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh agam n&aacute; go mbeadh scr&uacute;duithe na n-ollscoileanna tagarmharc&aacute;lta n&oacute; benchmarked leis an gcomhchreat Eorpach.  Ar an gcaoi sin d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; a chinnti&uacute; go raibh caighde&aacute;n &aacute;irithe &aacute; shroicheadh agus go mbeadh s&eacute; tr&eacute;dhearcach.  T&aacute; an cur chuige sin molta ag an Roinn Oideachas agus Scileanna maidir leis na nuatheangacha.  T&aacute; an polasa&iacute; sin sa doicim&eacute;id "Languages Connect" n&oacute; "D&eacute;anann Teangacha Nasc".  Molaim gur ch&oacute;ir an Ghaeilge a chur san &aacute;ireamh ansin.  N&iacute;l s&iacute; san &aacute;ireamh go f&oacute;ill.</p> <p>  T&aacute; na hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; uile, DCU san &aacute;ireamh, ag d&eacute;anamh obair nu&aacute;lach chun caighde&aacute;n na Gaeilge a fheabhs&uacute; i measc na mac l&eacute;inn.  Faigheann siad ionchur mar a rinne an tOllamh MacMahon cur s&iacute;os air.  T&aacute;im cinnte go nd&eacute;anfaidh an Dr. &Oacute; Ceallaigh an rud c&eacute;anna.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r sprioc cinnte a bhfuil caighde&aacute;n seachtrach ag baint leis a bheith ar f&aacute;il.  Sin &eacute; an moladh at&aacute; agam.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r aghaidh a thabhairt freisin ar an easpa fhorbartha gairmi&uacute;la le hais t&iacute;ortha eile.  Nuair a ch&aacute;il&iacute;tear m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, n&iacute; chuirtear aon fhorbairt ghairmi&uacute;il orthu ina dhiaidh sin &oacute; thaobh caighde&aacute;n a gcuid Gaeilge a choinne&aacute;il suas ar chaighde&aacute;n r&eacute;as&uacute;nta maith.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r aghaidh a thabhairt air sin.</p> <p>  T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge ann, mar a luaigh an tUasal Eibhl&iacute;n N&iacute; Scannl&aacute;in romham.  T&aacute; molta&iacute; an-mhaith sa strait&eacute;is sin d&aacute; gcuirf&iacute; iad ar fad i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n Gaeilge ar si&uacute;l sna scoileanna, sna hollscoileanna agus istigh sna seomra&iacute; ranga ach, mar at&aacute; leagtha amach sa strait&eacute;is, n&iacute;l normal&uacute; d&eacute;anta ar an nGaeilge sa tsocha&iacute;.  Tuigimid &oacute; fhoghlaim teangacha go bhfuil an m&eacute;id a tharla&iacute;onn taobh amuigh den seomra ranga chomh t&aacute;bhachtach uaireanta leis an m&eacute;id a tharla&iacute;onn taobh istigh de, n&oacute; an m&eacute;id nach dtarla&iacute;onn i gc&aacute;s na Gaeilge.  Mar sin, go dt&iacute; go bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag tarl&uacute; lasmuigh de na seomra&iacute; ranga, n&iacute; bheidh an spreagadh ag dalta&iacute; agus ag &aacute;bhair mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; tabhairt faoi ardchaighde&aacute;n a bhaint amach.  Is &eacute; an dearcadh at&aacute; againn maidir leis an teip at&aacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh ag na scoileanna n&aacute; go bhfuil na spriocanna, na hionchais, n&oacute; na expectations at&aacute; againn r&oacute;-ard don mh&eacute;id ionchur at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de.</p></speech>
