    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy,  who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is joined by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shane Cassells.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of 19 September agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise from those minutes.</p> <p>  We shall now deal with correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A comprises the briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 2425A, dated 1 October 2019, and No. 2426 A from An Bord Plean&aacute;la are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up documents on Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  We discussed No. 2342 on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland last week.  The information provided was not that requested by the committee and we circulated among committee members what we asked for precisely.  We decided not to publish at the time and to hold the matter over until we received a response from the corporation.  When we receive it, we can consider publishing. </p> <p>  No. 2354B is from Professor Phillip Nolan, President, Maynooth University, dated 29 July 2019, responding to a request from the committee for details on an investment by the university in a subsidiary which will not be recovered, as well as information regarding employment contracts for employees in the organisation.  Professor Nolan confirms the loss and states the investment was appropriate based on the information and advice available at the time.  He also provides an information note in regard to employment contracts and states that engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  While we will note and publish this item, I want to make a few remarks on the subsidiary.  Maynooth University set up a subsidiary called Innovation Value Services Limited for research and development and the organisation did not meet its expectations.  The company was ultimately wound down at a loss to the university of &euro;750,000.  That is a very substantial figure and that is why we wrote to the university.  In its detailed reply to us, it points out that the provision of &euro;750,000 against the impairment of the loan to Innovation Value Services Limited represents a real and regrettable loss, and that it will not impact on education or services to students but will reduce the university's capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  That is an honest answer from a third level college.  Normally it is said there is no effect but at least in this case the university says there will be an impact on its capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  The university had an innovation value institute in the college that had attracted over &euro;10 million since 2010.  It decided to set up a subsidiary, which it is entitled to do.  Before it set up the company, based on what is projected, it commissioned PwC to produce a report, and the latter advised against the initial business plan, which projected an investment of &euro;1.25 million.  The investment plan was then scaled back on that basis.  The university invested &euro;410,000 in the subsidiary in October 2015 and, in May 2016, it advanced another &euro;300,000.  After the first year of operation, it agreed to defer the loan repayments until December 2019 because it knew the organisation was not meeting expectations.  In May 2019, the decision was taken by the university executive not to invest further in the company.  The board of Innovation Value Services Limited met on 18 June 2019, which is not that long ago, and decided to wind up the company and cease trading by the end of the financial year, which I presume is about now.  Those are some of the salient facts.  We need to ask for a copy of the final accounts for the company when it is ultimately wound up and audited.</p> <p>  Second, we raised the question as to whether the loan of &euro;750,000 was included on the university's risk register.  The replay given was that the risks associated with Innovation Value Services Limited were not specifically included in the register.  The university said it updated the risk register in February 2017, which was two and a half years ago, and it was further updated over the summer of 2019, which has just passed.  At this stage, we must write to the university and ask for the risk register.  In my view, this should be produced on an annual basis, at a minimum.  The HSE produces them on a quarterly basis.  It does miss things but at least it has a system in place every quarter.  I expect a body such as the university to produce a register regularly.  A year is the most that should elapse before producing a register.  Even if we get a register once per year, it will not be too bad.  The one the university is operating from is two and a half years old.  I propose that we write to it asking it for the risk register it was working on over the summer.  Let us see where that stands.</p><p>That is all I want to say about the matter.</p><p> I mentioned the occasional lecturers.  The university gives details on this on page 17 of its letter, which is a very comprehensive document.  There are about 40 pages in the reply.  It indicates there are 1,394 occasional staff, 668 of whom receive under &euro;1,000 and 239 of whom receive between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,000.  The overwhelming majority of them receive under &euro;4,000 and would not be considered in any way full-time.  They are occasional, perhaps.  Most of them are postgraduates at the college.  That is what the university says here.  I will come to Deputy Catherine Murphy, who will have more knowledge on this.  I am just putting on the record what the university says because we will discuss the response.  I want to put the response on the record because the university does not expect everyone to read the 40 pages.  The university is saying the overwhelming majority of the occasional staff are postgraduates doing just a small amount of work here and there.  It says it complies with legislation.  That is the university's response.  I have a duty to put it on the record.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00200"><p>Obviously, when we get more information back, we will come back to this.  If we had got a copy of the university's risk register last year, it would not have shown up this.  What else is the register likely not to include?  Seeing it now, after this has been disclosed, yes, they are taking corrective action, but I am concerned we are not getting a full picture.  That is one aspect.  The business of universities is about creating knowledge.  If NUI Maynooth is acknowledging the loss in respect of research and knowledge transfer, that is really at the core of what the university is supposed to be about.  I am not sure we have fully fleshed out what this implies, and I would like to hear from the university what it means by "impact".</p> <p>  Regarding the number of staff, I completely accept that universities have people coming in and possibly doing several hours' additional work and that that is normal practice and adds to the value of the university.  I think there are much greater employment protections at primary school level than at university level, not just in Maynooth but in the whole university sector.  People going to college, who are very often the people paying for the staff, and their parents - and there are Government grants and so on towards tuition fees - do not appreciate that very often what is provided is perhaps one contact hour for every lecturing hour.  I think great liberties are being taken in this regard.  A total of 1,394 is a lot of people without contracts.  We have spoken about this in the context of RT&Eacute; and bogus self-employment, for example.  Whereas this would not fall into the exact same category, it is a category of staff about whom I would have concerns as to how universities manage their accounts.</p> <p>  There is the other issue of how universities perform if not enough research hours are provided compared with contact hours.  This shows up in our accounts, and that is the only reason it is appropriate for discussion here.  However, we are hearing from the president of the college, not from the people who have a grievance about this.  I think we are hearing a one-sided view on it, and I have concerns about that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for going through the correspondence in detail.</p></speech>

The risk register is what jumped out at me, again, as someone who is not experienced in this area.  We rely on such registers.  When I look at the accounts every single week I see the risk registers and what has turned up on them.  However, the risk register is only as good as what goes on it, so perhaps somebody could help us with that.  What criteria are used?  Who checks those who put items on the risk register?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00600"><p>A risk register is a requirement under the code of practice for governance.  It is probably fair to say the register is not a precise science.  It is really about requiring an organisation to look at the specific risks that arise in its business.  One check on the adequacy of the risk register is whether what happens, and the response to what happens, has been foreseen in the risk register as it goes.  I think this has come up with organisations such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00700"><p>CervicalCheck was not on the risk register for the HSE until the court case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00800"><p>Exactly, so it certainly arises that organisations will have blind spots.  Nearly every organisation will have things that it assumes will always work because they always have worked.  Having a good risk register is more an art than a science, and keeping it up to date is a procedural matter.  However, the judgments that are made as to what goes on it and what is an appropriate response are a matter that an organisation needs to grapple with.  The organisation needs to update it regularly, as the Chairman said.  A review once a year would probably not be adequate for a relatively large organisation.  One would want perhaps a quarterly review of the register and systems in place that ensure that it is not just something that is happening at the top of an organisation but that it percolates down through the organisation such that everybody is thinking about the areas specific to their aspect of the business and what they would do if certain of those risks materialised.  It is, therefore, hard to say "this is an excellent risk register" and "that is a very poor one".  It is seen in the outturn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00900"><p>On that point, let us take the case of Galway.  This is very much factual.  It is another problem about which nothing was done, but the hospital was good in that it put the capacity of the hospital on the risk register.  Then let us turn to the universities, not just NUI Maynooth.  Knowledge was mentioned.  I believe knowledge should be acquired through questioning.  I disagree slightly with just the way Deputy Catherine Murphy put it.  I believe that the universities should inculcate a questioning environment, which we seem to be losing, and that knowledge should be acquired in that manner as opposed to knowledge for knowledge's sake and for a profit.  However, that is a policy matter.  I was in Waterford on Monday leis an gcoiste Ghaeilge agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; in Institi&uacute;id Teicneola&iacute;ochta Phort L&aacute;irge.  It brought back to me a lot of the matters and issues we looked at here.  Does the risk register not assume a lot more importance now that the universities are more and more in the business of setting up companies with a view to making a profit?  Is that not a whole new aspect of the risk register now, with public moneys and public buildings being used in that manner?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01000"><p>Absolutely.  There may be third level institutions that do not have subsidiaries and are not involved in business structures.  Once one gets into a new model of service delivery, there are different kinds of risks which one may not be fully aware of if one does not have a background in that.  What one would expect to see is that the risk register is an organic instrument of the organisation that changes as the business changes and as the environment around the organisation changes or if demand is going up, funding is tightening or a commercial venture is part of what is being done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01100"><p>Given the profile of what has happened here, is that a blind spot?  Would Mr. McCarthy have expected to see it on a risk register way earlier?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01200"><p>I do not want to speak specifically about Maynooth because I have not looked at this precise point.</p><p>If one is using subsidiaries to deliver parts of one's business, then one needs to have a part of one&rsquo;s risk register dealing with that.  For example, what if there are trading aspects or control of intellectual property as we have had in other institutions?  One needs to identify what are the risks and where can this potentially go wrong?  What systems and controls do we need to have in place to ensure it does not go wrong, or if it does, that we can respond appropriately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#D00200"><p>I want to raise a separate issue concerning the follow-up correspondence from Maynooth.  It is to do with what it calls occasional staff and staff on contracts.  The volume of people on contracts at the university is high.  The university stated in its cover note that it does not engage persons on zero-hour contracts.  That is true.  However, there are if-and-when contracts or what it calls occasional staff contracts.  The university stated it believes the engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  In some cases, it may well be.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that we are seeing this more and more with public bodies which are employing people on if-and-when contracts.  On some occasions, it is the right thing to do; other times, it is not.  Watching this across all organisations, my fear is that some public bodies are hiding behind this position.  If-and-when or low-hour contracts may suit some people but they do not suit everybody.  If it does not suit somebody, then it is the only contract offered.  There is an issue in relation to their rights and entitlements, whether it is sick pay, holiday pay and other entitlements.  We have seen it with other public bodies and I believe we need to keep an eye on it.</p> <p>  I noted in Maynooth that 1,394 staff were on occasional staff contracts.  It seems to be a bit high.  I know there is a logic to it and I can see how it would suit a university.  It is something that I will keep an eye on.  When is the Department of Education and Skills due back before the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#D00300"><p>It is not scheduled yet.  There are two points we need to take up on the two different topics.  One, what it calls occasional staff.  The university says that most of them are postgraduates.  We are going to ask about the 1,394 figure it gave and how many of those are in receipt of payment for more than one year, two years, three years and four years?  If we find 95% of them were postgraduates, just passing through the college as a tutor, that is fine.</p></speech>

We want the university to give us an information note on the research and knowledge transfer activity for the past three years, as well as it plans and arrangements for this and next year.  Based on the figures it gave us, &euro;700,000 seems to be a large figure if it is only had &euro;10 million external research and development over a long period.  It might represent a small proportion or it could be the most of it.  I have no idea.  We want to know the level spent in this area in each of the past three years, this year and the plan for next year.  We can then see the impact.  Has it closed the whole operation?  Has it had a significant impact?  I have no idea based on the reply we got.</p> <p>  We need the details on the two points.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We want a copy of the risk register and a note.  There should be an audit and risk committee as part of the board.  It should have been their job.

One of the things that should be reviewed in that exercise is the risk management system.  It should be annually considered outside of the risk assessment process itself.  There should be an exercise.  Very often this is done by internal audit.  This would be looking at whether the risk register is working for the organisation.  There is also a requirement on a cyclical basis for an external review of risk management at least once every three years.</p></speech>

It is a bit more complicated for aviation fuel.  The Act is prescriptive in that the agency should raise this levy for its running costs.  Running costs of the agency are about &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million a year.  I am told that there is somewhere in the region of &euro;250 million in its accounts based on this levy.  We levy 2 cent per litre under an Act which states that the agency must cover its running costs and not to exceed that.  It now seems to have substantially exceeded this amount.  We are all hard-pressed consumers paying 2 cent per litre.  It has been mentioned in the media and in dispatches from Ministers and the Department that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.</p><p> It has been mentioned in media dispatches from Ministers and their Departments that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.  Frankly, that would be in breach of the law on the basis that if we are collecting the money for A, we cannot use it for B.  I am not against using money in this way, but we live in an era in which we all accept that we are heading for carbon taxes.  The receipts from the latter will be invested in the climate action fund.  If an excess of between &euro;100 million and &euro;150 million accrues because running costs are being exceeded and if, effectively, this is being collected illegally or in a manner that is contrary to legislation, something needs to be done.  The Government could consider whether this levy might be reduced or stopped - I accept that this is a policy issue - as long as we can ensure that the oil companies pass it on to the consumer.  I emphasise that 2 cent a litre is an awful lot.  On that basis, I think this is something at which we should look.  I suggest to the committee that we should invite NORA personnel and officials from the Department of Finance to come in to discuss the issue.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have any comments to make on what I have said?  Can he confirm my concerns?</p></speech>

It provides an update on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry at Waterford Institute of Technology.  We asked the Minister to consider appointing an investigator under the relevant legislation to examine matters raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 104.  Mr. Beausang has advised that the Department is considering documents and has set out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.

We had lengthy discussions on this with the Department in the past.  We had similar discussions with the HEA when it became obvious that it was not able to publish the report it had done because it was outside its remit.  It looked like the Minister, through the appointment of a special investigator by the Department, was the only option.  I would like to draw the attention of colleagues to the second last paragraph of the letter that came back, which mentions that there had been a need to follow up with everyone who had submitted correspondence to the previous review, the report of which cannot now be published.  According to this letter, the correspondence and documentation subsequently received by the Department - the follow-up documentation - sets out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.  That was essentially our point from day one.  My point all along has been that the concerns which have been outlined, some of which were the subject of a report, cannot be left hanging.  We know it is probable that the report would have set out some of those concerns, but the HEA was just not able to publish it.  Is it going to be left hanging?  The Chairman is right when he says that the Department has come back to say it is still looking at whether further action is warranted.  If concerns relating to the management of potential conflicts of interest which have been documented by individuals still exist, there is a responsibility on the Department to follow them up.  It may or may not transpire that these matters were managed properly, but we cannot adjudicate on that.  It is not our job to adjudicate on it.  That is why we have a process.  Special investigators are appointed to establish the facts and report on them.  That needs to be done in this case to give closure to the issue.  If it is not done, all of these issues will continue to be raised by individuals within the institute, those individuals will not get any satisfaction and - more to the point - the facts will not be established.  We need to go back to the Department to say that if serious concerns are still being documented and sent to it, it has an obligation and a responsibility to follow them up.</p></speech>

The Department has stated that when it gets the information from Waterford, which we have mentioned, and when it gets the aforementioned HEA study, the terms of reference of which have not yet been agreed, it will examine all of that.  When it has completed its consideration of all of that, it will advise the Minister on what to do next.  That sounds like it will take years.

It looked at a very limited aspect of this matter.  As we know, the HEA report looked in more detail at other issues relating to the spinning out of these companies, including the management of conflicts of interest.  That is what they were looking at.  The report we got from the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that the institute accepted that it needed to improve on some issues that had arisen.  I think the board has since taken those issues on board.  We want something similar here.  All we want is the facts.  When we have the facts, it will be up to the board to follow though on them.  It is important for all the other institutes.  Many companies spin out of them.  Last week, I met representatives of a fantastic company that spun out of an institute.  This stuff is good.  Many people are doing work in this area.  It is important for everyone who is involved in spinning out these companies that the facts are established.  We have never said that there is wrongdoing.  We are saying that people are saying that there are issues.  They are writing into the Department.  They are engaging.  They are doing the right thing by putting their information on paper, documenting it and giving it to the Department.  As the Chairman indicated, it has been parked.</p></speech>

Everything I said was correct.  In the 2007 Act, section 44(3) states: "In determining the rates of levy, [that is, the 2 cent per litre that everyone is paying] the Minister shall seek to ensure that (taking one year with another) the sums realised by applying those rates to the volume assessments meet but do not exceed the estimated expenses of the Agency and of each designated subsidiary."  Therefore, it has approximately 2.5 times what its running costs are.  There have been dispatches, both in the UN speeches by Government this week and by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, talking about repurposing the legislation to use this money in respect of actions suggested by the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  That would be a breach of the law.  That is from where I am coming from in respect of this matter and I say it for the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the context of his report to us at next week's meeting.  I apologise for bringing us back to this matter.</p></speech>

That is appreciated.</p> <p>  We move to category C correspondence, which is from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Some of this arrived during the summer but we had to clear the earlier categories of correspondence at our two previous meetings.  No. 2349C is correspondence from an individual, dated 15 July 2019, responding to a request from the committee for his consent to forward his correspondence in regard to renewable electricity.  The correspondent has requested us to forward it to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will forward it to that committee for any action it may deem appropriate.</p> <p>  No. 2350C is correspondence from an individual copying the committee in on correspondence to the Taoiseach regarding the long-term effect on careers of cannabis convictions.  There is no specific request to the committee but the item may be of interest to some members.  We have not been asked to do anything and we have just been given a copy of the correspondence to the Taoiseach.  We will note this item.</p> <p>  No. 2353C is correspondence from Ms Orla Allen of the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, dated 24 July 2019, providing consent to forward its correspondence to the Valuation Office.  There is additional information provided which we will send to the Valuation Office to be considered in its response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2355C is correspondence from Deputy Catherine Murphy forwarding a query from an individual requesting the committee to make inquiries with the HSE regarding difficulties with its new payroll system, the national integrated staff records and pay programme, NiSRP.</p></speech>

The only reason I am putting the matter on the agenda is that this was being trialled in one part of the country, which I understand would be a sensible thing to do.  However, it has produced quite a significant difficulty for some staff cohorts, from what I am hearing, to the point that there appears to be an inflexibility in it.  The HSE has invested in this system and if it is to be rolled out to the rest of the country, it has the potential to cause industrial conflict, for example, because people are not getting paid or are not being paid in a timely way.  I would have some concerns about that, although that is not for the Committee of Public Accounts.  What is of concern is that if it requires to be recalibrated, that needs to happen.  However, if we have invested in a big system and the system is not fit for purpose, that is an issue.  If it is just a recalibration, that is another matter.  I do not know which it is but I am hearing complaints, although whether that is for this committee is another matter.</p></speech>

The HSE is a very complex organisation, as we know, and various types of people are employed, some 9 to 5, some 24-7 and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#F01200"><p>We will include it as an item to be discussed with the HSE representatives.  I have proposed that they will be coming in again shortly.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in connection with HSE primary care centres.  Quite a lot has happened since HSE representatives where here to discuss last year's financial statements, particularly in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We will be inviting representatives of the HSE to come before us in the fairly near future.  We can address this issue that meeting.</p></speech>

There was a time lag for the investment in some IT systems.  It would be useful to understand that because one of the constant complaints was that there were something like seven or nine different ledgers.  Getting visibility on the accounts, or even segments of things that one could look at in order to compare one part of the country with another, had been deficient.  There is a big investment programme and we have to make sure it is robust and fit for purpose.  That is where my main concern lies.</p></speech>

At least if the committee understood the scale of what the HSE is planning, what stage its plans are at and the costs it envisages, it would be a better start to the meeting, rather than just doing it on the morning.</p></speech>

We will write to them and put them on notice.</p> <p>  No. 2356C is correspondence from an individual, dated 8 August, who has made a detailed submission regarding the financial situation of Irish wind farms.  Related to this are Nos. 2368C and 2370C, dated 8 August, correspondence from individuals also requesting the committee to review the submission.  We know this matter is not within the remit of the committee as it is a policy matter and the submission refers to activities of EirGrid, which is a commercial semi-State company and is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The correspondent has specifically requested us not to forward the submission to anybody else.  I propose, therefore, to advise the correspondent that the matter is not within our remit and to suggest he correspond with the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will thank him for the correspondence, which the members have read, but it is not something we can formally deal with because EirGrid and the wind farms are not under the remit of the committee.</p> <p>  Nos. 2358C, 2359C and 2360C constitute correspondence from an individual copying the committee in on correspondence to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal and related to freedom of information provision.  There is no specific request to the committee.  We will note these items.</p> <p>  No. 2366C is correspondence from an anonymous individual, dated 30 August, alleging improper and illegal conduct at Maynooth University.  We have received correspondence from the university regarding the governance matter, and it deals with those types of issues.  I propose to write to the university to provide an information note in regard to the specific items.  No. 2385C, dated 13 September 2019, is correspondence from Deputy Louise O'Reilly, forwarding a copy of the same letter.  We note this item.  When we write to the university, we will give it a copy of letter and ask it to respond.</p></speech>

The correspondent has copied the committee on a submission to several Ministers and to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have looked at this matter as it pertains to our last periodic report but the communications committee is responsible for matters relating to the roll-out of broadband.  I propose that we advise the correspondent accordingly.  The issue of the cost incurred to the Exchequer to date in implementing the national broadband scheme continues to be a matter for this committee.</p> <p>  No. 2371C, dated 21 July, is from the secretary of the Irish Environmental Forum, referring to evidence given by representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency at a meeting of this committee on 18 April regarding the Aughinish plant in County Limerick.  I propose to request the correspondent's consent to forward the documentation to the EPA for response to the matters raised.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2372C, dated 6 August, is from an individual querying the frequency and necessity of road repairs and resurfacing in the Donnybrook and Ballsbridge areas of Dublin.  I propose that we advise the correspondent that this matter is not within the remit of the committee and should instead be taken up with Dublin City Council or, alternatively, the Local Government Audit Service.

The individual is in a difficult situation, which we all have encountered with constituents, as a consequence of SUSI's requirement that applicants provide financial information in respect of both their parents.  Even where a student's parents are separated or divorced and there may be difficulties within the household, SUSI insists on obtaining that information.  In some cases, a student might be living with one parent, who has no contact with the other.  It might even be the case that one parent has secured a court order against the other.  SUSI will not process grant applications until information on both parents is received, even though it is sometimes not possible for the applicant to obtain it.  I propose that we write to SUSI requesting it to indicate its process and procedures for dealing with such exceptional cases.  I have encountered students who could not go to college because one of their parents would not facilitate any correspondence with anybody.  Without that information, SUSI will not process the application.  That is unfair to students and it is not being dealt with in a satisfactory way.  We will not refer to the correspondent in our letter to SUSI but we will ask about the organisation's general position on dealing with these types of issues.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2411C, dated 25 September, is from an individual concerned about appointments to the public service of persons with a knowledge of Irish.  I propose that we ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an information note regarding those appointments.  The correspondent refers to the proposed official languages Bill 2019 and argues that the allocation of employment to a special interest group, which he calls "our Irish speakers", is a contrived State regulation and amounts to jobbery.  Can Deputy Connolly advise whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the right Department to address on this matter?</p></speech>

We will write to that Department.</p> <p>  No. 2414C, dated 22 September, is from Mr. Allen Morgan, who was recently in touch regarding the administration of his correspondence to the committee.  The secretariat is providing him with clarifying information in that regard.  In this correspondence, he asks the committee to consider a particular matter as part of our examination of the OPW's 2018 account.  I propose that we note the correspondence for now and members may refer to it as part of any upcoming engagement with the OPW.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report concerning the OPW, so we will be engaging with that body concerning its overall financial statements.</p> <p>  No. 2415C, dated 25 September, is a response from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association to our consideration of matters raised by it in regard to the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal.  I propose that we note the correspondence and keep the points raised in mind.</p><p>I want to follow it up in further detail.  I have looked at this correspondence.  At a previous meeting we asked about the valuation of car-parking spaces in some of these out-of-town locations.  To summarise this correspondence, there are two issues.  It referred to a two-year backlog for the 2017 appeals.  I am not sure if it is the tribunal or the Valuation Office.  We want that matter clarified based on this correspondence.<br/><br/>We really need clarification on the second item.  The correspondence from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association states: &quot;The Valuation Office has recently made some amendments to the methodology they use for service stations ... which is positive but we have been told that these amendments will not apply to stations revalued under the 2017 revaluation even where they are appealing to the Valuation Tribunal.&quot;  Essentially, the Valuation Office is stating that there will be two separate methods for valuing filling stations for rates: those valued under the 2017 regulations; and those now being valued under the recent amendments.  That is not fair.  Given that it could take ten years for such filling stations to be revalued again, they may be at a commercial disadvantage for up to a decade.  The IPRA is also saying that when filling stations appeal valuations carried out under the 2017 rules to the valuation tribunal, it will not accept the new amendments and is sticking to the old regulations.  That appeals process is unfair.  We want that clarified and it does not sound fair to me.<br/><br/>We asked the Valuation Office for a response on the issue of car park spaces at supermarkets, etc.  That was mentioned in the context of rates in towns.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association graciously sent us a copy of the Valuation Office practice note regarding supermarkets.  We did not get it from the Valuation Office yet, but it is its document.  The petrol retailers are utterly confused by what the Valuation Office says about car parking at supermarkets.  It states:</p><blockquote>Car parking arrangements associated with retail units will be dealt with as follows:- Common car parking facilities serving retail units will be reflected in the rent passing.  [Is that the rent from the landlord to the supermarket?]  Under these circumstances these facilities will be reflected in the passing rent.</blockquote><p>It suggests that where somebody has developed a facility with many shop units, including a big car park used by all the customers for all the shops, the cost of the car park will be reflected in the rent charged by the landlord who owns the property.  However, we are asking about the rates and not the rent.<br/><br/>The practice note also states: &quot;Where the building occupier occupies car spaces at a physically separate location then they will be valued as a separate relevant property with a description of &lsquo;carpark&rsquo;.&quot;  It is stating where common car parking facilities are used for several shops, it is reflected in the rent.  My question is then about the rates assessment for the landlord.  Was the landlord assessed for the commercial value of the car park?  It seems to be suggesting supermarkets are covered in the rent.  I want to know where in the system the commercial value of the car park is valued for rates.  The Valuation Office seems to be suggesting the supermarket does not pay it.  That should mean the landlord does it.  Are we then going to be told the same property cannot be valued twice?  I have not worked that one out.  I want clarification on it.  It is a good question, and the answer muddied the water further as far as I am concerned.  We want to know the commercial value of the car park at these shopping centres.  Where is the rates demand notice and who pays them?</p></speech>

We only asked the Valuation Office for that last week.  The petrol retailers gave us a copy of the Valuation Office's instruction on the issue of the commercial value of a car park.

Where it is owned by a property developer and rented to the supermarket and other businesses, where is the commercial value of the car park captured?</p></speech>

The individual obviously followed the debate here last week and this letter has stated that he is happy to do so.</p> <p>  That covers all the correspondence we have had since July.  We come to financial statements and accounts that have been laid before the Oireachtas since the last meeting.

The next item is the risk equalisation fund, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  What is that?  Is that for the private health insurance?</p></speech>

Someone will do it somewhere along the line.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for all that.  That is the end of the financial statements.</p> <p>  On the work programme, we have already arranged a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for today.  Next week, we will have the National Transport Authority.  The following week we have Caranua.  The week after that we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine because there is a gap between the report and that.</p><p>We have a gap for the week of 31 October, on Brexit day.  People are not sure whether the D&aacute;il is sitting that week but we will assume it is.  There are a couple of items we could possibly include.  These are the Charities Regulator, Pobal and Sport Ireland.  We have mentioned the possibility and we can see whether we can get one of the three of them for that date.</p><p> On 7 November, we will discuss the relevant chapters of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I am sure we will also speak about the public services card, on which I want to comment now.  We will start to climb up to the HSE and the children's hospital as soon as possible after that because there is a chapter on it in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Now that we have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General we will try to flesh out our work programme until Christmas at the next meeting.  There is nothing major to be said.</p><p> An item I want to raise that ties into the work programme is an issue that was raised last week in our very useful meeting with the Data Protection Commissioner on the use of the public services card and her report.  We also dealt with other financial matters.  Towards the end of the meeting, I raised the issue of a person who continued to use an expired free travel card.  The person should not have done so because social welfare payments had ceased.  However, the travel card element of the public services card had not been cancelled and the person continued to use it. After several months, the card was confiscated at Heuston Station when it did not work in the turnstile to leave the station.  Afterwards, the person received a fine from Irish Rail for &euro;1,000 for not having the correct ticket.  So far so good, but this raises data protection issues.  The person, whom I dealt with over the summer, told me the issue of how Irish Rail got the individual's name and address had already been raised with the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is no dispute with regard to the amount but there is a data protection issue.</p><p> Arising from our meeting last week, on Friday I received a very interesting email, as did the Comptroller and Auditor General, from a person with regard to a use of the public services card I had not really thought about until now.  If this is happening we really need it to be clarified.  On the public services card is a photo, the person's PPS number is on the back, and there is also the person's signature.  The card also shows a date until which it is valid.  On the front it may have the letters FT to signify free travel, or it may have the letters FT+S to signify the person's spouse can accompany him or her for free.  The individual who sent the card used it on the Luas in Dublin and on one of the major bus companies, not Dublin Bus.  When the public services card goes through the ticket machine information is recorded and the individual got curious about what is recorded when the public services card is given to private transport companies.  The person tracked it down and eventually received a letter back from the National Transport Authority, NTA, because the bus operator and Luas said it was nothing to do with them and that the person should contact the NTA.  In recent days, we received a copy of the letter sent to the individual by the NTA.  The NTA states that when a person uses the card none of the person's information on the card is recorded but every card has a number - not the PPS number - that the transport companies have.  This allows the companies to claim payment.  I know there are also lump sum grants but perhaps Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is slightly different.  This number records all of the trips and journeys made by card holder.  The rail company does not have the person's name and address or other details but it sends the number to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection where it can be matched to the person's PPS number.</p><p> The NTA states only the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection knows the PPS number and the individualised anonymous number held by the transport companies.  The Department does not provide this information to anyone.  As far as public transport is concerned, all the NTA knows is that the number has been used but not who used it or anything about the person using the card and it is entirely anonymous.  The email also states that when the public services card is presented at the ticketing machine, it records that a journey has been taken and assigns the value of the fare forgone to the record, which is stored in the ticket machine.  The information held by the transport company is the ID, which is the number on the card, the date and time of the journey, the route number and the fare forgone, which is the adult single fare.  The data is then uploaded to the back office system and subsequently made available to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The purpose of recording the information is so the transport operator can record overall passenger numbers and overall usage and also be able to make a claim for reimbursement from the Department in respect of services delivered to free travel pass holders.</p><p> It appears that when the information comes back from the travel company the Department of Employment Affair and Social Protection has details with regard to 900,000 people, including every State pensioner in the country, on every time they use public transport and every trip they take.  The allegation in the email is that the person did not know the State had such mass surveillance systems in place.  I do not think people knew the card and the Department could obtain details on every trip taken.  I can see why from a financial position but from a data protection point of view I can see that people were not aware that this is the case.  We will write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to clarify this particular issue on whether it has a record of all of the travel taken.</p></speech>

My understanding is there is a different type of arrangement with Go-Ahead, in that the fares go directly to the NTA rather than to Go-Ahead, and that its contract is just to drive the buses.  The NTA has a direct aspect on this.  It is a tripartite arrangement instead of the direct relationship between Irish Rail and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is going three ways.</p></speech>

We are also joined by Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal officer in the planning division of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off completely.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.

The board is responsible for the determination of appeals and certain other matters under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2018 and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.  The board also has responsibility for dealing with proposals for the compulsory acquisition of land and with determining appeals under the water pollution and building control Acts.</p> <p>  The board's income in 2018 totalled &euro;24.4 million.  Just over &euro;4 million, or 17%, comprised fee receipts.  Oireachtas grant funding issued in 2018 from the Vote for housing, planning and local government amounted to &euro;17.5 million.  Expenditure on salaries and related costs amounted to &euro;16 million, representing around two thirds of the board's expenditure in 2018.  Expenditure on legal fees amounted to &euro;3.3 million, or 14% of the total.  The balance of expenditure, of &euro;4.7 million, related to premises and other operating expenses.  The surplus for the year was &euro;552,000.  I certified the 2018 financial statements on 19 June 2019 and issued a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Considering that I took up the post of chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in November 2018, 11 months ago, I may, with the Chairman's indulgence, ask my colleagues to address some of the issues that may be raised during the session.  They may be more familiar with some of the matters.</p> <p>  It is important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual planning cases, as to do so could compromise decisions or various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will endeavour to be as helpful to the committee as possible.</p> <p>  The board is well aware of its critical role in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals, and it remains committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities.  I can confirm that the board considers itself in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p> <p>  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee and internal audits, and we undertake regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  As is required under the code of practice, I receive a report annually from the independent, external chair of the audit and risk committee.  The committee's most recent report has confirmed that our risk management processes and internal controls are operating effectively.  As chairperson, I am also reassured of our financial and governance controls through the unqualified audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General, both for 2018 and for all previously audited years.</p> <p>  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, as outlined by Mr. McCarthy, the board had a total income of &euro;24.4 million in 2018, comprising primarily an Exchequer grant of &euro;17.5 million and fees revenue of just over &euro;4 million.  We spent just over &euro;24 million, leaving a surplus of just over &euro;550,000 when capital transfers and appropriations were taken into account.</p> <p>  I will give members a little background on the organisation.  The board currently has 164 whole-time equivalent staff and ten board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving recent resource requests, including our workforce plan for the period 2019-20, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases that are coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, vacant site levy cases and major infrastructure projects, and taking into account the forecast increase in cases.</p> <p>  In policy terms, the national planning framework and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural areas, and the board has a clear role in implementing such policies through efficient and consistent processing of case decisions.</p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are rightly to the fore, it is crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness.</p> <p>  While it is acknowledged that the board's capacity and performance to meet its statutory objective period of 18 weeks has been impacted, particularly in 2018, by the transition to our new case management system, the increased caseload and the fallout from reduced board capacity in 2017, we have made strong progress to turn things around in recent months.</p> <p>  In 2018, we recorded a 32% increase in the number of cases decided over the previous year, with over 2,800 decisions made.  In November and December alone, we decided almost 600 cases, which is up 36% on the same two months in 2017.  This helped us to reduce the number of cases on hand by more than 300, from 1,355 to just over 1,000 files at the end of the year.  This reflects the commitment of our hard-working staff and board to really get to grips with the backlog generated and deliver robust decisions as efficiently as possible.</p><p> In terms of meeting our 18-week statutory objective period for deciding normal planning appeals, we are aware that an overall compliance rate of 43% for 2018 is not what we would like.  Equally, however, the priority and focus for me since I arrived in the job and took over as chairperson has been to process and decide those cases longest with the board, which had a consequential impact on our percentage compliance rate last year.  However, we have a clear plan in 2019 to clear the backlog and get back to a compliance rate of 70% to 80% by the end of this year.  Things are going well.  Our aggregate compliance rate for appeals for the year was up to 67% by the end of August, and the average decision time was 19.5 weeks, down from 22.5 weeks in 2018.  For the last four months, we have averaged 78% compliance but we know that more work is needed.  The board&rsquo;s performance in relation to strategic housing developments has been very strong, with 39 cases decided during 2018, all within the 16-week target.</p><p> In overall terms, last year the board granted permission for 27 applications for more than 7,100 housing units and almost 4,500 student bed-spaces, which is a vital contribution to the overall increase in residential activity.  This trend has ramped up significantly in 2019, with 40 applications granted permission in the first eight months of this year for a cumulative 9,070 homes and more than 3,000 student bed-spaces.  We are continuing to prioritise these cases and to deal with any large-scale housing appeals expeditiously.  </p><p>Over the course of 2018, the board prepared a five-year strategic plan with four clear goals.  These are to: protect and enhance our reputation for independence, impartiality, integrity, trust and transparency; make robust, timely and high-quality decisions which support proper planning and sustainable development; improve our service to meet changing customer expectations; and foster a motivated, resilient and responsive organisation.  While this is, of course, a five-year strategy out to 2023, there are a number of initiatives and actions that we are prioritising in 2019 to help to realise these objectives and set us on the right path.  High among these priorities is the roll-out and refinement of the project, Plean-IT, which will ultimately enable appeals, observations, submissions and applications to be made online, linking in with the local authorities&rsquo; own e-planning initiatives.   </p><p>  I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues so I will leave it there.  I have included some summary graphs in my submission.  These outline high-level statistics as a reference.  We are happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

It is one of the easiest to read we have received from any organisation.  I want to acknowledge that because it can sometimes be difficult to understand and interpret some of the reports we get here.  Credit is due on that front.</p> <p>  With regard to what Mr. Walsh mentioned in his opening statement in respect of normal appeals, I am looking specifically at table 1 on page 16 of the annual report, which shows that the rate of compliance with the statutory guidelines, that is to say, the time in which the board would like to complete appeals, has fallen.  Does Mr. Walsh believe the Minister has provided the board with enough staff and resources to improve this situation?  I also note that Mr. Walsh mentioned sufficient improvements this year.  At what level does he expect the board to be by the end of 2019?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#N00400"><p>I thank the Deputy; we appreciate good feedback on our annual report.  All our staff put a lot of work into it and it is good to hear that it is legible and easy to follow.  With regard to performance and the challenges the organisation has faced over the past two years, it has helped that the Department and the Minister have provided the resources for which we have asked.  Back in 2013 or 2014, we were down to 138 to 140 staff members.  We are now up to 166, plus the board.  Our workforce plan includes 16 additional posts to be filled over the next year and a half, and these have been approved by the Minister.  That level of staffing resource and budgetary supports means that we will have sufficient capacity.  The challenge for the organisation is often in retaining the great staff we have.  In a very buoyant market, there are opportunities for experienced and well-trained people in the public sector to move on.  Our job, as part of the strategic plan, is to ensure that people want to work in, and stay in, the organisation and that people see a future for themselves in it.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about performance, a 39% rate of compliance in respect of normal planning appeals is very poor.  This has been caused by the roll-out of the Plean-IT scheme.  It is very difficult.  I know from personal experience in previous roles and from talking with staff that the new case management system covers the entire operation of the board from reception through to how the board operates.  When anything new is introduced, even when it is as well developed as possible, there will always be challenges as people get used to the new system and make sure that it is as functional as it can be.  All it takes is a month or two of a slowdown for a backlog to build up.  Thankfully, that backlog is now clearing.  We have dealt with the oldest cases in the system and we expect that, by the end of 2019, our compliance rate will be above 70% and, perhaps, close to 75%.  This expectation acknowledges that in January we were already dealing with cases that had been on hand for longer than the 18 weeks, so we were not getting the benefit.  </p> <p>  In my opening statement, I pointed out that the percentage can sometimes mask the actual performance of the board.  In 2018, the average time to make decision was approximately 22.5 weeks; that time is now down to approximately 19.5 weeks.  For September, it was actually down to 19.1 weeks.  Even though the target is 18 weeks, the average performance is only one week longer.  It is not as if we have left appeals on hand.  We have dealt with the oldest cases and cleared that backlog.</p></speech>

How is that assessed?  There seems to be frustration across the industry with regard to getting responses to referrals under section 5, which are used to determine whether planning permission is needed.  Are they given a lower priority in the context of the current housing emergency?  How are they assessed?  The pushing out of target dates probably has to do with compliance.  People sometimes feel that the target is not really a target if it can be pushed out.  It does not give certainty.  Will Mr. Walsh expand on those three points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#N00600"><p>On the first issue, that of our priorities, we deal with a whole range of cases.  Given the priority Government and the Oireachtas places on ensuring quick decisions on appeals in respect of strategic infrastructure or strategic housing developments, we expedite them as best we can.  We prioritise such appeals and we have put extra resources into our strategic housing division to ensure we meet the 16-week deadline.  Of the 91 such cases we have decided on since January 2018, every single decision was made within the 16 weeks.  That has been a challenge, but we have met the deadline.  Similarly, insofar as is possible, we ensure that we have capacity to deal with applications relating to large infrastructure projects such as roads, energy projects, or major industrial developments.  That may have a knock-on implication for lower-level categories.</p> <p>  In addition to normal planning appeals, we deal with building control, referrals, and vacant site levies.  Through the management team and the board, the organisation has to assess how to best use our resources and how to prioritise, particularly in respect of the older cases.  We took a conscious decision to focus on the applications which had been in the system the longest.  That had an impact early in 2019.  We have now cleared the majority of those cases and we hope to get back.  Referrals are an important element of our work, but they can be more complex and can involve difficult questions of law.</p><p>They are more about deciding whether something needs permission rather than whether we have a file or appeal before us.  In the context of the Deputy's final question, on target dates, there is nothing more frustrating than having uncertainty around when one might get a decision.  In the past 12 months, where we have had to provide an extension and inform all applicants and anyone who is observing, we have given realistic dates and, in the vast majority of cases, met them.  That has made a difference to the feedback from consumers and customers.</p></speech>

On the fee structure, will Mr. Walsh outline An Bord Plean&aacute;la's policy for charging and recovery and its bad debt provision for fees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#O00300"><p>For the majority of fees the board sets, as governed by section 144 of the Planning and Development Act, the board is permitted to set fees and propose them for the Minister to agree with or not.  Every three years we need to review our fees.  The most recent booklet on our system outlines all the fees.  It was updated in April 2019 and it reflects the fact we introduced some new fees in respect of vacant site levies, which is a new process the board has.  The majority of the fees we have set date back to approximately September 2011.  Every two years - we are due another periodic review - we look at the fees, particularly in the context of consumer price index increases, and propose whether we suggest increases.  I am sure we would all acknowledge that the tough times during and after the recession were not the time to be loading up.  We want to ensure that the fees are kept at a level that encourages as many people as possible who wish to be involved in the process, either in making observations or appeals, to feel there is not a monetary block.</p> <p>  Fees for strategic infrastructure projects and strategic housing projects are set at a fairly high level and we get pretty much full cost recovery for those.  We get the fee paid up front and, depending on the overall assessment of the application over its lifetime, we would either look for additional money or, in some cases, refund money that was not a cost incurred.  Bad debts occur only in legal cases and there are very few.  Where we identify costs that should be recouped, it is normally through that process that we try to chase down those debts and ensure we get value for money for the Exchequer and the organisation.</p></speech>

How will embracing electronic commerce improve how the board does its business?  My understanding of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that it sends letters via registered post.  Will that process change?</p> <p>  On the strategic housing development, SHD, as far as I understand, applicants have to host an online system to correspond with the board.  Some people may argue that it may be difficult for the public to have oversight of the process.  Will Mr. Walsh comment on the new IT system?  How will it improve the performance of the board's website, provide transparency for the customer and assist in the overall embracing of electronic commerce?</p></speech>

We are not as far along in the process as we would have originally envisaged.  We planned it in 2014 and the project has existed for four or five years.  If everything had gone to plan, we would launch this year.  It is likely to be towards the end of next year but there are good reasons for that.  To return to the previous issue of delays and consequential impacts on the operation of the system, we need to make sure that whatever goes live will be fully functional and will maintain the confidence people have in the system.  The last thing we need is a less than perfect model to be out there where, from day one, people say it is not working and they cannot make their connections.</p> <p>  The issue is that everybody expects and knows about the system, and we are all working towards making the process as simple and efficient as possible.  As the Deputy will probably know from his local government days, paper and boxes of files are still being shipped.  We are keeping An Post and other organisations in business with the volume of paperwork, although that will all change.  Local authorities will be able to press a button and send all their digital copies to us.  We will not deal with large files.  We will have everything on our system and it will be visible.  Likewise, any letters and notifications will go out by email.  We will need to maintain some level of traditional correspondence for people who do not wish to engage in e-commerce, as in the case of driver licences, motor tax and passports.  The vast majority of people, however, including professionals, members of the public and local authorities, will embrace the change and are waiting for it to come through.  It will have greater efficiency, as well as a cost saving in the system, but it is also a simple requirement of how business needs to move on.  Before we developed the new system, the system was functional but it never had the required capacity.  When we went out with it, therefore, we knew that the design would be a web portal that would allow everybody to view, participate and make payments, and that it would, hopefully, provide an even better service to everybody.  </p> <p>  On SHD and oversights, we work within the remit the Minister and the Oireachtas have set in legislation.  The requirement for the proposer or applicant to put all the documentation on a website was very much mirroring what was already there in respect of the large-scale strategic infrastructure projects.  I am aware that as part of the legislative measures brought in in 2017, the Minister is undertaking a review of SHD and the process, and looking at whether there are ways to improve it.  An independent review group was established to produce a report.  The board will await the outcome of that and determine what the Minister and the Government wish to do, and we will adapt our systems.  The more information that is available on our website and on that of the planning authority, the better.  We do not want to hide information but rather make it as accessible as possible, which would be our ultimate goal.</p></speech>

The accounts for 2017 and 2018 show that in 2017, we were due to have a rent review of our building in Marlborough Street but it did not happen until 2018.  We had factored in that we expected there would be an increase in the price of the rents of potentially up to 15%, given the market that was there.  As the review was due in 2017, we had budgeted for retrospective costs that might come through.  In the end, as part of our negotiation, we secured a 2% increase in our rents for the next five years instead of the 15% for which we had budgeted.  There were no retrospective issues in 2017.  We felt it was a good deal in the context of that for which we had originally planned.  It is a functional building and we control all of it.  It is useful to have everyone in one location in order that we, as an organisation from reception all the way through the board, have a seamless process.  We will be there for the next four years.  Mr. Egan might like to add something.</p></speech>

We have the main building but we also took on what were two empty retail units on the ground floor of the building.</p><p>They had been lying vacant for a number of years and we got a very attractive offer from the landlord to take those retail units into the building at a much reduced rent for those floor areas.  Those areas are used primarily for the public.  As we have increased the space for the reception area and the meeting rooms, we were quite satisfied that this was a very good deal and improved our customer service to members of the public coming into our offices.  </p></speech>

One area of interest is the operation of the strategic infrastructure provision.  Perhaps Mr. Sheridan might like to comment on this.  It concerns the determination the board must make further to county development plans.  I am thinking of areas like the development of the renewables sector and wind farms.  I note that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's annual report is very clear about the determinations it has made in respect of those.  The Department embarked on a trajectory a number of years ago.  Councillors were setting out provisions in their county development plans that would aid the development of renewables like wind farms in particular areas like boglands.  They were making it very clear in the development plan that the Minister was issuing directions to overturn those proposals.  Subsequently, it stopped doing that.  Recent county development plans contain variations that were put forward by the local authorities.  They were left in place when concerns may have been raised.  In other words, they agreed with the decisions of the democratically-elected local authorities.  An example could be if a local authority makes a determination through the democratically-elected councillors to designate an area in its county development plan that might be suitable for the development of a wind farm.  This is a global picture to help my understanding of the process.  Were the local authority to designate an area, for example, a bog, based on its assessment, the testing of wind speeds, the habitat and all the different matrices it uses, how much note of that would be taken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is it a definite "No" that it would override decisions like that in the county development plan or is it something of which it would take substantial account?  How does that process work?  It has always interested me.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Planning Act and the Schedule to the Act set the threshold.  I think it is 25 turbines or a wind energy level of 50 MW.  If something meets the threshold, it will come into the board directly.  Regardless of whether it involves large-scale or smaller-scale developments, the board must have regard to a range of factors.  They include national policy, planning guidelines, regional and spatial plans, city and county plans and local area plans.  We must look at the whole range of issues.  Regardless of whether it involves Government guidance or a county development plan, there are objectives that, depending on how one reads them, can conflict.  There could be objectives around encouraging greater renewable energy generation, protecting landscapes,  providing more industry and encouraging rural activity.  The board has a range of highly skilled and highly professional planners, who must take everything from the national to the regional to the local into account and must make a judgment call.  Planning is never an exact science.  It is not a blanket model that one can move because every consideration and every case has its own nuances around access, visibility, appropriateness of location, stability and even the appropriateness of whether one would get the right wind conditions to make it viable.  A challenge not only for the board but for planning authorities in dealing with smaller-scale projects is to weigh up all of these different factors and to find the best planning solution.  It is often on the basis of the information we have before us and the views of people in favour of or against it but it also takes from the city and county plans, as well as national guidance.</p></speech>

I would have hoped that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would place great value on those documents and I hear that in what Mr. Walsh is saying.  Mr. Walsh mentioned that national plans can contradict that.  Sometimes they can leave a vacuum, for example, with regard to wind guidelines and setback.  Does Mr. Sheridan have anything to add regarding cases where variations were stopped and are now allowed?  Are we waiting for a clear strategy in the area?</p></speech>

The national planning framework and regional spatial and economic strategies will have particular objectives regarding renewable energy, including wind farms, and, accordingly, must be taken into account by local authorities in their plans.  They are in the process of being reviewed on foot of the adoption of the regional spatial and economic strategies.  All local authorities will adhere to new timelines with regard to the adoption of plans.  Under the new arrangements, which will be overseen by the Office of the Planning Regulator, there will be an obligation on local authorities to have regard to national policy generally, including with regard to renewable energy, when adopting their plans, as well the other requirements set out in the Planning Act.  Where previously, directions were initiated within the Department against local authorities and confirmed by the Minister, that process is in transition and that function is being transferred to the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p></speech>

Often, a CPO that is not challenged does not even come before the board but where an individual or an organisation challenges a local authority-proposed CPO, even if it is a single person in one house, we will always facilitate through an oral hearing.  In many cases, the oral process provides the opportunity to the local authority to outline its views and to enable individuals or appellants to justify their opposition.  Ultimately, the board makes a decision that goes back to the local authority for confirmation or otherwise.</p></speech>

One could argue that, for small-scale CPOs, it is a lot of time and effort.  Equally, however, the CPO process is impacting on people's lives and on their constitutional property rights to a certain extent.  It is important that people feel they have not just a written opportunity but also a chance to understand and meet the planning inspector as well.  We used to make oral hearings mandatory but in some cases the board now has the opportunity to decide if it has enough information on hand without having a hearing in every instance.</p></speech>

Only in the past month we received a report on our own review of our oral hearing processes in terms of how they are organised, who attends and also trying to identify savings and efficiencies that we can bring to the system.  Some of our oral hearings have gone on for a number of weeks, particularly for more complex projects.  Again, if we have as much information available to all of the applicants as early as possible, it allows us to get to the nub of the issues quickly.  Not all oral hearings are held in hotels.  Obviously, any that take place in or around Dublin would be held in our offices, free of charge.  A lot depends on the type of project or proposal.  We also deal with local authority projects, road CPOs and so on and if the oral hearing is being held in the local authority offices, there might be a perception-----</p></speech>

The legislation requires that the board has a range of skills.

The same is true of people who have worked in certain sectors.  Normally, for the first two years they would not get any files associated with that sector at all.

The idea is that we do not want to have the same people going into the meetings all the time - people who share the same views or the same skill set.  We always vary the timelines in terms of who people deal with.  We are a collective board of ten and while we meet <i>en bloc</i>for large applications, for the sake of efficiency we generally have three-person meetings.  We could have three meetings going on at the same time.  In 2018, we had 940 meetings of the board.</p></speech>

It is our problem if the board does not have enough resources.  While we might be meeting the rules of the game in terms of the legislation, I do not think we are meeting the spirit of the planning process in terms of the oversight we expect as consumers and the State by having just three people deciding on a case.  I will leave that point because I have two other important points and I do not want to go over time.</p> <p>  My next question is probably for Mr. Sheridan.  Is it still possible for a Minister to make a ministerial order?  I remember reading years ago that a ministerial order was made to give X planning permission.

I am conscious that the board does not want us to discuss individual cases, so let us talk about a hypothetical case.  Let us say a lake was infected with cryptosporidium and because the lake provided water to 13,000 families, Irish Water decided it needed to put in a treatment plant immediately because otherwise the 13,000 families would have to boil water.  Let us say the planning authority gave planning but An Bord Plean&aacute;la overruled it on the basis that it was contrary to the habitats directive, as there was a particular snail or aspect of biodiversity that had to be protected.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la was taking adequate cognisance of the imperative reasons of overriding public interest, surely the board would grant permission?  It would say the sum of the 13,000 families outweighs the sum of the biodiversity needs of the snail or whatever aspect of diversity was at stake?  Would that be the case?</p></speech>

On the basis that most cases involve a board of three, if there were perhaps ten, there would be a better opportunity for somebody to state, under the imperative reasons of overriding public interest provisions, that 13,000 families were affected.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not providing adequate scope.  Its practice is to involve three persons, but there is the potential to miss the emergency aspect of supplying clean water to 13,000 families.  As Mr. Walsh stated, we cannot discuss individual cases, but I am discussing a hypothetical one that happens to mirror an actual case.</p></speech>

First, we regard every case that comes before us as important because there are individuals affected by it, but there is a scale of cases.  One might have an extension to a house, a single house, a large road or water services infrastructure.  We have to marry and adjudicate on a huge range and spread of cases.  If we were to have the full board deal with every case that comes through, it would have an impact on the timelines.  The committee saw what happened two years ago when our ability to deliver within 18 weeks was severely challenged.  It is a judgment call.  For large-scale and infrastructure cases, we have a strategic infrastructure division which I chair and has five board members.  They deal with most of the larger cases and anything I bring to a ten-person board.  The EIA, AA and flood risk assessment are all issues on which we comply fully and of which we are cognisant in making decisions.</p></speech>

The legislation has removed all checks and balances even in normal circumstance.  Certainly, it has removed them from the democratic process in the local authorities' adherence to county development plans in terms of objections from the public, etc.  Is it fair to say the provisions for strategic housing developments have worked nicely for developers insofar as they have allowed them to circumvent county development plans?  Is it a fair assertion that it was more about removing regulation than fast-tracking, given what came to light over the weekend?</p></speech>

We were assigned the role to deal with strategic housing developments within the bounds of what had originally been set out in the 2017 Act and the regulations from the Minister.</p><p>It may be more a matter for the Department to explain the justification.  However, in the context of addressing the issue of input from all levels, from the local authorities as well as from the applicants and third parties who are interested in the case, one thing that has worked quite well within the system is the tripartite discussions that happen during the pre-planning arrangements.  These take place in the first nine weeks of the period.  The applicant, the local authority in all its different guises - planners, water people - as well as the board and its inspectors, will meet to discuss the key issues that the local authority, the board and the applicants feel are critical to developing a proposal of the scale that is within the bounds of the SHD legislation.  That allows a very clear and formal process to enable views to be expressed, akin to the section 247 processes that the local authority would have had before.  This is very much to identify, as part of a final report for the pre-planning, critical issues that the board or indeed the local authority, which will submit its own report, would highlight and that a developer or proposer needs to reach-----</p></speech>

In the context, in any decisions that we take, the role of the board is finished, generally, with the decision.  Again, we have had good constructive feedback.  We did meet the review group as part of a range of stakeholders to inform them on the process.  That was one of the issues that did arise but it is ultimately a matter for the Minister and the Department to decide if additional measures are required.</p></speech>

The whole justification for being given the power for this scheme and the whole idea of the scheme was to fast-track.  Now that is not happening.  For two thirds of the planning applications, two thirds of the houses, work has not even commenced on them.  What responsibility would Mr. Walsh take for that?  I imagine he would have to accept some responsibility.  The policy is not working that he is tasked to implement.</p></speech>

The SHD legislation was to fast-track planning decisions.  That is what we have done.  It is not the board's job, and indeed people might argue that the board would be going way beyond its remit if it started taking over what either the Department or planning authorities do.  The Deputy mentioned before about making sure there was a local process, and that is the system that the board feeds into.  We make fast-track planning decisions and then the system has to ensure that there are sufficient mechanisms to drive development that happens on foot of it.  We have approved 16,000 units and 7,500 or 8,000 student bed spaces.  Many of those are being built.  It is a matter for the Department and the Minister to review to ensure that there is up-to-date information.  That is something that Mr. Sheridan might want to speak on.</p></speech>

There were claims that the planning system was an impediment or obstacle to the progression of housing developments and delivery of housing supply.</p><p>This was considered in the context of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan in 2016, and it was a commitment that the Department and the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, incorporated in the plan.  I accept the Deputy's point that the fast-track process was to facilitate the delivery of housing as speedily as possible and that it kind of undermines the system.  Despite the granting of planning permission, the permissions are not being acted on as quickly as is necessary, but we are monitoring this issue.  It was one of the issues addressed by the review group that reported back to us last week on the operation of the arrangements.</p></speech>

At what stage did the Department recognise that, while the whole idea was to fast-track development, it was not happening and, therefore, the policy was not working?  At what stage did the Department flag that up with the Minister and what was the response?</p></speech>

The first permissions were not granted until January 2018 and we have been monitoring it since then.  Granting planning permission is not the sole factor in ensuring delivery of housing supply but it is the one factor we and the Minister have control over.  However, other factors such as access to capital and land are equally important in this regard.  There may be situations where developers, on getting planning permission, are still in the process of completing schemes or obtaining finance to progress the permissions they have been granted.  It became apparent early in 2019 that things were not happening as quickly as we would like, but one has to allow a reasonable timeframe from the granting of permission to the commencement of development on site.  As I indicated, this was something that was focused on by the review group that reported back to us last week on the effectiveness of the scheme, and the group made particular recommendations in this regard.  It is ultimately a matter for the Minister, on foot of that review and under the provisions of the Act, to come forward with his conclusions on the review group report and any recommendations within it, and to submit his conclusions on that report, which we only received last week, to the Oireachtas by the end of October.</p></speech>

As I said, we only received the report last week.  We will be submitting the Minister's conclusions on the report and also the report itself to the Oireachtas, as required under the 2017 Act, by the end of this month, that is, in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

It is only in operation for just over two years.

As I said, he is going to come forward with his responses to the review group report within a matter of weeks and they may include further legislative changes.  That has been flagged.  As Mr. Walsh has signalled, that could include the application of a vacant site levy where permissions are not being activated, and perhaps attaching a condition to those permissions that they must be commenced within a certain period after the permission is granted.  All of these issues are being looked at present.</p></speech>

For the purposes of transparency, Dave Walsh was assistant secretary over climate change and environment and Terry Sheridan was in planning at the time I was in the Department.</p> <p>  I was looking forward to the meeting today because, during my brief stint in the Department, this area was one where I would have loved to have had more time but, unfortunately, I did not.  I am very glad there is a new face to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if there is a face, because it is desperately needed.  I believe 100% in An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I do not believe that how it operates at the moment can continue from a transparency point of view.  It needs to change pretty fundamentally.  If I was ever on the other side of the Chamber again, it would be one of my main priorities to put this into a programme for Government.  In fact, I would insist on it.  I do not think it can continue.</p> <p>  I want to raise five different areas, and this is more by way of discussion than questions.  I will not ask the witnesses to speak about any individual cases, and if I mention one, it is not to look for a response.  I am certainly not going to down the road that Deputy MacSharry went, basically mirroring a case all the way.</p></speech>

In other words, the person objects to a development, that objection is dismissed by relevant authority - the county council - it is referred to the board, and the board disagrees with the planning authority and agrees with the person who referred it.  That is all fine, it happens, and it is no problem.  Has it ever happened that the actual person who is taking this to the board, where a decision has been made, in whole or in part, does not actually exist?  Would that not mean that this decision is in some way in jeopardy or in some way corrupted?  I use these words loosely because I cannot think of any other words, and I mean that in generic terms rather than with a personal orientation.</p><p>I ask the Chair to follow my logic.  Somebody objects to a proposal or a development, which is their entitlement.  The local authority then passes the development.  The person objecting takes it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which reverses the planning authority&rsquo;s decision, partly or fully based on the fact this person referred it to the board.  This person does not exist, however.  What happens then?  Has Mr. Walsh ever heard of any situation like this in any way, shape or form?</p></speech>

In some cases, letters would come back because the address was wrong or, in some cases, the person could not be found.  In theory, if there is no objection, then there is no case for the board to deal with.</p> <p>  Any appeal or objection that is received is circulated to the applicant.  Again, in some cases, the applicant may raise the same question the Deputy has, namely, does this person exist.  The board would take every step that it can to track down and make sure there is a valid appeal from a person who exists.</p> <p>  We would take legal advice as to what the status.  The board would have operated on the best available information it had in making its decision.  It may be a matter for the courts to decide whether the board&rsquo;s appeal and decision stands.</p> <p>  There have been difficulties.  I remember a general case in which somebody wrote in with their views on a topic.  It was obvious that English was not their first language.  The person spelled their name differently in three different locations on the application form.  We undertook to follow up and make sure the person existed.  The person did not write in the English script, meaning the challenge was spelling it.  Again, these are the kinds of steps the board would take in general terms.  In many cases, it would be the applicant who might raise this issue, on which the board would then follow up.</p></speech>

This is where my determination to ensure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is changed for the better is exemplified.  I do not think An Bord Plean&aacute;la can or should in any way, shape or form take an application unless it is verified.  The stage after involves taking the decision to another level, which is the courts.  That is not fair.  In fact, it is disproportionate because the applicant has done everything right.  A legislative change should be introduced to ensure an objector is verified.  I accept it could be graded according to the scale of the development from individual houses up.  However, for medium and large-scale developments, there should be some process like I have suggested.  In my view, there have been fictitious appeals that have gone all the way to the board.  The board&rsquo;s consideration of decisions has happened based on people who did not exist.  That is not acceptable.  It is not a good enough answer to say the applicant can resort to the courts.</p></speech>

This has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>in Kerry.  The decision, however, of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that development was influenced by this.  There were only two objectors.  Everyone knows who the other one was.  That was their right as a citizen and I have no issue with that.  The decision, however, was based on the two objections sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Nobody knows who the other person was.  Most people there do not believe that person exists.</p><p>That cannot be allowed happen.  Decisions like that are not acceptable.  Parking the decision about the actual case, it cannot happen that it was appealed by somebody who does not exist.</p></speech>

That is fine.  However, take the circle of the decision-making process.  It is corrupted if a person is appealing it and then the board has to consider that as part of the mix.  It cannot say that it is the same complete decision if it got all the way through the board but the person objecting does not exist.</p> <p>  One wonders why people have concerns about An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have had concerns about it from a transparency point of view for many years.  This is an ultimate example of why people have concerns.  That is why Mr. Walsh must clean it up.  I will not stop in my political career until this is fixed.  I will keep going on this issue because I believe it must be cleaned up.</p> <p>  The people of Ballinskelligs, a small little place in south Kerry who are dependent on this type of development and need it, will not have this hotel because of this decision.</p><p>The decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that is fine.  It was a decision that pre-dated Mr. Walsh and that is fine.  The fact the people in Ballinskelligs cannot find out who one of the people who objected was, and it got all the way through to the board, is fundamentally, totally and utterly wrong and cannot be allowed to happen in modern Ireland.  The impact it has on small places is disproportionate and morally wrong.  There are many other questions about it.  Mr. Walsh should take that for what it is worth.</p><p> I have a couple of comments to make on transparency and I will get back to my recommendations.  That was a Freudian slip; I mean the recommendations that came out of the report.  My colleague went through issues about who makes decisions and most people do not know that it can come down to three people.  I knew that, although most people did not.  I do not agree with it, but I know it.  I think that at the end of each year, the names of the people who made decisions on each file must be published.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should bring that in.</p></speech>

However many people are involved in making a decision, if any of the decision makers had conversations with each other before the decision was made, they should, through An Bord Plean&aacute;la processes, have to declare them prior to the decision being made.  It is purely a transparency initiative to stop any notion of people coming together to make decisions beforehand.  These suggestions are purely to protect the process of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  I return to the recommendations in the review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that I sought.  When I was Minister, I had many others balls in the air about other matters, so I did not have much time for this area.  I did, however, ask for a complete review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, organisationally, which was done at the time by very eminent people.  I rarely do this, but I submitted a parliamentary question to my former Department, asking for an update, in chronological order, on the 101 recommendations contained in that review.  The Department refused to do that.  The Ceann Comhairle will be dealing with the matter and I look forward to that being resolved.  Will Mr. Walsh please provide the committee, within in a week or two, with the current status of those 101 recommendations?</p></speech>

There are very good recommendations in it and I want to find out the status of them all.  I have a deep suspicion that many of them have not materialised.  That would concern me because I felt at the time that there was not much of a pull towards my decision to start this review in the first place.  Page 30 of the annual report states the board consented to the quashing of ten of its orders where a procedural deficit was identified.  On ten occasions, the board had to quash its own orders which is a bit of an indictment of the procedures.  In this report, many of the procedures are updated and improved on so I want to ensure they are being implemented.</p> <p>  The report was not done for the craic.  There are some very good recommendations in the report.  For example, recommendation No. 61 is that the board must make clear its direction, by reference to paragraph numbers, those parts of the inspector's report with which it agrees and those parts with which it disagrees.  That again brings me back to transparency.  Where the board disagrees, it should give its reasons for doing so, supported, if necessary, by relevant evidence.  In other words, the reasons should not be formulaic.  Does that happen?</p></speech>

I am not going to take up much committee time on this but there are a number of other useful recommendations.  Recommendation No. 3 relates to managerial oversight.  Recommendation Nos. 6 and 8 deal with board members being appointed by the public appointments service, PAS.  That goes outside the board's remit and is more of a departmental issue but that is a no-brainer and should happen.  Recommendation No. 16 relates to biannual seminars.  Recommendation No. 24 deals with performance management.  There are a whole range of recommendations that need legislative changes which, I understand, would come through the Department and not the board.</p> <p>  Deputy MacSharry spoke about the use of local authorities and I do not believe An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be hiring rooms in hotels unless it is going through a very long process.  I think they should all be in local authorities, or somewhere close to them.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 66 is aimed at easing pressures, getting the timelines down and meeting the timeframes set out.  It suggests appointing one board member for small developments unless they are going to contradict it.  The timelines must improve.</p> <p>  Referring back to my time in the Department, I believe the relationship between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department needs to change.  I will not say too much more about that but it needs to change pretty quickly.</p> <p>  Another recommendation is that where there is a contravention of a local development plan over a certain level, there should be consultation with the public.  Does that happen?  It does not.  That has to happen and that is an example of a recommendation that never came in.</p> <p>  The board should have an annual conference.  Recommendation No. 98 states there should be a head of communications.  At the end of the year, key decisions should be explained.</p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, all this is about transparency to the public about operations, the people who make the decisions, how people are appointed, how money is spent and to ensure that serious contraventions of local developments are explained.  All this needs to be front-facing.  The days of An Bord Plean&aacute;la hiding behind secrets and a process that nobody knows about, although I know about it and can see it, are over.  The process needs to be front and centre for the public to see.  People do not respect, appreciate or understand how all this works.  That is becoming a problem because discourses are emanating out there as regards decision making.  That creates rumours, which creates concerns.  I believe some of these are not warranted.  However, I demonstrated examples at the beginning of this meeting where they are warranted, justified and are affecting people's lives in a massive and disproportionate way.  It is wrong.</p> <p>  I have a couple of final points to make and questions to ask.  I bet our guests are glad I came to the committee today.  A number of pieces of legislation are recommended as part of the 101 recommendations.  Have our guests any issue with any of the proposed pieces of legislation?  If so, they might tell me.</p></speech>

Some 20 cases went to the courts in 2018.  Seven of those cases were refused leave to appeal, 13 cases were won by the board, and two cases were lost.</p></speech>

I will touch on a number of issues.</p> <p>  I refer to strategic housing developments.  If a local authority receives a big planning application, a commencement notice is given in order that it can track permissions and commencements.  How does An Bord Plean&aacute;la do that?</p></speech>

The board has no role in commencements.  Any commencements required by an applicant or developer go into the local government system.</p></speech>

Our job is to determine the planning permission, and once that is done, our role is finished and it goes back to the local authorities to enforce it.</p></speech>

I presume the local authorities have to deal with Part V and applications that are given permission subject to conditions.  Where something is granted permission in theory, the conditions can sometimes take some time to work out and must be worked out at local government level.  How many applications would be subject to conditions?</p></speech>

Some of those applications require local authority agreement around finishes, landscaping, and so on.  These are normal issues in the course of a development.  A planning application that is successful at local level would have the same level of conditions attached to it.</p></speech>

Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

It is standard practice that if a developer wants to move ahead, it will submit the finishes or other details to the local authority to be signed off on.</p></speech>

However, when a site gets permission and is subsequently sold, there is no obligation to maintain a website.  I have come across that issue in my own area and it becomes impossible for people to find information.  There is a question of transparency in public information, because the development has not come through the local authorities.  They will only put it up on their system so they can track it for compliance.  Is that currently being looked at?  There is duplication here which is costing administrative time.</p></speech>

That is something Mr. Sheridan may well update and is being looked at as part of the review.  All the information the board receives is on our website as part of the public record, and is also available to view in our offices.

It is challenging for people because there is a lot of information on the site and it is not in the modern website style.

The board is a member of the oversight steering group so we are fully <i>au fait</i>with what it is doing.  We have been talking at a technical level to ensure understanding of information, particularly in the context of how data and files will move.  Ultimately, it is the format of files.

We are operating with different systems.  The key is that the systems talk to each other as effectively as possible.  We have chosen a certain project, a Microsoft customer relationship management, CRM, system, to operate in the board and that runs throughout the board.  The local government system through the LGMA operates different models in not just the planning area but also in how it operates as an organisation.  Obviously, it has other functions.  The reality is that most of the documentation that will be transferred over and back will be in the same format and it is about making sure that both systems talk and are compatible.  There is no duplication.  We have been developing this for the last four years and the system is operational.  It is working and we are using it daily in the organisation.  The key issue for me is to ensure that it works as efficiently and fully as possible before we roll it out for the public accessing it.</p></speech>

When it went live internally in 2017 the spend was &euro;1.319 million, and in 2018 the spend was &euro;456,000.  That gives a total of &euro;2.875 million spent to the end of 2018, with a further &euro;174,000 spent this year so far.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh spoke about a combined approach to the IT strategy.  Is there a combined approach to storage capacity as well, or would that be appropriate?  A very large amount of money is being spent nationally and some of it would not be under the remit of this committee.

The Office of Government Procurement has a framework agreement so there are people who have pre-qualified to provide archiving and storage services.

A great deal of work goes into them.  Many of them have to be re-examined because we have moved from a national spatial strategy to the national development plan and a re-focus.  The plans will have gone through, in a very thoughtful way, what is required to permit a housing development to take place, such as associated roads infrastructure, schools, community facilities and so forth.  The board does not have to take account of those.  It can have regard to them.  The phrases "regard to" and "in compliance with" are very different.  What note does the board take of those with regard to, for example, large scale strategic housing developments?  There is already sizeable disquiet about more one-dimensional housing development.  We need housing, but the point is there is a store of other things are not provided in parallel with it.</p><p>Houses are built but not communities.  What is An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit in that regard?  There is a cost associated with it.  What is the arrangement?</p></speech>

The Deputy is making the point that the development is not in isolation.  It requires upgrades in servicing through wastewater, water systems or traffic, and has cumulative impacts.  We also have regard to national policy, from the national planning framework through what, hopefully, will be regional spatial and economic strategies and the new regional plans in place.  It is always a balance to say we have to have regard to those.  As I said in response to another Deputy's question, where we are seriously materially contravening and going against the local plan, we have to justify and explain why that is the case.  For SHDs, when a proposal comes in that goes against the plan, it has to advertise in its public notice that it is contravening the plan and set out the reasons for that.  The board will analyse and assess that in coming to its final decision.</p></speech>

However, there is often a time lag and that is why this phasing approach is often knitted into plans.  That is not always followed through on.  There could be a potential cost.</p></speech>

There is a significant challenge in trying to align and ensure that all of the plans at the different levels are consistent.  The local area plans would be the last to be updated, taking account of whatever is in their regional spatial strategy and the key principles.  In an ideal world, we would say that we will wait until everything is aligned before making decisions, but we have to make important and efficient decisions on issues and investments now, whether housing, roads or water.  That is not to say that anything in the plans at present is out of date.  We have to recognise that there may be a mismatch in the interim between what might be national and local.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the courts to ultimately decide whether the board's decision was valid or otherwise.  In every case, including some that we win, we get a report from our legal advisers stating what the issue was and that the courts decided to make a judgement, stating that the board's language was deficient or the process was not as robust as it should be and what the board needed to do to amend it.  With regard to appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessments or provision of services, the language sometimes used by the board in its orders may or may not fully reflect the requirements.</p></speech>

We have a process which can be convoluted and take a long time.  We receive claims from the people who we have liability to, usually in a gross amount.  Since we are dealing with the superior courts, those claims can be quite substantial.  When we contest a judicial review that goes through the High Court, possibly to the Supreme Court, the claims can range from &euro;250,000 to &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

We consult our legal advisers about the quantum of the claim.  There can be scope for settlement negotiations to be conducted without necessarily going to taxation.  I am not a legal person but as I understand it, it would be quite common in such matters for the parties to try to settle.  Given the nature of the committee here, members can rest assured that when we receive a gross claim, we do not just pay it.  I am not costing any aspersions on the bona fides of the claimants but the settlement negotiations that we have experienced in the last number of years have substantially settled claims at a much reduced level from the original level, in the quantum of approximately between 25% and 40%.  We have also gone to taxation but I understand that people know that to go to taxation is itself a costly process, including the transaction costs of taxation.  We have to make the judgment about whether we settle at what we consider to be an amount that would not be bettered at taxation.  That is what we do in individual cases.  We have settled but at a level that is much lower than the claim.</p></speech>

All of this is on the board's website.  The fees can vary.  They are based on the number of units in the development.  A certain amount is specified per unit.  It also depends on whether an environmental impact assessment or Natura impact statement is involved and whether alteration requests are made.

We did a breakdown for the first six months of the operation of the SHD.  We calculated the amount of time taken by staff and local authorities, which get a portion of the fees.</p><p>For the first 18 months of the operation, we received &euro;2.416 million in fees under strategic housing developments.  There was a refund of just over &euro;1.09 million of those fees.  Where we were able to process the fees in advance, we gave a refund of money that was not spent.  That pretty much left &euro;1.325 million as the estimated costs of what we spent.  It is full cost recovery, just the same as strategic infrastructure.</p></speech>

We would ask the question of what would happen if the power went down in the organisation or the IT system completely failed.  All departments, from reception up to the board, operate off this system so we would consider what we would do in that scenario.  Another example would be performance.  At the start of this year, we identified that our compliance with the SOP was not where it should be and we identified that as a major risk.</p></speech>

This would be our 80% compliance target.  We have made sufficient progress over the course of the year.  We set a target for ourselves to be at 70% by the end of the year, and we are currently at about 65%, so we reduced that risk as part of our mid-year review because we recognised that we have more control over it.  There is a control effectiveness measure, so the number three signifies the most control and the number one means it is out of our hands.

They are good and easy to read.  I come from a slightly different background and I do not condemn An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authorities about planning.  They have been underfunded and under-resourced for a long time.  I do not expect Mr. Walsh to comment on what I am about to say but I will preface my remarks by saying we are now in a position where we are rushing through, and putting a statutory obligation on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to rush through, housing developments and other strategic developments that should be going through an adequately resourced and funded local authority.  We are undermining democracy and the participation of citizens.  From a legal background, one matter that always struck me as I listened to the judges was the emphasis they put on the trinity.  I want to repeat that here and I will go on to ask some questions.  The trinity in planning law is the local authority, the developer and the citizen.  The burden on the citizen is huge.  I do not like the word "objection".  I have rarely seen objectors in my 17 years at local authority level.  I have seen committed people.  One does see one or two people who object for the sake of it but most people are committed when they go to the trouble of making a submission.  I have seen the role of the public in the planning process significantly reduced to the point that it has been almost entirely removed.  That is to the detriment of our democracy.</p> <p>  I have just returned from the D&aacute;il where the T&aacute;naiste justified the legislation the Government brought in giving An Bord Plean&aacute;la the power to look at strategic housing developments.  He said it was taking 75 weeks to process an application for 100 houses.  That was one of the reasons he gave, which I wrote down as he spoke.  I was totally unaware of that and I spent 17 years at local authority level.  What was missing, since 2009 in particular, was application, staff and public housing.</p></speech>

It comes from a piece of work the Department undertook in 2015 and 2016 to track large-scale developments of 100 houses or more from when they went into the local authority to when the decision on the appeal was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The Department shared a spreadsheet of all those cases and the calculations with the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government as part of the deliberations on the legislation.  Notwithstanding the point the Deputy has made, if we look at how An Bord Plean&aacute;la is operating, we have a mandate to deal with what comes before us.

There was no problem getting applications through at local authority level during the Celtic tiger period.  I watched that and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was understaffed and under-resourced.  I am glad to hear it has more resources now but it would have to get more resources given the huge range of responsibilities it has, extending from derelict site levies to projects of common interest, which I will come to.  Is An Bord Plean&aacute;la adequately resourced to deal with all those responsibilities?</p></speech>

Environmental impact assessments are generally carried out on such projects, which would deal with the human impact but also the impact on water, on air and on energy, including renewable energy.  The proposer would be expected to outline why the development was positive rather than negative.  Locations are a critical factor and water courses may be impacted in certain areas.  Data centres, like any other major infrastructure, have a huge draw on resources generally.  We look at the cumulative impact of proliferation as much as an individual case.  We marry our approach to major infrastructure and industrial processes to renewable energy proposals and we see the full spectrum, giving us a better picture to enable us to make the best determination we can.</p></speech>

Often it is not clear what the issue is.  In these cases we provide an opportunity for the applicant or the appellant to elaborate or provide further evidence.  We normally allow a period of two or three weeks.  We then circulate the material to everyone else in the file and the 18 weeks disappear very quickly.  We have a priority system to balance the larger projects, particularly where there is masses of information and we need to make sure people will have time to understand and respond to it.  Our system looks at files and balances the competing challenges presented by small cases and ones of more strategic, community, economic or infrastructural significance.  We make sure we provide the resources needed to ensure there will be a planning inspector and staff ready to deal with those files, rather leaving all of the hard ones until the end.  We have to balance it as we go.</p></speech>

I understand how something can be delayed.  A lot of people have received letters stating their case was not dealt with within the 18-week period and that it would be dealt with within a few more weeks.  When those few weeks passed by, they received another letter stating it would be dealt with in another few weeks.  This was a source of much irritation and frustration for real people in trying to go about their daily lives.  Does Mr. Walsh acknowledge that this is the case?  What has An Bord Plean&aacute;la done since that period?  Has the organisation learned from it and how will it prevent it from happening ever again to normal people in going about their lives?</p></speech>

Certainly we have learned that we do not want to offer something we cannot actually deliver.  We have improved our overall compliance levels.  It used to take on average between 22.5 and 23 weeks to decide all cases.  Cases were not decided within 18 weeks, but they did not go to far beyond that figure.  We have brought it down to 19.5 weeks.  In the vast majority of cases where parties do not receive a decision within 18 weeks, they receive one very soon afterwards.

I am just commenting on other assertions made here.  I cannot see how it is technically possible or realistic for the ten people to consider all 2,900 cases.  I am sure members of the public do not make the calculation.  Three members of the board make a decision on a case.  As I said at the start, a case could involve a shed at the back of a property or 200 houses.  Obviously, the full complement of ten people does not make a decision on an extension.  Can I assume that in his leading role Mr. Walsh is the person who balances the expertise of the board in make decisions?</p></speech>

We have 55 or 60 planners and a director of planning who identifies cases that are complex and which will require time.  It is a perfect balance.  If we were getting through decisions in five minutes, it would be said the board was not spending enough time in considering the issues involved.  We have to find the perfect balance between having sufficient sharing of views in order that it is not just one person who is making the decision and the need to prioritise and provide the full scale of perspectives needed on large-scale major projects.  It is my job, as chairperson, to convene a meeting of the full board or all of its available members.</p></speech>

Are there cases where other members of the board come to Mr. Walsh with the view that he has not made the correct decision on who is to look at a certain case?  Does another member of the board ever say that perhaps member No. 8 should be involved also?  Do the other members of the board come together and recommend having seven, rather than five, because the other two have a specific interest in X or Y?

We follow formal well developed procedures that have been built up over decades of experience within the organisation.  We are operating in a legal context that is very much evolving.  We have new directives and requirements.  Case law will alter the thresholds or tests.  When legal advice indicates that a case will be challenging, we make a judgment.  Normally when we concede a case, it is remitted to the board, but different decision-makers look at it.  We make sure our processes are fully up to speed.  In these cases that is a better option than going to the courts.  The issue is not cost but time.  The amount of lead-in time required to obtain court dates, even in the commercial courts, stretches out the process.  It probably undermines people's confidence in the system.</p></speech>

How could something end up being &euro;5 million when it was &euro;2.9 million?  Inflation is understandable but if I was the company who had got that tender I would be delighted I had received a tender for &euro;2.9 million and could potentially get &euro;5 million.

We estimate the core development costs to be just over &euro;1 million.  This is what OpenSky is doing.  There are other supports.</p> <p>  I refer to the best laid plans and our best estimates for assessing the future costs.  We had advisers on board and programme managers and people with expertise in this area who said what it should cost.  The big challenge with any kind of project, whether IT or not, is that if it goes over schedule, it will cost more.  We need people for longer and we need to budget for that.</p> <p>  When we started off in 2014, we did not have strategic housing as a function or vacant sites as a function.  We also did not have the developments that have happened in the last five years in terms of the expectation of moving everything to the cloud.  We want to ensure we do not just retain and keep with the old product envisaged in 2014, but that we create a product that is future-proofed for the next five to ten years and that can be agile and adapt to the future requirements.</p></speech>

A point was made earlier about the interface there.  Consider a private citizen who may be in conflict with the local authority.  If I was being brought into a local authority office, I would feel that everyone there might be working against me.  I agree with cost savings, and I am sure there are ways to explore that.  I do not agree, however, and I do not think it is acceptable that a citizen of this country who has an oral hearing to do with a local authority, and where they are on opposite sides, could be put in a position where he or she would have to walk into the opposition's building.  I am not really expecting the witnesses to agree with this, or they can if they want.  I just wanted it on the record.</p></speech>

I did not really understand it until I read a bit about it.  I understand that there has been some success in Louth and in Waterford.  Will the witnesses talk me through how it happens?  When somebody tells the Department there is a boarded-up house in the middle of wherever and nobody has been in it for a long time, what is the procedure then?  I do not want the message to be that properties are being seized and occupied without consideration of the constitutional rights of people.  Once the authority moves into the CPO process, is it a runaway train or can it be pulled back for the citizen?</p></speech>

The CPO powers rest with the planning authority.  The local authorities will monitor their housing stock in their areas, that is, houses they control such as social housing, and they look at the community.  The local authority will hear about vacant properties directly or people may write in and say a building is in terrible state, is not being used and that it should be used.  The local authorities have powers under the CPO legislation around derelict sites to enable them either to force the person who owns or controls the house to fix it up and make use of it, and if that does not happen the authority can compulsorily acquire the house.  There are a number of steps, which the legislation sets out very clearly.  We give everybody involved an opportunity to understand that there are certain requirements and that it can be a safety issue.  If a building is going to fall down or is collecting waste and becoming a health hazard, there is a notice of intention placed by the local authority.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la gets involved only where a person might appeal the compulsory purchase.  If the owner of the building says, for example, that he or she wants to do something with the building, then the appeal goes to the board.</p></speech>

Can that person appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and say he or she wants it, and can the process be halted?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned Louth as an example where they have used the CPO powers a lot to bring properties into proper use.  I am speaking on behalf of the planning authority when I say that the motivation is to get a property back into use, whether it is a property the local authority would control, such as social housing, or whether the building would be used, rented or lived in permanently.  Where the owner of the property gives assurances to the local authority, the local authority would write to the board and indicate that it wants to annul the CPO because it is satisfied that the property will come back into use.  We close off that CPO process then.</p></speech>

If they cannot find the owners, the local authorities affix a notice to the property, which normally alerts the person who is not living in the area because someone might call him or her to say a notice is stuck on the front door of that old building he or she has on a certain street.  That tends to alert the person, who then has the opportunity to fix up the building in its general appearance.  Sometimes if a roof is leaning out into the street, the local authority could carry out the work and charge it against the property.  If that all fails, then it might go to the CPO.  It would be the end of a long road.  There is a lot of work involved, and it is only the minority that end up at this stage.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la would only deal with the cases that are appealed to it.</p> <p>  I am curious to know if any of the appeals the board has had to date were financial institutions, people with what I would call a beneficial interest.  That is a broad question and not about any specific case.</p></speech>

Local authorities are telling me that sometimes the bank lets it go because it is not worth trying to sell it on the open market and they like the CPO process because it gets the property off their hands, they get the current market value, and they do not have to engage a selling agent to sell it.  Through the local authorities I am hearing that some banks just sit back, let it happen, and the cheque will roll in at the end of the CPO process.

That is the other side of it.  I concur completely with Deputy O'Connell's comments about the location for oral hearings and the independence of those.  I understand that other members have expressed their own views about whether the hearings should be held in local authority buildings.  It is not a view of the committee and it is just people giving their own view on it.  I can think of nothing worse than having a hearing in the local authority, because regularly it is people appealing a decision of a local authority.  The board comes down on the decision in the local authority chamber.  It could not be worse and it could not look worse.  It could damage the board to be doing that.  It would be like a person appealing to the social welfare appeals office and the appeal being heard in the local social welfare office.  The person would wonder what chance he or she has going in there and it being the same people again.  It would be different faces, but the same.  It would be very bad practice for An Bord Plean&aacute;la's independence to have anything to do with the inside of a local authority building.  Regularly the board adjudicates on cases from them.  That is my view, and the Deputy had the same view.</p> <p>  With regard to the board, we have dealt with the women thing and the female gender balance-----</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la assigns the various members of its board like whoever runs the business in the courts assigns judges to different cases.  It is a bit like that because An Bord Plean&aacute;la's role is quasi-judicial to an extent, so I see a parallel.  It is not the case that every member of the High Court sits on every case.  I think that when people think about this, they will appreciate the common sense of what is happening there.</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la refers somewhere in its documentation to what it calls normal planning applications.  I ask Mr. Walsh to explain to the public, the listeners, what is normal.  It is a funny choice of word.  Does it mean traditional?</p></speech>

We deal with a range of appeals, from building consents to vacant sites, but a normal planning application that is appealed is what we call a normal planning appeal.  They make up about two thirds of all the numbers we deal with.  Obviously, some cases, such as large-scale housing and strategic infrastructure developments, come into us brand new.  Others concern different types of water cases or building control.  A normal planning appeal is a planning application that has been appealed.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh can send us a note on the next question I want to ask.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspectorate does the work on all decisions, presents the report to the board members and so on.  Will Mr. Walsh tell us, if he has the figure off the top of his head, which he probably does, although I ask him to send it to us anyway, how many decisions of the board accept the inspector's recommendation and how many overrule it?</p></speech>

Generally, around 10% to 12% or 13% of all cases are overturned, that is, the board makes a different decision from the inspector's recommended version.  Half of these cases are generally to grant where an inspector might wish to refuse, and the others might be to refuse where an inspector has recommended a grant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.781" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#FF02100"><p>As Chairman, I want to put to the committee the two sides to this.  It depends on whether one likes the judgment or the decision.  People will have a view as to whether it is right or wrong.  If a person agrees with the inspector and is overruled by the board, people complain bitterly, but then I always take the view that if the inspector's decision is the final word, why is a board needed at all?  A board must have some role.  I would be more concerned if there were an acceptance rate of 100% because I would wonder what control the board had if it were just rubber-stamping everything.  It is important, therefore, that there be a bit of rigour between both.</p></speech>

There is a very strong communication link.  Again, for any board decision where we overturn a recommendation of the inspector, we document the reasons.  We state in our decision that the board does not accept the recommendation because of the following reasons.  We try to explain it, and that becomes a matter of public record.  The other point is that, as the Chairman mentioned, the board has many skills and we are multidisciplinary.  The whole point is that planning is not an exact science.  It is a holistic approach to the question whether something is the right development.  That is where our system, as opposed to other systems whereby there may be just one person who is a planner making appeal decisions, is a more transparent and robust process.</p></speech>

There is a concern that somebody proposing a strategic infrastructure development may sit down with An Bord Plean&aacute;la at length before the proposal comes before the board.  One would wonder whether An Board Plean&aacute;la guided or assisted the applicant or told him or her what he or she had better change.  The acid test here is, out of the decisions on strategic infrastructure over, say, the past five years, what is the percentage granted and the percentage not granted?  Will Mr. Walsh tell us the percentages?  I see that last year there might have been one or two not granted.  Reference is made to an electrical substation.

I refer to what a planning authority would normally consider as part of a planning application.  If the authority receives an application, it is unusual not to have some request for further information, and that can then be assessed and people can see it.  In these situations, however, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has ironed out all that before the application comes in.  What then comes in, having been discussed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the applicant, should be fairly right because the applicant knows there is no further opportunity to put in further information.  In other words, so much of the decision is made before the formal application is lodged.  Again I come to the percentage of cases granted versus those refused.  If a very high percentage of them are granted, having gone through the nine weeks of private consultation behind closed doors before the formal process commences, it is no wonder.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was part of the process, if Mr. Walsh knows what I mean.  He gets my question.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is worth pointing out that the process is there to try to facilitate quick decisions.

When we produce the nine-week opinion at the end of the process, the development team would go away and it may not put in an application.  It might change the application.

It is important for the public to look at this.  I refer to the second appendix, detailing planning appeals received and decided by local authorities.  Everybody here is familiar with some local authority.  The information gives, for each local authority, the number of decisions made, the percentage of planning authority decisions confirmed, the percentage of planning authority decisions granted with conditions changed or added, and the percentage of planning authority decisions reversed.  I put my hands up as I will refer to Laois County Council, which had only 8% of the decisions coming before the board reversed.  That is the best record.  Kerry and Meath had 41% of the decisions rejected, Sligo had 38% of decisions rejected, Waterford city and county had 37% of decisions rejected, and Galway had 36% of decisions rejected.</p> <p>  Some planning authorities seem to be slightly more aligned to the board's thinking than other local authority planning offices.  Dublin is a little below average as well.  The witnesses get the point.  There must be a history of local authorities that have a significant number of decisions rejected year in and year out.  Other authorities tend to be more closely aligned to the board's thinking as it tends to support more of their decisions.  Perhaps the Department has a role in this.  Has there been an examination of these figures?  Has the County and City Management Association been involved?  Should there be uniformity?  It is clear that the board is the one national body that makes consistent decisions, regardless of the origins of an application.  It is clear that some local authorities get it and are fairly closely aligned but several others are operating away, probably hoping that cases do not go before the board.</p><p>If 41% of the decisions that come to the board are overturned, I worry about all those that would have been granted if they had come to it.  I accept that the board states it is a matter for the regulator but does it understand the concern I raise? </p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, one of the core functions of the office of the planning regulator will be to monitor the performance of local planning authorities to ensure they apply consistent standards and operate proper assistance and procedures, etc., in making their determinations.  Where they deviate from the national average, the regulator is empowered to go in and-----</p></speech>

I am sure that if I looked at the chart from five or even ten years ago, most of the same people will be in the same space.  The same will be true in another five years if they are allowed.  It is not good for the system.  In some counties, there is a great deal of aggravation against An Bord Plean&aacute;la because someone may have been prevented from building a house somewhere.  Another local authority would have known that the permission was not going to run in any event and might have got it right from day one.  It does not do the Department good in some communities when it overturns decisions, after people think they got the decision they wanted but somebody objected or whatever.  I have faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la - not every time but usually.</p></speech>

More generally, it potentially undermines confidence in the entire planning system if there is a great divergence between decisions at a local level and by the board.  Different cases can generate different overturn rates.  One of the meetings I had soon after I joined the board was with a delegation from the CCMA to discuss how we could share the experiences the board was having.  It was not about pointing to authorities that might not do everything right but rather to ones that present their information.  The vacant sites levy is an example.  It is new for local authorities and the board and we are constantly refining our processes.  There should be a dialogue, maybe facilitated by the Department or the new regulator, for people to talk and understand why we do something.  I do not mean that the board would tell people but some of the local authorities such as that in County Laois, which are obviously doing something right, could say this is how they approach the board and ask whether it is some best practice that could be shared with the 30 other authorities.  We are very open.  As the Chairman noted, we have a wealth of knowledge and experience in every type of case.  We are there to be tapped for advice.</p></speech>

Inevitably, they will not work.  While they are a great idea, they just do not work in practice.  Let us say a local authority has a population of 100,000.  Over the lifetime of its regional and national plans, it is to grow to 110,000 but the natural increase goes beyond that without a new house being built.  What happens when the local authority approaches the board?  Does it examine the current population?  I know that it has the latest CSO figures but I worry that if people were to implement the plans they had drawn up, they would be obliged to say the application cannot be granted because it has exceeded the permitted population figures.  How does the board deal with that?</p></speech>

It is a mapped information system of all applications that have come before the board, which allows us to see the data around an area.  To return to the question on core strategies and assigned numbers, that is in the development plan and the board would very much have regard to it.  The challenge, as other Deputies have highlighted, is that until such time as the regional plans and the updated local plans are in place with new figures, we are working off development plans that might be outdated.</p></speech>

I quote him every time anybody is asked for anything.</p> <p>  On the issue of wind farm guidelines, we operate on old, out-of-date ones.  We have been told for years that new ones are expected and that it is a matter for the Department but I do not understand it.  When people started building wind turbines, they normally had a height of 50 m, but they are now 180 m and we still have the same setbacks.  The Department is negligent - that is the most polite word.  The guidelines are utterly not fit for purpose.  They are not suitable for the scale of the structures coming through the system.  They were designed for a system when wind turbines were much smaller than they are now.  I have made my point.  The Department should publish new guidelines.  I am tired of asking parliamentary questions.  </p> <p>  The board is doing a review and I acknowledge that there was an event in Belgium.  I attended it several times and our guests will have seen my name in the debates.  The World Health Organization, WHO, issued new guidelines recently, which has delayed the review even further.  When an appeal from a wind farm is received, there are WHO guidelines on setback distance, flicker and whatever but the statutory guidelines from the Department are way behind the WHO guidelines.  Which does the board work off?  Does it work off those given by the Department, knowing they are not the best ones for sustainable development and that they are not in line with the WHO?</p></speech>

We consider applications in light of the guidelines.  Obviously, we have regard to national energy policy and legislation as well as planning guidance and international and WHO standards.  In terms of legal effect, the WHO standards are best practice guidelines.  We are aware of them and take into account other elements which support and protect citizens as well as the baseline from the 2005 guidelines.</p></speech>

It is good to have such interest in our committee discussions and deliberations.  I am conscious that on the previous occasion I came before the committee we were very tight on time and I am glad to be back; I hope to be able to address any questions members might have.  I thank the committee for the invitation to come before it this afternoon.  I am keen to update members on developments at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which most recently met on 15 July, and to discuss other foreign policy issues.  There was also a meeting in New York of the EU Ministers who were there, which was the vast majority of them.</p> <p>  The Department has provided an information note to the committee on the range of issues the Foreign Affairs Council has considered in the nine months since we last met.  In order to maximise the time available for discussion, I will address the major themes of the Council&rsquo;s discussions in my opening remarks and we can have a broader discussion afterwards on whatever committee members would like.</p> <p>  As committee members know, the Foreign Affairs Council frequently discusses Middle East issues.  As part of our commitment to work more closely with the region, a meeting of EU Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs and the League of Arab States took place in February.  It prepared the first ever EU-League of Arab States summit later that month.  I made strong statements on Syria and Yemen, stressing that any refugee returns to Syria should be voluntary.</p> <p>  In February, Ministers discussed the worsening humanitarian and security situation in Syria.  We were clear that any refugee returns must be voluntary, and should only take place when conditions are right and safe.  We expressed support for the UN special envoy, Mr. Geir Pedersen, and also discussed preparations for the Syria conference in March, where Ireland pledged &euro;25 million, bringing the total amount of our humanitarian assistance to Syria since 2012 to more than &euro;143 million.  I am encouraged that in recent days there has been agreement to establish a constitutional committee for Syria.  I hope this is a first step towards an inclusive political settlement, for which so many people yearn.</p> <p>  Also in February, we adopted Council conclusions on Yemen, reiterating our support for the implementation of the Stockholm agreement and urging agreement with the UN-led process.  In March, we discussed ways to support the UN special envoy and to maintain the EU's commitment in delivering humanitarian aid.  Progress since then on the implementation of the Stockholm agreement has been disappointing.  I hope that recent indications that the Houthis may consider a ceasefire can be built on.  We will continue to support UN efforts to reach a political solution.  There has been more than enough tragedy in Yemen to date.</p> <p>  I know the situation in Libya is of concern to many committee members, particularly Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan who has raised it with me a number of times in the D&aacute;il.  At the May Foreign Affairs Council, we discussed recent developments in Libya, including the fighting around Tripoli, with the UN Special Representative for Libya, Mr. Ghassan Salam&eacute;.  I am very clear that there is no military solution to this crisis.  We urged all parties to re-commit to the UN-facilitated political dialogue, and called for an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians, including migrants and refugees.</p> <p>  At the March Foreign Affairs Council, I called for a continuation of the full mandate of Operation Sophia to allow time for the outstanding issues around disembarkation to be addressed without disruption to the critical humanitarian work of the mission in which the Naval Service has been very involved.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to get full agreement on this issue, in which I have personally invested a great deal of time and effort, but we did ensure the operation will continue and that its mandate will remain under review so as to be able to respond to any changing circumstances.  Ireland will continue to work towards a resolution of outstanding issues to allow for a resumption of deployment of naval assets in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>  We must act together to find European-wide solutions to address the issues of migration.  Member states must play their part in burden-sharing and helping to relieve pressure on front-line member states.  We need to find a consensus based on solidarity, responsibility and international law.  Addressing the migration crisis requires deeper political, economic and development relationships between the EU and our partners, particularly in Africa.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, attended the June Foreign Affairs Council, where Ministers had a working lunch with the Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ayman Safadi.  The discussion focused on regional issues, including Iran's negative influence in the region, the Middle East peace process and hosting Syrian refugees.</p> <p>  At the July Foreign Affairs Council, we discussed Iran again.  I am deeply concerned about Iran's steps away from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, nuclear agreement and the recent escalation of tensions in the region following an attack on Saudi Arabia on 14 September.  The EU remains committed to maintaining the JCPOA and we urge Iran to return to full compliance without delay.  Last week, I raised this directly with Iran at a meeting with its President and Minister with responsibility for foreign affairs in New York.  The EU has worked very hard politically to try to protect the JCPOA.  The US Administration takes a very different view on the agreement.  It makes it much more difficult for the EU to maintain that political position if Iran deliberately moves away from the conditions and obligations under that agreement.</p><p>It is important to say that because we are trying to protect and maintain an agreement.  From a compliance perspective, if Iran moves away from what it has committed to, the EU position will become more difficult.  It is important to be direct and honest about that.  </p><p> In July, we also discussed the situation in Iraq.  We adopted Council conclusions on the EU&rsquo;s Iraq strategy and stressed our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and for economic, political and security sector reform.</p><p> In April, Council conclusions were adopted on Afghanistan.  Ireland supports an Afghan led and owned peace process, with a constructive role played by international actors and the meaningful participation of women in particular.  Along with our EU partners, we are also working to ensure that the humanitarian situation in the country is not neglected.  We encourage all parties to the conflict to come together and negotiate for a sustainable peace.</p><p> In January 2019, the first EU-African Union ministerial level meeting took place.  Ministers focused on implementing the memorandum of understanding on peace, security and governance and on President Juncker&rsquo;s initiative, the alliance for sustainable investments and jobs, which seeks to boost private sector engagement, increase trade and enhance job creation.  The Council conclusions adopted underlined the importance of the EU&rsquo;s strategic partnership with Africa.  This is something in which I am really interested.  It may be an interesting issue for the committee to explore in the context of both the next money market fund policy and EU neighbourhood policy.  </p><p> The political and institutional structures between the EU and the African Union are hopelessly inadequate.  The African continent will have an additional 1 billion people on it within the next 25 years.  Many of the partner countries with which we work in respect of development face what are, quite frankly, impossible challenges.  To simply stand still in respect of unemployment statistics, Ethiopia will need to create 2 million jobs each year.  Across the border in Kenya, 1 million jobs will need to be created each year.  It will simply not be possible to do this in a sustainable or manageable manner if we are not working in partnership and helping the continent of Africa, which is very close to us geographically, to cope with the enormous changes it is facing.  It is a massive challenge from the perspectives of climate change, food and water security, conflict and governance, and migration.  These are all issues in which the EU needs to be central in finding solutions.  Otherwise, we will be central to the challenges and problems that flow from the failure to find a solution.  That point is not lost on President Juncker, who has highlighted this issue as a priority for the EU in the years ahead.  Ireland can certainly contribute a great deal to that debate.</p><p> At the February meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, on the Horn of Africa, I emphasised that we must act in a co-ordinated manner to strengthen democratic governance and inclusive economic growth in that region.  I welcomed the peace process between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and EU support to both sides to institutionalise and consolidate that new relationship.   </p><p> At the June meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland strongly supported the EU&rsquo;s statement on Sudan and the robust leadership shown by the African Union and Ethiopia in their joint efforts to resolve the crisis there.  I am very encouraged by the civilian-led transition agreed in September, which we hope will pave the way for peace, security and economic growth in Sudan.</p><p> The Sahel was discussed at the May meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  This meeting included discussions with the G5 Sahel countries.  The EU has prioritised security, humanitarian and development issues across the region.  France has been a real leader in these efforts.  We need to focus on tackling the root causes of conflict, migration and poverty, while maintaining focus on governance and human rights.   A more holistic response to issues affecting the region is required.  The High Representative co-chaired the fifth EU-G5 Sahel ministerial meeting in July. </p><p> This year marked the tenth anniversary of the eastern partnership.  At the April meeting of the Council, we discussed implementation of its reform programme, 20 Deliverables for 2020, and the future of the partnership post-2020.  At the ministerial meeting in May, my EU colleagues and I sent a strong signal of our continuing commitment to the eastern partnership and to the principles of inclusivity and differentiation.</p><p> At the March meeting, discussions on Moldova focused on the February parliamentary elections there.  The High Representative described the elections as competitive, with fundamental rights respected, but with some shortcomings.  While coalition talks were unsuccessful for several months, a coalition government was formed on 8 June between the pro-EU ACUM party bloc and the pro-Russia Party of Socialists of President Igor Dodon.  The EU is ready to work with the Government of the Republic of Moldova on the basis of a mutual commitment to reforms and the principles enshrined in our association agreement.</p><p> At the February meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, we expressed our continued solidarity with Ukraine on the fifth anniversary of the Maidan.  In addition to providing humanitarian assistance and supporting conflict resolution efforts, we will continue to support Ukraine&rsquo;s reform agenda and to increase EU support for the Azov Sea region which, as members will know, has been a source of great tension in recent months.</p><p> In January, Ministers discussed the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the ten member states of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN.  Following the Council meeting, I attended the 22nd EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting where we discussed ways to enhance co-operation, particularly on fair trade, human rights, sustainable development and climate change. </p><p> At the April meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, we discussed EU-China relations.  We agreed on the need to balance an open and constructive relationship with remaining firm in pursuit of EU values and interests.  The EU-China summit which took place following the meeting of the Council demonstrated the success of this approach.  We must engage China in supporting the existing rules-based international order and multilateral institutions, while remaining clear on the need for universal standards and agreed rules and practices to be respected.  Consensus among EU partners is essential in delivering this approach.  As ever, the EU is much stronger when it speaks with one voice.</p><p> The current crisis in Venezuela has been discussed at successive meetings of the Council this year and we received regular updates on the progress of the international contact group, ICG.  At the May meeting, I voiced support for the ICG, stressed the need for continued engagement, and welcomed progress made on the humanitarian track of the ICG.  In July, we reiterated our support for the Oslo talks process between the Maduro Administration and the opposition.  While these talks, which are being held in Barbados but run by Norway, are now stalled, Ireland will continue to encourage both sides to engage in good faith in an inclusive, serious and results orientated way.  We also support EU efforts to achieve a peaceful electoral path as a way out of the current crisis.  Obviously, there are no military solutions to that particular conflict.</p><p> The Council continues to monitor the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s global strategy, which commits us to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  In June, High Representative Mogherini presented a report assessing three years of the global strategy, which outlines achievements across all five strands: security and defence; resilience; the integrated approach to conflicts and crises; regional co-operative orders; and global governance.  Addressing the challenges outlined in the strategy requires united, consistent and effective action by the EU.  At the Council meeting in June, Ministers held a further discussion about ways to improve the effectiveness of the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy.  We exchanged views on how to enhance our unity, cohesion and co-ordination.</p><p> The Foreign Affairs Council also addressed implementation of the EU joint action plan on disinformation, adopted last December, which aims to improve the detection and analysis of disinformation, strengthen co-operation, raise awareness and increase resilience.  The EU has established a rapid alert system for national points of contact which facilitates information-sharing.</p><p>A mapping exercise has also been conducted to assess the institutional capacity of member states.  A network of fact-checkers and media monitors is being developed.  We are trying to tighten our systems because, whether it is hybrid warfare or deliberate disinformation for other political reasons, every open economy and society is vulnerable.  The EU is taking a much more collective approach where that information is shared in a much more co-ordinated and structured way.</p><p> An important cross-cutting aspect of the work of the Council is the centrality of the multilateral system in addressing global challenges.  Ireland is a candidate for the UN Security Council for 2021-22.  I spent much of last week at the UN General Assembly promoting Ireland&rsquo;s candidature and highlighting our global contributions to peace and security, human rights and development.  That statement is addressed to the ambassadors in the Gallery whose support I hope we will have.</p><p> There is a range of other issues to which I have not referred.  Obviously, if members wish to ask me anything on the big issue of the day, Brexit, I will certainly not duck the issue.  This is such a broad brief that we could speak about any country in the world at this meeting.  Whatever direction the committee wants to take in questioning, I will try to be as open and responsive as I can be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1008" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019100300002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating me, as I will be debating legislation in the Chamber soon.</p> <p>  What Boris Johnson presented to the European Commission as a workable alternative to the backstop yesterday amounts to a dangerous and reckless proposition that many of us would say plays fast and loose with the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government is offering an all-Ireland regulatory zone for all goods but that there would be customs checks on the island.  All these arrangements are dependent on the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly in an opt-in, opt-out vote.  What is the Government&rsquo;s view of this?  Does the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade agree that these proposals, as framed, are not acceptable?  One concern many of us have expressed, as have commentators, is that these proposals effectively give the DUP a veto through an abuse of the petition of concern against the backstop.  Is that one of the concerns the Government has?  I did not hear such concern in any commentary coming from the Government.</p> <p>  Considering the majority of people in the North voted to remain, there is a view among pro-remain parties that they are being dragged out against their will.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on that?  Has the T&aacute;naiste told his European counterparts there needs to be a discussion on this?  Is he concerned that these are not serious proposals and are more about the next election in the UK?  Is this about Boris Johnson trying to bring his own party and the Brexit Party together to fight an election in England on the basis that the European Union has turned down what he considers a reasonable offer?  We have said all along that the backstop, or any alternative to it, cannot be time limited in any way.  Yet, again, this seems to be what the British Government and Boris Johnson are proposing.</p> <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe that Mr. Johnson wants a deal, that this is an opening gambit or it is about the next election?  Over the past couple of days, we saw the arrival of customs vehicles in Dundalk.  Is that coincidental?  Is the Government preparing for customs checks in the Border region?  This sent a worrying message to many people.  No one wants a hard border.  We are all on the same page that we want to ensure there is no hard border on the island.  We want to see the all-Ireland economy and the Good Friday Agreement protected.  It would be useful to send out a signal from here as to what the Government's thinking is on this proposal.</p> <p>  The Palestine situation was not discussed at the Council meetings.  We know that Israel is in a political stalemate after its latest election as its parties try to form a government.  We are concerned about the rhetoric used during the recent election campaign.  The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he plans to illegally annexe 30% of the occupied territories in the West Bank and Palestine.  Again, we do not know whether he will remain as Israeli Prime Minister for much longer.  There might be another election.  Has the T&aacute;naiste any concerns about this?  Was this call from Benjamin Netanyahu just simply electioneering?  Is what he is saying in public what we already know, namely, that he wants to destroy any attempt at a two-state solution and deepen Israeli apartheid rule in Palestine?  Since Mr. Netanyahu became Israeli Prime Minister, we have seen a significant increase in illegal settlements.  Some of us believe the Government could do more in response to these worrying developments.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline what the Government has done about these developments?  A D&aacute;il motion was passed on the recognition of the state of Palestine.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe the Government should move on this?  Has he changed his view on the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 which would make trade with illegal settlements a criminal offence in Ireland?</p> <p>  The war in Syria was mentioned but Turkey's involvement was not discussed.  I am concerned about Turkey's military invasion of northern Syria and its attempted land grab there.  Many see it as a lifeline being thrown to ISIS in that region.  Kurdish communities in northern Syria are extremely fearful of the invading Turkish army.  What is the Government's view about these illegal actions of a NATO army?  What is the view of other EU member states?  Was this discussed at the Council meeting?</p> <p>  We all agree the war in Yemen is horrific and getting worse.  We have seen the emaciated bodies of starving children there.  Were European military exports to Saudi Arabia discussed?  Did the Government push for an EU embargo on the sales of military goods to Saudi Arabia, considering the high probability that many of these weapons will be used to commit war crimes in this conflict?</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said the migration issue was discussed.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, 1,000 people have died in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe in 2019 so far.  The UNHCR is urgently calling for an increase in search and rescue capacity, including return of European Union state vessels to operations in the Mediterranean, as well as acknowledgement of the crucial role of NGO boats in the region.  Does the Government agree with this?</p><p>What is its view on that?  I am aware some states are opposed to it.  In terms of the humanitarian ships that picked up so many refugees and migrants from rafts, does the T&aacute;naiste believe there is a role for us, as Europeans, to try to save as many lives as possible in that regard?</p><p> Will the T&aacute;naiste outline whether we support the new proposals from Germany, France, Italy and Malta regarding the so-called fast-track system for getting people off boats in trouble in the Mediterranean and distributing people on board who want to seek asylum among countries willing to take them?  What is the Irish view on this migration issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019100300002#E00200"><p>I am conscious there are other members here as well but the Deputy has asked many good questions.  I know he has to leave shortly to return to the House, so I will try to give him some answers.  On the proposals that have come from the British Government in the past 24 hours, the Deputy asked if I believed this is a serious effort to get a deal.  I believe it is a serious effort.  If he is asking me if this proposal will be the basis of a deal, I do not think it will but there are some good things in it and it is important to recognise that.  We have to make a judgment call as to whether we believe the British Government is serious about getting a deal or whether this is simply about positioning for a general election with a view to a blame game if there is not a deal.  Our judgment is that the British Government does want to get a deal.  We want to work to help it get a deal, obviously through the Barnier task force, which is where the negotiation takes place.</p> <p>  In terms of the proposals, the positives in the proposal are that there is now a clear commitment from the UK to maintain full alignment on the island of Ireland for goods and agrifood products that effectively reduces the need for checks in certain areas.  That is very positive and we need to recognise that.  It is consistent with much of what the backstop was committed to achieving.</p> <p>  Where I believe there are difficulties is in respect of the customs element of the proposal.  If Northern Ireland is in a different customs union from the rest of the island of Ireland, it is difficult to see how customs checks can be avoided.  I understand that the British Prime Minister said in Westminster today that under no circumstances will there be any physical customs checks on the island of Ireland from its proposal.  It is difficult to see how those two things marry in terms of consistency, but we have to allow a process of discussion and negotiation to take place in the Barnier task force, which is now forensically looking at the paper, and the legal document that comes with it, to see whether it is legally operable.  However, they have already given an indication that in their view the customs proposals are very problematic and do not deliver the same outcome as the backstop, which effectively ensured that there was full alignment, both in terms of the Single Market as well as customs, on the island of Ireland.  It is important for us to be respectful but also clear that while these proposals are a step in the right direction, they will need to evolve further if there is to be a basis for agreement.</p> <p>  The other element the Deputy raised, which I believe is also a concern, is how we accommodate an Executive in Northern Ireland in terms of a consultative role around whatever mechanisms are agreed to prevent physical Border infrastructure re-emerging.  There is a consultative role already factored in to the withdrawal agreement and the Irish and Northern Ireland protocol as part of the backstop mechanism that had been agreed.  If there was future change in terms of EU regulation that impacted on Northern Ireland, there was, through the implementation of the backstop, a consultative role for a Northern Ireland Assembly in that regard.  What Boris Johnson is proposing is to go way beyond that and essentially give the Northern Ireland Assembly the power to opt in or not to the arrangements that are being proposed.  Obviously, we have to scrutinise what he means by that.  On initial reading, it would suggest that that means that a single party or a minority of people in the Assembly could effectively block the implementation of these proposals.  That is not something we can support under any circumstances.  We cannot have a situation where a minority of people are imposing a future on the majority of people through a blocking mechanism.  That simply will not work and it certainly is not consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  It is important that we are honest and upfront about that.  That is something on which we are in close contact with the task force because to a certain extent they rely on us in terms of understanding how the systems work within an Assembly and an Executive and issues around the use of petition of concern and so on.  While it is an important tool, it could potentially be used as a blocking mechanism for a minority, which would then impose a set of conditions on a majority of people who do not want that.  There is already tension in Northern Ireland because the majority of people did not want to leave the European Union.  However, the idea that the solutions we are putting in place to mitigate against the damage that has been caused by Brexit for Northern Ireland, and for the island of Ireland as a whole, could be blocked by a minority as well will not be the basis of a deal.</p> <p>  We are open to looking at how a role for an Assembly in Northern Ireland - people who are elected and representing people from all communities in Northern Ireland - can be factored in to any proposals.  We are happy to work on those issues, but as we read it today, the proposal from the British Prime Minister, which has been confirmed, unhelpfully, by a number of politicians, seems to suggest that a minority can effectively block the imposition of proposals in the future, which I do not believe will work.</p> <p>  In summary, we are responding cautiously to this proposal.  We believe it is serious.  We believe it is a step in the right direction to try to get a deal, but we believe there are some elements of it that will need to evolve significantly if they are to be the basis for an agreement in the next week or so.  That is the timeline we are on.  That seriousness is also reflected in the task force, in President Juncker's office.  We all want to try to get a deal.  We all want to work with the British Prime Minister and his team, but we have to be honest also and not pretend or get carried away in terms of spin.  There is still a lot of negotiation and work to do and the proposal currently on the table from the British Government will not be the basis of a deal in itself.  It will need to evolve, particularly on the customs area, and in the other area I mentioned relating to consultation and consent.</p> <p>  In terms of Israel and Palestine, as the Deputy is aware, I am personally very interested in this issue.  I spoke a lot about it with different partners and colleagues in New York, especially with the Arab League, but also with many others.  There is much political uncertainty in Israel.  Following a second general election, there does not seem to be the ability yet to be able to put a government together.  It is very difficult to bring forward any new proposals unless there is an Israeli government in place.  Some of the commitments that were made in the heat of an election were very unfortunate.  I was quite vocal at the time in terms of criticising those commitments.</p><p>I believe they propose something that is illegal and would be very strongly rejected by the international community.  The idea that Israel would simply annex large parts of the West Bank, making a two-state solution with two viable future states virtually impossible, is one at which the international community expresses very strong concern.  I contributed to that.  Some people dismissed those commitments as electioneering.  I do not think we should simply dismiss them as that.  There must be a very strong signal from the international community that any future Israeli government would not have the support of the international community, or at least the majority thereof, in taking that course of action.  My view is that the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 is not legally sound legislation and we should not be pursuing it.  That does not mean that The Government and I will not continue to be vocal on the Middle East peace process; we will.  We will insist on a two-state solution as any final outcome, offering very consistent criticism of the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and a series of other issues as well.</p><p> I will read from my notes on Turkey's involvement in Syria.  Turkey has borne a very heavy burden from the Syrian conflict, including hosting millions of refugees as well as a risk of a spillover of violence.  Its concern about the conflict on its southern border is understandable.  I have met the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey on several occasions and I have raised some of these issues with him.  However, our messages to Turkey on Syria have emphasised our concern for the protection of civilians and have urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further.  Civilians on both sides of the border, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds, are all entitled to protection and safety.</p><p> On Yemen and Saudi Arabia, there is no consensus on an arms embargo of Saudi Arabia at EU level, but the issue has been raised.  Such decisions require the agreement of everybody at EU level.  Irish efforts have concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of agreements that EU member states have already signed.  These include the export control regimes and the implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty, which has been signed and ratified by all member states.  These obligations require states to assess the potential that arms exports could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law and to consider measures to mitigate the risk of these violations.  I understand that several EU member states have said they will not export arms to Saudi Arabia until the war in Yemen is over.  That has been an ongoing discussion.</p><p> Regarding the Mediterranean-----</p></speech>

The EU has spent a significant amount of money supporting aid efforts to try to do that.  It is inexcusable knowingly to allow children, or anyone for that matter, to starve and to cut off supply routes for humanitarian assistance.  However, this is complicated.  It pertains to access to some ports where there are serious security issues and ongoing conflict.  That is why we are so committed to supporting efforts for a political solution and the maintenance of a ceasefire so that we can access many of very vulnerable communities.  The only show in town has been the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement.  We want to continue to support efforts in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding the Mediterranean, Ireland was not involved in a meeting that took place in Malta on 23 September, which was organised by the Maltese Government and attended by Maltese, French, German and Italian interior ministers as well as the EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship and the Finnish EU Presidency.  We were absent because we were in New York.  Otherwise I probably would have been there.  However, we welcome such efforts to find a consensus among member states on the disembarkation and relocation of migrants arriving in the EU.  Ireland has consistently called for all EU states to play their part in burden sharing and for more sustainable solutions to be found to these issues.</p> <p>  Just in case anybody does not know how this works at the moment, I will outline the situation in recent months, though things are starting to change now.  If a ship, whether state-owned or, more commonly, NGO-owned, had migrants on board and was able to access a port in Malta, Italy or somewhere else, there would be a phone call around different member states to see whether they would take some of those refugees voluntarily.  That is normally the condition of allowing that ship to disembark.  That is totally understandable.  Consider a minister in Malta, a small island where potentially thousands of migrants might disembark.  Unless such an official knows his or her government can manage and other member states will help share that burden, it is very difficult to allow a ship in, both politically and in pragmatic terms.  The previous Italian Government took a very hard line on this issue.  The humanitarian element of Operation Sophia effectively collapsed because of the inability to disembark.  That is why the remit changed.</p> <p>  On this issue I have been very critical of the EU and of the inability to get an agreement between all member states on burden sharing, even if that burden sharing meant that some states contribute to financing solutions and others are willing to take migrants.  If that kind of pragmatism is needed to get a deal, then we need to consider it.  We are certainly supportive of the efforts of France, Germany and others to arrive at a solidarity-based approach, which will make it a lot easier for a new Italian government, a Maltese government or other Mediterranean countries such as Spain, France, Greece etc. to make the political decisions around disembarkation.  That is our view.  We are and have been very interested in this issue.  Obviously that is because we have a moral obligation to be so, but it is also because Irish Naval Service ships have taken about 14,000 people out of the sea in the Mediterranean.  That is a lot of people.  Many of them were children.  We have seen some tragedy this year, but we cannot base a policy on knowingly allowing people to drown in the Mediterranean when we have the capacity to rescue them.</p> <p>  There are other issues we need to factor in.  We need to make sure we are not creating a pull factor.  I know that sounds crude, but there were legitimate concerns that there were communications between people in Libya who were sending people to sea and people who were waiting to receive them.  We need to make sure we are not contributing to the problem.  At the same time, we need to ensure a real search and rescue capacity so that we do not knowingly allow the tragedy of which we have seen too much.  That is our view.</p><p>I hope the efforts taking place at present, led by France, Germany and others, can deliver a more structured and streamlined system that can allow disembarkation to happen in a more managed and controlled way, as opposed to crisis by crisis calls to try to get countries to take migrants voluntarily so disembarkation can occur.  As it happens, Ireland has quietly and voluntarily taken a number of migrants in those circumstances, usually five, ten or 15, to try to make a contribution to a collective effort to deal with some very difficult issues.</p></speech>

I was in Iveagh House yesterday where there were positive events to learn about overseas development assistance, ODA.  It was good to see a comment in one of the opening speeches in the book, that the Overseas Development Institute has recognised Ireland as the most effective donor in reaching those in extreme poverty.  That is very positive.  The Minister referred to climate change causing displacement.  We are aware of that, but there is another displacement that is not on the agenda where it should be, which is the displacement that arises from multinationals, transnationals and the land grabs that are taking place.  I returned from Iveagh House yesterday to chair a meeting for Tr&oacute;caire in the audiovisual room.  Abelino Chub Caal, a human rights defender from Guatemala who was recently released from prison after serving a few years for defending his community, was present.  He was in Ireland to receive the &Oacute;scar Romero Award.  We also had Naw Pe Tha Law from Myanmar.  The common denominator is that they are trying to protect the land from transnational and multinational companies that have <i>carte blanche </i>to do what they like.</p><p>That brings me to one of my favourite topics, business and human rights, our national plan and the UN plan.  I was taken aback to learn that Ireland is not keen to agree to a legally binding plan.  Unless it is legally binding, these corporations will be able to do what they like in countries in South America and Africa.  The EU's private sector is becoming more involved in Africa.  It is seen as a way to help Africa, as the Minister said.  There is a big push on trade with China, and there is no need to mention some of the working conditions there.  I attended the recent launch of a report by Church in Chains and it was appalling to learn about what is happening there.  Last week, Senator Lawless and I had an interesting discussion with the Shura Council from Saudi Arabia about how migrants are treated in Middle Eastern countries.  All of that brings me to my first question.  Why is Ireland not supporting a legally binding UN treaty on business and human rights?</p><p>Second, I have attended some of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, meetings that have been held and there is no doubt that there is a growing militarisation agenda in Europe.  I partly understand it for some countries, particularly the Baltic countries and countries in eastern Europe.  Our committee visited Georgia so we see the fear that exists of further aggression by Russia.  However, I do not believe militarisation is the answer in these situations.  That leads me to continuing the exchange we had on the European peace facility.  There are questions about that.  It is fine in theory, but transparency and accountability are not obvious so there are concerns about that.  Will proposals go to national parliaments or, for example, to our committee?  Is there a guarantee that peace-building alternatives will be considered first?  Do we know that the list of eligible equipment will exclude lethal weapons?</p><p>Deputy Crowe mentioned Palestine.  I want to deal with another angle, the national state law, which is that the country is Jewish and democratic.  How can the rights of Palestinian people be recognised if that is what the Government is saying about the state?  I am aware of the T&aacute;naiste's interest in this and the procedure he is following.  He said that things are said in the heat of an election.  However, settlements are continuing outside the heat of an election.  He has seen this and so have I.  I have been there.  The Green Line is gone.  We are doing a disservice and being disrespectful to the Palestinian people in continuing to talk about the two-state solution when everybody knows that it is not viable.  It is becoming less and less viable as more settlements are built.</p><p>My final question is on our humanitarian assistance to Syria.  How is that disbursed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1016" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019100300002#G00300"><p>It was very encouraging that ODI ranked Ireland number one for our development assistance programme in terms of getting money to the least well-off or the people furthest behind, to use the sustainable development goal, SDG, term.  We can do more, but it is good to see that the programme is working.</p> <p>  I must correct the Deputy on multinationals.  We are not opposing a legally binding treaty.  Ireland is open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty to regulate the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises, provided it covers all economic operators, be they multinationals or domestic companies.  Any such instrument should reflect essential human rights principles.  It should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of states under existing international human rights law to protect against human rights violations.  Any new initiative should build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, guidelines for multinational enterprises and the International Labour Organization, ILO, tripartite declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy.  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, a legally binding instrument must enjoy broad support among UN member states.  This will not work if only a handful of countries do it, nor will it work unless they put pressure on others to do the same.  There must be a large coalition of countries to do this together if it is going to effective.  Otherwise, certain business activity will move away from countries that are trying to do the right thing into other countries.  We want to try to reward countries for doing the right thing and get a consensus-based approach.  Ireland has no issue with trying to work towards a legally binding instrument that would be effective.</p> <p>  The European peace facility, EPF, is still a proposal at this stage.  It was presented by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, last year.  It is receiving a technical examination at official level in Brussels, including in the context of the ongoing multi-annual financial framework, MFF, process.  The EPF proposes to bring together existing financial instruments - the Athena mechanism for the funding of CSDP operations and the African peace facility supporting the African Union and peacekeeping.  It proposes to increase the funding for these instruments.  It also proposes to broaden the EU's capacity to provide military assistance to prevent conflict, preserve peace and strengthen international security in accordance with the objectives of the UN external action set out in Article 212 of the Treaty on European Union.</p> <p>  In simple terms, many parts of the world are nasty places where governance is not working and warlords dominate and make decisions.  The EU has to intervene sometimes to try to support state actors who are trying to do the right thing.  Somalia is a good example of that.  It is a government that is trying to change Somalia to move away from violence, intimidation and terrorism.  There is a peacekeeping force there.  While reform is needed over time, it is essential to maintain peace and stability.  The EU has a big part in funding that.  Likewise in terms of Athena, it was essentially an anti-piracy initiative on the shores of Somalia where EU interventions and funding have made a positive impact on reducing and undermining the capacity for piracy.  That has allowed shipping to take place in a much safer zone than was previously the case.</p> <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying with regard to the focus of the EU needing to be on peace, stability, supporting peace, responsible development, partnership and so forth, but there are also times when we must help with the security infrastructure of a state.</p><p>If we get that wrong, it could contribute to the problem but there is a reason we have peacekeepers in different parts of the world.  That is essentially the UN version of this.  Irish peacekeepers, who are trained soldiers, on the Golan Heights and in southern Lebanon and Mali are making a positive contribution to peace but they carry arms.  I also think the EU must have the capacity to be able to fund interventions, partnerships and programmes that are about the more difficult side of conflict prevention and sometimes conflict intervention to try to bring about stability and peace.  I accept that this is a difficult area and there should be scrutiny of how and where we spend money to make sure we are contributing to peace and not conflict.  Having been to many of these regions, as has the Deputy, I can see that sometimes intervention is the only course of action to protect vulnerable and exposed people from conflict and that costs money and requires co-ordination, training and co-operation.  The EU is trying to create a more efficient and effective collective response to that.  That is my understanding of the European peace facility.</p><p> I think we are doing a disservice to the Palestinians by giving up on a two-state solution.  I do not believe a two-state solution is no longer viable.  I think the two-state solution is still viable and the international community must insist on that as the outcome of any future peace negotiations.  If we give up on that, we are essentially talking about some kind of one-state solution where Palestinians continue to be controlled in an occupied territory and I do not believe we will ever have peace and stability if this is the outcome.  That is my view.  The Deputy can have a different view.  This is why we have been and continue to be so critical of expanding settlements.  They are illegal.  They are essentially pouring concrete on somebody else's land and we will continue to criticise that.  The more concrete that is poured on Palestinian land, the more difficult it is to put together proposals for a viable two-state solution.  This is why expanding settlements on somebody else's territory because one happens to be the occupier is not only illegal but makes a future peace agreement more difficult because of the complexity of that given the scale of many of the settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.  Ireland wants to be a friend to Israel and Palestine and Palestinians but the past two years have constituted a very negative period for that relationship and the hopes and aspirations of Palestinians in particular, which is something Ireland consistently speaks out on.  I think I have answered the question.</p></speech>

Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;140 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict in Syria and the region, which is our largest ever response to any single crisis.  In March 2019, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million to Syria and the region for this year.  To date, we have disbursed over &euro;21 million of this amount.  This includes support within Syria and support to countries in the region, in particular, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, which host very large numbers of refugees.  I have been to some of those refugee camps, some of which are extraordinary in scale.  Our 2019 funding includes a contribution of &euro;2.5 million-----</p></speech>

I am about to tell the Deputy where the money has gone.  The 2019 funding includes a contribution of &euro;2.5 million to the UN Turkey humanitarian fund for the Syrian response, which supports the emergency cross-border response to the current humanitarian situation in north west Syria.  Ireland also supports the EU's humanitarian response to Syria through its annual contributions to the UN institutions.  In total, the EU has mobilised almost &euro;17 billion since 2012 for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt.  This figure includes a 2019 pledge of &euro;2.57 billion from the EU budget.  Ireland's support is channelled through a range of partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent movement.  Since 2012, 45 rapid response corps members have been deployed.  That is where our funding goes.</p></speech>

I will touch on some matters that have not been raised in great detail.  Regarding the migrant crisis, which is a significant challenge for Europe and individual EU member states, in his opening statement, the T&aacute;naiste said we need to find a consensus based on solidarity and responsibility and that addressing the migrant crisis requires deeper political, economic and development relations between the EU and our partners, particularly in Africa.  He alluded to population growth in Africa.  I will preface my question by referring to some of the scenes we witnessed in our own country with regard to attacks on and opposition to direct provision centres.  We can be proud of our humanitarian track record and our approach to dealing with vulnerable people and those who have had to flee their countries of origin.  My party and I are extremely concerned about some of the attacks on venues and places that were to have operated as direct provision centres.  In particular, I am concerned that there is a sinister infiltration of communities by people with ulterior motives.  I respect and defend any community's right to articulate concerns around service provisions.  That is fair enough.  Their fears may not always be to the extent that is being articulated.  We have seen how when direct provision centres were rolled out in some communities, those fears were not found to be of the scale or level expressed heretofore.  We are now a multicultural country.  We have a large non-Irish and non-European population that contributes hugely to our society and economy.  We must only look at the most recent local elections where a number of people who emigrated to this country were elected to positions in local government, which is positive.  We had some in my own party in Limerick while the T&aacute;naiste's party and others also have them.  I welcome that because it is a positive change.  I am couching that in terms of the migration challenge faced by Europe.  I know direct provision largely comes under the Department of Justice and Equality but immigration is something we are discussing here.  We know the background and history of direct provision.  It is far from perfect and has had significant problems.  Over the years, the Government has tried to improve it.  An alternative mechanism for dealing with people who present themselves here is not as obvious as people would like to think it is.  It is a complex issue.</p><p>Can the T&aacute;naiste give us more detail about how the EU will address this issue?  This country is playing its part by taking its quota.  With regard to the whole scale of it, the T&aacute;naiste spoke about finding "a consensus based on solidarity, responsibility and international law".  I ask him to put a little more flesh on those bones.</p><p> My final question relates to the Middle East peace process, which has been raised by previous speakers.  We have raised it with the T&aacute;naiste on a number of occasions.  I acknowledge that he has been vocal on it.  I also acknowledge that he has been critical of the stagnation or non-existence of the process and of the continued illegal expansion of settlements into the occupied territories.  He told me in the D&aacute;il almost two weeks ago that he shared the despair that was being articulated by me and by other Deputies.  When people from Israel purport to speak with authority, it is hard to believe what they are saying because their actions are completely different.  I suggest the Government needs to rethink its approach to the occupied territories Bill because the strategy of being vocal and criticising is not having any tangible effect.  I wonder whether we could look at other avenues.  For example, I was briefed by Tr&oacute;caire recently on the whole area of human rights and environmental due diligence legislation.  Could we consider the option of having a discussion with our European partners to demonstrate that the practices which are being rolled out offend human rights and potentially offend environmental best practice?</p><p> I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to the two matters I have raised.  As other members have covered Brexit and other topics, I do not intend to go into them.  I was present in the D&aacute;il this morning when the T&aacute;naiste addressed a number of issues that were put to him by my party's deputy leader, Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his rapid overview of many areas.  As he said, it is an enormous brief to cover without getting into the elephant in the room, which is Brexit.  I spoke on Brexit in the Seanad on Tuesday during a debate with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  Like Deputy Niall Collins, I will not go into Brexit other than to express the view that the T&aacute;naiste has expressed.  I do not see how the British Government's commitments under the Good Friday Agreement are legally reconcilable with the current proposals we have seen from it.</p> <p>  I would like to raise a few key points.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan spoke about this country's record with regard to overseas development aid.  I hope next week's budget will bring further good news on meeting our overseas development aid commitments and target.  This committee has done a great deal of work on the Irish Aid programme and I want to express my strong support for that.</p> <p>  The crisis in Syria has been mentioned by previous speakers.  I would like to refer specifically to the enormous Russian support for the Assad regime.  Civilians and hospitals have been targeted by Russian and Syrian regime forces.  Is there any prospect of further EU action, such as particular sanctions, against Russia and against the Assad regime?  The Minister said in his opening remarks that this was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in February.  It is clear that since then, things have changed for the worse in particular areas.  Notably, we have seen an escalation of bombardment in Idlib.  We have seen significant increases in refugee numbers.  I have been contacted by someone who has just returned from a refugee camp in Lebanon.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken about his visit to see the terrible conditions there.  Could more be done at EU level to achieve a peaceful resolution?</p> <p>  I raised a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in the Seanad on Tuesday.  It concerned a family in this country that has family members in Idlib.  Permission has been granted for the family members in question to be brought to Ireland.  Physically, it is almost impossible for people in that position to achieve safe passage.  I have sent details of this case to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The bigger issue here is that although we have stepped up by making a commitment to resettle refugees from Syria, particularly under the family programme, we have not come close to meeting the targets we have set.  I know we can do more to ensure safe passage for people who have already been given permission to come here.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to respond to this specific question.</p> <p>  I would like to refer briefly to the Middle East.  I was glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste's comments condemning the expansion of settlements in Palestine.  I would like more progress to be made in this State on the occupied territories Bill and on the recognition of the Palestinian state, for which there would be strong support from my party and many other parties.</p> <p>  One year on from the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, I urge the T&aacute;naiste to do more at EU level to condemn the regime in Saudi Arabia.  I recently met human rights activists from Bahrain who argue that Ireland should do more to condemn human rights abuses by the Bahraini Government, particularly abuses of political prisoners and discrimination against women.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has raised the Church in Chains issue in China.</p> <p>  Have we seen any progress on the situation in Venezuela, about which the T&aacute;naiste spoke?  This committee has heard about the destabilising effect that events in Venezuela are having on neighbouring countries in the region, including Colombia.  Many of us have had strong engagement with the Colombian ambassador and with non-governmental organisations and human rights groups in the region.  It is clear that the situation in Venezuela is problematic for the peace process in Colombia.  Mr. Eamon Gilmore has been before the joint committee to discuss this significant issue.</p> <p>  It is clear that all the work Ireland is doing to promote human rights internationally is very important.  It is important that we continue to have a strong record on the protection and promotion of human rights internationally, particularly if we get a seat on the UN Security Council.</p></speech>

My understanding is that a temporary deal was reached at the meeting in Malta.  This deal will be presented to the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 8 October next.  I hope we will be able to buy into that and support it.  I think there is a broader question here.  The temporary deal essentially involves trying to respond to the immediacy of the migrant problem in the Mediterranean.  The question of what the EU collectively should do to try to deal with this issue is a much bigger one.  Over the next 20 years, one of the defining issues for the EU will be the manner in which it deals with dramatic population growth in its neighbourhood.  People in the Middle East and particularly on the continent of Africa have the ability to move around and want the kind of lifestyle the EU provides.  It is going to be difficult to contend with this challenge.  Deals will continue to be done between the EU and Turkey.  In some ways, this is far from ideal but it is a pragmatic response as we try to deal with the vast numbers of refugees who have come from Syria and other conflict zones.  There is a constant balancing act for politicians in this regard.  I am very liberal when it comes to migration, but I understand that an approach to migration that is too open and too generous tends to get a response at election time from an electorate that can be quite conservative on these issues when it is asked to change and to accommodate large numbers of people in a short space of time.  We need to accept that this is what happened in Italy, which had quite a generous approach to disembarkation and was dealing with substantial numbers of people who were coming across the Mediterranean.  Virtually all of the disembarkation from Irish vessels was into Italian ports.  The Italian Government asked over and again for solidarity and support from other member states, but it did not get it.  The electorate gave its answer when it put in place a Government that takes a hard line on this issue.  We have to find a way to take a human approach to refugees and asylum seekers across the EU.</p><p>We have to bring people with us while doing so.  That is one of the issues that Deputy O'Callaghan referred to in the context of the concerning campaigns we have seen emerging to oppose direction provision nationally.  In other countries, Ireland is often pointed to as a model for the integration of refugees in towns and villages.  While we criticise the standard of accommodation in some direct provision centres, it is not living in the real world for some to call for an end to direct provision as if we can somehow magic over 7,000 people from the system and into their own homes overnight.  If one compares how we treat and accommodate migrants versus most other member states, in particular those that have a great many migrants, our direct provision centres are of a significantly better standard.  That is not to say they are good enough.  We must continue to improve the standard.  This is not only about accommodation but also about healthcare supports, social integration, becoming part of communities and so on.  We must be careful about how we interact with the communities we ask to accommodate lots of new people.  We have probably made some mistakes in that regard.  People have legitimate concerns around how a small town or village can accommodate large numbers of new residents.  We have to get better at this.  If we do not, we will run out of accommodation.  We have more than 1,000 refugees and asylum seekers in temporary hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation because we have too few structured direct provision centres.  We must address that, be upfront about it, and work with communities to make it viable.  I appeal to other political leaders in particular to offer leadership within communities rather than reinforce people's fears.  Many of those fears are based on rumour and inaccurate information.  I thank Deputy Niall Collins for his comments in this area, which were both accurate and fair.  The Government is very conscious of that.</p><p> Every member of the committee is concerned about the Middle East peace process.  We are open to any proposal, whether legislative or some other initiative, but I cannot support anything I do not believe to be legally sound, such as the occupied territories Bill.  The Bill is not implementable and would not change anything.  In fact, it would undermine Ireland's capacity to facilitate change.  I understand the motivation and frustration behind the Bill and have spoken to Senator Black about that on numerous occasions.  No Government, however, can knowingly implement legislation its Attorney General tells it is not legally sound.  While we would consider it if we thought otherwise, it is still the case that my only objective in the Middle East peace process is to make something positive happen.  I have no other objective.  That was the case in New York where I had an opportunity to meet Jared Kushner, with whom I had a long meeting at which the Irish view was made clear with regard to any new peace initiative the USA might bring forward if and when a new Israeli government takes office.  I speak regularly to Arab leaders, in particular the Jordanian minister, about what Ireland can do to be constructive within the EU.  That is what we are trying to do and we will continue to seek to play that role at UN and EU level.  We will do it in such a way as to keep an open dialogue with Israel and Palestinian leaders.  In fact, I am meeting the Palestinian ambassador to the UN after this meeting.  If members have ideas and proposals, we will happily look at them.  If they are helpful and legally sound, we will certainly look at progressing them.</p><p> I was asked about Iran and Russia supporting the Assad regime and Syria.  The role played by Iran and Russia in Syria has served to prolong the conflict and, thus, the suffering of Syrian people.  They have assisted the regime in the violent suppression of its own people, including through support for military attacks.  Syria will be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in October.  Sanctions are already in place on Syria and they have not been lifted.  There will come a time at some point when we have to recognise that a transition is taking place and look at how the EU can support it in a responsible way.  We have called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure civilians are protected and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process.  We want a political transformation over time that can facilitate significant EU financial and development support to rebuild a country that has been devastated in such a tragic way.</p><p> I was asked about ODA.  I will be honest and upfront about next week's budget, as I was with NGOs yesterday.  I am an open book on ODA.  I want us to get to 0.7%.  We delivered an extra &euro;116 million to the ODA budget last year and will have to make average increases of approximately &euro;150 million between now and 2030.  These are huge numbers but that is what we want to do and are committed to doing.  Next week's budget, however, will not be a normal one.  We are putting a budget together on the basis of a pessimistic outlook for a no-deal scenario with 0.7% economic growth in 2020, which is, in essence, no growth when one accounts for inflation and so on.  As such, expenditure increases across many Departments, including mine, will be much lower than would otherwise have been the case.  That will go for ODA as well as everything else.  That is not to say we will not increase ODA next week, which we will.  I am determined not to go backwards on the percentage of gross national income, GNI.  We are currently at 0.31% of GNI and will have to spend more money on ODA simply to hold it at that percentage.  I am insisting that we do not go backwards on our journey to 2030 and 0.7%.  We spend well over &euro;800 million a year and will add to that next week.  However, it will not be anything like what we were able to do last year, which was more than &euro;100 million.  It will be a lot less, I am afraid, reflecting the reality across all Departments of what a no-deal Brexit could mean.  We will have to make very significant financial provision to support vulnerable sectors should the disruption of a no-deal Brexit take effect.  We must also factor in 0% growth.  Unless it is hugely irresponsible, a government does not increase spending by 3% to 5% if growth is flat.  In recent years, we have consistently increased expenditure in line with growth in the economy.  That will be the same next week or very close to it.  I do not want to be negative.  We are still committed to being where we need to be by 2030 but it is important to ensure expectations next week are realistic.</p><p> I was asked about the Khashoggi murder.  Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the death of Jamal Khashoggi and, one year on, we are still waiting for those responsible for his murder to be held to account.  That is the truth of it.  From the beginning, Ireland has supported calls for a thorough, credible and transparent investigation into this murder, which must get to the facts of the case and ensure there is full accountability for those responsible.  While a trial is under way in Saudi Arabia, Irish officials have noted in contacts with officials there the need for greater transparency.  The report of the UN special rapporteur, which was released in June, made for sobering reading.  She concluded that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was premeditated and overseen by high-level Saudi officials and that Turkey's efforts to investigate it have been undermined by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The lengthy report is comprehensive and includes a number of detailed recommendations that require careful consideration.  This incident should not have happened.  The international community needs to be firm and consistent in insisting on trying to get answers as opposed to allowing for some kind of cover-up and for all to move on, and we have been consistent in that regard.</p><p> On human rights in Bahrain, last week I met the Foreign Minister for Bahrain in New York where we had quite a good discussion on this issue.  We have raised the issue at a senior level.  We want a good relationship with the Bahraini Government.  There is a recognition that there are human rights considerations and concerns that need to be responded to and addressed.  I wish to reassure people that the issue of human rights was very much the topic of conversation. </p><p> In terms of Venezuela, this is just a calamity.  More than 5 million refugees or migrants have left Venezuela.  A huge number of them have poured into Colombia, in particular, but also into many other neighbouring countries.  The situation is causing huge tension and resentment.  Initially, extraordinary generosity was shown to the Venezuelans.  I believe that it is the sheer number of people that neighbouring countries must deal with has caused all sorts of challenges and problems, despite the fact that the countries have been extraordinary generous by and large.  In the D&aacute;il we have had some debates to discuss our approach.  We recognise that there has to be a political solution.  Pressure and sanctions alone are not going to do this.  A talks process is under way.  Some people are sceptical of the process but we are not.  The Oslo process is largely taking place in Barbados and it is a vehicle to find a way forward.  We want to continue to encourage engagement with that process.  I know that the Norwegian Government is very committed to it and I hope we will see a non-violent outcome to what has been a pretty awful episode in Venezuelan history for so many Venezuelans.  I think that is everything.  </p></speech>

As he will know, migration is my area.  I am really concerned about the fierce toxic anti-immigration sentiment in the United States, which this year has reduced the intake of refugees to 18,000 refugees from a high of 100,000 refugees by the former Administration.  The anti-immigrant sentiment has probably fuelled the protests that we saw here in the last few weeks with regard to our acceptance of asylum seekers and refugees.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, the centre is in my home country.  Sinister right-wing activists have infiltrated and fuelled these protests.  As he has said, dialogue must take place with local people.  I think Ireland has done quite well in terms of direct provision for asylum-seekers and refugees.  As he also asked, what are we going to do with the 6,000 people?  What is our quota of asylum-seekers?  What numbers do we take in on a yearly basis?</p></speech>

Sanctions sound great in theory but, in practice, hurt ordinary people more than they hurt those they are directed at.  Part of the issue in Venezuela are the sanctions imposed by the United States.  Such sanctions have caused an awful lot of difficulty in Cuba.  As far as America is concerned, the Cold War continues.  It is the same when it comes to Iran.  Does America solve issues or make things worse and harden people's attitudes?</p></speech>

Somebody will try to get a headline and be in sync with a community that might be worried or angry about something that they have not been told about and feel something has been sprung on them.  That is a human reaction.  Communities, by and large, will be reasonable in this space if they are treated with respect, given information in advance, if it is clearly explained how something will work and told how many people are coming.  Also, it must be explained how things like education, school spaces, healthcare and so on will be provided.  There is an onus on the State to manage the communications of this more effectively.  There are lots of really good examples of direct provision centres located in towns around Ireland where there has been fantastic integration.  One of the Ministers who sat at the Cabinet table this week explained that there was a welcome event and party held for the new citizens in town at a direct provision centre, which was a hotel, and is literally 100 yd from his house.  There was instant integration and the placement has worked really well.  Such a situation can be replicated across Ireland.  Irish people are generous but want to know what is going on, and that is the challenge for us.  </p> <p>  There are sinister elements too.  There is a far-right element in Ireland.  They have not got much political traction but they are active.  They are racist and they will look to stoke up trouble in communities on the back of rumours and fear, which we need to combat head-on because that kind of politics is very active in other countries.  Fortunately for us, such activity has been much more successful in other countries than here.  Most of the time Irish people have no time for that kind of lack of generosity or, in some cases, bigotry and racism.  Whether we like it or not it is there, is under the surface and it will take advantage of vulnerable communities if we do not manage these things properly.  It is a big challenge for all parties to work together to ensure that migration and the politics surrounding same are not part of the main political discourse at election time in Ireland.  We are planning for a country that will have an extra 1 million people in the next two decades.  Half of that extra 1 million people, in terms of an addition to Ireland's population, will not have been born in Ireland.  Today, 17% of our population was not born here and that percentage is increasing all of the time, which is good.  It is a really good thing in terms of the way Ireland sees the world and has an outward-looking open approach to how we interact with other countries and so on.  It has allowed us to have a platform for not only international trade but also a much more open approach towards how society lives and tolerates difference.  I am sure Senator Lawless understands that only too well from the work that he has done in the US and here.</p></speech>

To date, Ireland has admitted more than 2,600 people under EU relocation and resettlement programmes.</p><p>It is expected that the rest of these numbers will be filled by the end of 2019 through pledges for programme refugees and by approximately 630 family reunification arrivals under the new Irish Refugee Protection Programme, IRPP, humanitarian admissions programme.  That is a structured relocation programme for migrants.  Asylum seeking is a separate issue.  Anybody from anywhere can arrive in Ireland and can claim that they are fleeing persecution and therefore claim asylum.  We have a legal obligation to go through the process and to look after the needs of those people during that process, which is what direct provision was set up for 20 years ago or more.  As I said, there are many countries, including in the EU, that have far fewer supports in place for asylum seekers than we have.  That is not to say we are doing great or anything; we can always do better.  There is no such thing as a quota for asylum seekers.  The numbers who arrive have to be dealt with under international law.  That also has to involve, in some circumstances, deportation.  We cannot have a credible migration policy unless we are honest with people.  We accommodate people who are genuine asylum seekers and we have got to say to people who are not, who are economic migrants but who do not come here under the appropriate visa programmes, we have got to say to those people that we are sorry but there is a way to come to Ireland under a work visa programme and if they do not qualify, they have to go home.  If we are not consistent on that, it is hard to get the broader public to buy into a generous migration strategy, which I believe we should have, by the way.  I am very liberal when it comes to migration but it is all well and good saying that; we have to have a system that works.  We have to be able to accommodate the numbers who are here.  At the moment, we are right at the edge of that in terms of direct provision and not having enough places, which is why we need new direct provision centres.  We have to work with communities to make that happen.</p><p> In terms of sanctions, many sanctions target individuals or their financial assets through travel bans or through specific targeting of individuals in power.  I think there is a role for sanctions.  Without sanctions, we have very few tools in the toolkit, frankly.  If we are simply appealing to a dictator, in some cases, to change his ways, to have elections, to respect international law, but actually have no means to use a stick as well as a carrot, if we are ruling out military intervention which I believe we should, sanctions do play a role.  Sanctions have changed the approach of governments and individuals in different parts of the world.  We need to be careful with how sanctions are used.  Sometimes they can contribute to the misery of the broader public in a country.  That is why they need to be constantly assessed.  If we are not going to agree with military intervention, we have to look at other ways of persuasion or facilitating change in line with the standards that we should be expecting in the European Union.  I think there is a role for sanctions but we need to constantly assess how they are working and how targeted they are.  </p><p> Finally on Georgia, the prolongation of so-called frozen conflicts remains a source of concern.  They pose a challenge to reform efforts and undermine stability in the wider region.  This is in respect of the ongoing Russia-Georgia conflict.  There remain serious challenges regarding the situation of internally displaced persons and of human rights in the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhasia.  In recent weeks there has been an escalation along the administrative boundary lines with the Russia-backed breakaway regions, with both sides reinforcing checkpoints and security infrastructure.  The EU has called for both sides to show maximum restraint and avoid escalation.  Technical discussions at the incident prevention and response mechanism have de-escalated the situation somewhat but tensions remain high.  The EU continues to engage as co-chair of the Geneva international discussions, including the continued presence on the ground of the EU monitoring mission, which has three Irish members.  This is something we will continue to watch closely and which I will continue to discuss with my EU colleagues to ensure that we keep it on the agenda.</p></speech>

I have a few quick comments in regard to Brexit.  It is slightly ironic that the British Prime Minister entitled his letter &quot;A fair and reasonable compromise: UK proposals for a new protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland&quot;.  In my view, what the British Government is now putting forward is neither fair nor reasonable, nor even a compromise.  It is a considerable reneging on the commitments made by Britain and agreed with the European Union in the 2017 joint report.  Paragraph 49 of that report states:</p><blockquote>The United Kingdom remains committed to protecting North-South cooperation and to its guarantee of avoiding a hard border. Any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements. [...] In the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement. </blockquote> <p>More and more people, particularly in the Border communities and the community where I live, feel that a hard, crash-out Brexit may be less than four weeks away.  There is a great fear of that happening, as the T&aacute;naiste is well aware.  In regard to the Prime Minister's proposals, the only political party in Northern Ireland supporting them is the Democratic Unionist Party.</p><p>Along with political parties in Northern Ireland, we have to be cognisant of the views of representative organisations that have voiced their strong opposition.  They include Manufacturing NI, Retail NI and Northern Ireland Retail Consortium.  What is proposed at present will damage the Northern Ireland economy and will also damage two decades plus of painstaking political and cross-community progress made under the Good Friday Agreement.  What damages the Northern Ireland economy damages our economy as well as, thankfully, both of our economies are so interdependent because of the most valuable development in the all-Ireland economy and the growth of business on an all-Ireland basis.  If we think of the stark remarks of Manufacturing NI, it tweeted last night: &quot;Frankly the proposals are worse than No Deal for Northern Ireland businesses.&quot;  Indeed I gather from some of the limited commentary I listened to at the Tory Party conference that some of the British Ministers saw Brexit as an opportunity for widespread divergence between Britain and the European Union in terms of standards and conditions.  Hopefully that will not happen but if such divergence emerged, then communities such as those I represent would be deeply adversely affected.  It would result in a clear breach of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>One comment that we must be mindful of and that I hope will be brought through right to the end of the negotiations was President Juncker's statement in the European Parliament last April that the UK must fully respect the letter and sprit of the Good Friday Agreement.  President Juncker's stress on both the letter and the sprit of the agreement is greatly important and significant.  I sincerely hope there will be no deviation from that position and that EU solidarity with the Government's position and the position of the Oireachtas will be maintained.  I said at our first committee meeting after the Brexit referendum in June 2016 that for a person who grew up in the Troubles and lived in the Border communities, and who has had the privilege of representing two counties with a long land border, the psychology of going back to borders as part of our everyday narrative is terribly damaging.  We sincerely hope that does not transpire.  We wish the T&aacute;naiste well in the continued difficult task he has in ensuring that Ireland's interests are fully protected.</p></speech>

I agree with every word he has just said.  I am very familiar with paragraph 49 of the December 2017 agreement.  I quote it all the time to people.  We worked really hard to get it agreed.  I think the then Prime Minister, Ms May, understood the complexity of trying to protect the Good Friday Agreement and relationships on the island of Ireland at the same time as delivering Brexit and, because of that, gave that commitment and the commitment in paragraph 50, the next paragraph, to try to reassure unionism.  What Prime Minister Johnson has proposed falls significantly short of that commitment.  That is why I have said that while I regard Prime Minister Johnson's proposal as a serious one and an effort to try to move negotiations forward, there is still a need for another big step to ensure that an outcome here that we can all sign up to, I hope, is consistent with the paragraph the Chairman has just quoted and the commitments that have been made in the context of the backstop.  If we are to replace the backstop with something else, it must do the same job, which is to reassure Border communities that they will not face Border infrastructure and the disruption it would bring in the future.  It must also ensure that mechanisms in place in Northern Ireland to try to mitigate the damage of Brexit are not obstructed by a minority against the majority will.  That would not be democratic or consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  The challenge for us is to try to find a way forward that unionists and nationalists, and members of the communities that are neither, can support.  Ultimately, though, we must ensure we do not go back to a border on the island of Ireland being a political debating point and all that flows from that in terms of the corrosive impact on relationships and disruption to trade, which, as the Chairman knows, has been such a reinforcer of normality and peace in the Border region for the past two decades.</p> <p>  This is difficult stuff, but we want to work with the British Prime Minister, and of course we are working as part of Michel Barnier's team.  We will do everything we can to try to get a deal in the next week or so.  It must, however, be the right deal in order that we do not let people down and find that the Border becomes the topic of debate in Ireland for the foreseeable future, with all the divisions that flow from that and the calls for more radical change and so in in Northern Ireland, which I do not believe we are ready for, and I think the Chairman is of the same view.  These are difficult times.  We are writing the history of what the relationship between Britain and Ireland and between the EU and the UK will look like for the next 20 years, and we need to get it right.</p></speech>

The TPNW provides for states to fulfil their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and affirm their commitment to achieving a world free from nuclear weapons.  The TPNW plugs a legal gap by prohibiting the last form of weapon of mass destruction which has not yet been explicitly outlawed under international law.  I am pleased that during the Second Stage debate all parties expressed support for the passing of this legislation and shared a deep concern about the devastating consequences to humanity and the planet which would arise from the detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet, whether by accident, miscalculation or design.  We are all agreed that the only guarantee of protection from the use of nuclear weapons is their complete elimination.  The ratification by Ireland of the TPNW will be an important step towards the realisation of this important goal.</p> <p>  The TPNW establishes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on participating in nuclear weapon activities.  The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 creates offences in respect of these prohibitions.  In addition to these core prohibitions that implement the disarmament pillar of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the TPNW obliges states parties to assist survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use in areas under their jurisdiction and to undertake necessary environmental remediation in areas under their control.  The treaty is the first international legal instrument to recognise the disproportionate impact on the health of women and girls of ionising radiation from nuclear weapons use.  The treaty also promotes equal participation in the treaty&rsquo;s work by women and men and includes a provision on disarmament education.   </p> <p>  Ratification of the treaty following the enactment of the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 will be in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Ireland played a leading role in the treaty negotiations and, accordingly, signed the treaty at the earliest opportunity, on 20 September 2017.  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the treaty negotiations also reflected our principled position on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, respect for human rights and the promotion of civil society voices.  These values are reflected in the treaty.  I am pleased to inform members that during a special high level ceremony at UN Headquarters in New York last week the TPNW took a significant step forward towards its entry into force when seven states signed and five states ratified the treaty.  The treaty now has 79 signatories and 32 states parties.  The treaty is more than halfway towards the 50 states parties required for its entry into force.</p> <p>  I would like to inform the committee that the Government is likely to propose an amendment on Report Stage to include a reverse onus clause in section 2 of the Bill.  This type of clause is to be found in other similar legislation, including the Biological Weapons Act 2011.  A reverse onus clause will ensure that, in the event of a prosecution being commenced for an offence under the Bill, a weapon or other explosive device capable of releasing nuclear energy will be presumed to have been designed for hostile purposes, that is, to cause or likely to cause death, serious injury or damage to property or the environment.  Thus, it will be for the defendant to cast reasonable doubt on this presumption in order to rebut it. </p> <p>  I again thank Deputies for their support for the Bill during its Second Reading.  More particularly, I thank Deputies for the richness of their engagement across a broad range of issues related to nuclear disarmament during that debate.  There is no doubt but that a world free of nuclear weapons is in best interests of humanity and the planet.  That is a shared view across the House.  I am confident that we will succeed in passing this legislation which will allow Ireland to ratify the TPNW in the coming months and demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s leadership on the international stage on the issue of nuclear disarmament.</p></speech>

Its research and background information on the Bill were very helpful.  Its work complements ours, particular of those of us in opposition.  It is of huge benefit to Members.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports and welcomes the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill.  As the Minister of State said, it received unanimous support on Second Stage.  I imagine that support will continue as the Bill progresses through all remaining Stages.  The Bill will enable Ireland to become a state party to the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and give effect to its provisions in Irish law.  The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities related to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.  This is both very welcome and something to which every country should agree.  Nuclear weapons threaten the very existence of the human race and life on this planet.  They should not be developed, stored or used by anyone.  </p> <p>  It is worrying that many Cold War disarmament treaties are breaking down.  That should be noted in this discussion.  Presidents Trump and Putin are moving towards a new arms race.  We need to create a world free from nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction.  Ireland must be a global leader on the issues of demilitarisation and disarmament.  </p> <p>  We should remember all victims and survivors of nuclear weapons.  Two nuclear weapons have been used in war - the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US military in 1945.  These two bombs killed 120,000 civilians and flattened both cities.  They were deployed to kill as many civilians as possible.  It was a war crime, although it is never spoken about in these terms, and the effects are still being felt today.</p><p>We have seen pictures of babies born today who are suffering the effects of that war which should never have happened.  The development and use of nuclear weapons should have ended with it, but, regrettably, the opposite happened.  We know that more and more of these weapons were produced.  I always try to attend the annual event organised by the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on Merrion Square to remember all those who died in these two war crime events.  It is a small ceremony, but it is important that Irish people be given the opportunity to express their horror at what happened.  During the Cold War we saw massive proliferation of nuclear weapons which still pose a threat to humanity.  Nuclear weapons have been detonated on 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations which have caused enormous environmental damage.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that in 2017 there were 14,465 nuclear weapons in the world.  They must all be destroyed and put beyond use.  </p><p> I reiterate my support for the treaty, Ireland being a signatory to it and the Bill, the effect of which will be to enshrine the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  I am not sure about the amendment that has been tabled and hope someone will speak to it.  I am open to supporting it, but I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on it.  The treaty is not binding on states that are not a party to it and we have a long race to run before we reach full global nuclear disarmament.  Nonetheless, the treaty remains an important step in achieving nuclear disarmament.  In parallel to its support for the treaty, the Government should try to stop the erosion of Irish neutrality and oppose further militarisation of the European Union.  I know that there are differences of opinion, but it is not good enough to oppose nuclear weapons while remaining part of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace.  We cannot chastise countries that have stockpiled and developed nuclear weapons in Europe and then join EU battle groups with them and silently move towards the formation of an EU army.  It is welcome that we have signed the treaty, but we must encourage more countries to do likewise.  We must also encourage those that have nuclear weapons to set out on the long road towards disarmament and the decommissioning of all nuclear weapons.</p></speech>

That said, I have concerns.  While we are all agreed on the prohibition of nuclear weapons which are weapons of mass destruction, there seems to be an open field for the arms industry generally and the weapons produced that cause massive, rather than mass, destruction.  It is all very well to agree on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, but the bigger picture must be addressed.  This is particularly the case when one looks at the finance involved in the arms industry.  When I was speaking to the Bill in the D&aacute;il Chamber, I mentioned some figures which included the $1.74 trillion spent on arms in 2017.  In the European Union alone, military spending is &euro;260 billion per annum.  Apparently, it will take another $1 trillion to modernise the nuclear weapons capacity of the nine countries that have nuclear weapons.  While we are passing this legislation, supporting its provisions and asking that it be as strong as possible, we must be mindful of what is happening in the wider context.  There are a number of rather volatile world leaders who like to play war games with each other.  We are depending on them to behave rationally, but I am not sure if we can put too much store in that happening.  Of course, the countries that hold nuclear weapons will not agree with the treaty because they want to retain these weapons.  In that context, a lot more work needs to be done.</p> <p>  I have a question about divestment in companies that produce nuclear weapons.  Three countries in Europe have divested from them completely.  Ireland has divested from three of the 26 companies in which it has investments.  As we did in the case of fossil fuels, we must work on this issue too.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, this country has a long and proud record in working towards the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.  Going back to 1958, led by the then Minister Frank Aiken, Ireland introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the United Nations which eventually led to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which has become the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament.  The treaty is the most widely recognised agreement on nuclear disarmament.  As has been said, with so much uncertainty throughout the world, this is an issue that must continually be addressed by the international community.  The Bill is an important measure and we are glad to be able to facilitate its passage.  I thank members for their co-operation.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Dilis Clare, GP and medical herbalist, and Mr. Kevin Hurley, a tax agent from CKH Fiscal Services who for the past few years has been advising our organisation on the VAT treatment of food supplements.  I thank the Chairman and the other members of the joint committee for the interest they have taken in the issue and inviting us to address them on the most serious threat ever to face the health food industry in Ireland, that is, the imposition of VAT on food supplements.  </p> <p>  There are health food stores in every town in Ireland.  They are mostly small, independent family-run businesses which are an integral part of the local community.  The imposition of this unwarranted tax will undoubtedly lead to the closure of many of them and the loss of hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs.  We have made a submission to the committee which sets out a lot of the background to the issue and I hope members have had a chance to read it.</p> <p>  I will summarise the five reasons the imposition of VAT on food supplements should not proceed.  We are being told that we are about to have a no-deal Brexit budget.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has stated it will be a safe and careful budget which will help citizens, families and communities that could find themselves dealing with real change as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  If the United Kingdom crashes out of the European Union on 31 October, new customs tariffs will apply to goods traded between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It is expected that imports of food supplements from the United Kingdom into Ireland which account for the majority of supplements will attract a tariff of 12.8%.  If VAT at a rate of 23% is applied, Irish consumers of food supplements will be facing a cumulative increase of 37.8% overnight at the beginning of November.  A near 40% rise in price will see a major decline in health supplement consumption, a knock-on impact on the health of citizens and a threat to hundreds of retailers across Ireland.  The Minister cannot prevent the United Kingdom from crashing out of the European Union or the resultant WTO tariffs, but imposing VAT on food supplements in the budget is totally at odds with a no-deal Brexit.  Instead of protecting Irish consumers and retailers, it would punish them.</p> <p>  It is important to understand the origins of the proposal.  It is not because of Government policy and not driven by a desire to raise money, nor is it being demanded by the European Union.  It is being done because Revenue's decentralisation of decision-making in 2014 led to contradictory Revenue decisions where given different VAT rates were applied to the same types of supplement.  Revenue's answer to an administration problem which it created is to impose a charge on consumers and damage the business of retailers.  Revenue, in the shape of its chairman in front of this committee, has claimed that since the end of 2018, the zero-rating of food supplements since 1973 has been on a concessionary basis, but there is no evidence whatsoever to back up this claim.  If there was a single email from one Revenue official to another mentioning this concession in the past 20 or 30 years, we would have seen it by now, but no document has been produced showing any evidence that there was ever a concessionary basis for the taxation of food supplements at the zero rate.  The industry had never heard of this so-called concession until it was first mentioned by the Minister, in response to a D&aacute;il question in October last year, despite the countless VAT audits that had taken place throughout the country in the 40 years in which there had been food supplements in Ireland.  Revenue would have audited the accounts of many firms, retailers and wholesalers in recent years and there has never been an issue with the non-application of VAT to food supplements.  There have been no related prosecutions, fines or penalties, interest or back tax payments during the years.</p> <p>  The EU VAT directive does not allow member states to apply a zero VAT vate on a non-statutory or concessionary basis, as Revenue should know better than anybody.  Under freedom of information legislation, we obtained evidence in August this year that there had never been any concessionary treatment and that in 2006 Revenue had published instructions for its staff confirming that food supplements were always legally eligible for the zero rate as food in accordance with its interpretation of existing VAT law.  In short, the concession argument is bogus and has caused the Minister and members of the committee to be misled.  </p> <p>  Any imposition of VAT would impact negatively on health and retailers.  The imposition of VAT on these products would also penalise hard-pressed consumers, especially children and the elderly who, with most adults, often use food supplements to maintain good health and address many dietary deficiencies associated with the reality of modern diet and lifestyle.  We can provide examples of the positive health benefits of food supplements for members, if they so desire.  A serious risk if there is an increase in the price of food supplements is that consumers will abandon their local stores and purchase supplements online, where there is no regulation, advice or guidance on what might or might not be suitable, depending on people's health circumstances.  That will guarantee job losses and the closures of small businesses.  The sudden imposition of VAT on sports supplements in 2011 led to the decimation of that category of goods which had accounted for 10% of my business.  The segment more or less disappeared as if somebody had turned out the lights.  People went online to buy their products and that was the end of sports supplements for me.</p><p> The resolution of this issue lies with the Minister.  An identical situation arose in 2014 regarding VAT on herbal teas.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, had no difficulty in introducing new zero VAT legislation for those products in that year's budget.  I thank members for their continuing interest in this issue.  We are happy to take questions on any aspect of this subject.  What we hope to do today is to persuade individual members and the committee as a whole of the merit of our case notwithstanding the forces ranged against us.  As public representatives, we ask members to reject the proposal that an administrative problem for Revenue be resolved at the expense of ordinary consumers and retailers.  We realise that time is short but we hope the committee will take action over the coming days.  </p></speech>

Could he give us a sense of current practice regarding the products he and other members of the Irish Association of Health Stories sell?  What is the overall mix?  I know there are regional variations since the devolution in 2014 to local Revenue offices.  What is the overall picture regarding the application of the zero rating of products for VAT purposes?</p></speech>

We must also remember that when we speak here, we are not just speaking about the 200 businesses we represent.  Supplements are being sold within many aspects of retail.  About 1,800 plus pharmacies throughout the country are selling food supplements.  We can speculate that there are many hundreds of supermarkets that sell them in the same way.  For the past 40 years, there was never been a question regarding how we should treat food supplements.  We had a few things like juices.  If we sold a medicinal product such as plantain juice that did not taste very nice, the fact that its label contained the word "juice" meant that it attracted 23% VAT in the same way as apple juice would.  However, there was never a question but that a simple vitamin, mineral, fish oil or a botanical like turmeric, ginger or garlic, which would almost be sold in any corner shop, would attract 0% VAT.  I can say that all retailers applied that same measure.  It was unquestioned and nobody had any reason to think otherwise.</p> <p>  It is only in the past three or four years that there has been any real challenge to that practice and we found the need to submit a product to Revenue to get a VAT ruling on it because Revenue started throwing up question marks about this.  I will pass this question over to Mr. Hurley, who can give the Deputy even more definitive information in that regard.  However, I can tell the Deputy that over the past 47 years, every retailer in the country always had the very simple approach that it was 0% VAT for a food supplement regardless of whether it was a Vitamin C, ginger or garlic capsule.  That was the practice and all those thousands of businesses applied that rule without hesitation.  Suddenly, Revenue is saying that these thousands of businesses have been out of step and only Revenue knew what should have happened.  It is only Revenue that claimed at one point that the very tight definition of vitamin, mineral or fish oil deserved the 0% rating according to a strict reading of the regulation and that everything else should have had 23% VAT attached to it.  That story was then contradicted by Revenue's own website because the website had numerous products such as royal jelly, ginseng and garlic openly rated at 0%.  I have snapshots from the 2018 guidance from Revenue's website detailing a 0% rating on these products in accordance with their categorisation as a food because-----</p></speech>

Is this not currently applied to 70%, 80% or 90% of products sold in the stores of the association's members?  What is current practice on the ground?</p></speech>

We are awaiting the conclusion of that.  I will hand over to Mr. Hurley to get the Deputy a more definitive answer.</p></speech>

There may not be any legal basis for doing so.  In legal terms, there is no real difference between a body building supplement and a Vitamin C supplement for immune health but the industry as a whole applied VAT to those products in 2012.  Everybody assumed that products similar to ginseng, such as probiotics or other botanicals were zero rated because of entries on Revenue's website for ginseng and royal jelly capsules at 0%.  When royal jelly was first released into the market, it was marketed as the fountain of youth.  I think ginseng was marketed as an aphrodisiac.  Revenue might have taken the view that some of these supplements were being marketed for frivolous purposes but very many of the products Revenue said were zero rated, such as royal jelly capsules and ginseng, were marketed for equally frivolous purposes.</p></speech>

Regarding the profile in my store, I always say that elderly people on a limited budget who still find it within their means to spend significantly will be at the top of my list of people who will be badly affected by this.</p><p>A monthly spend of &euro;40 or &euro;50 would not be unusual if they are buying something like a good multivitamin.  They may be spending &euro;20 on a turmeric product to reduce achy joints and knees, or perhaps a glucosamine sulphate, something that has been well scientifically researched, to help with joint problems.  One can easily get to that sort of number.  Obviously there will be a great deal of variation on that.  The most popular single product in my store is what might appear to be a slightly expensive multivitamin but nevertheless people find the value in it.  That starts off at &euro;45 for a monthly supply and could go to well over &euro;60 if one were to apply duties, tariffs and all the rest.  </p></speech>

Those who come for health food supplements might not have an adequate diet, partly because there is an evidence-proven reduction in constituents in the food we are eating compared to 20 or 30 years ago.  Also if we look at the survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition, SL&Aacute;N, which is the Government's own information, there are serious deficiencies in what Irish people are eating.  Only 35% of the population is eating the advised five servings of fruit and vegetables a day; 20% are eating three portions of dairy and 60% are not eating two portions of fish.  There is a fantasy about how it would be if we all ate the right food, but we are not.  Irish people are not eating our ideal diet.  In the absence of proper health intervention and prevention, people are trying to do the best that they can.  Many are addressing dietary deficiencies.  Some 70% of first-time patients attending Cork University Hospital rheumatology department were deficient in vitamin D and 26% of them were seriously deficient.  That is every patient who went for a first appointment to rheumatology.</p> <p>  As a GP, I can tell the committee they will no longer do vitamin D tests for general practitioners.  There is a lot of scientific evidence showing that the medical supplements of vitamin D do not provide the adjuncts of vitamin K1, boron and magnesium.  Many Irish people are also deficient in magnesium.  Iron deficiency in toddlers is widespread.  There are food supplements based on dried apricots and dried fruit, which they are not eating for their parents for one reason or another.  That is the reality based on the Government's own health information in the SL&Aacute;N survey.</p></speech>

The science behind all of this is undisputed.  For example, treating ulcers in elderly people is greatly enhanced by a multivitamin.  I refer also to treating iron deficiency in children.  Many people who have chronic illnesses cannot assimilate different forms of vitamins, for instance the difference between B12 as a supplement and methyl B12.  One can treat gout with vitamin C.  There is a reference in these documents to 13 meta-analyses, systematic reviews showing that vitamin C can treat gout.  Because of all the side effects and gut devastation of analgesics, and liver problems, more and more doctors are using colchicine long term, which causes a deficiency in B12.  Even using pharmaceuticals can cause vitamin deficiencies.  My son has epilepsy.  He has been treated with epilepsy medication.  Not one doctor has told him about depletion in B vitamins and folic acid.  There is a knowledge deficit.</p> <p>  Nothing is perfect on either side of a issue but to describe what people are seeking to do for their own health - I cannot understand the logic of putting no VAT or medicine but putting VAT on food supplements, which is people trying to help themselves.  They might not always get it right but they are trying to help themselves.  A local health food store is likely to give the most accurate advice that people have time to give.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

It is true because of the peculiarities of VAT law.  I will hand over to Mr. Hurley here but it appears that if we break the continuity of the allowance of zero VAT for a product, the EU will say we cannot re-establish it.</p></speech>

The cut-off date was 1 January 1991.  Ireland had a zero rate for food on that date, which included food supplements under Revenue's own interpretation of the VAT directive, which is repeated in its guidance throughout the years.  The products that were permitted to be zero rated at that time could continue to be zero rated but after that date, we could not bring in any new zero rates.  If we were to legislate to exclude food supplements from zero rate the same way as other products are excluded, such as sweets, crisps, cakes and biscuits, although they are afforded a reduced rate, thereafter we would not be able to change that legislation and reintroduce them at the zero rate because that would, in effect, be introducing a new VAT rate.  The fact is that on 1 January 1991 these products were food.  They were entitled to the zero rate under the EU rules.  Revenue's claiming that there is a concession places us in an extraordinary situation.  Ireland was treating food supplements as food and was compliant with EU VAT legislation but, if this was understood as a concession, we would be in breach of EU rules and possibly open to EU infringement proceedings.</p></speech>

Government and Revenue are giving away our authority on this.  We are giving away any scope to change our minds once the impact has been studied.</p></speech>

It is up to Irish authorities to interpret national legislation and we always interpreted national legislation to include food supplements as food.  There are other types of non-conventional food or not ordinary everyday food, for example food-grade chemicals - all these numbers from E100 up to E900 - which are zero rated at the moment.  Revenue considers them to be food.  They are not ordinary conventional food but they are still included under the umbrella term of food and as such zero rated.  They can only be not zero rated by being excluded from the food and drink table that is in the VAT legislation.  That is the only way a food cannot be zero rated.</p></speech>

People take supplements because they need them in the main.  The serious consequences of what the witnesses have said is an administrative error are quite daunting.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  People can then buy these supplements online at 3% VAT, so we are giving away all of that as well.  It is crazy.</p><p>That is in addition to the jobs that are created by health food stores.  We have a great health food store in Belmullet, as well as a chemist who supplies health foods and employs local people.  This measure makes no sense, even from a purely economic point of view.</p></speech>

I have been in the European Parliament which debated whether prunes were a laxative for four or five years.  There is no evidence that prunes are a laxative.  Therefore, according to the regulations, the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, had to state that prunes were not a health food.  The debate went on for a long time because many other issues hinged on the case.  I wish the committee well with the amount of administration, people hours and paper that will go into what is such a minor change.  It will be phenomenally difficult.  The same applies to herbal teas and medicines and considering what is a botanical and what is a food.  There are three different lists in the EU, including what is known as the BELFRIT list.  What is being opened up is huge.</p></speech>

Many people with iron problems, who cannot tolerate gastrointestinal side effects of pharma products such as Galfer or Feospan, can often tolerate food-based iron.  That is another significant category.  Another is vitamin D for the over-65s and essential fatty acids for those who do not eat oily fish or do not have good oils in their diet.  There is a major movement towards veganism and vegetarianism.  These diets are deficient in omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids.  People are choosing to change their diet and replace those essential elements by using food supplements in a knowledgeable way.  They are some examples.  Another area is children's multivitamin supplements and vitamin D.  We do not pay enough attention to vitamin D.  The governments of all other countries at the same latitude as Ireland and further north advise their entire populations to take vitamin D.</p></speech>

His specialty is research on age-related macular degeneration, which is the degeneration of the back part of the eye.  It is a leading cause of blindness in Ireland in the over-50s.  He has studied the condition for years and is one of the world's leading researchers in this area.  He presents his research internationally and is based in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  He has estimated that the cost of providing the correct level of supplementation with carotenoids, which are his specialty, for this single condition free of charge to sufferers of this cause of blindness in Ireland would be &euro;93 million over five years.  The State would save &euro;210 million over the same period because the treatment, the only recourse people have as the disease progresses, is enormously expensive.  He reckons that blindness costs Ireland &euro;135 million per annum, which is a significant cost to the State.  There is an enormous cost-benefit to the State of encouraging people to take these types of supplements.  It helps to prevent the decimation of their quality of life while also avoiding the excessive and extreme cost of trying to save the vision of the people in question.  If we were to choose one product or one area, it would have to be age-related macular degeneration because it of the debilitating effect blindness has on quality of life.  The State is being lumbered with an enormous cost to try to make up the shortfall when medical intervention becomes necessary.</p></speech>

Most doctors now advise people to go to their health food store for probiotics.  Whether one calls these products a medicine or food, they fall exactly into the middle ground.  Significant research has been done and presented internationally by Cork University Hospital.  A particular brand has been researched and must be sold mainly through agencies that require the products to be sold at two or three times the price to ordinary customers.  Be that as it may.  There will be a major argument on what is a food and what is a medicine.  People are increasingly being advised by their doctors to buy probiotics at a health food store after a regular course of antibiotics.</p></speech>

Irish people have a well established tradition of using these types of products.  It has become part of our everyday culture.  One gentleman who was in hospital told me he was in a ward with five or six other people, all of whom looked at him as if he had two heads because he was not taking any supplements.  They asked why in the name of God he was not taking anything to protect his health.  He asked me what he needed to get back on his feet and recover well.  That shows that supplements are a major part of our approach to safeguarding our health and the health of our families.  Babies, children and everyone else, all the way up to seniors, are using products that are appropriate to them to improve their health and ensure they are in good form.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses list three or four of the best selling products, their current price and how much they would cost if VAT were applied?  We can then factor in Brexit.  VAT and Brexit will be the two major issues for the witnesses.  If I went to Mr. Ronan's shop and bought four different products, how much would they cost, taking into account VAT changes and Brexit?</p></speech>

Applying the 23% VAT rates brings that to &euro;8.36 and taking into account the effect of Brexit as well, the price will go over &euro;10.  A bottle containing 100 capsules of vitamin C from Solgar starts at &euro;19.65 but this could go to &euro;24.17 with the new VAT rate and &euro;27.25 after the effects of Brexit.  A commonly used probiotic costs &euro;25.99 for a 30-day supply and with a new VAT rate, this would rise to &euro;31.97 and to &euro;36.05 after taking into account the effect of Brexit.  The product would be pushed from &euro;25 to &euro;36, meaning nearly &euro;11 would be added to the price if the worst happens.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I might have asked have already been addressed.  In the opening statement the witnesses indicated that the tax treatment of these products is currently the same whether the product is sold in a supermarket, food store or pharmacy.  Is there a definition of a food supplement?  I presume if I go to Tesco I can buy garlic powder, turmeric or products that people might use to benefit their health.  Have the Revenue Commissioners been a bit vague about this food versus food supplement definition?</p></speech>

The interpretation used to be that this was just food.  That was old guidance from the Revenue Commissioners published many times.

When a food supplement is placed on a shelf, there must be an indication that it is a food supplement.  There can be no vagueness in how it is regulated.  These products are very strictly regulated under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  It must align 100% to the European directives dealing with food supplements and there is no vagueness in that respect.

Any manufacturer, distributor or shop must be registered with the authorities as a food business operator and these are inspected by environmental health officers in the same way as a food business.  There are very strict controls and there must be compliance with food information and consumer laws.  There cannot be claims that are disallowed by law.  It is strict regulation.</p><p>The interpretation is in line with EU VAT legislation because annex III to the EU VAT directive permits reduced rates to apply to a number of products and they include foodstuffs and animal feeding stuffs.  Revenue interprets that to mean that food supplements for farm animals are also zero rated.  That is on Revenue's VAT rates index.  Ingredients to produce food are also in that reduced rates section, as are supplements to the normal diet.  The reduced rate, which is our <i>de facto</i>zero rate, can apply to food supplements.</p></speech>

The traffic after Palmerstown is chaotic.  I apologise for arriving at the end of the meeting.</p> <p>  I am very much supportive of this campaign on the basis that I know, from people who come to me, many of whom are elderly, that many of those health products are a considerable support.  I know of one person who had to be taken into hospital numerous times in the middle of the night with serious pain.  This person started taking a special supplement, which has meant the emergency services no longer come out and a hospital bed is no longer taken up.  That side of things should not be forgotten.</p> <p>  The health food sector is one of the few sectors to have expanded n rural Ireland.  These businesses are opening in many towns where other businesses have closed.  God knows, we want more of these developments in rural towns and villages.  I do not want to hold up the meeting.  I am very supportive of the campaign.  I hope the representations made today will be taken into account in the budget and VAT will not be applied to many of these products which are very important, particularly to our ever growing ageing population.</p></speech>

Our entire industry feels as if it is on a precipice.  As a previous speaker observed, if we lose the ability to rate food supplements at zero, that ability will be lost forever.  We stress that we are at the mercy of the Minister in this regard.  It is within his power to act.  While he may choose to accept the Revenue view that this is driven by regulation, the current interpretation of the regulations would serve perfectly well.

We understand the valuable work of the committee and the importance of these hearings and welcome the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.  My opening statement will provide some background on AIG in Ireland and then address the costs and availability of insurance in Ireland.</p> <p>  AIG is 100 years old this year and has operated in Ireland for 43 years.  AIG companies have a team of 900 people in Ireland.  The team is involved in insurance and shared services, both domestically and internationally.  Domestically, AIG is the seventh largest general insurer and the second largest health insurance provider in Ireland.  In addition, the AIG team in Ireland provides IT support to AIG operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  The AIG team also provides treasury and investment services to AIG globally from Ireland.  Our general insurance business is roughly &euro;300 million in premiums, 50% in insuring individuals and 50% in insuring companies.  Our principal lines are financial, for example, directors and officers insurance, professional indemnity and cyber insurance, motor insurance, travel insurance, liability insurance and property insurance.  For 40 years, AIG has been the insurance partner for large and small companies, not-for-profit organisations and consumers in Ireland.  Operating in over 80 countries, our global footprint combined with our local presence and knowledge has enabled us to support the insurance needs of Irish based companies expanding in the EU and around the world, as well as the insurance needs of US and other multinational businesses in Ireland.  We are proud of the part we play in safeguarding people and property.</p> <p>  The high cost of insurance has been an ongoing challenge in Ireland for many years.  Representing the Government back in 1992, the former Minister, the late Des O&rsquo;Malley, stated in the D&aacute;il that insurance costs in other countries are only a fraction of what they are here.  However, the claims and awards in other countries are also only a fraction of what they are here.  Inevitably, the former is a reflection of the latter and that will continue.  As has been discussed, Ireland has experienced significantly higher personal injuries awards from its courts than comparable European jurisdictions, with awards for minor injuries, on average, 4.4 times higher than in the UK, according to the Personal Injuries Commission.  Claims awards and legal costs make up the majority of insurance premiums, and this is a key factor in the cost of insurance in Ireland.  The higher awards arise from a combination of factors, including the relatively high award levels for personal injury claims set out in the book of quantum, the inconsistency of awards made by the courts, and a time-consuming and costly appeal process.  There is real commitment from Government, the Oireachtas and key stakeholders, including the insurance industry, to implement change.  We welcome the Judicial Council Act 2019 as it provides an opportunity to address some of the root causes of higher insurance costs by creating a fairer and more consistent framework for the allocation of personal injury awards.  We look forward to the establishment of the personal injuries guidelines commission, under a judicial council, to oversee the delivery of new personal injuries guidelines.  We also support the Civil Liability (Capping of General Damages) Bill 2019.</p> <p>  It is critical for the market that insurers are well capitalised with a strong governance and risk management framework.  For insurers to continue to provide services to consumers and businesses, they also need to be profitable.  Although the Irish motor insurance market made a profit for the first time in many years in 2017, liability remains loss-making.  In the last six years of published data, the liability market has made a net underwriting loss of over &euro;500 million and the motor market has made a net underwriting loss of over &euro;800 million.  This has led to some companies exiting the market or exiting poorly performing segments, which has impacted the cost and availability of cover in these areas.  We want to work together with the Government and Oireachtas to create a sustainable, fair and consistent cost framework for insurance claims, allowing AIG to play its role supporting businesses and consumers in Ireland.</p></speech>

Aviva has been operating in the Irish market for nearly 240 years.  This year, we reinforced our commitment to this market by completing the establishment of separate legal entities in Ireland for our general insurance and life assurance businesses.  This allows us to continue to protect our customers and serve their best interests in Ireland post-Brexit.  We employ circa 1,600 people in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  We are a socially responsible insurer that seeks to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our customers, over the long term.  We contribute significantly to national sports and community organisations through our sponsorship of the Aviva Stadium and our support of charitable and community causes.  We are one of the largest providers of insurance in the Irish market, with a general insurance market share of approximately 15%.  To give a sense of that figure, we insure one in every five small and medium enterprises, SMEs, one in every five motorists and one in every six homes.  We are well placed to know and understand this market and we exist to pay our customers claims.  We hear from our customers on a daily basis about the difficulties they are facing as a result of the problems in the insurance market.</p> <p>  What is driving the cost and availability of the insurance sectors under discussion today?  We point to three areas that have caused challenges for profitability in the market.  Those challenges are the increasing cost of claims, a reduction in investment income and a reduction in premiums.  The problems faced by the insurance market became a consumer issue from 2015 onwards, manifesting first in significant increases in customer premiums and thereafter in significant reduced availability of cover for certain market segments.  Most domestic insurers reduced capacity for volatile and unprofitable segments of the market, including leisure, and these were replaced primarily by UK-based insurers.  The additional problem, as highlighted in the media recently, is that these UK insurers are now exiting the market.  Business customers in these sectors can find it difficult to get a quote and if they do, it can be at prohibitively expensive prices.</p> <p>  The cost of insurance working group was established in 2016 to address the issue of increasing insurance costs.  The group correctly identified the need to establish the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC.  One of the most significant aspects of the PIC was that for one of the first times ever, it included representatives of all stakeholders, including the Law Society, insurers, the Bar Council, the medical profession, consumer and competition representatives and relevant Government Departments.  The excellent work of retired Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, who chaired the PIC, confirmed that personal injury award levels in Ireland are 4.4 times those in England and Wales, with the commission unanimously recommending the establishment of a judicial council to recalibrate awards back to reasonable levels.  When whiplash awards are aligned to levels in England and Wales, this will result in substantial premium reductions.</p><p>What are the key changes that need to be made to improve the landscape for the cost and availability of insurance?  The insurance landscape continues to create significant issues for Irish customers in terms of premium volatility and the withdrawal of insurance underwriters from what is an open market here.  The issue of excessive award levels was validated by the cost of insurance working group and the Personal Injuries Commission and Aviva fully supports the recommendations they outlined.  However, our customers remain frustrated that in spite of all the activity in implementing changes, there has been no real reduction in claims costs and, as a consequence, we cannot deliver more substantial premium reductions and sustainable premiums.  </p><p> Business customers face an additional challenge.  The excessive award levels have created a "compo" culture that is significantly impacting the liability market in Ireland.  In our experience, the courts are taking a much broader view of the duty and standard of care.  We are asking the Government to review the law of negligence as it applies to personal injury actions against small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and community and voluntary organisations in Ireland.</p><p> What has Aviva done to promote, encourage and deliver these required changes?  In 2015, we launched our &ldquo;road to reform&rdquo; agenda and wrote to our customers highlighting the reasons for the rising cost of premiums and the changes required to reduce the cost.  We have since proactively engaged with key stakeholders including Ministers, Opposition spokespersons and senior officials in the Departments of An Taoiseach, Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport on the drivers of premium increases and the urgent reforms required.  We recognise the need to substantially increase our capacity to prevent and detect fraud.  We have invested heavily in our fraud team, which now has more than 30 dedicated fraud investigators working alongside a network of more than 50 additional claims investigators nationwide.  Over the past three years we have worked very closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have increased the reporting of criminal disclosures to it under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  In addition, we have proactively engaged with the Garda, industry stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues of claims fraud, ghost broking, which involves the sale of counterfeit policies, and fraud tourism, involving claimants who travel to Ireland from countries with lower award levels solely to commit insurance fraud.</p><p> What is Aviva&rsquo;s commitment to Irish consumers if the required changes are delivered?  Aviva will continue to operate prudently from an underwriting and pricing perspective, as it always has, to ensure that we are here to protect our customers when they need us most, namely, at point of claim.  The target return we hope to achieve is a small percentage of the overall cost of insurance.  Most of a premium goes towards paying our customers' claims.  For example, 65% of motor insurance premiums goes toward paying claims, with a further 11% going towards paying levies and claims from uninsured drivers.  The cost of claims remains the largest influencing factor on the cost of insurance in Ireland.  We would be delighted to pass on lower premiums to our customers who are bearing the brunt of these excessive awards.  Changes in the awards handed down are essential if we are to deliver lower and more sustainable premiums to our customers and we encourage the Government to prioritise the completion of this reform process.  We are committed to ensuring our customers will benefit directly from any such reductions when claims costs come down.  </p><p> What is Aviva&rsquo;s request of the Government and the committee?  The biggest factor determining the cost and availability of insurance is the cost of claims.  The mechanism to address this is a recalibration of award levels as provided for in the Judicial Council Act.  Aviva calls for the establishment of the judicial council without further delay and for it to then establish the personal injuries guideline committee to recalibrate injury award levels as a matter of urgency rather than in accordance with the maximum timeframe permitted under the legislation.  Aviva also asks the Government to review the law of negligence as it applies to personal injuries actions against SMEs and community and voluntary organisations.</p><p> I thank the Chair and members.</p></speech>

Zurich welcomes the opportunity to be part of this discussion, contribute to the work of the committee and discuss the next steps in the reforms required to address the challenges on the agenda today.  As this is our first time to appear before the committee, I will briefly introduce Zurich Ireland.  It was originally founded in Cork in 1952 and has been part of the global Zurich Group since 1998.  Our AA- financial strength rating means Zurich customers can rely on us to consistently deliver on our promises when it matters.  We are a proudly Irish business with a 100% local management team focused solely on the Irish market, with 380 employees across our Dublin and Wexford offices.  We write over &euro;300 million in premiums in Ireland, giving us a market share of approximately 9%.  Our business profile is similar to that in the market overall, with 45% of premiums in motor insurance, 30% in property and the remaining 25% spread across a number of more specialised business lines including farm, financial lines and liability business.</p> <p>  Like most companies in the market, Zurich experienced the ups and downs of the Irish insurance cycle in recent years, with underwriting losses after several years of falling premiums and rising claims costs across the industry.  In 2015 we enacted a turnaround programme to restore our business profitability.  By 2018 we had completed the programme and delivered a 6% underwriting profit on our written premiums.  Even during the turnaround period, we continued to experience consistently rising claims costs.  The continued rise in claims costs and volatility has been the key driver of increased insurance premiums and reduced availability of cover in certain lines across the Irish market.  We have worked to help drive change and reform and have been consistent and active supporters of the actions outlined in the reports of the cost of insurance working group which lay out a clear framework that can deliver real change for Irish customers in terms of internationally benchmarked claim awards, faster resolution of those claims and improved predictability of total claims costs which will deliver reduced cost and increased availability of insurance for Irish customers.</p> <p>  We accept that providing more consistent and transparent industry data to independent bodies such as the Central Bank will help all stakeholders to understand relevant trends and drivers of performance.  We have seen the useful impact of making such data available through the work of the Personal Injuries Commission which used independently verified industry data to drive an informed debate on the level of personal injury awards in Ireland and provide that Irish soft tissue injury awards are more than four times the level of such awards in the UK.  It determined the cost of inaction on the issue, with awards for such injuries increasing by more than &euro;900 each year benchmarked from 2011 to 2016.  We welcome, therefore, the recent passage of the Judicial Council Act through the Oireachtas.  It promises to be a significant step in reforming and modernising the way our courts work.  However, real measures need to be implemented as a matter of urgency to align the level of compensation awarded in Ireland with that in other jurisdictions.  We also welcome recent Court of Appeal rulings which recognise that minor injuries should attract appropriately modest general damages.  We acknowledge and welcome other key steps taken in 2019 such as the progress of the Civil Liability (Capping of General Damages) Bill and the commencement of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act which should enable more timely and accurate settlements to injured parties.</p> <p>  The introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in the early 2000s was a landmark event and initially led to material reductions in the duration and cost of claims as well as delivering reduced insurance premiums across the market.  These benefits have been eroded over time as more and more claimants have chosen to reject the recommended awards and instead pursue a longer, more adversarial and more costly settlement path.  The steps I have outlined are key enablers of reform and it is important to acknowledge progress that will benefit customers, insurers and society.  However we must also acknowledge and act on public frustration with the pace of change and the need for a continued sense of urgency.  All stakeholders need to remain engaged and vigilant to ensure the benefits are delivered and maintained from these actions and not allowed to erode over time as happened with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p> <p>  We recognise the committee&rsquo;s major concern regarding the cost and availability of insurance in the Irish market.  There are a number of factors, so how do we fix the problem?  The way forward is to continue to deliver the recommendations laid out in the reports of the cost of insurance working group, which lay out a comprehensive suite of reforms agreed through co-operation and commitment across multiple stakeholders.  We cannot get away from the fact that the single biggest input into our calculation of insurance premiums is the cost of claims.  Insurers transfer the risk and cost of claims and we share it across our portfolio.  This means the cost of claims directly impacts on every insurance premium we calculate and collect from our customers.  Our premiums must reflect the prevailing level of awards to ensure our business is sustainable.  If the level of injury awards and incurred legal costs reduce, this will drive meaningful reform in the claims environment which will deliver a stable and sustainable cost of insurance for businesses and consumers.  We want to be part of the solution and we welcome any help from the committee to maintain the necessary sense of urgency on reducing uncertainty and delivering these core reforms.  I wish to take this opportunity to confirm that we will pass on the benefits of reduced claim costs to our customers.  I thank the Chair and look forward to answering questions from members.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Rourke from AIG stated: "Claims awards and legal costs make up the majority of insurance premiums and this is a key factor in the cost of insurance in Ireland."  Mr. Quinlan from Aviva Ireland stated: "The cost of claims remains the largest influencing factor on the cost of insurance in Ireland."  Mr. Brennan, representing Zurich, stated: "We cannot get away from the fact that the single biggest input into our calculation of insurance premiums is the cost of claims."  I ask the witnesses to break down the premia into the cost of claims, awards, legal fees, administration and the profit margin that they seek to cover.  My request is simply to elicit the information and I ask Mr. Quinlan to respond first.</p></speech>

Let us consider a typical premium.  Our premia is made up as follows: Claims would represent 65% out of &euro;100 and of that 65% the legal fees would be 19% or 30%; levies, including for uninsured drivers, would be 11%; commissions to intermediaries would be 9%; our expenses would be 12%; and our profit would be 3% but that is a target.  From 2012 to 2018, one can see from the facts that we achieved nothing like that.</p></speech>

Am I correct to say that the target of profitability in Aviva is 3%?</p></speech>

If that is less than &euro;100 million then we are making money without having to rely on investment income, which we cannot do.  Our group, to attract capital in Ireland and remain safe, will require a combined operating ratio of 95% out of 100%.  It is important that we continue to attract capital here.  We are struggling to do so, certainly from the Lloyds market following its remediation of its book.</p></speech>

I cannot talk about our actual premiums but I can go a little bit further and talk about the theoretical premium calculation model.  To be very clear, for competition reasons, I am not saying this is exactly Zurich's premium.  Right now, if we consider motor insurance, roughly 30% of our claims are personal injury-type or soft tissue damage and we are four times the UK average.  If we reduced the figure to twice the UK average, which is reasonable, and thus a reduction of 50%, I think I could bring that 30% in a theoretical model down to 15%.  It would be quite reasonable that if that were to happen and insurers had reduced their prices, with all things being equal and somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should ask us a lot of questions.  I cannot really go much further than that.</p> <p>  For liability, where the vast majority of claims are injury related, it would be a higher percentage and probably close to 20%.  Again, this is a theoretical pricing model and not a commitment on Zurich's premiums, which I cannot give for competition reasons. </p></speech>

If one looks back, because we cannot look forward with pricing legislation, one can see that when the injuries board was established premiums dropped dramatically fairly quickly.  As the market has returned to profitability over the last couple of years one can already see decreases across the market, particularly on the motor side.</p></speech>

Why?  AIG broke even in 2017 yet it showed a loss of &euro;30 million on a turnover of &euro;280 million in premiums in 2018.  Have there been major write-offs?  Was the loss of &euro;30 million made after exceptional provisions were made?  A loss by AIG is out of kilter with what happened in the rest of the insurance industry.</p><p>Why is that?</p></speech>

How does that sit with section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011, which imposes an obligation on insurers to report suspicions of fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?

There is a protocol in place for reporting claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The section to which the Deputy refers includes a piece on providing "material assistance" to the garda&iacute;.  I do not believe that sending those 100 claims forward would be of material assistance.  We would not have had court level proof of fraud in all 100 cases.  That is quite important, even from a civil liability point of view, and then we must move on to a level of evidence that allows for prosecution for fraud.  It is quite a difficult offence to prosecute successfully.  We work very closely with garda&iacute; and will continue to do so.  I welcome the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced recently that it has increased resources in this area, and we look forward to working with it.  We would be very happy to take garda&iacute; through the other 96 cases if there is a change or improvement in the guidelines around what would provide material assistance to them.</p></speech>

There is a legal obligation on insurance companies to report suspicions of fraud.  Mr. Brennan's company, Zurich Insurance, determined that there were 100 fraudulent claims made in 2018 and in 96% of those cases the information has not been passed on to the Garda.  Zurich is therefore in breach of section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  It is up to the Garda to decide whether it has enough information to warrant a prosecution, once it is given that information.  The requirement in that section is that one has to provide the information where there is a suspicion of fraud.</p></speech>

The witnesses need to read section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  It is not for insurance companies to decide whether the evidence reaches the threshold for prosecution.  That is a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  The witnesses and their companies have a clear responsibility to report any suspicions of fraud to the Garda and allow its members to do the work for which they are trained.</p></speech>

According to our internal legal advice, we are compliant with the relevant Act in our reporting of fraud.  We have 80 people working on fraudulent claims and the division is headed by a former Garda superintendent.  We have taken a proactive and aggressive stance on fraud detection and prevention, of which the Deputy will be aware.  I will pass over to our claims director, Mr. Farrell, for the facts and figures on fraud cases, the percentages, numbers brought to court, and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1342" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100300002#N03500"><p>This is a real problem area.  Over the past three years, we have reported more than 500 claims to the Garda under section 19 and have reported an additional 100 this year alone.  The issue is not with the cases that are not reported, the vast majority of which will not provide material assistance to the Garda.  The real problem is with the ones that are reported.  Of the hundreds that have been reported, there have been virtually no convictions.  Garda&iacute; are incredibly hard-working, professional and dedicated people, but there is simply not sufficient capacity in the Garda with enough dedicated resources to follow up on fraud.  We are fighting fraud in AIG, with 30 employees backed up by 50 full-time investigators.</p> <p>  I refer to what happens when a case goes to court.  Take for example the case of a businessman who burns down his premises, against whom we plead fraud in open court to defend that case on behalf of innocent policyholders, as is our obligation.  We are forced to spend 21 days in the High Court, at a cost of more than &euro;1 million.  That man then simply walks away from his claim, and that &euro;1 million has to be paid by SME customers around the country.  That is why their premiums have gone up despite not having made any claims.  As long as claims in this country are a free-risk endeavour, people will continue to make fraudulent claims.  We need assistance in this area.  There needs to be far more effective follow-up on fraudulent crimes, because they are crimes and they have a real impact.</p> <p>  In another case, one of our customers rear-ended a third party.  The cost of the damage was &euro;80 and no personal injuries were reported at the time of the accident.  Some time after the accident we were presented with two personal injury claims, which is not unusual.  The first claim that went through the court was awarded &euro;105,000.  The legal fees were &euro;98,000, though that was subsequently adjusted to &euro;65,000.  That was only for one of the injuries.  There is a very real problem with the compo culture in this country and it has to be addressed.</p></speech>

People submit fraudulent claims that did not happen in the manner they are presented.  In some cases they are staged.  Even when these people are thrown out of court, there is no effective follow-up or prosecutions.  There needs to be a deterrent.  Our awards are worth 4.4 times the value of similar claims in the UK, which is a huge magnet.  Some people come into this country with no other purpose than to perpetrate crime by committing fraud.  We are currently defending ourselves from a fraudulent claim by a gentleman from England.  When he came to Ireland to attend a medical examination for the claim, he caused another single car accident that same day.  This is a very real problem that we have to address.  It will ultimately be addressed by bringing down the high cost of awards.  If we reduce the figure from 4.4 to one, many of these problems will go away.  Our customers cannot understand why the Minister has not signed the Judicial Council Act into effect.</p><p>Why are we waiting one more day?  We call on him to sign it today.</p></speech>

Our guests will hear from many members of the committee that we want additional action in respect of an insurance fraud unit and to ensure there is not a revolving door in the courts, with those who make fraudulent claims just walking out with no losses.  Deputy Michael McGrath has prepared legislation in that regard.  Nevertheless, this meeting is about the industry and I wish to address the figures, not anecdotes or stories.  Mr. Farrell stated Aviva reported 100 fraudulent claims to the Garda.  What proportion is that of the overall number of suspected fraudulent claims?</p></speech>

For the three-year period before that, it was 500, or approximately 20%.  A total of 20% of all the claims we suspect to be fraud are reported.</p></speech>

Every claim that is believed to be fraudulent needs to be reported.  What percentage of claims made to the company does Mr. Farrell believe are fraudulent?

Under section 19, the obligation is to report them where they would provide material assistance.  We have regular engagement with the Garda.

Despite the level of the fees we pay, even when someone walks away scot-free for something that was obviously wrong, that is what we do.  The cases we report to the Garda are those that offer material assistance, as adjudicated by our legal counsel and head of fraud, who is a former superintendent with the Garda.  We could tick a box, dump over all our claims and say we report every single one.  We saw what the Criminal Assets Bureau did to the criminal fraternity and we need the same in the form of a dedicated fraud unit in the Garda.

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the cost and availability of insurance.  I can categorically state that if we increase the number of section 19 reports we make, it will make absolutely no difference to the cost or availability of insurance.

Regarding price optimisation and dual pricing, he may have read in the media that I have asked the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC,  to investigate the issue.  I will be providing evidence next week to the CCPC.  Dual pricing is controversial.  It punishes loyalty and targets vulnerable policyholders.  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, across the water is investigating this practice and its initial investigations show that not all companies operate price optimisation.  Will Mr. Quinlan clarify whether his company, Aviva, operates price optimisation and dual pricing?</p></speech>

Aviva offers a lower new business price point and we look at renewals.  Some 33% of our renewal customers are offered prices lower than our new business price.

Does Mr. Mahon accept, given the findings so far, that the more loyal customers are, the more likely it is that they will have a price premium?  Aviva's experts in price optimisation need to understand behavioural attitudes so that people willing to renew repeatedly will be penalised with higher premiums.  Is that what this really means?</p></speech>

While the FCA has a number of issues with the practice, and its interim report is being released tomorrow morning, it stated in its initial review that differential pricing is not inherently unfair, harmful or always results in poor customer outcomes.  Differential pricing encourages new business competition within the market.  We are here to talk about cost and availability of insurance.  Adjusting differential pricing will have no impact on the cost of insurance.  It will, instead, harmonise it.  Costs will be increased for new business customers, of which there are roughly 500,000 in the Irish market each year.  It will also marginally reduce costs for renewal customers, but the average cost will remain exactly the same.  I argue that because competition will be reduced on the new business side, availability may be reduced.</p> <p>  We would welcome a review of this issue.  Our sister company in the UK has led the market there with Aviva Plus.  Interestingly, this initiative, which has been in operation for 12 months, involves making a commitment to customers who take out the company's product that their renewal price will be no more than the new business price.  Despite that product being available, the company sells more on its standard product with a lower price point than it does on the Aviva Plus point.  Customers, therefore, are choosing not to go down the route of level pricing.  They still want to go for the cheapest price in the majority of cases.  When our UK colleagues test a product that may well work within the Irish market, we will look at bringing in something similar.  We are working closely with our underwriting colleagues in the UK and reviewing with interest their offering.</p></speech>

This an important engagement and an opportunity for us, on behalf of the people we represent, to hold the insurance companies to account, tease out issues and get some answers.  I will start by continuing with the issue raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty regarding differential pricing, as it has been described.  How does it work in practice?  What is it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Mahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100300002#P01300"><p>It is a costing initiative.  We use it, as many other industries do, to supplement new business pricing in the market.  It allows us to be more competitive within that market.  In my experience, in the area of broadband, for example, I pay four times the new business price for broadband.  I am also paying 70% more for my bank charges than a new business customer would pay at the same bank.  Similarly, in utilities, I am paying about 30% more.  That is my experience.  Differential pricing is not, therefore, uncommon across a number of industries.  We do it to stimulate competitiveness within the market.  From the point of view of insurers, differential pricing is not a profit-generating initiative but more of a means of generating new business.  If it was removed, it would be beneficial overall for the insurance industry.  That is why we are pushing in the UK to see if we can road test that product.  We would then be selling on key differences, such as brand, product and financial stability.  Those would be the main reasons customers make decisions.</p></speech>

In effect, Mr. Mahon is stating that if they just renew at the premium quoted on the renewal documentation, they will probably pay more than they would if they were a new customer or simply went online to get a new quote, which might well come from Aviva Ireland.</p></speech>

The question concerns customer fairness.  Pricing sophistication is trying to get the right price for the right risk.  There is a secondary issue of new business versus renewal pricing.  The theory behind this is that we are trying to do is stimulate competition and new business flows by offering a lower new business price.  How is that fair for me as an existing customer?  Over the course of my time as a customer with Aviva - we have an average policy duration of between five and seven years - he or she would expect to pay the identical amount, notwithstanding that he or she might have come in on a cheaper price point.</p> <p>  Can people tweak the system, as was done with fronting, by going back in and claiming to be a new business customer?  Yes, that is possible.  The level of that difference for us is 3%, on average.  It can be higher or lower, depending on individual circumstances.  It is something we are looking at.  We have launched a big pilot in the UK.  It is not really working as we thought it might and other companies have not followed suit.  We await the findings of the FCA to see if this becomes mandatory.  If that is the case, we will welcome that in this market because we will go-----</p></speech>

If we break this down to brass tacks, however, is it not the case that loyal customers, those policyholders with Aviva who renew year in and year out and do not ask questions, are the biggest losers?  They are not availing of the cheaper premiums that would be available if they were new customers.  Is it not that simple at the end of the day?</p></speech>

Some 85% of our business comes through brokers who do their own checking of cover and pricing.  We have a high retention rate.  People will look at an opportunity with a new business promotion.  It can involve utilities, banks, etc.  With a company such as Aviva, however, customers will look to see if they will be treated fairly over time.  They will want to know if their premiums will average out to be the same as they would have been if they had shopped around every year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.1414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100300002#P01800"><p>Is it not the case that Aviva is taking advantage of consumer behaviour?  To take the example of motor insurance, many people get their renewal policy in the post.  That document will still not tell them what they paid last year.  It is necessary to check up on that information.  Customers look at those policy renewal documents and think that the figure presented is roughly what they paid the previous year.  Most people are busy and just renew the same policy.  They do not even ring up to try to get a reduction.  If they do ring up, however, and state they had contacted one of Aviva's competitors and were offered a policy some &euro;100 cheaper, then Aviva will probably match that competing policy.  That is the reality.  Is the lesson here that loyalty is punished?</p></speech>

If trust or loyalty is broken with customers, the company involved will lose those customers.  People have that ability to shop around.  As I stated, some 85% of our business comes through brokers.  We retain our customers because we treat them fairly.  We are more than happy to change the practice, if that is provided for in legislation.  All companies would need to be involved to bring that about and ensure that the 500,000 people who benefit from a new business discount or quote every year maintain those savings.</p><p>We got a detailed set of questions from Deputy Pearse Doherty that we will come back to and answer fully.</p></speech>

The witness referred to it in utility companies.  Of course, they do it.  They offer a better deal if one is a new customer signing up whereas if one is locked into a contract, one cannot avail of that until the contract expires.  This is not the only industry that is doing it.  Banks are doing it for the biggest transaction that people have in their life, which is their mortgage.  They are not proactively trying to tell a customer he or she could get a better deal, even by switching to a different product with that bank or by switching bank.  That is not happening.</p> <p>  It is a job for all of us to address the issue of inertia among consumers and we will do that.

I would point again to what Mr. Quinlan said about brokers because we get over 90% of our business through brokers.  It is a commercial reality.  It is the way the marketplace works.  However, I would point out that, similar to Aviva, in a five-to-seven year duration, one is looking at a 15% to 20% switch rate.  If one looks at those other industries we talked about, such a switch rate would be a very high one for those industries.  We are making it easy for customers to move around.  The broker community enables that.</p> <p>  One of the challenges, if one looks at this, is it seems easy to say one can legislate for it but when one starts to figure out how it would work in practice, it would create all sorts of other loopholes that would make it more difficult.  The effect it would have on the marketplace in the short term is difficult to know.</p></speech>

The reality is our policyholders will pay these costs through increased premiums or we must get these costs back from the fraudster, which, of course, is difficult to do.  We attempt to do that but often these are not people of substance from whom we can recover costs.  We urgently need greater and more dedicated resources in the Garda to work with us and we need to work on a more effective deterrent for fraud cases in the courts.</p></speech>

We are one of the largest providers of cover for sports clubs and sporting associations in the country and our connection with the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, has only served to cement that.

As those businesses' insurance renewals come up and no policy is offered to them, they face closure.  Many have closed and many more will close.  Have the witnesses any hope to offer that sector that it is an area of business their firms would be prepared to consider and to write business in or is their message that until the personal injuries climate is improved they will not be prepared to consider it?  What is the bottom line?</p></speech>

We are absolutely looking to cover these areas when we can.  I spoke to a leading Lloyds broker this week to understand what was going on from a Lloyds' perspective.  Lloyds would have been a safety valve for the giving of cover, often at higher prices.  I can give the Deputy verbatim the feedback I got.  Lloyds itself is struggling to retain some of its capital providers.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was over in its offices recently.  It has introducd a newe syndicate-in-a-box initiative where over a three-month period one can become a writer of business.  However, what is happening is that under a new regime they have to write for underwriting profit.  We have seen many syndicates which wrote business here not getting their business plans approved.  Amlin Insurance had business of &pound;250 million sterling, a chunk of which would have been Irish business, which will no longer be written.  It has not got permission to do so.  C.V. Starr and R&amp;Q Insurance were also affected.  The fact that Excel Insurance and AXA Insurance - AXA being the general insurance company in Ireland and one of the biggest in the world - cannot see a way to write their leisure insurance business gives us an indication of the real challenges.  The sector that will benefit most immediately from the reforms we are calling for will be the leisure sector.  In the medium term we would be prepared to work, certainly at Insurance Ireland level, on alternative approaches to give some sort of cover here but it is complex.  It is not without its challenges.</p></speech>

I know a particular Lloyds broker was speaking to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about certain vehicles for this particular sector.  There is always a way but there is a level of risk that needs to be retained by the customer.  Each and every excess is there already.  We are talking about a crisis where no cover is being given and we need to come together to see if we can address it and maybe even accelerate reforms in this particular area.</p></speech>

We called on the Minister to sign the proposed judicial council into effect immediately without any further delay.  We also called out the additional problem people face in the small and medium enterprise market where the issue is not only the size of the awards but the automatic entitlement to compensation.  That is the "compo" culture.  We have seen examples of that where a person can sit down at a table in a restaurant and simply knock his or her knee off the leg of a table and get an award of thousands of euro.  We are calling for the law of negligence to be reviewed to ensure it is put back into a more affordable and sustainable area where genuine negligence is compensated for but simple accidents are not.</p></speech>

There are still sections of the Judicial Council Act that have not commenced.  As to when a judicial council will be up and running, perhaps it will be by the end of the year.  The personal injuries committee then has to be set up, which would probably take a further few months, and it would then have to draw up the personal injuries guidelines.  I do not get the sense there will be any great solution to this quickly from the process that is under way.  Is Mr. Quinlan's feedback to us that this is the only way to do it in terms of a game changer which would result in a more competitive insurance market for consumers and, ultimately, improve the availability of insurance and reduce premiums for consumers?</p></speech>

As we have seen recently with overseas insurers traditionally passporting into our market, their pulling out of the market completely is a big concern.  When we consider what happened on the back of the Setanta Insurance collapse with the collapse of Gable Insurance, Enterprise Insurance and Qudos Insurance, many of these businesses look at Ireland and wonder what is going on.  We need to change that and make it more attractive to existing players because we have all got parent companies that we have to convince to keep our capital here and we want other capital to flow in equally.</p></speech>

We have replies to parliamentary questions that show there is a number of firms that have not aligned their regulatory status and, therefore, they will lose the right to passport in the sale of insurance services in the Irish market from 1 November.  What is the witnesses' sense of what potentially might happen in a no-deal scenario to the insurance market in Ireland?</p></speech>

It is an absolute risk.  It is a real concern.  I know that around the Insurance Ireland table all the big firms have planned for a hard Brexit but there is a concern.  One of the feedbacks from Lloyds is that the concern about Ireland in terms of volatility, levels of profitability and Brexit really dampen down enthusiasm to write business here so it is a concern.</p></speech>

It is about identifying behavioural change and punishing loyalty.  It is not about incentives for new businesses but the fact that the companies employ people who have skills related to the behavioural attitudes of their customers and looking at algorithms to identify people who are more likely to renew automatically, and punishing them with higher premiums.  Would that not be a fair summary of what dual pricing is?</p></speech>

The description states that a number of price leads are being recruited in both the personal and commercial lines, so there was not just one but a number.  It goes on to state that Aviva would like the applicant to have knowledge and experience of the full range of standards, risk modelling, customer behaviour modelling and price optimisation.</p></speech>

That is absolutely not true.  We outlined a process where, to stimulate competition in the marketplace, there can be a difference between a new price offer and a renewal, but over the lifetime of the policyholder, the customer will pay the same amount.  Can a person play the system by pretending to be new versus renewal?  Potentially.  We have seen fronting in the past.  It is not our intention to treat our loyal customers unfairly.</p></speech>

Why is Aviva recruiting people who need experience in customer behavioural models?</p><p>Is Aviva recruiting people who have to have experience in customer behavioural models?  Is it not the case that the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, report, which Aviva is involved in across the water, states that if people  renew with an insurance company they are likely to be penalised in their premium?  Let me quote some statistics: a person who renews four times with the same company will pay on average 20% more as a loyalty premium.  That will be 28% if they renew five times and up to 40% if they renew over ten times.  This is a result of price customisation or what is called dual pricing, something that Aviva has just recruited.</p></speech>

We have a dedicated team on Aviva plus where renewals and new business are exactly the same.  That pilot is one year old.  The figures are not encouraging in terms of getting more business.  People like to shop around and they like the dynamic of going in with a lower new business price knowing that they will pay more over time.  We are certainly not hiring people to play any fast tricks with consumer behaviour.  There is a broad definition of consumer behaviour, including where people live, fewer buying houses, new types of cover, etc.  It certainly is not to penalise our customers in any way.</p></speech>

Is that not the model?  Is that not why Aviva is talking to people with expertise in behavioural analysis, is that not the point of big data mining?  The company targets individuals using these algorithms to say that this individual has renewed several times, is less price sensitive and therefore it can charge an additional premium.</p></speech>

We have recently seen claims against community groups which might not have been made years ago.  The environment today is that people do take claims even against a group of people who have put their time in for free, doing valuable work for their community.  That makes it very difficult for us to price any other way than by considering the cost of claims that these groups will incur and allow for that.  It goes back to delivering on the cost of claims.

That is why we called specifically for a review of the law of negligence because too many claims are being paid out.  There are two significant problems, first, the cost of the claims in this country, which is 4.4 times that in England and Wales.  That has been validated by the excellent work of the retired judge, Mr. Nicholas Kearns.  Second, an additional problem for the groups the Senator speaks about is the sheer frequency of claims and the fact that every accident now requires compensation.  It is part of the "compo" culture.  We are calling for a fresh review to determine what can be done so that payments are made only where actual negligence happens.  That is critical to help in that area.</p></speech>

Two of my children fractured their fingers this summer playing hurling and camogie.  They went to the local clinic, the finger was strapped up and they were back playing in a few weeks.  A fractured finger is not a big deal but if someone is responsible for it or it happens in a play centre or a men's shed, according to the book of quantum in Ireland, a fractured finger with no long-term complications is worth &euro;17,500.</p><p>One can expect to spend &euro;10,000 on the complainant fees, while the defence fees will be &euro;3,000, all for a fractured finger that will be fine in a few weeks in uncomplicated cases and which thousands of children get playing hurling every Sunday.

There was an argument that they wanted to get back more quickly.  A private clinic tries to get people to have an MRI and one has to tell them an X-ray is fine as it is not so serious.  We sought the view of our claims managers throughout Europe of what would happen in their country.  In comparison to the 17,500 whiplash cases in Ireland, there were 4,100 in the UK and the legal fees were &euro;932.  A lawyer needs to find ten broken fingers in the UK to pay for one in Ireland.

In 2018 the normal target margin was 5% but Aviva made 11.4% and Zurich 8.98%.  Aviva made superprofits of &euro;33 million and Zurich &euro;12 million, which are 6% and 4%, respectively.  Axa was before us, as were FPD and Allianz.  In total, the five companies other than AIG made superprofits of over &euro;122 million in 2018.  We have spoken about claims and legal fees but, given that the companies are making margins way in excess of their target margins, why are they not reducing fees?  They are saying they will only reduce premiums when they keep the 5% margin.  Why are Aviva and Zurich not passing back these superprofits, of &euro;33 million and &euro;12 million, respectively, to customers in the form of reduced premiums?  Why do many customers feel they are being ripped off by insurance companies?</p></speech>

We often pay claims seven years down the road and we are not making superprofits.  If we were, there would be far more competition from companies interested in participating in the Irish market.  Our figures for 2012-18 suggest we are making a 97% core, which is 2% below our target.  It was 101% in 2012 but 92% in 2018.  For motor insurance we wrote &euro;1.2 billion between 2012 and 2018 and made a &euro;14 million underwriting profit, &euro;71 million in total, which is a gross return of 1.7% and nothing like 5%.  Our liability was &euro;400 million.</p> <p>  I was asked about claims increases but we lost &euro;37 million on that figure at underwriting level, and lost &euro;10 million of the total, yet I am trying to convince the group to stay with Ireland and to keep deploying capital.  We are certainly not making supranormal profits.  We need to make sure we are here to pay the claims of the future.  Quinn Insurance cost us &euro;2 billion because the premiums were not right.  We will pass back profits as soon as we can see the reductions in average claim cost.</p></speech>

On top of that is investment income, which is the money we put aside to put back into our business and into reserves we all need to hold.  A lot of claims take a long time to pay back so I would not describe our figures as superprofits.  There have been reductions in home and motor insurance but not liability, which is a problem for us and a challenging area.  The reductions will feed through to lower margins in the years to come and the danger of us of getting back into a boom and bust cycle, in which we compete strongly with each other, is that we drive the margin down to a level at which we start making losses again and require premium increases.  Customers want stability.  They all want reductions in premiums but they do not want big increases followed by big reductions.  We plan for a sustainable level of profit and we plan three years ahead.  I look at the profit level in three years' time and it will be a bit lower than 2018, which means I need to grow my business.  I want to get into more lines of business because that will mean the cost of claims becomes more reliable and more predictable.</p></speech>

The average person will ask why their premiums are so high.  It is a legitimate question and I ask the insurance company to look at premiums for hard-pressed customers, though I accept they have to make a profit.  They need to ensure cover is provided across many areas, because people in leisure, cr&egrave;ches and the SME sector cannot get insurance.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

We have employed 30 dedicated staff to handle specifically fraud cases, backed up by a network of 50 personnel to carry out comprehensive investigations.  Fraudsters need enablers.  They cannot put forward fraudulent claims on their own.  They need and get assistance from various professionals.  We would ask those professionals to look closely at claims to ensure there is proper behaviour and that in addition to us they are carrying out significant investigation into claims.  In terms of the cases getting to court, it is a little difficult to believe that some of the people who are involved were not aware that there were grounds for suspicion.</p></speech>
