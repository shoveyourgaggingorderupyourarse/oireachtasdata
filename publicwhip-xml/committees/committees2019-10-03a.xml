    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy,  who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is joined by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shane Cassells.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of 19 September agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise from those minutes.</p> <p>  We shall now deal with correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A comprises the briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 2425A, dated 1 October 2019, and No. 2426 A from An Bord Plean&aacute;la are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up documents on Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  We discussed No. 2342 on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland last week.  The information provided was not that requested by the committee and we circulated among committee members what we asked for precisely.  We decided not to publish at the time and to hold the matter over until we received a response from the corporation.  When we receive it, we can consider publishing. </p> <p>  No. 2354B is from Professor Phillip Nolan, President, Maynooth University, dated 29 July 2019, responding to a request from the committee for details on an investment by the university in a subsidiary which will not be recovered, as well as information regarding employment contracts for employees in the organisation.  Professor Nolan confirms the loss and states the investment was appropriate based on the information and advice available at the time.  He also provides an information note in regard to employment contracts and states that engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  While we will note and publish this item, I want to make a few remarks on the subsidiary.  Maynooth University set up a subsidiary called Innovation Value Services Limited for research and development and the organisation did not meet its expectations.  The company was ultimately wound down at a loss to the university of &euro;750,000.  That is a very substantial figure and that is why we wrote to the university.  In its detailed reply to us, it points out that the provision of &euro;750,000 against the impairment of the loan to Innovation Value Services Limited represents a real and regrettable loss, and that it will not impact on education or services to students but will reduce the university's capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  That is an honest answer from a third level college.  Normally it is said there is no effect but at least in this case the university says there will be an impact on its capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  The university had an innovation value institute in the college that had attracted over &euro;10 million since 2010.  It decided to set up a subsidiary, which it is entitled to do.  Before it set up the company, based on what is projected, it commissioned PwC to produce a report, and the latter advised against the initial business plan, which projected an investment of &euro;1.25 million.  The investment plan was then scaled back on that basis.  The university invested &euro;410,000 in the subsidiary in October 2015 and, in May 2016, it advanced another &euro;300,000.  After the first year of operation, it agreed to defer the loan repayments until December 2019 because it knew the organisation was not meeting expectations.  In May 2019, the decision was taken by the university executive not to invest further in the company.  The board of Innovation Value Services Limited met on 18 June 2019, which is not that long ago, and decided to wind up the company and cease trading by the end of the financial year, which I presume is about now.  Those are some of the salient facts.  We need to ask for a copy of the final accounts for the company when it is ultimately wound up and audited.</p> <p>  Second, we raised the question as to whether the loan of &euro;750,000 was included on the university's risk register.  The replay given was that the risks associated with Innovation Value Services Limited were not specifically included in the register.  The university said it updated the risk register in February 2017, which was two and a half years ago, and it was further updated over the summer of 2019, which has just passed.  At this stage, we must write to the university and ask for the risk register.  In my view, this should be produced on an annual basis, at a minimum.  The HSE produces them on a quarterly basis.  It does miss things but at least it has a system in place every quarter.  I expect a body such as the university to produce a register regularly.  A year is the most that should elapse before producing a register.  Even if we get a register once per year, it will not be too bad.  The one the university is operating from is two and a half years old.  I propose that we write to it asking it for the risk register it was working on over the summer.  Let us see where that stands.</p><p>That is all I want to say about the matter.</p><p> I mentioned the occasional lecturers.  The university gives details on this on page 17 of its letter, which is a very comprehensive document.  There are about 40 pages in the reply.  It indicates there are 1,394 occasional staff, 668 of whom receive under &euro;1,000 and 239 of whom receive between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,000.  The overwhelming majority of them receive under &euro;4,000 and would not be considered in any way full-time.  They are occasional, perhaps.  Most of them are postgraduates at the college.  That is what the university says here.  I will come to Deputy Catherine Murphy, who will have more knowledge on this.  I am just putting on the record what the university says because we will discuss the response.  I want to put the response on the record because the university does not expect everyone to read the 40 pages.  The university is saying the overwhelming majority of the occasional staff are postgraduates doing just a small amount of work here and there.  It says it complies with legislation.  That is the university's response.  I have a duty to put it on the record.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00200"><p>Obviously, when we get more information back, we will come back to this.  If we had got a copy of the university's risk register last year, it would not have shown up this.  What else is the register likely not to include?  Seeing it now, after this has been disclosed, yes, they are taking corrective action, but I am concerned we are not getting a full picture.  That is one aspect.  The business of universities is about creating knowledge.  If NUI Maynooth is acknowledging the loss in respect of research and knowledge transfer, that is really at the core of what the university is supposed to be about.  I am not sure we have fully fleshed out what this implies, and I would like to hear from the university what it means by "impact".</p> <p>  Regarding the number of staff, I completely accept that universities have people coming in and possibly doing several hours' additional work and that that is normal practice and adds to the value of the university.  I think there are much greater employment protections at primary school level than at university level, not just in Maynooth but in the whole university sector.  People going to college, who are very often the people paying for the staff, and their parents - and there are Government grants and so on towards tuition fees - do not appreciate that very often what is provided is perhaps one contact hour for every lecturing hour.  I think great liberties are being taken in this regard.  A total of 1,394 is a lot of people without contracts.  We have spoken about this in the context of RT&Eacute; and bogus self-employment, for example.  Whereas this would not fall into the exact same category, it is a category of staff about whom I would have concerns as to how universities manage their accounts.</p> <p>  There is the other issue of how universities perform if not enough research hours are provided compared with contact hours.  This shows up in our accounts, and that is the only reason it is appropriate for discussion here.  However, we are hearing from the president of the college, not from the people who have a grievance about this.  I think we are hearing a one-sided view on it, and I have concerns about that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for going through the correspondence in detail.</p></speech>

The risk register is what jumped out at me, again, as someone who is not experienced in this area.  We rely on such registers.  When I look at the accounts every single week I see the risk registers and what has turned up on them.  However, the risk register is only as good as what goes on it, so perhaps somebody could help us with that.  What criteria are used?  Who checks those who put items on the risk register?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00600"><p>A risk register is a requirement under the code of practice for governance.  It is probably fair to say the register is not a precise science.  It is really about requiring an organisation to look at the specific risks that arise in its business.  One check on the adequacy of the risk register is whether what happens, and the response to what happens, has been foreseen in the risk register as it goes.  I think this has come up with organisations such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00700"><p>CervicalCheck was not on the risk register for the HSE until the court case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00800"><p>Exactly, so it certainly arises that organisations will have blind spots.  Nearly every organisation will have things that it assumes will always work because they always have worked.  Having a good risk register is more an art than a science, and keeping it up to date is a procedural matter.  However, the judgments that are made as to what goes on it and what is an appropriate response are a matter that an organisation needs to grapple with.  The organisation needs to update it regularly, as the Chairman said.  A review once a year would probably not be adequate for a relatively large organisation.  One would want perhaps a quarterly review of the register and systems in place that ensure that it is not just something that is happening at the top of an organisation but that it percolates down through the organisation such that everybody is thinking about the areas specific to their aspect of the business and what they would do if certain of those risks materialised.  It is, therefore, hard to say "this is an excellent risk register" and "that is a very poor one".  It is seen in the outturn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C00900"><p>On that point, let us take the case of Galway.  This is very much factual.  It is another problem about which nothing was done, but the hospital was good in that it put the capacity of the hospital on the risk register.  Then let us turn to the universities, not just NUI Maynooth.  Knowledge was mentioned.  I believe knowledge should be acquired through questioning.  I disagree slightly with just the way Deputy Catherine Murphy put it.  I believe that the universities should inculcate a questioning environment, which we seem to be losing, and that knowledge should be acquired in that manner as opposed to knowledge for knowledge's sake and for a profit.  However, that is a policy matter.  I was in Waterford on Monday leis an gcoiste Ghaeilge agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; in Institi&uacute;id Teicneola&iacute;ochta Phort L&aacute;irge.  It brought back to me a lot of the matters and issues we looked at here.  Does the risk register not assume a lot more importance now that the universities are more and more in the business of setting up companies with a view to making a profit?  Is that not a whole new aspect of the risk register now, with public moneys and public buildings being used in that manner?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01000"><p>Absolutely.  There may be third level institutions that do not have subsidiaries and are not involved in business structures.  Once one gets into a new model of service delivery, there are different kinds of risks which one may not be fully aware of if one does not have a background in that.  What one would expect to see is that the risk register is an organic instrument of the organisation that changes as the business changes and as the environment around the organisation changes or if demand is going up, funding is tightening or a commercial venture is part of what is being done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01100"><p>Given the profile of what has happened here, is that a blind spot?  Would Mr. McCarthy have expected to see it on a risk register way earlier?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#C01200"><p>I do not want to speak specifically about Maynooth because I have not looked at this precise point.</p><p>If one is using subsidiaries to deliver parts of one's business, then one needs to have a part of one&rsquo;s risk register dealing with that.  For example, what if there are trading aspects or control of intellectual property as we have had in other institutions?  One needs to identify what are the risks and where can this potentially go wrong?  What systems and controls do we need to have in place to ensure it does not go wrong, or if it does, that we can respond appropriately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#D00200"><p>I want to raise a separate issue concerning the follow-up correspondence from Maynooth.  It is to do with what it calls occasional staff and staff on contracts.  The volume of people on contracts at the university is high.  The university stated in its cover note that it does not engage persons on zero-hour contracts.  That is true.  However, there are if-and-when contracts or what it calls occasional staff contracts.  The university stated it believes the engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  In some cases, it may well be.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that we are seeing this more and more with public bodies which are employing people on if-and-when contracts.  On some occasions, it is the right thing to do; other times, it is not.  Watching this across all organisations, my fear is that some public bodies are hiding behind this position.  If-and-when or low-hour contracts may suit some people but they do not suit everybody.  If it does not suit somebody, then it is the only contract offered.  There is an issue in relation to their rights and entitlements, whether it is sick pay, holiday pay and other entitlements.  We have seen it with other public bodies and I believe we need to keep an eye on it.</p> <p>  I noted in Maynooth that 1,394 staff were on occasional staff contracts.  It seems to be a bit high.  I know there is a logic to it and I can see how it would suit a university.  It is something that I will keep an eye on.  When is the Department of Education and Skills due back before the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#D00300"><p>It is not scheduled yet.  There are two points we need to take up on the two different topics.  One, what it calls occasional staff.  The university says that most of them are postgraduates.  We are going to ask about the 1,394 figure it gave and how many of those are in receipt of payment for more than one year, two years, three years and four years?  If we find 95% of them were postgraduates, just passing through the college as a tutor, that is fine.</p></speech>

We want the university to give us an information note on the research and knowledge transfer activity for the past three years, as well as it plans and arrangements for this and next year.  Based on the figures it gave us, &euro;700,000 seems to be a large figure if it is only had &euro;10 million external research and development over a long period.  It might represent a small proportion or it could be the most of it.  I have no idea.  We want to know the level spent in this area in each of the past three years, this year and the plan for next year.  We can then see the impact.  Has it closed the whole operation?  Has it had a significant impact?  I have no idea based on the reply we got.</p> <p>  We need the details on the two points.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We want a copy of the risk register and a note.  There should be an audit and risk committee as part of the board.  It should have been their job.

One of the things that should be reviewed in that exercise is the risk management system.  It should be annually considered outside of the risk assessment process itself.  There should be an exercise.  Very often this is done by internal audit.  This would be looking at whether the risk register is working for the organisation.  There is also a requirement on a cyclical basis for an external review of risk management at least once every three years.</p></speech>

It is a bit more complicated for aviation fuel.  The Act is prescriptive in that the agency should raise this levy for its running costs.  Running costs of the agency are about &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million a year.  I am told that there is somewhere in the region of &euro;250 million in its accounts based on this levy.  We levy 2 cent per litre under an Act which states that the agency must cover its running costs and not to exceed that.  It now seems to have substantially exceeded this amount.  We are all hard-pressed consumers paying 2 cent per litre.  It has been mentioned in the media and in dispatches from Ministers and the Department that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.</p><p> It has been mentioned in media dispatches from Ministers and their Departments that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.  Frankly, that would be in breach of the law on the basis that if we are collecting the money for A, we cannot use it for B.  I am not against using money in this way, but we live in an era in which we all accept that we are heading for carbon taxes.  The receipts from the latter will be invested in the climate action fund.  If an excess of between &euro;100 million and &euro;150 million accrues because running costs are being exceeded and if, effectively, this is being collected illegally or in a manner that is contrary to legislation, something needs to be done.  The Government could consider whether this levy might be reduced or stopped - I accept that this is a policy issue - as long as we can ensure that the oil companies pass it on to the consumer.  I emphasise that 2 cent a litre is an awful lot.  On that basis, I think this is something at which we should look.  I suggest to the committee that we should invite NORA personnel and officials from the Department of Finance to come in to discuss the issue.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have any comments to make on what I have said?  Can he confirm my concerns?</p></speech>

It provides an update on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry at Waterford Institute of Technology.  We asked the Minister to consider appointing an investigator under the relevant legislation to examine matters raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 104.  Mr. Beausang has advised that the Department is considering documents and has set out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.

We had lengthy discussions on this with the Department in the past.  We had similar discussions with the HEA when it became obvious that it was not able to publish the report it had done because it was outside its remit.  It looked like the Minister, through the appointment of a special investigator by the Department, was the only option.  I would like to draw the attention of colleagues to the second last paragraph of the letter that came back, which mentions that there had been a need to follow up with everyone who had submitted correspondence to the previous review, the report of which cannot now be published.  According to this letter, the correspondence and documentation subsequently received by the Department - the follow-up documentation - sets out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.  That was essentially our point from day one.  My point all along has been that the concerns which have been outlined, some of which were the subject of a report, cannot be left hanging.  We know it is probable that the report would have set out some of those concerns, but the HEA was just not able to publish it.  Is it going to be left hanging?  The Chairman is right when he says that the Department has come back to say it is still looking at whether further action is warranted.  If concerns relating to the management of potential conflicts of interest which have been documented by individuals still exist, there is a responsibility on the Department to follow them up.  It may or may not transpire that these matters were managed properly, but we cannot adjudicate on that.  It is not our job to adjudicate on it.  That is why we have a process.  Special investigators are appointed to establish the facts and report on them.  That needs to be done in this case to give closure to the issue.  If it is not done, all of these issues will continue to be raised by individuals within the institute, those individuals will not get any satisfaction and - more to the point - the facts will not be established.  We need to go back to the Department to say that if serious concerns are still being documented and sent to it, it has an obligation and a responsibility to follow them up.</p></speech>

The Department has stated that when it gets the information from Waterford, which we have mentioned, and when it gets the aforementioned HEA study, the terms of reference of which have not yet been agreed, it will examine all of that.  When it has completed its consideration of all of that, it will advise the Minister on what to do next.  That sounds like it will take years.

It looked at a very limited aspect of this matter.  As we know, the HEA report looked in more detail at other issues relating to the spinning out of these companies, including the management of conflicts of interest.  That is what they were looking at.  The report we got from the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that the institute accepted that it needed to improve on some issues that had arisen.  I think the board has since taken those issues on board.  We want something similar here.  All we want is the facts.  When we have the facts, it will be up to the board to follow though on them.  It is important for all the other institutes.  Many companies spin out of them.  Last week, I met representatives of a fantastic company that spun out of an institute.  This stuff is good.  Many people are doing work in this area.  It is important for everyone who is involved in spinning out these companies that the facts are established.  We have never said that there is wrongdoing.  We are saying that people are saying that there are issues.  They are writing into the Department.  They are engaging.  They are doing the right thing by putting their information on paper, documenting it and giving it to the Department.  As the Chairman indicated, it has been parked.</p></speech>

Everything I said was correct.  In the 2007 Act, section 44(3) states: "In determining the rates of levy, [that is, the 2 cent per litre that everyone is paying] the Minister shall seek to ensure that (taking one year with another) the sums realised by applying those rates to the volume assessments meet but do not exceed the estimated expenses of the Agency and of each designated subsidiary."  Therefore, it has approximately 2.5 times what its running costs are.  There have been dispatches, both in the UN speeches by Government this week and by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, talking about repurposing the legislation to use this money in respect of actions suggested by the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  That would be a breach of the law.  That is from where I am coming from in respect of this matter and I say it for the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the context of his report to us at next week's meeting.  I apologise for bringing us back to this matter.</p></speech>

That is appreciated.</p> <p>  We move to category C correspondence, which is from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Some of this arrived during the summer but we had to clear the earlier categories of correspondence at our two previous meetings.  No. 2349C is correspondence from an individual, dated 15 July 2019, responding to a request from the committee for his consent to forward his correspondence in regard to renewable electricity.  The correspondent has requested us to forward it to the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will forward it to that committee for any action it may deem appropriate.</p> <p>  No. 2350C is correspondence from an individual copying the committee in on correspondence to the Taoiseach regarding the long-term effect on careers of cannabis convictions.  There is no specific request to the committee but the item may be of interest to some members.  We have not been asked to do anything and we have just been given a copy of the correspondence to the Taoiseach.  We will note this item.</p> <p>  No. 2353C is correspondence from Ms Orla Allen of the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, dated 24 July 2019, providing consent to forward its correspondence to the Valuation Office.  There is additional information provided which we will send to the Valuation Office to be considered in its response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2355C is correspondence from Deputy Catherine Murphy forwarding a query from an individual requesting the committee to make inquiries with the HSE regarding difficulties with its new payroll system, the national integrated staff records and pay programme, NiSRP.</p></speech>

The only reason I am putting the matter on the agenda is that this was being trialled in one part of the country, which I understand would be a sensible thing to do.  However, it has produced quite a significant difficulty for some staff cohorts, from what I am hearing, to the point that there appears to be an inflexibility in it.  The HSE has invested in this system and if it is to be rolled out to the rest of the country, it has the potential to cause industrial conflict, for example, because people are not getting paid or are not being paid in a timely way.  I would have some concerns about that, although that is not for the Committee of Public Accounts.  What is of concern is that if it requires to be recalibrated, that needs to happen.  However, if we have invested in a big system and the system is not fit for purpose, that is an issue.  If it is just a recalibration, that is another matter.  I do not know which it is but I am hearing complaints, although whether that is for this committee is another matter.</p></speech>

The HSE is a very complex organisation, as we know, and various types of people are employed, some 9 to 5, some 24-7 and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#F01200"><p>We will include it as an item to be discussed with the HSE representatives.  I have proposed that they will be coming in again shortly.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in connection with HSE primary care centres.  Quite a lot has happened since HSE representatives where here to discuss last year's financial statements, particularly in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We will be inviting representatives of the HSE to come before us in the fairly near future.  We can address this issue that meeting.</p></speech>

There was a time lag for the investment in some IT systems.  It would be useful to understand that because one of the constant complaints was that there were something like seven or nine different ledgers.  Getting visibility on the accounts, or even segments of things that one could look at in order to compare one part of the country with another, had been deficient.  There is a big investment programme and we have to make sure it is robust and fit for purpose.  That is where my main concern lies.</p></speech>

At least if the committee understood the scale of what the HSE is planning, what stage its plans are at and the costs it envisages, it would be a better start to the meeting, rather than just doing it on the morning.</p></speech>

We will write to them and put them on notice.</p> <p>  No. 2356C is correspondence from an individual, dated 8 August, who has made a detailed submission regarding the financial situation of Irish wind farms.  Related to this are Nos. 2368C and 2370C, dated 8 August, correspondence from individuals also requesting the committee to review the submission.  We know this matter is not within the remit of the committee as it is a policy matter and the submission refers to activities of EirGrid, which is a commercial semi-State company and is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The correspondent has specifically requested us not to forward the submission to anybody else.  I propose, therefore, to advise the correspondent that the matter is not within our remit and to suggest he correspond with the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will thank him for the correspondence, which the members have read, but it is not something we can formally deal with because EirGrid and the wind farms are not under the remit of the committee.</p> <p>  Nos. 2358C, 2359C and 2360C constitute correspondence from an individual copying the committee in on correspondence to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal and related to freedom of information provision.  There is no specific request to the committee.  We will note these items.</p> <p>  No. 2366C is correspondence from an anonymous individual, dated 30 August, alleging improper and illegal conduct at Maynooth University.  We have received correspondence from the university regarding the governance matter, and it deals with those types of issues.  I propose to write to the university to provide an information note in regard to the specific items.  No. 2385C, dated 13 September 2019, is correspondence from Deputy Louise O'Reilly, forwarding a copy of the same letter.  We note this item.  When we write to the university, we will give it a copy of letter and ask it to respond.</p></speech>

The correspondent has copied the committee on a submission to several Ministers and to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have looked at this matter as it pertains to our last periodic report but the communications committee is responsible for matters relating to the roll-out of broadband.  I propose that we advise the correspondent accordingly.  The issue of the cost incurred to the Exchequer to date in implementing the national broadband scheme continues to be a matter for this committee.</p> <p>  No. 2371C, dated 21 July, is from the secretary of the Irish Environmental Forum, referring to evidence given by representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency at a meeting of this committee on 18 April regarding the Aughinish plant in County Limerick.  I propose to request the correspondent's consent to forward the documentation to the EPA for response to the matters raised.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2372C, dated 6 August, is from an individual querying the frequency and necessity of road repairs and resurfacing in the Donnybrook and Ballsbridge areas of Dublin.  I propose that we advise the correspondent that this matter is not within the remit of the committee and should instead be taken up with Dublin City Council or, alternatively, the Local Government Audit Service.

The individual is in a difficult situation, which we all have encountered with constituents, as a consequence of SUSI's requirement that applicants provide financial information in respect of both their parents.  Even where a student's parents are separated or divorced and there may be difficulties within the household, SUSI insists on obtaining that information.  In some cases, a student might be living with one parent, who has no contact with the other.  It might even be the case that one parent has secured a court order against the other.  SUSI will not process grant applications until information on both parents is received, even though it is sometimes not possible for the applicant to obtain it.  I propose that we write to SUSI requesting it to indicate its process and procedures for dealing with such exceptional cases.  I have encountered students who could not go to college because one of their parents would not facilitate any correspondence with anybody.  Without that information, SUSI will not process the application.  That is unfair to students and it is not being dealt with in a satisfactory way.  We will not refer to the correspondent in our letter to SUSI but we will ask about the organisation's general position on dealing with these types of issues.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2411C, dated 25 September, is from an individual concerned about appointments to the public service of persons with a knowledge of Irish.  I propose that we ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an information note regarding those appointments.  The correspondent refers to the proposed official languages Bill 2019 and argues that the allocation of employment to a special interest group, which he calls "our Irish speakers", is a contrived State regulation and amounts to jobbery.  Can Deputy Connolly advise whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the right Department to address on this matter?</p></speech>

We will write to that Department.</p> <p>  No. 2414C, dated 22 September, is from Mr. Allen Morgan, who was recently in touch regarding the administration of his correspondence to the committee.  The secretariat is providing him with clarifying information in that regard.  In this correspondence, he asks the committee to consider a particular matter as part of our examination of the OPW's 2018 account.  I propose that we note the correspondence for now and members may refer to it as part of any upcoming engagement with the OPW.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report concerning the OPW, so we will be engaging with that body concerning its overall financial statements.</p> <p>  No. 2415C, dated 25 September, is a response from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association to our consideration of matters raised by it in regard to the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal.  I propose that we note the correspondence and keep the points raised in mind.</p><p>I want to follow it up in further detail.  I have looked at this correspondence.  At a previous meeting we asked about the valuation of car-parking spaces in some of these out-of-town locations.  To summarise this correspondence, there are two issues.  It referred to a two-year backlog for the 2017 appeals.  I am not sure if it is the tribunal or the Valuation Office.  We want that matter clarified based on this correspondence.<br/><br/>We really need clarification on the second item.  The correspondence from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association states: &quot;The Valuation Office has recently made some amendments to the methodology they use for service stations ... which is positive but we have been told that these amendments will not apply to stations revalued under the 2017 revaluation even where they are appealing to the Valuation Tribunal.&quot;  Essentially, the Valuation Office is stating that there will be two separate methods for valuing filling stations for rates: those valued under the 2017 regulations; and those now being valued under the recent amendments.  That is not fair.  Given that it could take ten years for such filling stations to be revalued again, they may be at a commercial disadvantage for up to a decade.  The IPRA is also saying that when filling stations appeal valuations carried out under the 2017 rules to the valuation tribunal, it will not accept the new amendments and is sticking to the old regulations.  That appeals process is unfair.  We want that clarified and it does not sound fair to me.<br/><br/>We asked the Valuation Office for a response on the issue of car park spaces at supermarkets, etc.  That was mentioned in the context of rates in towns.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association graciously sent us a copy of the Valuation Office practice note regarding supermarkets.  We did not get it from the Valuation Office yet, but it is its document.  The petrol retailers are utterly confused by what the Valuation Office says about car parking at supermarkets.  It states:</p><blockquote>Car parking arrangements associated with retail units will be dealt with as follows:- Common car parking facilities serving retail units will be reflected in the rent passing.  [Is that the rent from the landlord to the supermarket?]  Under these circumstances these facilities will be reflected in the passing rent.</blockquote><p>It suggests that where somebody has developed a facility with many shop units, including a big car park used by all the customers for all the shops, the cost of the car park will be reflected in the rent charged by the landlord who owns the property.  However, we are asking about the rates and not the rent.<br/><br/>The practice note also states: &quot;Where the building occupier occupies car spaces at a physically separate location then they will be valued as a separate relevant property with a description of &lsquo;carpark&rsquo;.&quot;  It is stating where common car parking facilities are used for several shops, it is reflected in the rent.  My question is then about the rates assessment for the landlord.  Was the landlord assessed for the commercial value of the car park?  It seems to be suggesting supermarkets are covered in the rent.  I want to know where in the system the commercial value of the car park is valued for rates.  The Valuation Office seems to be suggesting the supermarket does not pay it.  That should mean the landlord does it.  Are we then going to be told the same property cannot be valued twice?  I have not worked that one out.  I want clarification on it.  It is a good question, and the answer muddied the water further as far as I am concerned.  We want to know the commercial value of the car park at these shopping centres.  Where is the rates demand notice and who pays them?</p></speech>

We only asked the Valuation Office for that last week.  The petrol retailers gave us a copy of the Valuation Office's instruction on the issue of the commercial value of a car park.

Where it is owned by a property developer and rented to the supermarket and other businesses, where is the commercial value of the car park captured?</p></speech>

The individual obviously followed the debate here last week and this letter has stated that he is happy to do so.</p> <p>  That covers all the correspondence we have had since July.  We come to financial statements and accounts that have been laid before the Oireachtas since the last meeting.

The next item is the risk equalisation fund, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  What is that?  Is that for the private health insurance?</p></speech>

Someone will do it somewhere along the line.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for all that.  That is the end of the financial statements.</p> <p>  On the work programme, we have already arranged a meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for today.  Next week, we will have the National Transport Authority.  The following week we have Caranua.  The week after that we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine because there is a gap between the report and that.</p><p>We have a gap for the week of 31 October, on Brexit day.  People are not sure whether the D&aacute;il is sitting that week but we will assume it is.  There are a couple of items we could possibly include.  These are the Charities Regulator, Pobal and Sport Ireland.  We have mentioned the possibility and we can see whether we can get one of the three of them for that date.</p><p> On 7 November, we will discuss the relevant chapters of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I am sure we will also speak about the public services card, on which I want to comment now.  We will start to climb up to the HSE and the children's hospital as soon as possible after that because there is a chapter on it in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Now that we have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General we will try to flesh out our work programme until Christmas at the next meeting.  There is nothing major to be said.</p><p> An item I want to raise that ties into the work programme is an issue that was raised last week in our very useful meeting with the Data Protection Commissioner on the use of the public services card and her report.  We also dealt with other financial matters.  Towards the end of the meeting, I raised the issue of a person who continued to use an expired free travel card.  The person should not have done so because social welfare payments had ceased.  However, the travel card element of the public services card had not been cancelled and the person continued to use it. After several months, the card was confiscated at Heuston Station when it did not work in the turnstile to leave the station.  Afterwards, the person received a fine from Irish Rail for &euro;1,000 for not having the correct ticket.  So far so good, but this raises data protection issues.  The person, whom I dealt with over the summer, told me the issue of how Irish Rail got the individual's name and address had already been raised with the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is no dispute with regard to the amount but there is a data protection issue.</p><p> Arising from our meeting last week, on Friday I received a very interesting email, as did the Comptroller and Auditor General, from a person with regard to a use of the public services card I had not really thought about until now.  If this is happening we really need it to be clarified.  On the public services card is a photo, the person's PPS number is on the back, and there is also the person's signature.  The card also shows a date until which it is valid.  On the front it may have the letters FT to signify free travel, or it may have the letters FT+S to signify the person's spouse can accompany him or her for free.  The individual who sent the card used it on the Luas in Dublin and on one of the major bus companies, not Dublin Bus.  When the public services card goes through the ticket machine information is recorded and the individual got curious about what is recorded when the public services card is given to private transport companies.  The person tracked it down and eventually received a letter back from the National Transport Authority, NTA, because the bus operator and Luas said it was nothing to do with them and that the person should contact the NTA.  In recent days, we received a copy of the letter sent to the individual by the NTA.  The NTA states that when a person uses the card none of the person's information on the card is recorded but every card has a number - not the PPS number - that the transport companies have.  This allows the companies to claim payment.  I know there are also lump sum grants but perhaps Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is slightly different.  This number records all of the trips and journeys made by card holder.  The rail company does not have the person's name and address or other details but it sends the number to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection where it can be matched to the person's PPS number.</p><p> The NTA states only the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection knows the PPS number and the individualised anonymous number held by the transport companies.  The Department does not provide this information to anyone.  As far as public transport is concerned, all the NTA knows is that the number has been used but not who used it or anything about the person using the card and it is entirely anonymous.  The email also states that when the public services card is presented at the ticketing machine, it records that a journey has been taken and assigns the value of the fare forgone to the record, which is stored in the ticket machine.  The information held by the transport company is the ID, which is the number on the card, the date and time of the journey, the route number and the fare forgone, which is the adult single fare.  The data is then uploaded to the back office system and subsequently made available to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The purpose of recording the information is so the transport operator can record overall passenger numbers and overall usage and also be able to make a claim for reimbursement from the Department in respect of services delivered to free travel pass holders.</p><p> It appears that when the information comes back from the travel company the Department of Employment Affair and Social Protection has details with regard to 900,000 people, including every State pensioner in the country, on every time they use public transport and every trip they take.  The allegation in the email is that the person did not know the State had such mass surveillance systems in place.  I do not think people knew the card and the Department could obtain details on every trip taken.  I can see why from a financial position but from a data protection point of view I can see that people were not aware that this is the case.  We will write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to clarify this particular issue on whether it has a record of all of the travel taken.</p></speech>

My understanding is there is a different type of arrangement with Go-Ahead, in that the fares go directly to the NTA rather than to Go-Ahead, and that its contract is just to drive the buses.  The NTA has a direct aspect on this.  It is a tripartite arrangement instead of the direct relationship between Irish Rail and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is going three ways.</p></speech>

We are also joined by Mr. Terry Sheridan, principal officer in the planning division of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off completely.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.

The board is responsible for the determination of appeals and certain other matters under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2018 and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.  The board also has responsibility for dealing with proposals for the compulsory acquisition of land and with determining appeals under the water pollution and building control Acts.</p> <p>  The board's income in 2018 totalled &euro;24.4 million.  Just over &euro;4 million, or 17%, comprised fee receipts.  Oireachtas grant funding issued in 2018 from the Vote for housing, planning and local government amounted to &euro;17.5 million.  Expenditure on salaries and related costs amounted to &euro;16 million, representing around two thirds of the board's expenditure in 2018.  Expenditure on legal fees amounted to &euro;3.3 million, or 14% of the total.  The balance of expenditure, of &euro;4.7 million, related to premises and other operating expenses.  The surplus for the year was &euro;552,000.  I certified the 2018 financial statements on 19 June 2019 and issued a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Considering that I took up the post of chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in November 2018, 11 months ago, I may, with the Chairman's indulgence, ask my colleagues to address some of the issues that may be raised during the session.  They may be more familiar with some of the matters.</p> <p>  It is important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual planning cases, as to do so could compromise decisions or various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will endeavour to be as helpful to the committee as possible.</p> <p>  The board is well aware of its critical role in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals, and it remains committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities.  I can confirm that the board considers itself in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p> <p>  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee and internal audits, and we undertake regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  As is required under the code of practice, I receive a report annually from the independent, external chair of the audit and risk committee.  The committee's most recent report has confirmed that our risk management processes and internal controls are operating effectively.  As chairperson, I am also reassured of our financial and governance controls through the unqualified audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General, both for 2018 and for all previously audited years.</p> <p>  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, as outlined by Mr. McCarthy, the board had a total income of &euro;24.4 million in 2018, comprising primarily an Exchequer grant of &euro;17.5 million and fees revenue of just over &euro;4 million.  We spent just over &euro;24 million, leaving a surplus of just over &euro;550,000 when capital transfers and appropriations were taken into account.</p> <p>  I will give members a little background on the organisation.  The board currently has 164 whole-time equivalent staff and ten board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving recent resource requests, including our workforce plan for the period 2019-20, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases that are coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, vacant site levy cases and major infrastructure projects, and taking into account the forecast increase in cases.</p> <p>  In policy terms, the national planning framework and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural areas, and the board has a clear role in implementing such policies through efficient and consistent processing of case decisions.</p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are rightly to the fore, it is crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness.</p> <p>  While it is acknowledged that the board's capacity and performance to meet its statutory objective period of 18 weeks has been impacted, particularly in 2018, by the transition to our new case management system, the increased caseload and the fallout from reduced board capacity in 2017, we have made strong progress to turn things around in recent months.</p> <p>  In 2018, we recorded a 32% increase in the number of cases decided over the previous year, with over 2,800 decisions made.  In November and December alone, we decided almost 600 cases, which is up 36% on the same two months in 2017.  This helped us to reduce the number of cases on hand by more than 300, from 1,355 to just over 1,000 files at the end of the year.  This reflects the commitment of our hard-working staff and board to really get to grips with the backlog generated and deliver robust decisions as efficiently as possible.</p><p> In terms of meeting our 18-week statutory objective period for deciding normal planning appeals, we are aware that an overall compliance rate of 43% for 2018 is not what we would like.  Equally, however, the priority and focus for me since I arrived in the job and took over as chairperson has been to process and decide those cases longest with the board, which had a consequential impact on our percentage compliance rate last year.  However, we have a clear plan in 2019 to clear the backlog and get back to a compliance rate of 70% to 80% by the end of this year.  Things are going well.  Our aggregate compliance rate for appeals for the year was up to 67% by the end of August, and the average decision time was 19.5 weeks, down from 22.5 weeks in 2018.  For the last four months, we have averaged 78% compliance but we know that more work is needed.  The board&rsquo;s performance in relation to strategic housing developments has been very strong, with 39 cases decided during 2018, all within the 16-week target.</p><p> In overall terms, last year the board granted permission for 27 applications for more than 7,100 housing units and almost 4,500 student bed-spaces, which is a vital contribution to the overall increase in residential activity.  This trend has ramped up significantly in 2019, with 40 applications granted permission in the first eight months of this year for a cumulative 9,070 homes and more than 3,000 student bed-spaces.  We are continuing to prioritise these cases and to deal with any large-scale housing appeals expeditiously.  </p><p>Over the course of 2018, the board prepared a five-year strategic plan with four clear goals.  These are to: protect and enhance our reputation for independence, impartiality, integrity, trust and transparency; make robust, timely and high-quality decisions which support proper planning and sustainable development; improve our service to meet changing customer expectations; and foster a motivated, resilient and responsive organisation.  While this is, of course, a five-year strategy out to 2023, there are a number of initiatives and actions that we are prioritising in 2019 to help to realise these objectives and set us on the right path.  High among these priorities is the roll-out and refinement of the project, Plean-IT, which will ultimately enable appeals, observations, submissions and applications to be made online, linking in with the local authorities&rsquo; own e-planning initiatives.   </p><p>  I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues so I will leave it there.  I have included some summary graphs in my submission.  These outline high-level statistics as a reference.  We are happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

It is one of the easiest to read we have received from any organisation.  I want to acknowledge that because it can sometimes be difficult to understand and interpret some of the reports we get here.  Credit is due on that front.</p> <p>  With regard to what Mr. Walsh mentioned in his opening statement in respect of normal appeals, I am looking specifically at table 1 on page 16 of the annual report, which shows that the rate of compliance with the statutory guidelines, that is to say, the time in which the board would like to complete appeals, has fallen.  Does Mr. Walsh believe the Minister has provided the board with enough staff and resources to improve this situation?  I also note that Mr. Walsh mentioned sufficient improvements this year.  At what level does he expect the board to be by the end of 2019?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#N00400"><p>I thank the Deputy; we appreciate good feedback on our annual report.  All our staff put a lot of work into it and it is good to hear that it is legible and easy to follow.  With regard to performance and the challenges the organisation has faced over the past two years, it has helped that the Department and the Minister have provided the resources for which we have asked.  Back in 2013 or 2014, we were down to 138 to 140 staff members.  We are now up to 166, plus the board.  Our workforce plan includes 16 additional posts to be filled over the next year and a half, and these have been approved by the Minister.  That level of staffing resource and budgetary supports means that we will have sufficient capacity.  The challenge for the organisation is often in retaining the great staff we have.  In a very buoyant market, there are opportunities for experienced and well-trained people in the public sector to move on.  Our job, as part of the strategic plan, is to ensure that people want to work in, and stay in, the organisation and that people see a future for themselves in it.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about performance, a 39% rate of compliance in respect of normal planning appeals is very poor.  This has been caused by the roll-out of the Plean-IT scheme.  It is very difficult.  I know from personal experience in previous roles and from talking with staff that the new case management system covers the entire operation of the board from reception through to how the board operates.  When anything new is introduced, even when it is as well developed as possible, there will always be challenges as people get used to the new system and make sure that it is as functional as it can be.  All it takes is a month or two of a slowdown for a backlog to build up.  Thankfully, that backlog is now clearing.  We have dealt with the oldest cases in the system and we expect that, by the end of 2019, our compliance rate will be above 70% and, perhaps, close to 75%.  This expectation acknowledges that in January we were already dealing with cases that had been on hand for longer than the 18 weeks, so we were not getting the benefit.  </p> <p>  In my opening statement, I pointed out that the percentage can sometimes mask the actual performance of the board.  In 2018, the average time to make decision was approximately 22.5 weeks; that time is now down to approximately 19.5 weeks.  For September, it was actually down to 19.1 weeks.  Even though the target is 18 weeks, the average performance is only one week longer.  It is not as if we have left appeals on hand.  We have dealt with the oldest cases and cleared that backlog.</p></speech>

How is that assessed?  There seems to be frustration across the industry with regard to getting responses to referrals under section 5, which are used to determine whether planning permission is needed.  Are they given a lower priority in the context of the current housing emergency?  How are they assessed?  The pushing out of target dates probably has to do with compliance.  People sometimes feel that the target is not really a target if it can be pushed out.  It does not give certainty.  Will Mr. Walsh expand on those three points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#N00600"><p>On the first issue, that of our priorities, we deal with a whole range of cases.  Given the priority Government and the Oireachtas places on ensuring quick decisions on appeals in respect of strategic infrastructure or strategic housing developments, we expedite them as best we can.  We prioritise such appeals and we have put extra resources into our strategic housing division to ensure we meet the 16-week deadline.  Of the 91 such cases we have decided on since January 2018, every single decision was made within the 16 weeks.  That has been a challenge, but we have met the deadline.  Similarly, insofar as is possible, we ensure that we have capacity to deal with applications relating to large infrastructure projects such as roads, energy projects, or major industrial developments.  That may have a knock-on implication for lower-level categories.</p> <p>  In addition to normal planning appeals, we deal with building control, referrals, and vacant site levies.  Through the management team and the board, the organisation has to assess how to best use our resources and how to prioritise, particularly in respect of the older cases.  We took a conscious decision to focus on the applications which had been in the system the longest.  That had an impact early in 2019.  We have now cleared the majority of those cases and we hope to get back.  Referrals are an important element of our work, but they can be more complex and can involve difficult questions of law.</p><p>They are more about deciding whether something needs permission rather than whether we have a file or appeal before us.  In the context of the Deputy's final question, on target dates, there is nothing more frustrating than having uncertainty around when one might get a decision.  In the past 12 months, where we have had to provide an extension and inform all applicants and anyone who is observing, we have given realistic dates and, in the vast majority of cases, met them.  That has made a difference to the feedback from consumers and customers.</p></speech>

On the fee structure, will Mr. Walsh outline An Bord Plean&aacute;la's policy for charging and recovery and its bad debt provision for fees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#O00300"><p>For the majority of fees the board sets, as governed by section 144 of the Planning and Development Act, the board is permitted to set fees and propose them for the Minister to agree with or not.  Every three years we need to review our fees.  The most recent booklet on our system outlines all the fees.  It was updated in April 2019 and it reflects the fact we introduced some new fees in respect of vacant site levies, which is a new process the board has.  The majority of the fees we have set date back to approximately September 2011.  Every two years - we are due another periodic review - we look at the fees, particularly in the context of consumer price index increases, and propose whether we suggest increases.  I am sure we would all acknowledge that the tough times during and after the recession were not the time to be loading up.  We want to ensure that the fees are kept at a level that encourages as many people as possible who wish to be involved in the process, either in making observations or appeals, to feel there is not a monetary block.</p> <p>  Fees for strategic infrastructure projects and strategic housing projects are set at a fairly high level and we get pretty much full cost recovery for those.  We get the fee paid up front and, depending on the overall assessment of the application over its lifetime, we would either look for additional money or, in some cases, refund money that was not a cost incurred.  Bad debts occur only in legal cases and there are very few.  Where we identify costs that should be recouped, it is normally through that process that we try to chase down those debts and ensure we get value for money for the Exchequer and the organisation.</p></speech>

How will embracing electronic commerce improve how the board does its business?  My understanding of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that it sends letters via registered post.  Will that process change?</p> <p>  On the strategic housing development, SHD, as far as I understand, applicants have to host an online system to correspond with the board.  Some people may argue that it may be difficult for the public to have oversight of the process.  Will Mr. Walsh comment on the new IT system?  How will it improve the performance of the board's website, provide transparency for the customer and assist in the overall embracing of electronic commerce?</p></speech>

We are not as far along in the process as we would have originally envisaged.  We planned it in 2014 and the project has existed for four or five years.  If everything had gone to plan, we would launch this year.  It is likely to be towards the end of next year but there are good reasons for that.  To return to the previous issue of delays and consequential impacts on the operation of the system, we need to make sure that whatever goes live will be fully functional and will maintain the confidence people have in the system.  The last thing we need is a less than perfect model to be out there where, from day one, people say it is not working and they cannot make their connections.</p> <p>  The issue is that everybody expects and knows about the system, and we are all working towards making the process as simple and efficient as possible.  As the Deputy will probably know from his local government days, paper and boxes of files are still being shipped.  We are keeping An Post and other organisations in business with the volume of paperwork, although that will all change.  Local authorities will be able to press a button and send all their digital copies to us.  We will not deal with large files.  We will have everything on our system and it will be visible.  Likewise, any letters and notifications will go out by email.  We will need to maintain some level of traditional correspondence for people who do not wish to engage in e-commerce, as in the case of driver licences, motor tax and passports.  The vast majority of people, however, including professionals, members of the public and local authorities, will embrace the change and are waiting for it to come through.  It will have greater efficiency, as well as a cost saving in the system, but it is also a simple requirement of how business needs to move on.  Before we developed the new system, the system was functional but it never had the required capacity.  When we went out with it, therefore, we knew that the design would be a web portal that would allow everybody to view, participate and make payments, and that it would, hopefully, provide an even better service to everybody.  </p> <p>  On SHD and oversights, we work within the remit the Minister and the Oireachtas have set in legislation.  The requirement for the proposer or applicant to put all the documentation on a website was very much mirroring what was already there in respect of the large-scale strategic infrastructure projects.  I am aware that as part of the legislative measures brought in in 2017, the Minister is undertaking a review of SHD and the process, and looking at whether there are ways to improve it.  An independent review group was established to produce a report.  The board will await the outcome of that and determine what the Minister and the Government wish to do, and we will adapt our systems.  The more information that is available on our website and on that of the planning authority, the better.  We do not want to hide information but rather make it as accessible as possible, which would be our ultimate goal.</p></speech>

The accounts for 2017 and 2018 show that in 2017, we were due to have a rent review of our building in Marlborough Street but it did not happen until 2018.  We had factored in that we expected there would be an increase in the price of the rents of potentially up to 15%, given the market that was there.  As the review was due in 2017, we had budgeted for retrospective costs that might come through.  In the end, as part of our negotiation, we secured a 2% increase in our rents for the next five years instead of the 15% for which we had budgeted.  There were no retrospective issues in 2017.  We felt it was a good deal in the context of that for which we had originally planned.  It is a functional building and we control all of it.  It is useful to have everyone in one location in order that we, as an organisation from reception all the way through the board, have a seamless process.  We will be there for the next four years.  Mr. Egan might like to add something.</p></speech>

We have the main building but we also took on what were two empty retail units on the ground floor of the building.</p><p>They had been lying vacant for a number of years and we got a very attractive offer from the landlord to take those retail units into the building at a much reduced rent for those floor areas.  Those areas are used primarily for the public.  As we have increased the space for the reception area and the meeting rooms, we were quite satisfied that this was a very good deal and improved our customer service to members of the public coming into our offices.  </p></speech>

One area of interest is the operation of the strategic infrastructure provision.  Perhaps Mr. Sheridan might like to comment on this.  It concerns the determination the board must make further to county development plans.  I am thinking of areas like the development of the renewables sector and wind farms.  I note that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's annual report is very clear about the determinations it has made in respect of those.  The Department embarked on a trajectory a number of years ago.  Councillors were setting out provisions in their county development plans that would aid the development of renewables like wind farms in particular areas like boglands.  They were making it very clear in the development plan that the Minister was issuing directions to overturn those proposals.  Subsequently, it stopped doing that.  Recent county development plans contain variations that were put forward by the local authorities.  They were left in place when concerns may have been raised.  In other words, they agreed with the decisions of the democratically-elected local authorities.  An example could be if a local authority makes a determination through the democratically-elected councillors to designate an area in its county development plan that might be suitable for the development of a wind farm.  This is a global picture to help my understanding of the process.  Were the local authority to designate an area, for example, a bog, based on its assessment, the testing of wind speeds, the habitat and all the different matrices it uses, how much note of that would be taken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is it a definite "No" that it would override decisions like that in the county development plan or is it something of which it would take substantial account?  How does that process work?  It has always interested me.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Planning Act and the Schedule to the Act set the threshold.  I think it is 25 turbines or a wind energy level of 50 MW.  If something meets the threshold, it will come into the board directly.  Regardless of whether it involves large-scale or smaller-scale developments, the board must have regard to a range of factors.  They include national policy, planning guidelines, regional and spatial plans, city and county plans and local area plans.  We must look at the whole range of issues.  Regardless of whether it involves Government guidance or a county development plan, there are objectives that, depending on how one reads them, can conflict.  There could be objectives around encouraging greater renewable energy generation, protecting landscapes,  providing more industry and encouraging rural activity.  The board has a range of highly skilled and highly professional planners, who must take everything from the national to the regional to the local into account and must make a judgment call.  Planning is never an exact science.  It is not a blanket model that one can move because every consideration and every case has its own nuances around access, visibility, appropriateness of location, stability and even the appropriateness of whether one would get the right wind conditions to make it viable.  A challenge not only for the board but for planning authorities in dealing with smaller-scale projects is to weigh up all of these different factors and to find the best planning solution.  It is often on the basis of the information we have before us and the views of people in favour of or against it but it also takes from the city and county plans, as well as national guidance.</p></speech>

I would have hoped that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would place great value on those documents and I hear that in what Mr. Walsh is saying.  Mr. Walsh mentioned that national plans can contradict that.  Sometimes they can leave a vacuum, for example, with regard to wind guidelines and setback.  Does Mr. Sheridan have anything to add regarding cases where variations were stopped and are now allowed?  Are we waiting for a clear strategy in the area?</p></speech>

The national planning framework and regional spatial and economic strategies will have particular objectives regarding renewable energy, including wind farms, and, accordingly, must be taken into account by local authorities in their plans.  They are in the process of being reviewed on foot of the adoption of the regional spatial and economic strategies.  All local authorities will adhere to new timelines with regard to the adoption of plans.  Under the new arrangements, which will be overseen by the Office of the Planning Regulator, there will be an obligation on local authorities to have regard to national policy generally, including with regard to renewable energy, when adopting their plans, as well the other requirements set out in the Planning Act.  Where previously, directions were initiated within the Department against local authorities and confirmed by the Minister, that process is in transition and that function is being transferred to the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p></speech>

Often, a CPO that is not challenged does not even come before the board but where an individual or an organisation challenges a local authority-proposed CPO, even if it is a single person in one house, we will always facilitate through an oral hearing.  In many cases, the oral process provides the opportunity to the local authority to outline its views and to enable individuals or appellants to justify their opposition.  Ultimately, the board makes a decision that goes back to the local authority for confirmation or otherwise.</p></speech>

One could argue that, for small-scale CPOs, it is a lot of time and effort.  Equally, however, the CPO process is impacting on people's lives and on their constitutional property rights to a certain extent.  It is important that people feel they have not just a written opportunity but also a chance to understand and meet the planning inspector as well.  We used to make oral hearings mandatory but in some cases the board now has the opportunity to decide if it has enough information on hand without having a hearing in every instance.</p></speech>

Only in the past month we received a report on our own review of our oral hearing processes in terms of how they are organised, who attends and also trying to identify savings and efficiencies that we can bring to the system.  Some of our oral hearings have gone on for a number of weeks, particularly for more complex projects.  Again, if we have as much information available to all of the applicants as early as possible, it allows us to get to the nub of the issues quickly.  Not all oral hearings are held in hotels.  Obviously, any that take place in or around Dublin would be held in our offices, free of charge.  A lot depends on the type of project or proposal.  We also deal with local authority projects, road CPOs and so on and if the oral hearing is being held in the local authority offices, there might be a perception-----</p></speech>

The legislation requires that the board has a range of skills.

The same is true of people who have worked in certain sectors.  Normally, for the first two years they would not get any files associated with that sector at all.

The idea is that we do not want to have the same people going into the meetings all the time - people who share the same views or the same skill set.  We always vary the timelines in terms of who people deal with.  We are a collective board of ten and while we meet <i>en bloc</i>for large applications, for the sake of efficiency we generally have three-person meetings.  We could have three meetings going on at the same time.  In 2018, we had 940 meetings of the board.</p></speech>

It is our problem if the board does not have enough resources.  While we might be meeting the rules of the game in terms of the legislation, I do not think we are meeting the spirit of the planning process in terms of the oversight we expect as consumers and the State by having just three people deciding on a case.  I will leave that point because I have two other important points and I do not want to go over time.</p> <p>  My next question is probably for Mr. Sheridan.  Is it still possible for a Minister to make a ministerial order?  I remember reading years ago that a ministerial order was made to give X planning permission.

I am conscious that the board does not want us to discuss individual cases, so let us talk about a hypothetical case.  Let us say a lake was infected with cryptosporidium and because the lake provided water to 13,000 families, Irish Water decided it needed to put in a treatment plant immediately because otherwise the 13,000 families would have to boil water.  Let us say the planning authority gave planning but An Bord Plean&aacute;la overruled it on the basis that it was contrary to the habitats directive, as there was a particular snail or aspect of biodiversity that had to be protected.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la was taking adequate cognisance of the imperative reasons of overriding public interest, surely the board would grant permission?  It would say the sum of the 13,000 families outweighs the sum of the biodiversity needs of the snail or whatever aspect of diversity was at stake?  Would that be the case?</p></speech>

On the basis that most cases involve a board of three, if there were perhaps ten, there would be a better opportunity for somebody to state, under the imperative reasons of overriding public interest provisions, that 13,000 families were affected.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not providing adequate scope.  Its practice is to involve three persons, but there is the potential to miss the emergency aspect of supplying clean water to 13,000 families.  As Mr. Walsh stated, we cannot discuss individual cases, but I am discussing a hypothetical one that happens to mirror an actual case.</p></speech>

First, we regard every case that comes before us as important because there are individuals affected by it, but there is a scale of cases.  One might have an extension to a house, a single house, a large road or water services infrastructure.  We have to marry and adjudicate on a huge range and spread of cases.  If we were to have the full board deal with every case that comes through, it would have an impact on the timelines.  The committee saw what happened two years ago when our ability to deliver within 18 weeks was severely challenged.  It is a judgment call.  For large-scale and infrastructure cases, we have a strategic infrastructure division which I chair and has five board members.  They deal with most of the larger cases and anything I bring to a ten-person board.  The EIA, AA and flood risk assessment are all issues on which we comply fully and of which we are cognisant in making decisions.</p></speech>

The legislation has removed all checks and balances even in normal circumstance.  Certainly, it has removed them from the democratic process in the local authorities' adherence to county development plans in terms of objections from the public, etc.  Is it fair to say the provisions for strategic housing developments have worked nicely for developers insofar as they have allowed them to circumvent county development plans?  Is it a fair assertion that it was more about removing regulation than fast-tracking, given what came to light over the weekend?</p></speech>

We were assigned the role to deal with strategic housing developments within the bounds of what had originally been set out in the 2017 Act and the regulations from the Minister.</p><p>It may be more a matter for the Department to explain the justification.  However, in the context of addressing the issue of input from all levels, from the local authorities as well as from the applicants and third parties who are interested in the case, one thing that has worked quite well within the system is the tripartite discussions that happen during the pre-planning arrangements.  These take place in the first nine weeks of the period.  The applicant, the local authority in all its different guises - planners, water people - as well as the board and its inspectors, will meet to discuss the key issues that the local authority, the board and the applicants feel are critical to developing a proposal of the scale that is within the bounds of the SHD legislation.  That allows a very clear and formal process to enable views to be expressed, akin to the section 247 processes that the local authority would have had before.  This is very much to identify, as part of a final report for the pre-planning, critical issues that the board or indeed the local authority, which will submit its own report, would highlight and that a developer or proposer needs to reach-----</p></speech>

In the context, in any decisions that we take, the role of the board is finished, generally, with the decision.  Again, we have had good constructive feedback.  We did meet the review group as part of a range of stakeholders to inform them on the process.  That was one of the issues that did arise but it is ultimately a matter for the Minister and the Department to decide if additional measures are required.</p></speech>

The whole justification for being given the power for this scheme and the whole idea of the scheme was to fast-track.  Now that is not happening.  For two thirds of the planning applications, two thirds of the houses, work has not even commenced on them.  What responsibility would Mr. Walsh take for that?  I imagine he would have to accept some responsibility.  The policy is not working that he is tasked to implement.</p></speech>

The SHD legislation was to fast-track planning decisions.  That is what we have done.  It is not the board's job, and indeed people might argue that the board would be going way beyond its remit if it started taking over what either the Department or planning authorities do.  The Deputy mentioned before about making sure there was a local process, and that is the system that the board feeds into.  We make fast-track planning decisions and then the system has to ensure that there are sufficient mechanisms to drive development that happens on foot of it.  We have approved 16,000 units and 7,500 or 8,000 student bed spaces.  Many of those are being built.  It is a matter for the Department and the Minister to review to ensure that there is up-to-date information.  That is something that Mr. Sheridan might want to speak on.</p></speech>

There were claims that the planning system was an impediment or obstacle to the progression of housing developments and delivery of housing supply.</p><p>This was considered in the context of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan in 2016, and it was a commitment that the Department and the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, incorporated in the plan.  I accept the Deputy's point that the fast-track process was to facilitate the delivery of housing as speedily as possible and that it kind of undermines the system.  Despite the granting of planning permission, the permissions are not being acted on as quickly as is necessary, but we are monitoring this issue.  It was one of the issues addressed by the review group that reported back to us last week on the operation of the arrangements.</p></speech>

At what stage did the Department recognise that, while the whole idea was to fast-track development, it was not happening and, therefore, the policy was not working?  At what stage did the Department flag that up with the Minister and what was the response?</p></speech>

The first permissions were not granted until January 2018 and we have been monitoring it since then.  Granting planning permission is not the sole factor in ensuring delivery of housing supply but it is the one factor we and the Minister have control over.  However, other factors such as access to capital and land are equally important in this regard.  There may be situations where developers, on getting planning permission, are still in the process of completing schemes or obtaining finance to progress the permissions they have been granted.  It became apparent early in 2019 that things were not happening as quickly as we would like, but one has to allow a reasonable timeframe from the granting of permission to the commencement of development on site.  As I indicated, this was something that was focused on by the review group that reported back to us last week on the effectiveness of the scheme, and the group made particular recommendations in this regard.  It is ultimately a matter for the Minister, on foot of that review and under the provisions of the Act, to come forward with his conclusions on the review group report and any recommendations within it, and to submit his conclusions on that report, which we only received last week, to the Oireachtas by the end of October.</p></speech>

As I said, we only received the report last week.  We will be submitting the Minister's conclusions on the report and also the report itself to the Oireachtas, as required under the 2017 Act, by the end of this month, that is, in a matter of weeks.</p></speech>

It is only in operation for just over two years.

As I said, he is going to come forward with his responses to the review group report within a matter of weeks and they may include further legislative changes.  That has been flagged.  As Mr. Walsh has signalled, that could include the application of a vacant site levy where permissions are not being activated, and perhaps attaching a condition to those permissions that they must be commenced within a certain period after the permission is granted.  All of these issues are being looked at present.</p></speech>

For the purposes of transparency, Dave Walsh was assistant secretary over climate change and environment and Terry Sheridan was in planning at the time I was in the Department.</p> <p>  I was looking forward to the meeting today because, during my brief stint in the Department, this area was one where I would have loved to have had more time but, unfortunately, I did not.  I am very glad there is a new face to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if there is a face, because it is desperately needed.  I believe 100% in An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I do not believe that how it operates at the moment can continue from a transparency point of view.  It needs to change pretty fundamentally.  If I was ever on the other side of the Chamber again, it would be one of my main priorities to put this into a programme for Government.  In fact, I would insist on it.  I do not think it can continue.</p> <p>  I want to raise five different areas, and this is more by way of discussion than questions.  I will not ask the witnesses to speak about any individual cases, and if I mention one, it is not to look for a response.  I am certainly not going to down the road that Deputy MacSharry went, basically mirroring a case all the way.</p></speech>

In other words, the person objects to a development, that objection is dismissed by relevant authority - the county council - it is referred to the board, and the board disagrees with the planning authority and agrees with the person who referred it.  That is all fine, it happens, and it is no problem.  Has it ever happened that the actual person who is taking this to the board, where a decision has been made, in whole or in part, does not actually exist?  Would that not mean that this decision is in some way in jeopardy or in some way corrupted?  I use these words loosely because I cannot think of any other words, and I mean that in generic terms rather than with a personal orientation.</p><p>I ask the Chair to follow my logic.  Somebody objects to a proposal or a development, which is their entitlement.  The local authority then passes the development.  The person objecting takes it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which reverses the planning authority&rsquo;s decision, partly or fully based on the fact this person referred it to the board.  This person does not exist, however.  What happens then?  Has Mr. Walsh ever heard of any situation like this in any way, shape or form?</p></speech>

In some cases, letters would come back because the address was wrong or, in some cases, the person could not be found.  In theory, if there is no objection, then there is no case for the board to deal with.</p> <p>  Any appeal or objection that is received is circulated to the applicant.  Again, in some cases, the applicant may raise the same question the Deputy has, namely, does this person exist.  The board would take every step that it can to track down and make sure there is a valid appeal from a person who exists.</p> <p>  We would take legal advice as to what the status.  The board would have operated on the best available information it had in making its decision.  It may be a matter for the courts to decide whether the board&rsquo;s appeal and decision stands.</p> <p>  There have been difficulties.  I remember a general case in which somebody wrote in with their views on a topic.  It was obvious that English was not their first language.  The person spelled their name differently in three different locations on the application form.  We undertook to follow up and make sure the person existed.  The person did not write in the English script, meaning the challenge was spelling it.  Again, these are the kinds of steps the board would take in general terms.  In many cases, it would be the applicant who might raise this issue, on which the board would then follow up.</p></speech>

This is where my determination to ensure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is changed for the better is exemplified.  I do not think An Bord Plean&aacute;la can or should in any way, shape or form take an application unless it is verified.  The stage after involves taking the decision to another level, which is the courts.  That is not fair.  In fact, it is disproportionate because the applicant has done everything right.  A legislative change should be introduced to ensure an objector is verified.  I accept it could be graded according to the scale of the development from individual houses up.  However, for medium and large-scale developments, there should be some process like I have suggested.  In my view, there have been fictitious appeals that have gone all the way to the board.  The board&rsquo;s consideration of decisions has happened based on people who did not exist.  That is not acceptable.  It is not a good enough answer to say the applicant can resort to the courts.</p></speech>

This has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i>in Kerry.  The decision, however, of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that development was influenced by this.  There were only two objectors.  Everyone knows who the other one was.  That was their right as a citizen and I have no issue with that.  The decision, however, was based on the two objections sent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Nobody knows who the other person was.  Most people there do not believe that person exists.</p><p>That cannot be allowed happen.  Decisions like that are not acceptable.  Parking the decision about the actual case, it cannot happen that it was appealed by somebody who does not exist.</p></speech>

That is fine.  However, take the circle of the decision-making process.  It is corrupted if a person is appealing it and then the board has to consider that as part of the mix.  It cannot say that it is the same complete decision if it got all the way through the board but the person objecting does not exist.</p> <p>  One wonders why people have concerns about An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have had concerns about it from a transparency point of view for many years.  This is an ultimate example of why people have concerns.  That is why Mr. Walsh must clean it up.  I will not stop in my political career until this is fixed.  I will keep going on this issue because I believe it must be cleaned up.</p> <p>  The people of Ballinskelligs, a small little place in south Kerry who are dependent on this type of development and need it, will not have this hotel because of this decision.</p><p>The decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that is fine.  It was a decision that pre-dated Mr. Walsh and that is fine.  The fact the people in Ballinskelligs cannot find out who one of the people who objected was, and it got all the way through to the board, is fundamentally, totally and utterly wrong and cannot be allowed to happen in modern Ireland.  The impact it has on small places is disproportionate and morally wrong.  There are many other questions about it.  Mr. Walsh should take that for what it is worth.</p><p> I have a couple of comments to make on transparency and I will get back to my recommendations.  That was a Freudian slip; I mean the recommendations that came out of the report.  My colleague went through issues about who makes decisions and most people do not know that it can come down to three people.  I knew that, although most people did not.  I do not agree with it, but I know it.  I think that at the end of each year, the names of the people who made decisions on each file must be published.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should bring that in.</p></speech>

However many people are involved in making a decision, if any of the decision makers had conversations with each other before the decision was made, they should, through An Bord Plean&aacute;la processes, have to declare them prior to the decision being made.  It is purely a transparency initiative to stop any notion of people coming together to make decisions beforehand.  These suggestions are purely to protect the process of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  I return to the recommendations in the review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that I sought.  When I was Minister, I had many others balls in the air about other matters, so I did not have much time for this area.  I did, however, ask for a complete review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, organisationally, which was done at the time by very eminent people.  I rarely do this, but I submitted a parliamentary question to my former Department, asking for an update, in chronological order, on the 101 recommendations contained in that review.  The Department refused to do that.  The Ceann Comhairle will be dealing with the matter and I look forward to that being resolved.  Will Mr. Walsh please provide the committee, within in a week or two, with the current status of those 101 recommendations?</p></speech>

There are very good recommendations in it and I want to find out the status of them all.  I have a deep suspicion that many of them have not materialised.  That would concern me because I felt at the time that there was not much of a pull towards my decision to start this review in the first place.  Page 30 of the annual report states the board consented to the quashing of ten of its orders where a procedural deficit was identified.  On ten occasions, the board had to quash its own orders which is a bit of an indictment of the procedures.  In this report, many of the procedures are updated and improved on so I want to ensure they are being implemented.</p> <p>  The report was not done for the craic.  There are some very good recommendations in the report.  For example, recommendation No. 61 is that the board must make clear its direction, by reference to paragraph numbers, those parts of the inspector's report with which it agrees and those parts with which it disagrees.  That again brings me back to transparency.  Where the board disagrees, it should give its reasons for doing so, supported, if necessary, by relevant evidence.  In other words, the reasons should not be formulaic.  Does that happen?</p></speech>

I am not going to take up much committee time on this but there are a number of other useful recommendations.  Recommendation No. 3 relates to managerial oversight.  Recommendation Nos. 6 and 8 deal with board members being appointed by the public appointments service, PAS.  That goes outside the board's remit and is more of a departmental issue but that is a no-brainer and should happen.  Recommendation No. 16 relates to biannual seminars.  Recommendation No. 24 deals with performance management.  There are a whole range of recommendations that need legislative changes which, I understand, would come through the Department and not the board.</p> <p>  Deputy MacSharry spoke about the use of local authorities and I do not believe An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be hiring rooms in hotels unless it is going through a very long process.  I think they should all be in local authorities, or somewhere close to them.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 66 is aimed at easing pressures, getting the timelines down and meeting the timeframes set out.  It suggests appointing one board member for small developments unless they are going to contradict it.  The timelines must improve.</p> <p>  Referring back to my time in the Department, I believe the relationship between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department needs to change.  I will not say too much more about that but it needs to change pretty quickly.</p> <p>  Another recommendation is that where there is a contravention of a local development plan over a certain level, there should be consultation with the public.  Does that happen?  It does not.  That has to happen and that is an example of a recommendation that never came in.</p> <p>  The board should have an annual conference.  Recommendation No. 98 states there should be a head of communications.  At the end of the year, key decisions should be explained.</p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, all this is about transparency to the public about operations, the people who make the decisions, how people are appointed, how money is spent and to ensure that serious contraventions of local developments are explained.  All this needs to be front-facing.  The days of An Bord Plean&aacute;la hiding behind secrets and a process that nobody knows about, although I know about it and can see it, are over.  The process needs to be front and centre for the public to see.  People do not respect, appreciate or understand how all this works.  That is becoming a problem because discourses are emanating out there as regards decision making.  That creates rumours, which creates concerns.  I believe some of these are not warranted.  However, I demonstrated examples at the beginning of this meeting where they are warranted, justified and are affecting people's lives in a massive and disproportionate way.  It is wrong.</p> <p>  I have a couple of final points to make and questions to ask.  I bet our guests are glad I came to the committee today.  A number of pieces of legislation are recommended as part of the 101 recommendations.  Have our guests any issue with any of the proposed pieces of legislation?  If so, they might tell me.</p></speech>

Some 20 cases went to the courts in 2018.  Seven of those cases were refused leave to appeal, 13 cases were won by the board, and two cases were lost.</p></speech>

I will touch on a number of issues.</p> <p>  I refer to strategic housing developments.  If a local authority receives a big planning application, a commencement notice is given in order that it can track permissions and commencements.  How does An Bord Plean&aacute;la do that?</p></speech>

The board has no role in commencements.  Any commencements required by an applicant or developer go into the local government system.</p></speech>

Our job is to determine the planning permission, and once that is done, our role is finished and it goes back to the local authorities to enforce it.</p></speech>

I presume the local authorities have to deal with Part V and applications that are given permission subject to conditions.  Where something is granted permission in theory, the conditions can sometimes take some time to work out and must be worked out at local government level.  How many applications would be subject to conditions?</p></speech>

Some of those applications require local authority agreement around finishes, landscaping, and so on.  These are normal issues in the course of a development.  A planning application that is successful at local level would have the same level of conditions attached to it.</p></speech>

Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

It is standard practice that if a developer wants to move ahead, it will submit the finishes or other details to the local authority to be signed off on.</p></speech>

However, when a site gets permission and is subsequently sold, there is no obligation to maintain a website.  I have come across that issue in my own area and it becomes impossible for people to find information.  There is a question of transparency in public information, because the development has not come through the local authorities.  They will only put it up on their system so they can track it for compliance.  Is that currently being looked at?  There is duplication here which is costing administrative time.</p></speech>

That is something Mr. Sheridan may well update and is being looked at as part of the review.  All the information the board receives is on our website as part of the public record, and is also available to view in our offices.

It is challenging for people because there is a lot of information on the site and it is not in the modern website style.

The board is a member of the oversight steering group so we are fully <i>au fait</i>with what it is doing.  We have been talking at a technical level to ensure understanding of information, particularly in the context of how data and files will move.  Ultimately, it is the format of files.

We are operating with different systems.  The key is that the systems talk to each other as effectively as possible.  We have chosen a certain project, a Microsoft customer relationship management, CRM, system, to operate in the board and that runs throughout the board.  The local government system through the LGMA operates different models in not just the planning area but also in how it operates as an organisation.  Obviously, it has other functions.  The reality is that most of the documentation that will be transferred over and back will be in the same format and it is about making sure that both systems talk and are compatible.  There is no duplication.  We have been developing this for the last four years and the system is operational.  It is working and we are using it daily in the organisation.  The key issue for me is to ensure that it works as efficiently and fully as possible before we roll it out for the public accessing it.</p></speech>

When it went live internally in 2017 the spend was &euro;1.319 million, and in 2018 the spend was &euro;456,000.  That gives a total of &euro;2.875 million spent to the end of 2018, with a further &euro;174,000 spent this year so far.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh spoke about a combined approach to the IT strategy.  Is there a combined approach to storage capacity as well, or would that be appropriate?  A very large amount of money is being spent nationally and some of it would not be under the remit of this committee.

The Office of Government Procurement has a framework agreement so there are people who have pre-qualified to provide archiving and storage services.

A great deal of work goes into them.  Many of them have to be re-examined because we have moved from a national spatial strategy to the national development plan and a re-focus.  The plans will have gone through, in a very thoughtful way, what is required to permit a housing development to take place, such as associated roads infrastructure, schools, community facilities and so forth.  The board does not have to take account of those.  It can have regard to them.  The phrases "regard to" and "in compliance with" are very different.  What note does the board take of those with regard to, for example, large scale strategic housing developments?  There is already sizeable disquiet about more one-dimensional housing development.  We need housing, but the point is there is a store of other things are not provided in parallel with it.</p><p>Houses are built but not communities.  What is An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit in that regard?  There is a cost associated with it.  What is the arrangement?</p></speech>

The Deputy is making the point that the development is not in isolation.  It requires upgrades in servicing through wastewater, water systems or traffic, and has cumulative impacts.  We also have regard to national policy, from the national planning framework through what, hopefully, will be regional spatial and economic strategies and the new regional plans in place.  It is always a balance to say we have to have regard to those.  As I said in response to another Deputy's question, where we are seriously materially contravening and going against the local plan, we have to justify and explain why that is the case.  For SHDs, when a proposal comes in that goes against the plan, it has to advertise in its public notice that it is contravening the plan and set out the reasons for that.  The board will analyse and assess that in coming to its final decision.</p></speech>

However, there is often a time lag and that is why this phasing approach is often knitted into plans.  That is not always followed through on.  There could be a potential cost.</p></speech>

There is a significant challenge in trying to align and ensure that all of the plans at the different levels are consistent.  The local area plans would be the last to be updated, taking account of whatever is in their regional spatial strategy and the key principles.  In an ideal world, we would say that we will wait until everything is aligned before making decisions, but we have to make important and efficient decisions on issues and investments now, whether housing, roads or water.  That is not to say that anything in the plans at present is out of date.  We have to recognise that there may be a mismatch in the interim between what might be national and local.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the courts to ultimately decide whether the board's decision was valid or otherwise.  In every case, including some that we win, we get a report from our legal advisers stating what the issue was and that the courts decided to make a judgement, stating that the board's language was deficient or the process was not as robust as it should be and what the board needed to do to amend it.  With regard to appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessments or provision of services, the language sometimes used by the board in its orders may or may not fully reflect the requirements.</p></speech>

We have a process which can be convoluted and take a long time.  We receive claims from the people who we have liability to, usually in a gross amount.  Since we are dealing with the superior courts, those claims can be quite substantial.  When we contest a judicial review that goes through the High Court, possibly to the Supreme Court, the claims can range from &euro;250,000 to &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

We consult our legal advisers about the quantum of the claim.  There can be scope for settlement negotiations to be conducted without necessarily going to taxation.  I am not a legal person but as I understand it, it would be quite common in such matters for the parties to try to settle.  Given the nature of the committee here, members can rest assured that when we receive a gross claim, we do not just pay it.  I am not costing any aspersions on the bona fides of the claimants but the settlement negotiations that we have experienced in the last number of years have substantially settled claims at a much reduced level from the original level, in the quantum of approximately between 25% and 40%.  We have also gone to taxation but I understand that people know that to go to taxation is itself a costly process, including the transaction costs of taxation.  We have to make the judgment about whether we settle at what we consider to be an amount that would not be bettered at taxation.  That is what we do in individual cases.  We have settled but at a level that is much lower than the claim.</p></speech>

All of this is on the board's website.  The fees can vary.  They are based on the number of units in the development.  A certain amount is specified per unit.  It also depends on whether an environmental impact assessment or Natura impact statement is involved and whether alteration requests are made.

We did a breakdown for the first six months of the operation of the SHD.  We calculated the amount of time taken by staff and local authorities, which get a portion of the fees.</p><p>For the first 18 months of the operation, we received &euro;2.416 million in fees under strategic housing developments.  There was a refund of just over &euro;1.09 million of those fees.  Where we were able to process the fees in advance, we gave a refund of money that was not spent.  That pretty much left &euro;1.325 million as the estimated costs of what we spent.  It is full cost recovery, just the same as strategic infrastructure.</p></speech>

We would ask the question of what would happen if the power went down in the organisation or the IT system completely failed.  All departments, from reception up to the board, operate off this system so we would consider what we would do in that scenario.  Another example would be performance.  At the start of this year, we identified that our compliance with the SOP was not where it should be and we identified that as a major risk.</p></speech>

This would be our 80% compliance target.  We have made sufficient progress over the course of the year.  We set a target for ourselves to be at 70% by the end of the year, and we are currently at about 65%, so we reduced that risk as part of our mid-year review because we recognised that we have more control over it.  There is a control effectiveness measure, so the number three signifies the most control and the number one means it is out of our hands.

They are good and easy to read.  I come from a slightly different background and I do not condemn An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the local authorities about planning.  They have been underfunded and under-resourced for a long time.  I do not expect Mr. Walsh to comment on what I am about to say but I will preface my remarks by saying we are now in a position where we are rushing through, and putting a statutory obligation on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to rush through, housing developments and other strategic developments that should be going through an adequately resourced and funded local authority.  We are undermining democracy and the participation of citizens.  From a legal background, one matter that always struck me as I listened to the judges was the emphasis they put on the trinity.  I want to repeat that here and I will go on to ask some questions.  The trinity in planning law is the local authority, the developer and the citizen.  The burden on the citizen is huge.  I do not like the word "objection".  I have rarely seen objectors in my 17 years at local authority level.  I have seen committed people.  One does see one or two people who object for the sake of it but most people are committed when they go to the trouble of making a submission.  I have seen the role of the public in the planning process significantly reduced to the point that it has been almost entirely removed.  That is to the detriment of our democracy.</p> <p>  I have just returned from the D&aacute;il where the T&aacute;naiste justified the legislation the Government brought in giving An Bord Plean&aacute;la the power to look at strategic housing developments.  He said it was taking 75 weeks to process an application for 100 houses.  That was one of the reasons he gave, which I wrote down as he spoke.  I was totally unaware of that and I spent 17 years at local authority level.  What was missing, since 2009 in particular, was application, staff and public housing.</p></speech>

It comes from a piece of work the Department undertook in 2015 and 2016 to track large-scale developments of 100 houses or more from when they went into the local authority to when the decision on the appeal was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The Department shared a spreadsheet of all those cases and the calculations with the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government as part of the deliberations on the legislation.  Notwithstanding the point the Deputy has made, if we look at how An Bord Plean&aacute;la is operating, we have a mandate to deal with what comes before us.

There was no problem getting applications through at local authority level during the Celtic tiger period.  I watched that and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was understaffed and under-resourced.  I am glad to hear it has more resources now but it would have to get more resources given the huge range of responsibilities it has, extending from derelict site levies to projects of common interest, which I will come to.  Is An Bord Plean&aacute;la adequately resourced to deal with all those responsibilities?</p></speech>

Environmental impact assessments are generally carried out on such projects, which would deal with the human impact but also the impact on water, on air and on energy, including renewable energy.  The proposer would be expected to outline why the development was positive rather than negative.  Locations are a critical factor and water courses may be impacted in certain areas.  Data centres, like any other major infrastructure, have a huge draw on resources generally.  We look at the cumulative impact of proliferation as much as an individual case.  We marry our approach to major infrastructure and industrial processes to renewable energy proposals and we see the full spectrum, giving us a better picture to enable us to make the best determination we can.</p></speech>

Often it is not clear what the issue is.  In these cases we provide an opportunity for the applicant or the appellant to elaborate or provide further evidence.  We normally allow a period of two or three weeks.  We then circulate the material to everyone else in the file and the 18 weeks disappear very quickly.  We have a priority system to balance the larger projects, particularly where there is masses of information and we need to make sure people will have time to understand and respond to it.  Our system looks at files and balances the competing challenges presented by small cases and ones of more strategic, community, economic or infrastructural significance.  We make sure we provide the resources needed to ensure there will be a planning inspector and staff ready to deal with those files, rather leaving all of the hard ones until the end.  We have to balance it as we go.</p></speech>

I understand how something can be delayed.  A lot of people have received letters stating their case was not dealt with within the 18-week period and that it would be dealt with within a few more weeks.  When those few weeks passed by, they received another letter stating it would be dealt with in another few weeks.  This was a source of much irritation and frustration for real people in trying to go about their daily lives.  Does Mr. Walsh acknowledge that this is the case?  What has An Bord Plean&aacute;la done since that period?  Has the organisation learned from it and how will it prevent it from happening ever again to normal people in going about their lives?</p></speech>

Certainly we have learned that we do not want to offer something we cannot actually deliver.  We have improved our overall compliance levels.  It used to take on average between 22.5 and 23 weeks to decide all cases.  Cases were not decided within 18 weeks, but they did not go to far beyond that figure.  We have brought it down to 19.5 weeks.  In the vast majority of cases where parties do not receive a decision within 18 weeks, they receive one very soon afterwards.

I am just commenting on other assertions made here.  I cannot see how it is technically possible or realistic for the ten people to consider all 2,900 cases.  I am sure members of the public do not make the calculation.  Three members of the board make a decision on a case.  As I said at the start, a case could involve a shed at the back of a property or 200 houses.  Obviously, the full complement of ten people does not make a decision on an extension.  Can I assume that in his leading role Mr. Walsh is the person who balances the expertise of the board in make decisions?</p></speech>

We have 55 or 60 planners and a director of planning who identifies cases that are complex and which will require time.  It is a perfect balance.  If we were getting through decisions in five minutes, it would be said the board was not spending enough time in considering the issues involved.  We have to find the perfect balance between having sufficient sharing of views in order that it is not just one person who is making the decision and the need to prioritise and provide the full scale of perspectives needed on large-scale major projects.  It is my job, as chairperson, to convene a meeting of the full board or all of its available members.</p></speech>

Are there cases where other members of the board come to Mr. Walsh with the view that he has not made the correct decision on who is to look at a certain case?  Does another member of the board ever say that perhaps member No. 8 should be involved also?  Do the other members of the board come together and recommend having seven, rather than five, because the other two have a specific interest in X or Y?

We follow formal well developed procedures that have been built up over decades of experience within the organisation.  We are operating in a legal context that is very much evolving.  We have new directives and requirements.  Case law will alter the thresholds or tests.  When legal advice indicates that a case will be challenging, we make a judgment.  Normally when we concede a case, it is remitted to the board, but different decision-makers look at it.  We make sure our processes are fully up to speed.  In these cases that is a better option than going to the courts.  The issue is not cost but time.  The amount of lead-in time required to obtain court dates, even in the commercial courts, stretches out the process.  It probably undermines people's confidence in the system.</p></speech>

How could something end up being &euro;5 million when it was &euro;2.9 million?  Inflation is understandable but if I was the company who had got that tender I would be delighted I had received a tender for &euro;2.9 million and could potentially get &euro;5 million.

We estimate the core development costs to be just over &euro;1 million.  This is what OpenSky is doing.  There are other supports.</p> <p>  I refer to the best laid plans and our best estimates for assessing the future costs.  We had advisers on board and programme managers and people with expertise in this area who said what it should cost.  The big challenge with any kind of project, whether IT or not, is that if it goes over schedule, it will cost more.  We need people for longer and we need to budget for that.</p> <p>  When we started off in 2014, we did not have strategic housing as a function or vacant sites as a function.  We also did not have the developments that have happened in the last five years in terms of the expectation of moving everything to the cloud.  We want to ensure we do not just retain and keep with the old product envisaged in 2014, but that we create a product that is future-proofed for the next five to ten years and that can be agile and adapt to the future requirements.</p></speech>

A point was made earlier about the interface there.  Consider a private citizen who may be in conflict with the local authority.  If I was being brought into a local authority office, I would feel that everyone there might be working against me.  I agree with cost savings, and I am sure there are ways to explore that.  I do not agree, however, and I do not think it is acceptable that a citizen of this country who has an oral hearing to do with a local authority, and where they are on opposite sides, could be put in a position where he or she would have to walk into the opposition's building.  I am not really expecting the witnesses to agree with this, or they can if they want.  I just wanted it on the record.</p></speech>

I did not really understand it until I read a bit about it.  I understand that there has been some success in Louth and in Waterford.  Will the witnesses talk me through how it happens?  When somebody tells the Department there is a boarded-up house in the middle of wherever and nobody has been in it for a long time, what is the procedure then?  I do not want the message to be that properties are being seized and occupied without consideration of the constitutional rights of people.  Once the authority moves into the CPO process, is it a runaway train or can it be pulled back for the citizen?</p></speech>

The CPO powers rest with the planning authority.  The local authorities will monitor their housing stock in their areas, that is, houses they control such as social housing, and they look at the community.  The local authority will hear about vacant properties directly or people may write in and say a building is in terrible state, is not being used and that it should be used.  The local authorities have powers under the CPO legislation around derelict sites to enable them either to force the person who owns or controls the house to fix it up and make use of it, and if that does not happen the authority can compulsorily acquire the house.  There are a number of steps, which the legislation sets out very clearly.  We give everybody involved an opportunity to understand that there are certain requirements and that it can be a safety issue.  If a building is going to fall down or is collecting waste and becoming a health hazard, there is a notice of intention placed by the local authority.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la gets involved only where a person might appeal the compulsory purchase.  If the owner of the building says, for example, that he or she wants to do something with the building, then the appeal goes to the board.</p></speech>

Can that person appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and say he or she wants it, and can the process be halted?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned Louth as an example where they have used the CPO powers a lot to bring properties into proper use.  I am speaking on behalf of the planning authority when I say that the motivation is to get a property back into use, whether it is a property the local authority would control, such as social housing, or whether the building would be used, rented or lived in permanently.  Where the owner of the property gives assurances to the local authority, the local authority would write to the board and indicate that it wants to annul the CPO because it is satisfied that the property will come back into use.  We close off that CPO process then.</p></speech>

If they cannot find the owners, the local authorities affix a notice to the property, which normally alerts the person who is not living in the area because someone might call him or her to say a notice is stuck on the front door of that old building he or she has on a certain street.  That tends to alert the person, who then has the opportunity to fix up the building in its general appearance.  Sometimes if a roof is leaning out into the street, the local authority could carry out the work and charge it against the property.  If that all fails, then it might go to the CPO.  It would be the end of a long road.  There is a lot of work involved, and it is only the minority that end up at this stage.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la would only deal with the cases that are appealed to it.</p> <p>  I am curious to know if any of the appeals the board has had to date were financial institutions, people with what I would call a beneficial interest.  That is a broad question and not about any specific case.</p></speech>

Local authorities are telling me that sometimes the bank lets it go because it is not worth trying to sell it on the open market and they like the CPO process because it gets the property off their hands, they get the current market value, and they do not have to engage a selling agent to sell it.  Through the local authorities I am hearing that some banks just sit back, let it happen, and the cheque will roll in at the end of the CPO process.

That is the other side of it.  I concur completely with Deputy O'Connell's comments about the location for oral hearings and the independence of those.  I understand that other members have expressed their own views about whether the hearings should be held in local authority buildings.  It is not a view of the committee and it is just people giving their own view on it.  I can think of nothing worse than having a hearing in the local authority, because regularly it is people appealing a decision of a local authority.  The board comes down on the decision in the local authority chamber.  It could not be worse and it could not look worse.  It could damage the board to be doing that.  It would be like a person appealing to the social welfare appeals office and the appeal being heard in the local social welfare office.  The person would wonder what chance he or she has going in there and it being the same people again.  It would be different faces, but the same.  It would be very bad practice for An Bord Plean&aacute;la's independence to have anything to do with the inside of a local authority building.  Regularly the board adjudicates on cases from them.  That is my view, and the Deputy had the same view.</p> <p>  With regard to the board, we have dealt with the women thing and the female gender balance-----</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la assigns the various members of its board like whoever runs the business in the courts assigns judges to different cases.  It is a bit like that because An Bord Plean&aacute;la's role is quasi-judicial to an extent, so I see a parallel.  It is not the case that every member of the High Court sits on every case.  I think that when people think about this, they will appreciate the common sense of what is happening there.</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la refers somewhere in its documentation to what it calls normal planning applications.  I ask Mr. Walsh to explain to the public, the listeners, what is normal.  It is a funny choice of word.  Does it mean traditional?</p></speech>

We deal with a range of appeals, from building consents to vacant sites, but a normal planning application that is appealed is what we call a normal planning appeal.  They make up about two thirds of all the numbers we deal with.  Obviously, some cases, such as large-scale housing and strategic infrastructure developments, come into us brand new.  Others concern different types of water cases or building control.  A normal planning appeal is a planning application that has been appealed.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh can send us a note on the next question I want to ask.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspectorate does the work on all decisions, presents the report to the board members and so on.  Will Mr. Walsh tell us, if he has the figure off the top of his head, which he probably does, although I ask him to send it to us anyway, how many decisions of the board accept the inspector's recommendation and how many overrule it?</p></speech>

Generally, around 10% to 12% or 13% of all cases are overturned, that is, the board makes a different decision from the inspector's recommended version.  Half of these cases are generally to grant where an inspector might wish to refuse, and the others might be to refuse where an inspector has recommended a grant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-03a.781" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019100300002#FF02100"><p>As Chairman, I want to put to the committee the two sides to this.  It depends on whether one likes the judgment or the decision.  People will have a view as to whether it is right or wrong.  If a person agrees with the inspector and is overruled by the board, people complain bitterly, but then I always take the view that if the inspector's decision is the final word, why is a board needed at all?  A board must have some role.  I would be more concerned if there were an acceptance rate of 100% because I would wonder what control the board had if it were just rubber-stamping everything.  It is important, therefore, that there be a bit of rigour between both.</p></speech>

There is a very strong communication link.  Again, for any board decision where we overturn a recommendation of the inspector, we document the reasons.  We state in our decision that the board does not accept the recommendation because of the following reasons.  We try to explain it, and that becomes a matter of public record.  The other point is that, as the Chairman mentioned, the board has many skills and we are multidisciplinary.  The whole point is that planning is not an exact science.  It is a holistic approach to the question whether something is the right development.  That is where our system, as opposed to other systems whereby there may be just one person who is a planner making appeal decisions, is a more transparent and robust process.</p></speech>

There is a concern that somebody proposing a strategic infrastructure development may sit down with An Bord Plean&aacute;la at length before the proposal comes before the board.  One would wonder whether An Board Plean&aacute;la guided or assisted the applicant or told him or her what he or she had better change.  The acid test here is, out of the decisions on strategic infrastructure over, say, the past five years, what is the percentage granted and the percentage not granted?  Will Mr. Walsh tell us the percentages?  I see that last year there might have been one or two not granted.  Reference is made to an electrical substation.

I refer to what a planning authority would normally consider as part of a planning application.  If the authority receives an application, it is unusual not to have some request for further information, and that can then be assessed and people can see it.  In these situations, however, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has ironed out all that before the application comes in.  What then comes in, having been discussed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the applicant, should be fairly right because the applicant knows there is no further opportunity to put in further information.  In other words, so much of the decision is made before the formal application is lodged.  Again I come to the percentage of cases granted versus those refused.  If a very high percentage of them are granted, having gone through the nine weeks of private consultation behind closed doors before the formal process commences, it is no wonder.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la was part of the process, if Mr. Walsh knows what I mean.  He gets my question.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is worth pointing out that the process is there to try to facilitate quick decisions.

When we produce the nine-week opinion at the end of the process, the development team would go away and it may not put in an application.  It might change the application.

It is important for the public to look at this.  I refer to the second appendix, detailing planning appeals received and decided by local authorities.  Everybody here is familiar with some local authority.  The information gives, for each local authority, the number of decisions made, the percentage of planning authority decisions confirmed, the percentage of planning authority decisions granted with conditions changed or added, and the percentage of planning authority decisions reversed.  I put my hands up as I will refer to Laois County Council, which had only 8% of the decisions coming before the board reversed.  That is the best record.  Kerry and Meath had 41% of the decisions rejected, Sligo had 38% of decisions rejected, Waterford city and county had 37% of decisions rejected, and Galway had 36% of decisions rejected.</p> <p>  Some planning authorities seem to be slightly more aligned to the board's thinking than other local authority planning offices.  Dublin is a little below average as well.  The witnesses get the point.  There must be a history of local authorities that have a significant number of decisions rejected year in and year out.  Other authorities tend to be more closely aligned to the board's thinking as it tends to support more of their decisions.  Perhaps the Department has a role in this.  Has there been an examination of these figures?  Has the County and City Management Association been involved?  Should there be uniformity?  It is clear that the board is the one national body that makes consistent decisions, regardless of the origins of an application.  It is clear that some local authorities get it and are fairly closely aligned but several others are operating away, probably hoping that cases do not go before the board.</p><p>If 41% of the decisions that come to the board are overturned, I worry about all those that would have been granted if they had come to it.  I accept that the board states it is a matter for the regulator but does it understand the concern I raise? </p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, one of the core functions of the office of the planning regulator will be to monitor the performance of local planning authorities to ensure they apply consistent standards and operate proper assistance and procedures, etc., in making their determinations.  Where they deviate from the national average, the regulator is empowered to go in and-----</p></speech>

I am sure that if I looked at the chart from five or even ten years ago, most of the same people will be in the same space.  The same will be true in another five years if they are allowed.  It is not good for the system.  In some counties, there is a great deal of aggravation against An Bord Plean&aacute;la because someone may have been prevented from building a house somewhere.  Another local authority would have known that the permission was not going to run in any event and might have got it right from day one.  It does not do the Department good in some communities when it overturns decisions, after people think they got the decision they wanted but somebody objected or whatever.  I have faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la - not every time but usually.</p></speech>

More generally, it potentially undermines confidence in the entire planning system if there is a great divergence between decisions at a local level and by the board.  Different cases can generate different overturn rates.  One of the meetings I had soon after I joined the board was with a delegation from the CCMA to discuss how we could share the experiences the board was having.  It was not about pointing to authorities that might not do everything right but rather to ones that present their information.  The vacant sites levy is an example.  It is new for local authorities and the board and we are constantly refining our processes.  There should be a dialogue, maybe facilitated by the Department or the new regulator, for people to talk and understand why we do something.  I do not mean that the board would tell people but some of the local authorities such as that in County Laois, which are obviously doing something right, could say this is how they approach the board and ask whether it is some best practice that could be shared with the 30 other authorities.  We are very open.  As the Chairman noted, we have a wealth of knowledge and experience in every type of case.  We are there to be tapped for advice.</p></speech>

Inevitably, they will not work.  While they are a great idea, they just do not work in practice.  Let us say a local authority has a population of 100,000.  Over the lifetime of its regional and national plans, it is to grow to 110,000 but the natural increase goes beyond that without a new house being built.  What happens when the local authority approaches the board?  Does it examine the current population?  I know that it has the latest CSO figures but I worry that if people were to implement the plans they had drawn up, they would be obliged to say the application cannot be granted because it has exceeded the permitted population figures.  How does the board deal with that?</p></speech>

It is a mapped information system of all applications that have come before the board, which allows us to see the data around an area.  To return to the question on core strategies and assigned numbers, that is in the development plan and the board would very much have regard to it.  The challenge, as other Deputies have highlighted, is that until such time as the regional plans and the updated local plans are in place with new figures, we are working off development plans that might be outdated.</p></speech>

I quote him every time anybody is asked for anything.</p> <p>  On the issue of wind farm guidelines, we operate on old, out-of-date ones.  We have been told for years that new ones are expected and that it is a matter for the Department but I do not understand it.  When people started building wind turbines, they normally had a height of 50 m, but they are now 180 m and we still have the same setbacks.  The Department is negligent - that is the most polite word.  The guidelines are utterly not fit for purpose.  They are not suitable for the scale of the structures coming through the system.  They were designed for a system when wind turbines were much smaller than they are now.  I have made my point.  The Department should publish new guidelines.  I am tired of asking parliamentary questions.  </p> <p>  The board is doing a review and I acknowledge that there was an event in Belgium.  I attended it several times and our guests will have seen my name in the debates.  The World Health Organization, WHO, issued new guidelines recently, which has delayed the review even further.  When an appeal from a wind farm is received, there are WHO guidelines on setback distance, flicker and whatever but the statutory guidelines from the Department are way behind the WHO guidelines.  Which does the board work off?  Does it work off those given by the Department, knowing they are not the best ones for sustainable development and that they are not in line with the WHO?</p></speech>

We consider applications in light of the guidelines.  Obviously, we have regard to national energy policy and legislation as well as planning guidance and international and WHO standards.  In terms of legal effect, the WHO standards are best practice guidelines.  We are aware of them and take into account other elements which support and protect citizens as well as the baseline from the 2005 guidelines.</p></speech>

The TPNW provides for states to fulfil their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and affirm their commitment to achieving a world free from nuclear weapons.  The TPNW plugs a legal gap by prohibiting the last form of weapon of mass destruction which has not yet been explicitly outlawed under international law.  I am pleased that during the Second Stage debate all parties expressed support for the passing of this legislation and shared a deep concern about the devastating consequences to humanity and the planet which would arise from the detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet, whether by accident, miscalculation or design.  We are all agreed that the only guarantee of protection from the use of nuclear weapons is their complete elimination.  The ratification by Ireland of the TPNW will be an important step towards the realisation of this important goal.</p> <p>  The TPNW establishes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on participating in nuclear weapon activities.  The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 creates offences in respect of these prohibitions.  In addition to these core prohibitions that implement the disarmament pillar of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the TPNW obliges states parties to assist survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use in areas under their jurisdiction and to undertake necessary environmental remediation in areas under their control.  The treaty is the first international legal instrument to recognise the disproportionate impact on the health of women and girls of ionising radiation from nuclear weapons use.  The treaty also promotes equal participation in the treaty&rsquo;s work by women and men and includes a provision on disarmament education.   </p> <p>  Ratification of the treaty following the enactment of the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 will be in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Ireland played a leading role in the treaty negotiations and, accordingly, signed the treaty at the earliest opportunity, on 20 September 2017.  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the treaty negotiations also reflected our principled position on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, respect for human rights and the promotion of civil society voices.  These values are reflected in the treaty.  I am pleased to inform members that during a special high level ceremony at UN Headquarters in New York last week the TPNW took a significant step forward towards its entry into force when seven states signed and five states ratified the treaty.  The treaty now has 79 signatories and 32 states parties.  The treaty is more than halfway towards the 50 states parties required for its entry into force.</p> <p>  I would like to inform the committee that the Government is likely to propose an amendment on Report Stage to include a reverse onus clause in section 2 of the Bill.  This type of clause is to be found in other similar legislation, including the Biological Weapons Act 2011.  A reverse onus clause will ensure that, in the event of a prosecution being commenced for an offence under the Bill, a weapon or other explosive device capable of releasing nuclear energy will be presumed to have been designed for hostile purposes, that is, to cause or likely to cause death, serious injury or damage to property or the environment.  Thus, it will be for the defendant to cast reasonable doubt on this presumption in order to rebut it. </p> <p>  I again thank Deputies for their support for the Bill during its Second Reading.  More particularly, I thank Deputies for the richness of their engagement across a broad range of issues related to nuclear disarmament during that debate.  There is no doubt but that a world free of nuclear weapons is in best interests of humanity and the planet.  That is a shared view across the House.  I am confident that we will succeed in passing this legislation which will allow Ireland to ratify the TPNW in the coming months and demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s leadership on the international stage on the issue of nuclear disarmament.</p></speech>

Its research and background information on the Bill were very helpful.  Its work complements ours, particular of those of us in opposition.  It is of huge benefit to Members.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports and welcomes the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill.  As the Minister of State said, it received unanimous support on Second Stage.  I imagine that support will continue as the Bill progresses through all remaining Stages.  The Bill will enable Ireland to become a state party to the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and give effect to its provisions in Irish law.  The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities related to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.  This is both very welcome and something to which every country should agree.  Nuclear weapons threaten the very existence of the human race and life on this planet.  They should not be developed, stored or used by anyone.  </p> <p>  It is worrying that many Cold War disarmament treaties are breaking down.  That should be noted in this discussion.  Presidents Trump and Putin are moving towards a new arms race.  We need to create a world free from nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction.  Ireland must be a global leader on the issues of demilitarisation and disarmament.  </p> <p>  We should remember all victims and survivors of nuclear weapons.  Two nuclear weapons have been used in war - the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US military in 1945.  These two bombs killed 120,000 civilians and flattened both cities.  They were deployed to kill as many civilians as possible.  It was a war crime, although it is never spoken about in these terms, and the effects are still being felt today.</p><p>We have seen pictures of babies born today who are suffering the effects of that war which should never have happened.  The development and use of nuclear weapons should have ended with it, but, regrettably, the opposite happened.  We know that more and more of these weapons were produced.  I always try to attend the annual event organised by the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on Merrion Square to remember all those who died in these two war crime events.  It is a small ceremony, but it is important that Irish people be given the opportunity to express their horror at what happened.  During the Cold War we saw massive proliferation of nuclear weapons which still pose a threat to humanity.  Nuclear weapons have been detonated on 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations which have caused enormous environmental damage.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that in 2017 there were 14,465 nuclear weapons in the world.  They must all be destroyed and put beyond use.  </p><p> I reiterate my support for the treaty, Ireland being a signatory to it and the Bill, the effect of which will be to enshrine the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  I am not sure about the amendment that has been tabled and hope someone will speak to it.  I am open to supporting it, but I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on it.  The treaty is not binding on states that are not a party to it and we have a long race to run before we reach full global nuclear disarmament.  Nonetheless, the treaty remains an important step in achieving nuclear disarmament.  In parallel to its support for the treaty, the Government should try to stop the erosion of Irish neutrality and oppose further militarisation of the European Union.  I know that there are differences of opinion, but it is not good enough to oppose nuclear weapons while remaining part of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace.  We cannot chastise countries that have stockpiled and developed nuclear weapons in Europe and then join EU battle groups with them and silently move towards the formation of an EU army.  It is welcome that we have signed the treaty, but we must encourage more countries to do likewise.  We must also encourage those that have nuclear weapons to set out on the long road towards disarmament and the decommissioning of all nuclear weapons.</p></speech>

That said, I have concerns.  While we are all agreed on the prohibition of nuclear weapons which are weapons of mass destruction, there seems to be an open field for the arms industry generally and the weapons produced that cause massive, rather than mass, destruction.  It is all very well to agree on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, but the bigger picture must be addressed.  This is particularly the case when one looks at the finance involved in the arms industry.  When I was speaking to the Bill in the D&aacute;il Chamber, I mentioned some figures which included the $1.74 trillion spent on arms in 2017.  In the European Union alone, military spending is &euro;260 billion per annum.  Apparently, it will take another $1 trillion to modernise the nuclear weapons capacity of the nine countries that have nuclear weapons.  While we are passing this legislation, supporting its provisions and asking that it be as strong as possible, we must be mindful of what is happening in the wider context.  There are a number of rather volatile world leaders who like to play war games with each other.  We are depending on them to behave rationally, but I am not sure if we can put too much store in that happening.  Of course, the countries that hold nuclear weapons will not agree with the treaty because they want to retain these weapons.  In that context, a lot more work needs to be done.</p> <p>  I have a question about divestment in companies that produce nuclear weapons.  Three countries in Europe have divested from them completely.  Ireland has divested from three of the 26 companies in which it has investments.  As we did in the case of fossil fuels, we must work on this issue too.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, this country has a long and proud record in working towards the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.  Going back to 1958, led by the then Minister Frank Aiken, Ireland introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the United Nations which eventually led to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which has become the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament.  The treaty is the most widely recognised agreement on nuclear disarmament.  As has been said, with so much uncertainty throughout the world, this is an issue that must continually be addressed by the international community.  The Bill is an important measure and we are glad to be able to facilitate its passage.  I thank members for their co-operation.</p></speech>
