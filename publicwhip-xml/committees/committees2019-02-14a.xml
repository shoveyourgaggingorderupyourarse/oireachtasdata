There are three categories, the first of which is briefing notes and opening statements for today's meeting.  Before we get into the details of the correspondence received, what I have is quite a lot but not all of the documentation we have received in recent days on various meetings and reports in connection with the national children's hospital.  We will hold all of it together for a separate discussion and deal with the other correspondence received first, but I want to give members an indication of the volume of material that has been sent to the committee as a result of our questioning at a previous meeting.</p> <p>  Nos. 1943A and 1958 are items of correspondence received from Mr. Peter McCarthy, CEO of Enet, providing briefing material and an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1953A is correspondence received from the company Imagine, providing an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1959A is correspondence received from BT for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1962A is correspondence received from Eir for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 1963A and 1964A are items of correspondence received from the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, providing an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish them.  We will also note and publish the documentation received.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The second category is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers as a follow-up to requests made at Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  </p> <p>  No. 1932B is a letter received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the Government banking service contract in respect of the service being provided by Danske Bank.  Mr. Watt does not provide specific details, but he mentions the fact that there are up to 50 million transactions, mainly involving the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which accounts for some 43 million of them.  Mr. Watt says the service delivery and relationship management aspects of the contract are primarily managed by Danske Bank's Dublin based team supported by the head office in Copenhagen in Denmark.  It had a pre-existing arrangement with An Post for cash and cheque transactions, etc.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1937B is correspondence received from Dr. Des Fitzgerald in the University of Limerick, providing information requested by the committee.  We asked for the total number of subsidiary companies; a breakdown of the staff and the board membership, as well as the most recent financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre.  All of the information is provided, with a list of all the companies over which it has control and the financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre, a company limited by guarantee, formerly known as Plassey Campus Centre Limited.  I note that the company which is controlled by the University of Limerick has a turnover of &euro;37.168 million and revenue reserves of &euro;36.273 million.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm same.  Is the company consolidated in the accounts of the University of Limerick?</p></speech>

We want to make sure the figures are incorporated into the accounts of the University of Limerick.  If anyone wants to review the financial statements, he or she should, please, feel free to do so.</p><p> The next item is No. 1938B, correspondence received from Ms Julie Sinnamon of Enterprise Ireland, providing information requested by the committee, outlining Enterprise Ireland's full investment in FeedHenry, including its involvement in supporting and contributing to the commercialisation of the project.  Ms Sinnamon confirms that Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;1.59 million in the project and received &euro;4.5 million from the proceeds of the sale.  This was mentioned in passing the last day and we asked for a detailed letter on the matter.  Other than Waterford Institute of Technology and Enterprise, did any other State organisation receive some of the proceeds of the sale?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00200"><p>That is the full extent of the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00300"><p>We will note and publish the correspondence as we want to balance the discussion.  There has been much debate about returns to the State.  It is clear that on an investment of &euro;1.59 million by Enterprise Ireland, it received &euro;4.5 million in return.  That helps to complete the picture on the matter.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1939B, correspondence received in connection with the national children's hospital.  As we have a large volume of items in that regard, we will note and discuss the correspondence with all of the other correspondence received on the national children's hospital.  No. 1940B is also correspondence related to the national children's hospital.</p> <p>  No. 1942B is correspondence, dated 7 February 2019, received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing follow-up information requested by the committee at an earlier meeting.  What is provided includes information requested from the Irish Prison Service.  There are three items outstanding which the secretariat will be monitoring.  I will make a brief observation and know that other members wish to comment.  There has been much public criticism of us by another Oireachtas committee asking these questions, but I wish to put in context the reasons we are asking them.  There is a complication as the issues are within the remit of the justice committee, but equally they are within the remit of this committee.  Some committees of the Houses believe that if a matter is within their remit, it cannot come within ours, but there are matters that fall within the remit of more than one committee.  We must deal with that issue.  If a topic falls within the remit of a line committee, it should not necessarily be excluded from the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will not get into the detail as I know members wish to comment on the issue.</p> <p>  We followed up with the State Claims Agency on the matter of medical negligence and the cost of claims against the State.  There are approximately 1,685 such claims against the Irish Prison Service from current and former prisoners which may bring a serious cost to the State.  We were acting within our remit in inquiring about the background and matters such as how prisoners were dealt with while imprisoned.  There are also concerns about potential medical claims, which is why we asked about the medical service.  We asked about the level of prisoner injury and compensation claims.  The reply from the Department of Justice and Equality is that the information is awaited from the State Claims Agency.  The fact that the agency is dealing with the matter is proof that it is very much one within our remit.  We also asked about cases being taken against the State on the issue I mentioned.  That request is with the State Claims Agency.  We asked for details of compensation paid in cases where prisoners had harmed themselves.  Again, the Department is awaiting information from the agency.  We asked for information on compensation payments related to protected disclosures.  Again, information is awaited from the agency.</p> <p>  We were concerned about the health of prisoners as if the State was not providing adequate medical services, it might well lead to compensation claims against it.  We want such matters to be dealt with.  I was shocked by the response to one of the questions asked.  We asked about the number of prisoners with mental health or drug dependency issues, including the percentage of prisoners who passed through the system every year on medication or prescriptions.  The reply states: "Information on the level of mental health conditions in the prison population is derived from studies done in 2003 and 2005".  If information is based on 15 year old studies, it is utterly unacceptable and possibly on the negligent side of things.  That is if this is the most up-to-date information available.  The reply also states the rate of prescribing in the Irish Prison Service is "currently" - the letter dates from last week - 63% of the total number of prisoners in custody.  They have an active prescription which indicates that serious issues may arise at a later date.  The reply gives the cost of maintaining a prisoner in a high security prison, a medium security prison and an open prison.  The average cost was &euro;68,535 in 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00400"><p>There is much detail included in the correspondence.  As a committee, we requested a number of pieces of information.  The correspondence indicates that there are three elements that will be responded to at a later date, but as there may be more, we might liaise with the clerk on the outstanding requests.</p><p>The first point made in the reply is related to surveillance and is mind-boggling because of the way it is written.  One has to read it two or three times in order to understand it.  It states: &quot;In relation to the request by the committee for an information note on any costs for surveillance in any of the prisons or any prison offices over the past five years, the Irish Prison Service has no information to suggest that any authorised covert surveillance of a prison officer has been undertaken by the Irish Prison Service&quot;.  That relates to authorised, not unauthorised, activity.  The reply continues:</p><blockquote>Companies were engaged by the Irish Prison Service operational support group.  Records show that one company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;9,586.59 in 2011 and &euro;8,641.68 in 2012.  A second company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;10,774.12 in 2011.  It is not possible from the information available to determine if these payments relate to the surveillance of prison staff.</blockquote> <p>Effectively, the Irish Prison Service does not know why the money was paid.  The executive summary states money has been spent, but the service has no idea why it was spent.  It is mind-boggling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00500"><p>It is a comprehensive set of documentation, on which I agree with most of the Chairman's observations.  What are we doing with it?  We now have the response and witnesses were called before us.  If there are issues relevant to the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, we must isolate and deal with them.  It also strikes me that some of this relates to policy and that the documentation could be forwarded to the justice committee.  It could deal with the policy matters with which it must deal, while we can examine the cost or control matters relevant to our work.</p></speech>

We have received a lengthy and wordy reply, but, unfortunately, some of the stuff included in it just does not stand up and we will probably have to revisit it.  I have a concern that, with the best will in the world, the service administration in Longford does not really know what is going on in certain prisons or aspects of the work.</p><p>If we look at the mess committee stuff that came back here, it does not really add up.  There is other stuff as well.  We are not sure that money spent on surveillance was of staff.  It is just not credible.  Expenditure is supposed to be okayed by the director of operations of the Prison Service.  Why would he or she ever okay something without being told what it was for?  </p></speech>

While the biggest contingent liability is in the area of health, there are liabilities and risk assessments in other Departments and it is quite useful for us to be able to match one against the other.  We could see there was a drop in some claims by actions that were taken in respect of the risk assessments that were done in some of the prisons.  That was one of the things that came out.  If we are doing a piece of work on open disclosure, the HSE, the State and contingent liability, there are other liabilities under the State Claims Agency that could be part of that report.  What we are really trying to get at concerns the State Claims Agency, how we function, how litigious we are and how much is potentially being spent in the courts unnecessarily.  This will be useful in that context.</p></speech>

When we inquired into the issue, we got a note back with a little box ticked saying that they had gone through the procurement process.  We asked what the procurement process was, specifically around some of the contracts.  The largest one would have been for the fencing and security.  Essentially, what they are saying is that confirmation of the Papal visit of 28 August was only received in June.  That was the issue about the timeline to tender.  They used existing frameworks for some of the procurement.  My understanding is that they were on some preferred contractor list or something like that.  Someone might correct me if I am wrong on that.  That will happen.  There was not a specific tender for this.  However, going by the report that came back from the Department with the box ticked, one would have presumed there was a specific tender.  This letter is saying that there was not but that, after discussions with other parties, having considered the issue, and as there was insufficient time and resources to run multiple tender competitions, the OPW had no alternative but to use the existing frameworks.  Could we explain the existing frameworks?  Does anybody know what they are?</p></speech>

In general, if I may explain how a framework agreement works, the Office of Government Procurement or a large organisation puts a framework agreement in place.  They look for contractors who are capable of providing a class of service.  They pre-qualify them and put them on this framework arrangement.  Normally, when an organisation then wants to avail of the framework, it will go to a number of the contractors and run what is called a mini-competition.  It will state specifically what it needs and ask for prices, running a constrained competition.  Some people refer to a framework agreement when what they mean is a draw-down contract, whereby there is an arrangement for a certain amount of service to be provided but where more of the service can be drawn down.  The terms tend to be used interchangeably in some of the correspondence we have seen.  I do want to look at this procurement in the context of the appropriation account.  If there is something significant around procurement I may report on it.</p></speech>

Next is correspondence No. 1949B from Martin Whelan, head of public affairs at the National Treasury Management Agency, providing a note on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is part of the NTMA, and its investment in the Irish infrastructure fund, IIF, which, although it sounds similar, is a completely different organisation.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is part of the State under the NTMA.  The second last paragraph of the letter states that one of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's investments is in a privately managed Irish infrastructure fund.  While the abbreviations are similar, they are distinct and different entities.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is a State-owned fund and the IIF is a privately managed fund.  There is a bit of confusion about the names out there.  Investors in the privately managed IIF purchase their investment via unit holdings.  This is common practice in fund-based investments.  Consequently, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund does not own shares or have a shareholding in the privately managed IIF but does have a commercial interest via unit holdings.  The letter further states that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund holds 49.5% of the units in the privately managed IIF and has a commitment of &euro;250 million to the privately managed fund.  A chart is provided showing that there are 27 investors in the IIF who have control of 50.5%, while the State involvement is 49.5%.  Am I reading it correctly?</p></speech>

The Irish investors include university trusts, union pensions, religious orders, construction worker pensions, pension funds of a number of Irish companies, and Government bodies.  They have a lot of investment directly from the State and through major pension funds.</p></speech>

On top of that, it is a system set up to promote infrastructure.  The privately managed IIF holds investments in five Irish infrastructure companies in the energy, healthcare, telecoms and hospitality sectors.  There is a presumption that all of this is right.  Of course we need infrastructure.  I am not questioning that.  However, this is supposed to be good without any analysis of what is good.  The State holds 49%.  There is a push in a particular direction.  For example, I would immediately think of climate change.  Some infrastructure projects may make us more vulnerable to climate change.  The officials from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, were very good.  They put their hands up and said they had not considered climate change in making investments.  Fair play to Mr. O'Kelly.  Since then the NTMA has taken action.  We are seeing the same thing in this matter.  We are struggling.</p></speech>

The first is &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, where there is a clear audit opinion.  The next is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  It is a clear audit opinion but it raises the issue of the accrued pension liability, as happens in a lot of public organisations.  No. 4.3 is the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, where there is a clear audit opinion.  The next is the Commission for Railway Regulation, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The credit institutions eligible liabilities guarantee scheme account has a clear audit opinion.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has a clear audit opinion and the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, 2017 accounts have a clear audit opinion, though attention has been drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;2.7 million.  The board had no internal audit resource in 2017.  Why is that?  Is this coming to us late?</p></speech>

It also could not avail of the common arrangement for ETBs, which was put in place by the Department and operates out of Cavan.  There has been a problem in that function but the board has been gearing up.  Many ETBs have drawn attention to the fact that they did not have an internal audit resource in the period in question.</p></speech>

The board carried out a recruitment competition and on two occasions failed to fill the post.  As an interim measure, the internal audit unit for ETBs has appointed an external resource to undertake internal audits in the board.  Effectively, it has been outsourced.  The ETB internal audit unit was only in a position to carry out one internal audit in quarter 3 of 2017, in the area of specialist training providers with field work.  There was no report for the audit committee in the year and the report on the audit I mentioned was issued in December 2018.  The resource that is available to them in the period in question is very light.</p></speech>

Here we go again in matters relating to compliance in the area of procurement.  I do not know how many times we have raised this and we have received a number of reports from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General when it has been flagged in audit opinions.  Sometimes it has no implications for spending and sometimes it does.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's special report into the Kildare and Wicklow ETB showed that there had been incomplete documentation in relation to certain procurements.  There was a cost of &euro;483,000 to the State in additional expenditure because of change orders relating to the construction of a school.  We have to be more vigilant and start to go under the bonnet of some of this stuff.  As Teachta Connolly has said in several meetings, it is almost like a David and Goliath situation for us as we try to do our work in this area.</p> <p>  Procurement is at the heart of the big issue of the national children's hospital, with which we will be dealing in a few minutes.  Every time our attention is drawn to an issue with procurement we should follow up on it, rather than just note it.  What was the &euro;2.7 million for in this case?  What can we do to get more information on it?  Why was there non-compliance?</p></speech>

It was for the period up to October and it is currently being brought up to year end.  A very significant piece of work will be presented to us shortly on precisely what the Deputy is requesting.</p></speech>

There are a number of categories.  Purchases of goods and services were procured locally in 50 locations.  These were in line with CDETB procurement policy but due to the aggregation of spend across the organisation, they exceeded the national procurement threshold.  When a board spends more than &euro;25,000 it is supposed to put the contract on eTenders but because this organisation has devolved procurement to different areas, individual schools or training centres were making purchases from the same supplier.  These were in areas such as school books, arts and crafts material, coach hire, document storage, disability service providers, merchant banking services, school food provision and managed print services.  These contracts should be available to anybody who can supply them.</p> <p>  In another area, there were purchases of goods and services where the tender was extended beyond the specified contract period, for which the total cost incurred in 2017 was approximately &euro;1 million.  It included expenditure relating to mobile phones, wide area network, ICT network support, design and print services, ironmonger and hardware supplies, plumbing and electrical supplies.  These are also the types of activities that suppliers would be interested in competing for.</p></speech>

That figure rose to 78% for 2017, not only as a result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's insistence but also the committee's refusal to accept it.  One can clearly see that we will hold to account the boards of the education and training boards or whatever the organisations are.  As we did in the case of the non-provision of accounts in a timely manner, we might end up having to bring four or five organisations before the committee, which will send out a clear message.  I suspect that within 12 months most of them will address the matter.  It should be the boards' responsibility, not ours.  If they fail to do their job, however, we will ensure that they will do it, whether they like it or not.  We should not have to do it but nobody else will and we want it done.</p></speech>

We previously gave the matter some discussion and we were waiting on the report to see what we would do with it.  There were some major issues with justice and policing, for example, and there was one case where it was too late to make changes and, therefore, the contract was just rolled over.  That was fairly substantial.  There are a number of issues and, in some cases, it is a matter of small organisations not having the expertise or capacity.  Some of the explanations are benign while others are not, and some of the issues cost the State money while others do not.  The one constant is a note in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit opinion but, as far as I can see, there is no sanction for organisations that do not comply with the rules.  We need to consider compiling our own report if we do an examination of the issue, or perhaps it should be included in a periodic report.</p> <p>  If a Department commissions a body to carry out a report on weaknesses in procurement, similar to the Mazars report that was done on the national children's hospital, in which procurement failures and weakness were identified, should that body as a matter of course forward the report to the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Is that the practice?</p></speech>

As we have put a great deal of focus on the procurement of goods and services, many organisations are getting better at this.  They are getting better at understanding what they are buying, collating information for procurement and so on.  Progress is being made.  The one area where there is a systemic problem is the health sector.  Relative to the total spend in many of the organisations, the spend to which we are drawing attention is not so great.  Nevertheless, pressure needs to be maintained to avoid the problem becoming worse.</p></speech>

The key issue is that we know who is appearing before the committee later in the meeting.</p> <p>  Next week, we have arranged a session on the Kildare-Wicklow ETB financial statements 2015 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's supplementary report, which was published yesterday.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might make a brief observation because he seems quite critical of the board and its functions.  Perhaps his criticism applies to all ETBs.  There will be restrictions in respect of what the Department can answer on the day because a Garda investigation is ongoing.  In the afternoon, we will separately deal with housing as part of the housing meeting.  We have invited Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to appear before the committee and discuss the control of and procedure for capital projects.  We are aware that he was busy in recent days due to the nurses' dispute and we have not yet received an answer.  I am aware of invitations from approximately four Oireachtas committees to Mr. Watt to discuss the same issue.  He will not appear before all four, however, and I propose that if he agrees to appear before our committee next Thursday, as we have suggested, we postpone the discussion on the Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  Otherwise, we will proceed with that report.  We will receive confirmation tomorrow.</p></speech>

It is quite a damning report in highlighting mismanagement, conflicts of interest and poor governance with information not being brought to the attention of the board and just poor decision making.  It speaks for itself.  We just discussed the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, which has accepted its problems.  It is trying to put in place improvements and is flagging issues to us, which is good.  We should recognise and encourage that.</p> <p>  We obviously have to deal with the report which is before us, which speaks for itself.

There are questions that each ETB should be looking at for itself.  I think there is a willingness in the sector to do that and in Kildare-Wicklow ETB to address the thing.</p> <p>  There were very particular circumstances about this and the capacity of the ETB to deal with those issues when they came to light and whether it has the systems in place that allow, let us say, the board itself to take legal advice and take action.  The Department is seized of improvements that need to be made in the functioning of boards generally.</p></speech>

It looks particularly at the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and specifically the reporting obligations of directors of State bodies.  I draw attention to the legal basis of State bodies.  The point I made was that most of them were set up under statute - either specific Acts or statutory instruments.  However, in some cases State bodies are set up as companies under the provisions of the Companies Act.  If they are set up as companies, they must observe all the requirements of the Companies Act.  In addition, there may be requirements, in terms of reporting and so on, imposed by the line Minister or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  It is probably worth bearing in mind that the legal basis for a State body is not synonymous with the depiction or the designation of the body as commercial or non-commercial.  For example, Pobal is established as a company, but is classified as a non-commercial State body, while the ESB is established under an Act of 1927, but is classified as a commercial State body.  There is a bit of greyness around what applies in the code of practice because of those differences in designation.</p> <p>  The code of practice deals with fiduciary duty obligations on board members in general terms, but the terminology used relates to the interest of a company.  So there is a bit of ambiguity there as to whether the same principle should apply to any public body.  The specific bullet points that are included in the code are lifted more or less from the Companies Act.  It would seem to suggest that is specific to State companies as opposed to bodies.</p></speech>

There is also a section in the code dealing with the obligations on civil servants who are board members.  This refers back to a circular letter from the Department of Finance, as it was called then, circular 12/2010.  It deals with a protocol for civil servants nominated to the boards of non-commercial State bodies and outlines steps to be taken where a civil servant nominee to the board of a non-commercial State body has a concern that they have raised but that has not been answered to their satisfaction where a significant public policy issue is at stake.  This requires the Minister to be notified without delay where: there are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the board or the chairperson; there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed; or there are serious concerns about possible illegality or fraud occurring in a State body.  The note was just trying to give greater detail on the points I made at last week's meeting.</p></speech>

I have been raising this for weeks and what he has said is crystal clear; it reinforces the answers he gave me last week.  The way the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was constituted under the Health Acts means that circular 12/2010 and the code of conduct for State bodies which was brought up into line in August 2016 would apply to civil servants on that board.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is obviously not in the political sphere so we will not go anywhere near that with him.  Repeatedly, including again last night, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach have said that the representative, the civil servant - I have no opinion or issue with him personally - who sat on this board was acting in a personal capacity.  We now know that is wrong and completely and utterly inaccurate.  That individual had a responsibility as outlined in the circular to bring it to the attention of the Secretary General and then the Minister.</p><p>Very specifically, the Minister needs to be notified &quot;without delay&quot; where &quot;there are serious weaknesses in <font color="#2F2F2F">controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the Board or the Chairperson&quot; or &quot;there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed&quot;.  We have an overrun of at least &euro;450 million.  It started at more than  &euro;60 million, increased to &euro;200 million, increased again to &euro;391 million and then increased to &euro;450 million.  Given what we now know and given the responsibilities set out in the code of practice in Circular 12/2010, how could that representative on the board not have brought these issues to the attention of the Minister?  They certainly come within the meaning of &quot;</font>serious weaknesses in <font color="#2F2F2F">controls&quot; and &quot;significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body&quot;.  We need to bring this circular and the opinion given to us here today to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach and ask them to explain and answer how this is the case.</font></p></speech>

Where weaknesses in controls are identified, there is an obligation on an individual who is a senior civil servant to notify the Minister and that did not happen.  That is something that we need to probe.  We need to give this circular to the individual in advance of him appearing before the committee because a number of issues issue.  The steering committee, which is a steering committee of the board and the Department, was made aware of issues.  Those would have had to have been reported back to the board.  The individual in question sat on the board but I do not think he sat on the steering committee.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot comment on the matter.  We need to be clear as to what meetings he attended.  I assume they were the board meetings.  We also need to be clear about what information was presented to him, as a board member.  We have the minutes and we can go through them.  This information would enable us to put questions to him fairly and he will be able to respond to them fairly, if he appears before us.  We should give him this circular in advance of him doing so.  I am confused as I thought we had agreed at the previous meeting that he would appear.</p></speech>

At the previous meeting, I asked who was protecting the public purse and various colleagues, notably Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, took up the issue, which was very helpful.  The chairperson of the board did not seem to know who on the board was protecting the public purse or representing the ordinary person.  It subsequently emerged from, I think, the Department of Health that the gentleman who was named was the nominee on the board but that was not clear.  I cannot remember what answer was given about his reporting duties.  The circular has provided some clarification that has particular significance for this board.  It also has a wider significance in terms of appointments to various boards generally and who protecting the public purse and acts as the voice for the public.  There is the specific issue of the hospital board and then generally.  This is just the beginning in clarifying where accountability lies.  The 2010 circular, which was issued eight years ago, refers to contributing to greater accountability in non-commercial State bodies.  Everything set out in the circular was good but it did not happen.  That is my comment on the matter.  I welcome this as the first step. </p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform responded that the circular applies to its officials and, as Deputy Murphy just said, all other civil servants.  Based on the factual statements - not opinion - we have had this morning on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, and all of the issues and consequences that will arise from this and our requests for people to revert to us or appear before us, there is a broader issue here.  If we are meant to believe that the most senior procurement officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not interpret this circular in the way in which it is set out, what is going on across the whole Civil Service and the various institutions and boards and how they are made up?  What is going on, as Deputy Connolly said, as regards reporting lines and their role in protecting the public purse?  This whole topic seems to be all over the place.</p></speech>

I was a member of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  The Oireachtas has generally accepted until now that a public servant on the board of a company would be constrained by company law and the fiduciary duty on directors in terms of informing a Minister.  This circular does not tally with what I believe was the general presumption in the Oireachtas.  We will probably have to do a trawl of each Department and ask what issues have been highlighted to each Minister by civil servants in his or her Department in respect of the membership of civil servants on various boards.  We need to get that list or perhaps it does happen or is ignored.  That information might be useful.  We will not sign off on that today.  Deputy Kelly has highlighted the broad issue.  Now that it has been highlighted, I do not believe this committee can walk away from that without following through.  Maybe we will not do so today but we will certainly come back.</p> <p>  On correspondence, how do members want to proceed?  We are behind time and we want to catch up.  We have invited guests coming.  They are not normal witnesses who are required to be here.</p></speech>

We will ask the secretariats to work out what has been published already.  We will agree to ask the HSE, the Department of Health and the various boards to which these documents relate to immediately publish them.  Let them take the responsibility for publishing their minutes as it not our function to publish them.</p> <p>  We want to highlight two reports that are separate from the minutes.  One is a review of the new children's hospital project at the Mater Hospital.  It is the Mazars final report on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which issued on 17 December 2018.  I propose that we agree to publish this because it is the seminal document that everyone relied on last December.  It is a very hard hitting report.  Deputy Cullinane is about to comment.  We will probably have to get clearance or consent for it to be published because I am sure it was not part of the engagement that Mazars would agree to the document being published by the committee. </p></speech>

I propose that we write to the board saying we wish to publish it, get its consent and consent from Mazars.  If we get their consent we will publish.  We will indicate our intention to do so but we will not do it if they do not give their consent.  Is that a reasonable approach?  I know the Deputy wants to discuss it without publishing it, which is fine.  We can discuss it but we cannot publish it unilaterally if that is contained in the terms and conditions on which the report was published.  I know that people have circulated it.  It is in wider circulation at this stage.  That is only an observation.  I call Deputy Cullinane.  We will spend only a couple of minutes on this topic because we have to get into the broader work.</p></speech>

My issue is that we had the Secretary General of the Department before us on this issue.  We were dealing specifically with the processes and procedures around procurement and the spend of taxpayers' money in respect of the national children's hospital.  We had to drag information out of the Department in respect of the cost overruns.  From the &euro;983 million to the &euro;1.4 billion to the &euro;1.7 billion, we spent the entire morning getting that information.  We eventually got a breakdown, which we should have had before the meeting started.  How in God's name did the Department not give us the Mazars report in advance of those witnesses coming in?  To be fair to Mazars, its report nails many of the issues.  It is a very good report.  It outlines the 57% increase in costs as soon as the project started.  In my view it is a damning indictment of the work of the design team and the implementation board.  It is a damning indictment of the reporting relationship between the board and the Department.  There was very poor oversight.  We talk about reporting lines in respect of civil servants sitting on boards.  The reporting lines between the board and the Department were very weak.</p> <p>  What we have now established from our work in the Committee of Public Accounts is that in April of 2018 the steering committee became aware of very significant cost overruns.  The Department was not informed until August and the Cabinet and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was not informed until November.  That is where we ended up but my point is that the Mazars report highlighted all of these weaknesses yet we were not given that report before the witnesses came in.  We were given it afterwards.  I believe that was disingenuous of the Department not to do that.  We had to go looking for that and when we got it, we saw that it answers many of the questions we would have wanted to put to them.  In my opinion it is a way of avoiding accountability because a report such as this one is done for a reason.  It is to identify where weaknesses exist and our job is to probe those weaknesses to seek improvements.  We are not here to do anything other than protect the taxpayer, make sure that if there are weaknesses in the system we can identify and highlight them and recommend changes and improvements.  That is our purpose.  We cannot do that if valuable and important documentation is not provided.  I cannot understand why that report was not given to us.  We got it on Monday with a mountain of other documentation that it is not possible for any member of this committee to go through.  I made the David and Goliath comparison earlier.  We are not the Goliath, and some people have their views about the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are doing a very difficult job with the mountains of correspondence that we get, and we cannot keep up with all of it.  I believe in this case it was a deliberate tactic by the Department not to give us that report because I think it would have been a very different meeting.  That is my point.  Do we come back to it?</p></speech>

I would publish the report now but if there is a wisdom that we need to get permission to do it, it should be sought very quickly.  If we get it we should publish the report because, to be honest, it is out there.  Every media outlet has it.  We need to stop messing around with this type of stuff.  There is a damning report.  We are waiting for another report that will cost ten times more than this one cost.  This is a report that answers some of the questions.  In my view it should be published in the public interest.  Let us get that advice, if the Chairman believes we need it.</p> <p>  In all the minutes of the sub-committees, which we got also, reference was made to the joint finance and construction sub-committees and that cost overruns were identified in those sub-committees of sub-committees.  That is the world we are in.  Can we get the minutes of those meetings because we need to follow that through?  If we are to get the witnesses in again, we do not need to hear, "There is another set of minutes over here" in which there may be more information.</p></speech>

We want to seek clarification that Mazars has given its consent.  If it has given its consent, the secretariat can publish it today, tomorrow or as soon as it is confirmed.  If the consent is not available, we are requesting that consent and when we get it, it is our intention to publish that report.  I was cautious not just because of what is written in it.  We were here previously with the HSE regarding the reporting to the charity Console and its internal audit report.  The HSE was happy for us to publish it but would not publish it itself.  The HSE wanted to use the Committee of Public Accounts to get parliamentary privilege for its internal report, with which we chose not to oblige it.  I am cautious about people using the Committee of Public Accounts to get parliamentary privilege for some documents.</p><p>We have to be cautious from our perspective and that is why I am cautious here.  If there is agreement, we will publish it as quickly as possible once we have consent.  Second, we will ask each of the organisations that sent us the minutes to publish theirs straight away, and if not, to give consent for us to publish them.  Then we are to get any further minutes that have been referred to any organisation.</p></speech>

This is part of our consideration of the appropriation accounts for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will be engaging with a number of broadband providers in regard to our examination of the appropriation accounts for the Department.  The committee decided that in order to understand how value for money can be achieved in such a technical matter as broadband provision, it would be worthwhile hearing from those companies engaged in this market and have direct experience of it.</p><p>The companies and the representative body of smaller providers are here voluntarily.  They are not under examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  They are here to help us understand the Department&rsquo;s effectiveness in regard to the national broadband plan and broadband provision in general.</p><p>We have five groups here today, BT, Eir, the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, Imagine and Enet.  The engagements will be short and we have asked each of the companies to address a specific number of items as follows: outline the company&rsquo;s involvement with the national broadband plan, or its non-involvement, as the case may be, or its discontinuance of involvement if it had been involved and is no longer involved; describe briefly what it sees as the administrative and bureaucratic challenges and financial and operational challenges with the plan; comment on any communications with the Department in regard to the operation of metropolitan area networks, MANs; comment on facilitation of provision of broadband services throughout the country and new technologies, such as 5G; comment on the potential use of MANs for rollout of the national broadband plan, where appropriate; and comment on mapping of MANs, private fibre networks and mobile blackspots.</p><p>I emphasise that the companies are here voluntarily to assist us and we are very grateful they are here.  They are not here as witnesses from a Government Department or agency, who can be required to attend.  They are here to help us with our understanding.  As Oireachtas Members, we are lay people with no technical knowledge of this area.  We had a preliminary discussion with the Department on it and we felt we could do with a broader understanding of the broadband issue, if the witnesses will pardon the pun.  We have asked people involved in the industry to come in so that we can listen and learn.  That is why we are here today, not to examine them in regard to their particular company.</p><p>I welcome from BT, Mr. Peter Evans, director of wholesale, pre-sales and strategy.  He is accompanied by Mr. John O&rsquo;Dwyer, head of regulation.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off or switched to airplane mode.  Leaving them on silent mode is not enough as they may still interfere with the recording and broadcasting systems.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  If any member happens to ask what the witnesses think of the Department's view, they are not here to answer for the Department.  That is a matter we will address to the Department, and there is no problem in replying in that way if someone inadvertently puts such a question to them.</p><p>I invite Mr. Evans to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am director of wholesale for BT Ireland, and I am joined by my colleague, John O'Dwyer, head of regulation at BT Ireland.</p> <p>  BT is the main alternative provider of fixed line communications services in Ireland, employing more than 650 professionals throughout the country.  With a global network in 198 countries, our expertise lies in building and managing complex communications solutions for multinationals, public sector organisations and large domestic businesses.  We are Europe&rsquo;s largest telecoms services wholesaler by revenue and market share, serving more than 50 Irish communication providers, including Sky Ireland and Three.  We have invested heavily in building a high-capacity fibre network with nationwide reach, supported by sophisticated IT platforms and an expert in-house team.  We are in our 20th year of organising the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, Ireland&rsquo;s flagship science and technology platform for primary and secondary school students. </p> <p>  Our formal involvement to date with the national broadband plan, NBP, has been relatively limited so I will comment briefly on this before focusing primarily on our perspective on the opportunity presented by the metropolitan area networks, MANs, to improve broadband service provision throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  On the national broadband plan, as mentioned, BT Ireland provides national and international business, IT and communications services to corporate and public sector customers, alongside wholesale voice and broadband services to fixed and mobile telecommunications companies.  We considered entering the NBP bid process to roll out broadband access but we found that our business was better aligned with providing wholesale backhaul facilities and connectivity to service providers.  BT Ireland, therefore, offered to be a subcontractor to the Gigabit Fibre bid, which ultimately did not proceed past the pre-qualification questionnaire stage.  BT Ireland considers that high-speed connectivity to every home and business is an essential goal for Ireland, and one we actively support.</p> <p>  The metropolitan area networks were established using EU state aid to overcome limitations in the supply of fibre for entrant operators to invest into 94 provincial towns, such as Tralee, Wexford and Sligo.  The conditions of state aid approval sought to ensure that the MANs achieved the aim of stimulating investment and competition in regional areas on an open and transparent basis for all users of the MANs, for example, network operators such as ourselves which provide services directly or indirectly to homes and businesses.  We believe there is a considerable opportunity for some relatively straightforward enhancements to how the MANs are operated and monitored today.  Such enhancements could include the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment requesting the support of ComReg in the governance of the contractual obligations of the MANs managed services entity, MSE.  In doing so, we believe it is possible to ensure that its original purpose - equitable, open and transparent operation for all operators - is preserved, and will encourage further investment for more consumer-friendly solutions to homes and business throughout these provincial regions.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to speak to the committee.  My colleague and I would be happy to provide the committee with further information or to support it with any query members might have. </p></speech>

As time is short, we might go forward and backwards with the questions and answers, and I might get fairly snappy answers, if possible.</p> <p>  I picked up on the part of the opening statement that referred to ComReg.  I looked at the Analysys Mason report that was published yesterday, although it is unfortunate it was only published yesterday as it did not leave much time to study it.</p><p>The report says there were several complaints in respect of the activity of the metropolitan network area, MAN, contracts.  Was BT one of the entities that made a complaint?  If so, what were the concerns that prompted the complaint?</p></speech>

We have had a number of correspondences with the Department in respect of the operation and governance of the MANs.  We welcomed the Minister's announcement yesterday and the publication of the Analysys Mason report.  While it was only published yesterday, in the limited time we have had to study it, we have seen that it addresses some of the concerns we raised back in 2014 and which we have continued to raise since then.</p></speech>

They include things like the transparency of pricing for the MANs.  We are a customer of the MANs.  We spend quite a lot of money every year buying services from them.  We were concerned that the pricing, the levels of pricing and the discounting were not as transparent as we believed necessary in a public contract such as that for MANs.  We also believed that, in managing that contract, the Department would benefit from bringing in ComReg.  ComReg is the expert in telecommunications in Ireland and the expert regulator.  It understands cost models, pricing and competition.  We sought the bringing in of ComReg to provide a level of governance on that contract not only now, but on an ongoing basis.  We had a number of other concerns around the operation of the managed services entity.  Does the managed services entity own and run the MANs or is it a telecommunications operator itself?  The EU state aid rules make it very clear that it was not to be an operator, but it clearly is an operator today.  We believe that necessitated a level of separation between the company that manages the MANs and the company that runs the commercial organisation.  Some of that level of transparency between the two organisations is addressed in the Analysys Mason report.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that.</p></speech>

Not only would the wholesale and retail elements have to be separate but, within the wholesale area, the commercial and non-commercial parts of the organisation would be also.  The MANs are a public asset and need to be managed by a body with a transparent and distant relationship with the commercial organisation.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to see the gap between them.  There is the managed services entity, MSE, function which runs the MANs, but there is also a commercial entity which is a separate company.  That issue is brought up in the Analysys Mason report.  The gap between the two companies cannot be seen and that has worried us.</p></speech>

That is not me.  That does not reflect me at all.  I have trouble finding the right dial on the oven, but that is neither here nor there.  I happen to have the press statement from the Department.  I completely concur with what Deputy MacSharry has said.</p><p>It is really annoying when a report arrives the day before a meeting because one needs time to study it and it was appropriate for today.</p><p> There were approximately ten recommendations that the Department drew attention to in its opening statement.  Most of those were implemented and some remain in progress.  It looks like there has been great progress.  The only way we can test that is by asking the people who are the subject of this and it is helpful to us to have that kind of understanding so as we make sure we get the optimum regulation and a cost effective delivery of broadband, where it is in place and where it may, and should, be in place in the future.</p><p> It would be useful if Mr. Evans could give us a note, even after the meeting, in response to the kinds of things that are supposed to be implemented and if he believes they are not implemented.  That would be useful for us to hear.  We only got this report yesterday evening.</p><p> Moving to the national broadband plan, BT has considerable expertise in the area of broadband, as outlined by Mr. Evans in is opening statement, as do other providers.  BT considered making a bid and it probably would have been beneficial if there was a lot of bids and a large amount of competitive tension.  BT considered partnering with Gigabit.  What put BT off?  Did it not make the cut?  Were we comparing apples and oranges?  Why did BT not proceed to make a bid?</p></speech>

We are not an access provider.  We do not build local networks in Ireland, although we do in the UK and Northern Ireland.  It is our business in the UK and Northern Ireland to build local access networks, as well as the services above it, but in the Republic of Ireland, our business is multinationals, public sector and wholesale operators.  The network here was about building fibre access.  While we had the expertise to do it in the UK, it was not aligned to our business interests in Ireland.  We decided, at a very early stage, we were not going to participate in the tender process.</p></speech>

Going back to the early stages in 2004, we expressed an interest at that stage in becoming the managed services entity.  However, the EU state aid approval stipulated that an operator could not run the MANs.  They wanted that separation so we could not bid for it at that stage.</p> <p>  When it became clear, over the following years, that an operator actually was running the managed services entity, in 2017 we expressed an interest in participating in an upcoming tender for the management of the MANs.  We were told the decision had been made by the Minister to extend the contract for another ten years.</p></speech>

That report recommended the extension to that existing company.

The Department went out to tender, eight or nine years ago, for a company to run that service on behalf of the State.  We have been running that service for the past eight or nine years.  Our agents take the 999 calls.

When the Deputy says "taken out", what happens is that one can only give state aid where the commercial sector has not invested.  This is worth clarifying.  What happened here was Eir went to the Department and said that it had decided to commercially invest in that 300,000.  By saying it was going to do that - obviously it made a commitment because there was a commitment agreement given for that - it was saying to the State it was going to commercially do this and the State cannot provide state aid where it has commercially rolled out.  In this situation, Eir made that decision to make that roll-out and to be honest, I do not think-----</p></speech>

We have had this discussion with the Secretary General who conceded that that had a bearing on the overall contract.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of it - I hear what Mr. O'Dwyer is saying - if it started off as 840,000 and Eir made that proposition to commercially invest in those 300,000, and they were the most commercially viable, did that have a bearing on the commercial viability of what was left as the remainder of that contract?</p></speech>

That discussion in the UK is happening as we speak.  There is a debate.  The universal service is looking at 10 Gbps, which is lower than is being required here, although in practice a lot of the technologies would give one 30 Gbps or above anyway.  It is going down the road of this universal service approach to it.  One of the things which may be quite useful here is that BT has put forward a proposal in the UK to pragmatically look at the remainder.  One of the things that has happened is it has looked at introducing this from 2020.  It is saying that in 2020 it thinks it will be short of meeting the 100% coverage by approximately 600,000 premises - very similar to the numbers here, to be honest.  It thinks it will be short by that amount.</p> <p>  What BT, our parent company, has done is make a proposal.  It is in the public domain and is on the Ofcom website.  It has made a proposal, which is being discussed with the regulator as part of consultations, etc.  It has looked at it pragmatically.  It has said it is a lot of customers and has asked how it can do this quickly and pragmatically.  It said, "Well, let us look at radio.".  It has asked if 4G or 5G can help, because that can be rolled out very quickly and it has already got a lot of coverage, could work.   It reckons it could cover approximately 450,000 of that 600,000 with radio technology, like 4G and 5G.  EE, the company we also own, runs very good 4G.  It reckons it could get on average approximately 30 Mbps downstream, which, actually, is the specification for the NBP download speeds.</p> <p>  It said, "Well, okay, that is the first 450,000.  Let us look at the next piece of it.  We are 150,000 short."  It asked what it could do now and it set a threshold."  It is &pound;3,200, or something of that order.  It asked what it could do within that.  In terms of a price range of &pound;3,200, it could pay for itself.  It said that it could probably do 40,000 and pay that itself commercially without too much of a hit and that it would recover that eventually.  It would then be down to 110,000.  At the moment, there is a discussion - it may not be arguing but debating - how do one deals with the 110,000.  It has taken a very pragmatic approach of chunking it to see what it can do rather than saying that it is just a big number, it is a big problem, let us break the problem down and see how we can split it up.  That is roughly what is going on.</p></speech>

This is where I am coming from.</p></speech>

Up until yesterday, ComReg had no role to play at all.  The report recommends that ComReg come in and do an investigation into the compliance of the managed services entity with the contractual obligations.  We believe it should go further.  We think ComReg should be involved in the pricing and cost methodologies that are used by the managed services entity going forward on an annual basis.</p></speech>

I find it unusual that this report was commissioned by the Department.  I wondered why the Department was involved, as surely we have a regulator that deals with all this.  It should not still be in the hands of the Department.  There is no regulator, effectively, in respect of the MANs.  As we speak, there is a proposal that the regulator would examine aspects, which suggests there is not a regulator for the metropolitan area networks.</p></speech>

My colleague is completely correct that the Department issued the concession agreement and the contract to run it, and the company running the MANs has to comply with that contract.  However, there is an extra piece to this.  This is a state aid and, in 2005 or 2006, the European Commission issued a state aid approval for this project.  There was some debate at the time as to whether it was the correct sort of investment for state aid.  The European Commission issued a document, which is quite easy to obtain via Google, providing a set of conditions for that state aid.  In the concession agreement and the operation of the MANs, in my opinion, they have to comply with those conditions set as part of the state aid approval.  That is where the non-discrimination is coming through from.  It is the European Commission state aid approval that states that it must be open and transparent and that it must not be an operator.  All these conditions came from the European Commission.</p></speech>

At the time of that contract being given for a managed services entity with the Department and at the time that contract was signed, the organisation that got the contract would not have been involved in the retail trade.  Maybe on day one it was in compliance with the state aid rules.  However, Mr. O'Dwyer is saying that due to the passage of time and the change of business model being operated by the company that got the contract, it is a matter that needs to be looked at because it might not meet the state aid rules now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Evans" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#Q00700"><p>Yes.  In our view, the state aid rules were very clear, as Mr. O'Dwyer mentioned.  Over the years, our view is that the managed services entity has been allowed to diverge from those rules that were set back in 2006.  Yesterday's report was the first attempt to bring it back in line with those rules.  We welcome the fact that the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, has published that report, brought ComReg in and involved it in this process in an attempt to make sure the governance is right around that contract.  That is to the benefit of competition, as I said.  Bringing in more operators means better prices for consumers and more broadband.</p></speech>

BT's concern would be that at the point of extending the contract, which was quite recently, certainly it did not meet the state aid rules at that point because it was an operator of the service and was doing the managed services entity process at the same time.  Mr. Evans and Mr. O'Dwyer have a concern about that now.</p></speech>

We appreciate it.  It is great that they have come.  On a similar thread to do with the MANs, around the issue of the extension, it is still not clear to me why it was extended two years before it was going to expire and with no tender process.  We are all about proper procurement procedures in here.  Is there correspondence between BT and the Department that would be relevant to that?</p></speech>

I think it might have been in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment or else in the D&aacute;il.  There was a question asked around this and the reply was that the Minister was providing for an extension.  When we saw that, we knew something was happening and that it looked like consideration was being given to extending it early.  We wrote to the Department to say that we would like to participate in an upcoming tender process, which we understood from the question was happening.  We got a letter back saying it was too late and the Department had already made the decision.</p></speech>

Given that ETNL and its backhaul business is a related company of enet, enet may have an incentive and the ability to discriminate against customers who buy only MAN products in favour of customers who buy MAN-plus-backhaul products.</blockquote> <p>There is an incentive to discriminate in favour of their own customers.

The Department was given the completed review a year ago.  The committee scheduled a meeting with the providers at which, inevitably, such matters may be discussed.

Mr. Evans stated there has been a 50% reduction in the cost of new connections.  I ask him to explain that to us in layman's language.  A major reduction of approximately 50% in the price of the service provided through the metropolitan area network for a new connection was announced yesterday based on a report that has been sitting in the Department for the past 12 months.  Coincidentally, that was the day before the providers, including the operator providing that service on behalf of the Department, were due to appear before the committee.  Lo and behold, a 50% price reduction was announced yesterday.</p></speech>

The Commission was very clear and it said the MANs must not be run and operated by a telecoms operator because Europe saw that there would be a conflict of interest.  If one is a telecoms operator and one is managing the MANs, there was a perception of an incentive to distort competition in that way.  They wanted a company to come in and just run the MANs.  We were a telecoms operator at the time so we were excluded from that process.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get my head around this issue this morning.  I thank the witnesses for coming in to speak with us.  I refer to the Norcontel report.  Do the witnesses think it is right?  Would they argue that it is not correct?  My understanding from what has been said here this morning is that the Norcontel report basically said not to fragment the market and that it would be better to have consistency and continue with company A.  Do the witnesses agree with that as people who operate in the business?  Was the Norcontel report correct?</p></speech>

It could have still achieved that by doing a tender and having the company that is the incumbent bidding for the tender and winning it.  That would have still achieved the continuity that was needed but it would have been in the environment of a competitive process to keep it competitive in how it will run the contract.  We deal with multinationals and public sector organisations and it is very rare that contracts get rolled over for the long term.  In almost all cases, the company will look for a retendering process to get the best value and service out of the bidders.  Even if that same company retains the business it still goes through a process.</p></speech>

Can BT match that price or is that commercially sensitive?  Is that the price of it?  How much is it per metre and how does it compare?

ComReg has recently done an analysis of Eir's duct pricing and fibre pricing and the ComReg regulated price for Eir is even below &euro;2.60.  It is below the &euro;1 mark.  The Eir network is different, it is a bigger network and it is in more places but even at the new and reduced price there is still a gulf between that and the regulated price from ComReg.</p></speech>

There is a difference between passing the availability of a facility and the penetration of the facility.  It gives the impression that there is a large take up.  Cost and the 50% reduction is important from that point of view.  Cost will be a determining factor for some people in taking up the contract because of affordability and that.  It is true that the language is more or less about the coverage running past as opposed to the penetration.  Would it be more appropriate to match the level of penetration?  Is that possible?  Is it done?</p></speech>

It would be quite useful to have a full mapping service so we know what is available and also what the penetration is as opposed to what is there in theory, what is being taken up in practice and what the impediments to taking up broadband might be.  Some of that has been addressed yesterday to some degree by a reduction in the costs.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

The Deputy's question is around operators talking about coverage of 1.6 million homes or 500,000 homes but what is actually more important is how many people have taken up the service.</p></speech>

What really drives that is competition.  If there are multiple operators, retailers and wholesalers in an area at lower prices, consumers will buy the best service.  It drops prices down but it also increases service levels.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carolan Lennon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#T02200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  We are happy to be here and hope that we can help with the information on the telecommunications industry and market in Ireland.  I will begin by addressing Eir's current investment strategy, which is underpinned by strong support from our new shareholders, NJJ.  We are focused on further network expansion of both mobile and fixed services and plan to spend &euro;1 billion over the next five years.  That is on top of the &euro;1.5 billion that we have already spent, making Eir the largest investor in telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland in the last five years.  The European Commission states that Eir's &euro;1.5 billion investment moved Ireland from a position where 30% of the population had access to high-speed broadband to 90% today.  Earlier this week, we announced a &euro;500 million investment over five years to expand our fibre-to-the-home network, FTTH, beyond rural Ireland to a further 1.4 million premises.  That will cover 180 towns and cities.  When this project is complete, 75% of premises in Ireland will have access to fibre-to-the-home technology, which will move Ireland to third place in Europe for fibre to the home roll-out.  Every town in Ireland with 1,000 premises will be included in this roll-out.  Eir also contributes more than &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy annually.</p> <p>  In our material submitted to the committee and our discussions today, we are conscious of the ongoing national broadband plan process and our own engagement with the one remaining bidder, as a likely subcontractor to National Broadband Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to attend the committee and to be as helpful as possible.  However, there may be some specific questions about the process of the draft contract which we may not be able to discuss.</p> <p>  Eir's rural fibre investment, to pass over 300,000 premises, has attracted much public and political commentary and criticism.  When the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment approached all the network providers, we were asked to provide any future investment plans we had in the intervention area.  We faced a decision at Eir.  We were fast approaching the end of our fibre-to-the-cabinet investment programme, which brought high-speed broadband to 1.6 million homes and businesses in suburban and urban areas.  We put together a team of engineers, planners and contractors, to prove that we could roll out fibre quickly, efficiently and on budget.</p><p>We had to decide whether to dismantle that team and wait for the national broadband plan, NBP, process to conclude and possibly rebuild the team at that point or to keep that team moving forward and continue our fibre investment into the remaining commercially viable areas.  We knew we had a commercial business case for roll-out to another 300,000 homes in rural Ireland.  Eir decided to continue fibre investment into rural Ireland.  The specific 300,575 premises - identified by Eircode - were selected based on a number of criteria but essentially to provide the greatest number of premises which were commercially feasible that we could deliver within our &euro;250 million budget.  We needed to stay within that budget and we needed to see how many homes we could get passed for &euro;250 million.</p><p> In April 2017 we entered into a formal commitment agreement with the Department - at its request - and we shared with the Department an indicative deployment timeline.  I am pleased to say that as of last month, the programme is 76% complete and more than 228,000 of the specific 300,000 were passed.  We have also passed an additional 30,000 rural premises.  People refer to the 300,000 premises but these are not just statistics: 800 people have laid 22,000 km of fibre across the State from Drumcliff in Sligo to Rathmoylan in Waterford.  When we are completed in June this year, some 900,000 people in rural Ireland will have access to high-speed fibre broadband, as will 30,000 farms, more than 1,000 schools, 300 business parks and 50,000 small businesses.</p><p> Our rural fibre programme is an investment of &euro;250 million by Eir shareholders, connecting rural communities with high-speed future-proof technology.  We believe this is the single largest investment in fixed fibre technology in rural Ireland and is unmatched in scale and scope by any other operator.  I reiterate that our rural fibre to the home investment is Eir's own private capital.  It is not subsidised in any way by the Government.  Consequently, by June of this year more than 335,000 homes and businesses that originally required a subsidy under the national broadband plan will be able to avail of high-speed broadband without any contribution from the taxpayer.</p><p> As for the national broadband plan, as Eir began the rural 300,000 deployment we also remained a bidder in the national broadband plan and committed to securing the contract to deploy high-speed broadband to the remaining premises within the intervention areas.  We entered the national broadband plan process with only one goal, which was to win the NBP.  We invested more than &euro;7 million on our bid.  On 26 September 2017, we responded to the Department's invitation to submit a detailed submission, known as an invitation to submit detailed solutions, ISDS.  This included more than 3,000 pages of information, maps contained in 35 memory sticks and 52 lever arch files.  We actually had to make a wooden box to contain the submission.  The Department was aware that at that time, Eir had a range of commercial, regulatory and governance concerns about elements emerging in the procurement process.  We had raised these issues in August 2016 so the Department was well aware of our challenges.  We had decided, however, to remain in the process.  Even though there were three bidders remaining at that stage we were only one of two who submitted an ISDS.  It was a lot of work to put that ISDS together and submitting it.</p><p> In January 2018 my predecessor, Richard Moat, met the then Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten and the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Mark Griffin, to inform them of Eir&rsquo;s decision to regrettably withdraw from the bid process for the national broadband plan contract.  We confirmed this in writing on 30 January 2018.  Following protracted discussions we ultimately we came to the conclusion that the NBP framework would drive very substantial additional costs and delays to the roll-out of high-speed broadband to rural Ireland.  In our view the NBP framework resulted in duplication and inefficiency, adding to the ultimate cost to deliver high-speed broadband to non-commercial areas of rural Ireland.  We could not, therefore, accept it and we could not recommend it to our board.</p><p> There were specific requirements, such as ring fencing of funding, the creation of a wholly separate subsidiary company and the proposed restrictions on our existing wholesale division&rsquo;s ability to compete in the NBP areas.  These were all critical factors in our ultimate decision, as was the knock-on effect of NBP pricing and other decisions on our business outside of the intervention footprint.  This was a big consideration for Eir.</p><p> These challenges were unique to us because Eir is the only operator with an extensive wholesale division.  It was also looking as though Eir's infrastructure was the most likely to be built on.  There were processes and aspects that applied to Eir that did not apply to other bidders.</p><p> The committee has asked that we also refer to any other details we had on the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  The MANs did not form any part of our bid for NBP.  As we have a network everywhere there is a MAN, we do not use the MANs.  We did not have any communication with the Department on the MANs.  We had, however, been awaiting the launch of a re-tender of the MANs contracts and we expected to see it out in the summer of 2019.  We had planned to tender because, as I said, we have infrastructure everywhere there is a MAN and we thought there would be synergies there so we could probably put in a good bid that would save some taxpayer money.</p><p> The committee also asked for information on our mobile and 5G investments.  Recently we began a &euro;150 million mobile network upgrade and expansion.  This will grow our network by 25% with over 200 sites.  It will expand our 4G coverage to 99% population and geographical coverage.</p><p>It will also allow us to trial 5G later this year and to trial fixed wireless access as another potential mobile solution to rural broadband coverage.</p><p>  It remains a source of real regret for Eir, and for me personally because I was the managing director of Open Eir, which was heavily involved in putting together the NBP bid, that we ultimately found ourselves in a position where we could no longer remain in the NBP bid process.  I worked very closely on the process with a dedicated team of employees.  It was not a decision we took lightly.  We continue to engage extensively with the remaining bidder and we continue to support the Department in rolling out the NBP.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions that the members may have and will endeavour to be as helpful as possible, conscious of our obligations in respect of the communications protocol.</p></speech>

Ms Lennon said there were only two.  It can only be Eir and Enet who were still in it - if that is what the consortium is called now.  It would have been SIRO.  I understand it was in the process.

Right off the bat, the Department gave us the detailed communications protocol and we were very happy with that.  There was no issue there.  As part of that there were regular meetings with the Department's team for the NBP.  I was at many of those meetings in my previous role.  We were raising those issues for 18 months.  We started raising them in August 2016.  To be honest, those issues never changed and across that entire 18 months the issues remained the same.  As we worked through the process we knew the September date for the detailed submission was approaching.  Our chief executive officer got in touch in writing with the Minister in July and they met in August as part of an overall meeting on communications infrastructure and investment.  He raised those issues-----</p></speech>

We wanted to submit our submission and make sure he would raise these issues.  He raised them and we then went ahead and submitted our ISDS.  The next step was for the Department to issue the contract in the new year.  We were hopeful that between the submission of the ISDS in September and the contract in the new year a number of our issues would be addressed.  However, when we saw the contract in the new year, there were a few small changes, but none of the fundamental issues surrounding governance, cost and regulation had been addressed.  The next stage which was due to be in February was to sign off on the contract.  It was to commit to all of the commercial arrangements included in the contract, but we knew then that we would not be in a position to do that.  We had been raising issues for 18 months and the bid was due to be awarded in April.  We did not believe there was any opportunity between January and April for these things to be addressed because they had not been addressed in 18 months.  Therefore, we made the unfortunate and sad decision to pull out of the NBP.  That was the sequence of events.</p></speech>

The fact that there are state aid rules on top adds a level of complexity.  From where we were coming as a regulated ex-incumbent, Eir had a level of complexity.  However, we were of the view that if we had a commercial case to deliver the NBP - we do not, but if we did - we could have done it cheaper and faster than it could have been through that NBP process because of the complexity and cost that arose from it.</p></speech>

If the 300,000 for which we had a commercial case were still in the NBP, we believe, based on our analysis, that it would require a subsidy.  We had a case to make, that we could do it cheaper than if it was part of the NBP process.  Second, the subsidy required for the NBP is based on two things: how quickly one can do it and how many people are in it.  If other network developments happen at the same time and people avail of a fixed wireless solution, a satellite solution or whatever else, potentially, that will reduce the number of people who are in it.  However, building a fibre connection to the home network is a long-term investment.  As it is future proofed, we will not look at our business case in the next two years.  We expect the level of uptake to grow over time, but undoubtedly that will make an impact on the subsidy.</p></speech>

It is done on what is called a cost orientated basis.  The regulator looks as the cost of erecting and maintaining poles in rural Ireland and bases the regulated price on this.  We are bound by the regulated prices.  Again, we are concerned that in being asked to have a different regulated price in one part of the country we would then be required to have the same price in the rest of the country.  We are obliged to be equivalent to other operators all over the country.  We do not have varied prices across the country.</p></speech>

If one is in an area that can benefit from it and loads of people are not trying to benefit from it, one will have fibre-like speeds.  That is definitely the case.  The problem is that if there are 100 people on it, everybody is looking for the same footprint, whereas if one has a fibre to home connection, one does not have that contention issue.  The other issue is that the 5G network requires an awful lot of masts, which can be a challenge, particularly in rural areas.  I believe the 5G network can solve some of the problem, but it cannot solve all of it.</p></speech>

The challenge in dealing with mobile black spots comes back to commercial decisions.  As an operator, it is difficult to make a commercial case to gain access to a site.  They are black spots for a reason and perhaps one cannot get access to them.  However, all operators know where the black spots are.  From talking to other operators who are committed to trying to solve the problem, we would like the Department to state: "Here are the sites you can use because we own them.  Now, as mobile operators, you can tell us how this is going to work".</p></speech>

In our case, part of the tender and the requirement for the national broadband plan was that we would set up a completely new wholesale team.  We have a wholesale team today; we are the biggest wholesale operator in Ireland.  Part of the NBP was that we would set up a duplicate wholesale team to sell into the national broadband plan footprint and that our current wholesale team would not be able to sell into it.  If I had 80 people selling today, with all of the systems and costs involved in supporting them, I would have to have another 80, probably, selling into the national broadband plan footprint.  That did not make any sense for us and we could not stand over it.  Therefore, we could not recommend it to the board.</p></speech>

I will start with the existing infrastructure.  In the past couple of weeks there have been announcements by Eir, SIRO and Imagine Telecommunications Limited of increased investment in infrastructure.  I live in and represent part of a rural constituency.</p><p>In the past, issues were raised relating to old infrastructure, poles, and copper rather than fibre to the mast.  Are those the areas where investment will be directed?  I believe the sum was &euro;500 million.  </p></speech>

The investment announced on Monday relates to urban and semi-urban areas, that is, towns of over 1,000 premises.  The Deputy is correct.  We are over-building our copper network with fibre.  It is future-proofed technology, which will serve Ireland well into the future up to 10 GB.</p></speech>

They are often copper to mast.  Why is there no investment in those areas, particularly when they are the same areas?</p></speech>

We did those 300,000 rural build - and that is very rural - because there was a commercial business case but there is no business case for us to go beyond that.  That is the reason a national broadband plan exists in the first place, because it recognises that subsidy is required to bring fibre broadband to certain areas.</p></speech>

The lack of commercial business case is what I was getting at.  It goes back to the argument, which some might say is ideological, that the State has to intervene to ensure something is available when it is not commercially viable, but that it is necessary in the interests of the State that it be provided.</p> <p>  Ms Lennon referred to the NBP.  It has been problematic, to say the least.  Someone living in a rural area might hear a service provider say that it is not commercially viable for it to make the investments but that there is an NBP that will resolve their problem.  So far it has not resolved their problem and it has been dogged with difficulties.  I raised this with BT earlier.  Notwithstanding any changes in the structure of the company which have made it almost unrecognisable from when it first drew up its bid, one problem that has been raised is that the initial plan was for 840,000 customers.  Eir made a pitch for 300,000 of them.</p></speech>

The Department contacted all telecoms operators and asked what our plans were to build into that 840,00 or 850,000 intervention footprint.  We understand that several telecom operators, including ourselves, went back to the Department and told it our plans.  The only operator that went off and put its money where its mouth was, spent the &euro;250,000 and did the build, was Eir.  We signed a commitment contract at the request of the Department.  We would have done that build anyway.</p></speech>

As Ms Lennon has pointed out, the NBP deals with households and areas where it is not commercially viable.  That was to include the 840,000 customers.  When 300,000 of the most commercially viable of that figure are removed, it makes the remaining number more problematic in terms of their viability.  Is that part of the reason for the current difficulty and why there was not sufficient competitive tension in the process?</p></speech>

We know who we are in terms of our ex-incumbency.  Our regulation poses some challenges.  We raised all of the issues in the context of understanding that we would all love things to be simpler but sometimes that they cannot be.  We were disappointed that they were not addressed.  I can say this not as CEO.  I was the person who led the NBP bid from the start.  We wanted to win it and we thought we were best placed to win it because we know how to build networks and we know the infrastructure.  It was disappointing.  We kept thinking that the issues would be addressed but in the end, they were not.</p></speech>

Eir did that.  It asked the Department questions and told it about its concerns.  Did the Department say it would sort that out or that it would provide an answer?

For example, on the registration pricing and our worry that if we set a price over here, it would end up our <i>de facto</i>price over there.  That is a real issue for us with a business that is all over the country and an equivalence requirement.  The Department will state that this will be okay but we cannot take it that it will be okay because we are regulated, as are our prices.  There were some areas where the Department did not accept our issue and we believed it was an issue because we are regulated and know how the rules work while there were other areas where the Department engaged on them.  We went for it in terms of the ISDS submission.  We did an awful lot of work and produced a large submission.  We hoped that would show how serious we were about the bid in terms of the effort.  We hoped for changes after that.  That went in in September and the contract came out in January.  That was when we realised that nothing was going to change because there had only been very small marginal changes in the contract and none of the major issues had been addressed.  Up to then, we were probably hopeful that we might make some progress.  We kept making our arguments, kept pushing and put in a very good submission but it was obvious in January that we were not going to get traction on those issues.  At that time, the tender was meant to be awarded in April.  If we could not get traction in 18 months, we were not going to get in three months.  That was when we decided to-----</p></speech>

We need to get on with our own business."  I understand that.  When Eir indicated to the Department that it was pulling out of the process because it was not for it, did the Department say "Fair enough, good luck" or was there much of an effort to try to get Eir to stay in?</p></speech>

The feedback was that the Department asked us to reconsider and not to be hasty.  Richard Moat came back and we discussed it.  We also discussed it with our board.  At that stage, it was too late.  We were of the view by April that those major issues were not going to be fundamentally addressed.  They are major issues that require a lot of thought and many solutions.</p></speech>

My concern from the Department's point of view, not from Eir's point of view, is how the Department can run a competition on the basis of getting rural broadband to 540,000 houses without contravening state aid rules.  There is going to be a subsidy and then, lo and behold, someone says "sure I can do a third of them without any state aid".  Given where we are on this contract, I am sure Ms Lennon can understand my line of thought.</p></speech>

The complaint I am getting in rural areas is that people are willing to pay in and do not want to have to wait for the national broadband plan.  They want to get on with the job themselves but they are being held up by this process that has been going on for three and a half years with no sign of a contract.  Where we started out with the contract is worlds apart form where we are now.  I think the Minister is going through this matter with a fine tooth comb.  I would be appalled if he were to sign a contract for this now, given that a lot of it can be dealt with.</p></speech>

We can ask the other groups what they were bidding for.  I did not know the contract could be subdivided into two lots.  In terms of the 335,000 Eir has added on, were more of them in the northern or the southern end?</p></speech>

When it was originally part of the Department of Post and Telegraphs it had these cabinets all around.  In some villages they still have the old cabinet and Eir puts in a new fibre cabinet.  In respect of the old cabinets that are, say, three miles from the exchange, has Eir any plan to upgrade them?</p></speech>

At the moment in a lot of those places we have fibre going from the exchange to the cabinet and then a copper line into someone's house.  Our recent announcement was to bring fibre into 1.4 million premises.</p></speech>

We are regulated so we will have to engage with the regulator and the other operators who use our infrastructure.  Our plan will be not to have two networks but just to have a fibre network.</p></speech>

Some people have their own water supply.  Why run water to a house and then find the householders do not want it because they have their own supply?</p></speech>

Homes should be passed because that is efficient.  If the householders want to be connected, we connect them, but if not, we do not.  The business case is made on the number of people who are expected to want to be connected.</p></speech>

The pragmatic point that many householders in rural Ireland, rather than urban areas, would make is that they might have a pole at the edge of their house or garden, and they might have an underground connection to their house-----</p></speech>

In general, many people will have to replace the ducting.  Will Eir bring the cable to the house or the edge of the property?  What is provided for in the broadband plan?  We should ask those responsible for the plan.</p></speech>

Some people say they do not want that and that they want an underground duct.  In that case, generally, they install the duct and we meet them at the road.</p></speech>

The challenge to the plan is that the intervention footprint is based on uptake.  A lot of people will benefit from Imagine's roll-out and they will take its broadband on.  They will not then go on to the NBP, although they may in the future.  Future-proofing is the challenge.</p></speech>
