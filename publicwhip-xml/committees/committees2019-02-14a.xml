There are three categories, the first of which is briefing notes and opening statements for today's meeting.  Before we get into the details of the correspondence received, what I have is quite a lot but not all of the documentation we have received in recent days on various meetings and reports in connection with the national children's hospital.  We will hold all of it together for a separate discussion and deal with the other correspondence received first, but I want to give members an indication of the volume of material that has been sent to the committee as a result of our questioning at a previous meeting.</p> <p>  Nos. 1943A and 1958 are items of correspondence received from Mr. Peter McCarthy, CEO of Enet, providing briefing material and an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish them.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1953A is correspondence received from the company Imagine, providing an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1959A is correspondence received from BT for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1962A is correspondence received from Eir for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 1963A and 1964A are items of correspondence received from the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, providing an opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish them.  We will also note and publish the documentation received.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The second category is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers as a follow-up to requests made at Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  </p> <p>  No. 1932B is a letter received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the Government banking service contract in respect of the service being provided by Danske Bank.  Mr. Watt does not provide specific details, but he mentions the fact that there are up to 50 million transactions, mainly involving the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which accounts for some 43 million of them.  Mr. Watt says the service delivery and relationship management aspects of the contract are primarily managed by Danske Bank's Dublin based team supported by the head office in Copenhagen in Denmark.  It had a pre-existing arrangement with An Post for cash and cheque transactions, etc.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1937B is correspondence received from Dr. Des Fitzgerald in the University of Limerick, providing information requested by the committee.  We asked for the total number of subsidiary companies; a breakdown of the staff and the board membership, as well as the most recent financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre.  All of the information is provided, with a list of all the companies over which it has control and the financial statements for Plassey Campus Centre, a company limited by guarantee, formerly known as Plassey Campus Centre Limited.  I note that the company which is controlled by the University of Limerick has a turnover of &euro;37.168 million and revenue reserves of &euro;36.273 million.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to confirm same.  Is the company consolidated in the accounts of the University of Limerick?</p></speech>

We want to make sure the figures are incorporated into the accounts of the University of Limerick.  If anyone wants to review the financial statements, he or she should, please, feel free to do so.</p><p> The next item is No. 1938B, correspondence received from Ms Julie Sinnamon of Enterprise Ireland, providing information requested by the committee, outlining Enterprise Ireland's full investment in FeedHenry, including its involvement in supporting and contributing to the commercialisation of the project.  Ms Sinnamon confirms that Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;1.59 million in the project and received &euro;4.5 million from the proceeds of the sale.  This was mentioned in passing the last day and we asked for a detailed letter on the matter.  Other than Waterford Institute of Technology and Enterprise, did any other State organisation receive some of the proceeds of the sale?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00200"><p>That is the full extent of the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00300"><p>We will note and publish the correspondence as we want to balance the discussion.  There has been much debate about returns to the State.  It is clear that on an investment of &euro;1.59 million by Enterprise Ireland, it received &euro;4.5 million in return.  That helps to complete the picture on the matter.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1939B, correspondence received in connection with the national children's hospital.  As we have a large volume of items in that regard, we will note and discuss the correspondence with all of the other correspondence received on the national children's hospital.  No. 1940B is also correspondence related to the national children's hospital.</p> <p>  No. 1942B is correspondence, dated 7 February 2019, received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing follow-up information requested by the committee at an earlier meeting.  What is provided includes information requested from the Irish Prison Service.  There are three items outstanding which the secretariat will be monitoring.  I will make a brief observation and know that other members wish to comment.  There has been much public criticism of us by another Oireachtas committee asking these questions, but I wish to put in context the reasons we are asking them.  There is a complication as the issues are within the remit of the justice committee, but equally they are within the remit of this committee.  Some committees of the Houses believe that if a matter is within their remit, it cannot come within ours, but there are matters that fall within the remit of more than one committee.  We must deal with that issue.  If a topic falls within the remit of a line committee, it should not necessarily be excluded from the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will not get into the detail as I know members wish to comment on the issue.</p> <p>  We followed up with the State Claims Agency on the matter of medical negligence and the cost of claims against the State.  There are approximately 1,685 such claims against the Irish Prison Service from current and former prisoners which may bring a serious cost to the State.  We were acting within our remit in inquiring about the background and matters such as how prisoners were dealt with while imprisoned.  There are also concerns about potential medical claims, which is why we asked about the medical service.  We asked about the level of prisoner injury and compensation claims.  The reply from the Department of Justice and Equality is that the information is awaited from the State Claims Agency.  The fact that the agency is dealing with the matter is proof that it is very much one within our remit.  We also asked about cases being taken against the State on the issue I mentioned.  That request is with the State Claims Agency.  We asked for details of compensation paid in cases where prisoners had harmed themselves.  Again, the Department is awaiting information from the agency.  We asked for information on compensation payments related to protected disclosures.  Again, information is awaited from the agency.</p> <p>  We were concerned about the health of prisoners as if the State was not providing adequate medical services, it might well lead to compensation claims against it.  We want such matters to be dealt with.  I was shocked by the response to one of the questions asked.  We asked about the number of prisoners with mental health or drug dependency issues, including the percentage of prisoners who passed through the system every year on medication or prescriptions.  The reply states: "Information on the level of mental health conditions in the prison population is derived from studies done in 2003 and 2005".  If information is based on 15 year old studies, it is utterly unacceptable and possibly on the negligent side of things.  That is if this is the most up-to-date information available.  The reply also states the rate of prescribing in the Irish Prison Service is "currently" - the letter dates from last week - 63% of the total number of prisoners in custody.  They have an active prescription which indicates that serious issues may arise at a later date.  The reply gives the cost of maintaining a prisoner in a high security prison, a medium security prison and an open prison.  The average cost was &euro;68,535 in 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00400"><p>There is much detail included in the correspondence.  As a committee, we requested a number of pieces of information.  The correspondence indicates that there are three elements that will be responded to at a later date, but as there may be more, we might liaise with the clerk on the outstanding requests.</p><p>The first point made in the reply is related to surveillance and is mind-boggling because of the way it is written.  One has to read it two or three times in order to understand it.  It states: &quot;In relation to the request by the committee for an information note on any costs for surveillance in any of the prisons or any prison offices over the past five years, the Irish Prison Service has no information to suggest that any authorised covert surveillance of a prison officer has been undertaken by the Irish Prison Service&quot;.  That relates to authorised, not unauthorised, activity.  The reply continues:</p><blockquote>Companies were engaged by the Irish Prison Service operational support group.  Records show that one company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;9,586.59 in 2011 and &euro;8,641.68 in 2012.  A second company was paid a cumulative total of &euro;10,774.12 in 2011.  It is not possible from the information available to determine if these payments relate to the surveillance of prison staff.</blockquote> <p>Effectively, the Irish Prison Service does not know why the money was paid.  The executive summary states money has been spent, but the service has no idea why it was spent.  It is mind-boggling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#C00500"><p>It is a comprehensive set of documentation, on which I agree with most of the Chairman's observations.  What are we doing with it?  We now have the response and witnesses were called before us.  If there are issues relevant to the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, we must isolate and deal with them.  It also strikes me that some of this relates to policy and that the documentation could be forwarded to the justice committee.  It could deal with the policy matters with which it must deal, while we can examine the cost or control matters relevant to our work.</p></speech>

We have received a lengthy and wordy reply, but, unfortunately, some of the stuff included in it just does not stand up and we will probably have to revisit it.  I have a concern that, with the best will in the world, the service administration in Longford does not really know what is going on in certain prisons or aspects of the work.</p><p>If we look at the mess committee stuff that came back here, it does not really add up.  There is other stuff as well.  We are not sure that money spent on surveillance was of staff.  It is just not credible.  Expenditure is supposed to be okayed by the director of operations of the Prison Service.  Why would he or she ever okay something without being told what it was for?  </p></speech>

While the biggest contingent liability is in the area of health, there are liabilities and risk assessments in other Departments and it is quite useful for us to be able to match one against the other.  We could see there was a drop in some claims by actions that were taken in respect of the risk assessments that were done in some of the prisons.  That was one of the things that came out.  If we are doing a piece of work on open disclosure, the HSE, the State and contingent liability, there are other liabilities under the State Claims Agency that could be part of that report.  What we are really trying to get at concerns the State Claims Agency, how we function, how litigious we are and how much is potentially being spent in the courts unnecessarily.  This will be useful in that context.</p></speech>

When we inquired into the issue, we got a note back with a little box ticked saying that they had gone through the procurement process.  We asked what the procurement process was, specifically around some of the contracts.  The largest one would have been for the fencing and security.  Essentially, what they are saying is that confirmation of the Papal visit of 28 August was only received in June.  That was the issue about the timeline to tender.  They used existing frameworks for some of the procurement.  My understanding is that they were on some preferred contractor list or something like that.  Someone might correct me if I am wrong on that.  That will happen.  There was not a specific tender for this.  However, going by the report that came back from the Department with the box ticked, one would have presumed there was a specific tender.  This letter is saying that there was not but that, after discussions with other parties, having considered the issue, and as there was insufficient time and resources to run multiple tender competitions, the OPW had no alternative but to use the existing frameworks.  Could we explain the existing frameworks?  Does anybody know what they are?</p></speech>

In general, if I may explain how a framework agreement works, the Office of Government Procurement or a large organisation puts a framework agreement in place.  They look for contractors who are capable of providing a class of service.  They pre-qualify them and put them on this framework arrangement.  Normally, when an organisation then wants to avail of the framework, it will go to a number of the contractors and run what is called a mini-competition.  It will state specifically what it needs and ask for prices, running a constrained competition.  Some people refer to a framework agreement when what they mean is a draw-down contract, whereby there is an arrangement for a certain amount of service to be provided but where more of the service can be drawn down.  The terms tend to be used interchangeably in some of the correspondence we have seen.  I do want to look at this procurement in the context of the appropriation account.  If there is something significant around procurement I may report on it.</p></speech>

Next is correspondence No. 1949B from Martin Whelan, head of public affairs at the National Treasury Management Agency, providing a note on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is part of the NTMA, and its investment in the Irish infrastructure fund, IIF, which, although it sounds similar, is a completely different organisation.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is part of the State under the NTMA.  The second last paragraph of the letter states that one of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's investments is in a privately managed Irish infrastructure fund.  While the abbreviations are similar, they are distinct and different entities.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is a State-owned fund and the IIF is a privately managed fund.  There is a bit of confusion about the names out there.  Investors in the privately managed IIF purchase their investment via unit holdings.  This is common practice in fund-based investments.  Consequently, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund does not own shares or have a shareholding in the privately managed IIF but does have a commercial interest via unit holdings.  The letter further states that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund holds 49.5% of the units in the privately managed IIF and has a commitment of &euro;250 million to the privately managed fund.  A chart is provided showing that there are 27 investors in the IIF who have control of 50.5%, while the State involvement is 49.5%.  Am I reading it correctly?</p></speech>

The Irish investors include university trusts, union pensions, religious orders, construction worker pensions, pension funds of a number of Irish companies, and Government bodies.  They have a lot of investment directly from the State and through major pension funds.</p></speech>

On top of that, it is a system set up to promote infrastructure.  The privately managed IIF holds investments in five Irish infrastructure companies in the energy, healthcare, telecoms and hospitality sectors.  There is a presumption that all of this is right.  Of course we need infrastructure.  I am not questioning that.  However, this is supposed to be good without any analysis of what is good.  The State holds 49%.  There is a push in a particular direction.  For example, I would immediately think of climate change.  Some infrastructure projects may make us more vulnerable to climate change.  The officials from the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, were very good.  They put their hands up and said they had not considered climate change in making investments.  Fair play to Mr. O'Kelly.  Since then the NTMA has taken action.  We are seeing the same thing in this matter.  We are struggling.</p></speech>

The first is &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, where there is a clear audit opinion.  The next is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  It is a clear audit opinion but it raises the issue of the accrued pension liability, as happens in a lot of public organisations.  No. 4.3 is the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, where there is a clear audit opinion.  The next is the Commission for Railway Regulation, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The credit institutions eligible liabilities guarantee scheme account has a clear audit opinion.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has a clear audit opinion and the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, 2017 accounts have a clear audit opinion, though attention has been drawn to non-compliant procurement of &euro;2.7 million.  The board had no internal audit resource in 2017.  Why is that?  Is this coming to us late?</p></speech>

It also could not avail of the common arrangement for ETBs, which was put in place by the Department and operates out of Cavan.  There has been a problem in that function but the board has been gearing up.  Many ETBs have drawn attention to the fact that they did not have an internal audit resource in the period in question.</p></speech>

The board carried out a recruitment competition and on two occasions failed to fill the post.  As an interim measure, the internal audit unit for ETBs has appointed an external resource to undertake internal audits in the board.  Effectively, it has been outsourced.  The ETB internal audit unit was only in a position to carry out one internal audit in quarter 3 of 2017, in the area of specialist training providers with field work.  There was no report for the audit committee in the year and the report on the audit I mentioned was issued in December 2018.  The resource that is available to them in the period in question is very light.</p></speech>

Here we go again in matters relating to compliance in the area of procurement.  I do not know how many times we have raised this and we have received a number of reports from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General when it has been flagged in audit opinions.  Sometimes it has no implications for spending and sometimes it does.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's special report into the Kildare and Wicklow ETB showed that there had been incomplete documentation in relation to certain procurements.  There was a cost of &euro;483,000 to the State in additional expenditure because of change orders relating to the construction of a school.  We have to be more vigilant and start to go under the bonnet of some of this stuff.  As Teachta Connolly has said in several meetings, it is almost like a David and Goliath situation for us as we try to do our work in this area.</p> <p>  Procurement is at the heart of the big issue of the national children's hospital, with which we will be dealing in a few minutes.  Every time our attention is drawn to an issue with procurement we should follow up on it, rather than just note it.  What was the &euro;2.7 million for in this case?  What can we do to get more information on it?  Why was there non-compliance?</p></speech>

It was for the period up to October and it is currently being brought up to year end.  A very significant piece of work will be presented to us shortly on precisely what the Deputy is requesting.</p></speech>

There are a number of categories.  Purchases of goods and services were procured locally in 50 locations.  These were in line with CDETB procurement policy but due to the aggregation of spend across the organisation, they exceeded the national procurement threshold.  When a board spends more than &euro;25,000 it is supposed to put the contract on eTenders but because this organisation has devolved procurement to different areas, individual schools or training centres were making purchases from the same supplier.  These were in areas such as school books, arts and crafts material, coach hire, document storage, disability service providers, merchant banking services, school food provision and managed print services.  These contracts should be available to anybody who can supply them.</p> <p>  In another area, there were purchases of goods and services where the tender was extended beyond the specified contract period, for which the total cost incurred in 2017 was approximately &euro;1 million.  It included expenditure relating to mobile phones, wide area network, ICT network support, design and print services, ironmonger and hardware supplies, plumbing and electrical supplies.  These are also the types of activities that suppliers would be interested in competing for.</p></speech>

That figure rose to 78% for 2017, not only as a result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's insistence but also the committee's refusal to accept it.  One can clearly see that we will hold to account the boards of the education and training boards or whatever the organisations are.  As we did in the case of the non-provision of accounts in a timely manner, we might end up having to bring four or five organisations before the committee, which will send out a clear message.  I suspect that within 12 months most of them will address the matter.  It should be the boards' responsibility, not ours.  If they fail to do their job, however, we will ensure that they will do it, whether they like it or not.  We should not have to do it but nobody else will and we want it done.</p></speech>

We previously gave the matter some discussion and we were waiting on the report to see what we would do with it.  There were some major issues with justice and policing, for example, and there was one case where it was too late to make changes and, therefore, the contract was just rolled over.  That was fairly substantial.  There are a number of issues and, in some cases, it is a matter of small organisations not having the expertise or capacity.  Some of the explanations are benign while others are not, and some of the issues cost the State money while others do not.  The one constant is a note in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit opinion but, as far as I can see, there is no sanction for organisations that do not comply with the rules.  We need to consider compiling our own report if we do an examination of the issue, or perhaps it should be included in a periodic report.</p> <p>  If a Department commissions a body to carry out a report on weaknesses in procurement, similar to the Mazars report that was done on the national children's hospital, in which procurement failures and weakness were identified, should that body as a matter of course forward the report to the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Is that the practice?</p></speech>

As we have put a great deal of focus on the procurement of goods and services, many organisations are getting better at this.  They are getting better at understanding what they are buying, collating information for procurement and so on.  Progress is being made.  The one area where there is a systemic problem is the health sector.  Relative to the total spend in many of the organisations, the spend to which we are drawing attention is not so great.  Nevertheless, pressure needs to be maintained to avoid the problem becoming worse.</p></speech>

The key issue is that we know who is appearing before the committee later in the meeting.</p> <p>  Next week, we have arranged a session on the Kildare-Wicklow ETB financial statements 2015 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's supplementary report, which was published yesterday.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might make a brief observation because he seems quite critical of the board and its functions.  Perhaps his criticism applies to all ETBs.  There will be restrictions in respect of what the Department can answer on the day because a Garda investigation is ongoing.  In the afternoon, we will separately deal with housing as part of the housing meeting.  We have invited Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to appear before the committee and discuss the control of and procedure for capital projects.  We are aware that he was busy in recent days due to the nurses' dispute and we have not yet received an answer.  I am aware of invitations from approximately four Oireachtas committees to Mr. Watt to discuss the same issue.  He will not appear before all four, however, and I propose that if he agrees to appear before our committee next Thursday, as we have suggested, we postpone the discussion on the Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  Otherwise, we will proceed with that report.  We will receive confirmation tomorrow.</p></speech>

It is quite a damning report in highlighting mismanagement, conflicts of interest and poor governance with information not being brought to the attention of the board and just poor decision making.  It speaks for itself.  We just discussed the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, which has accepted its problems.  It is trying to put in place improvements and is flagging issues to us, which is good.  We should recognise and encourage that.</p> <p>  We obviously have to deal with the report which is before us, which speaks for itself.

There are questions that each ETB should be looking at for itself.  I think there is a willingness in the sector to do that and in Kildare-Wicklow ETB to address the thing.</p> <p>  There were very particular circumstances about this and the capacity of the ETB to deal with those issues when they came to light and whether it has the systems in place that allow, let us say, the board itself to take legal advice and take action.  The Department is seized of improvements that need to be made in the functioning of boards generally.</p></speech>

It looks particularly at the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and specifically the reporting obligations of directors of State bodies.  I draw attention to the legal basis of State bodies.  The point I made was that most of them were set up under statute - either specific Acts or statutory instruments.  However, in some cases State bodies are set up as companies under the provisions of the Companies Act.  If they are set up as companies, they must observe all the requirements of the Companies Act.  In addition, there may be requirements, in terms of reporting and so on, imposed by the line Minister or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  It is probably worth bearing in mind that the legal basis for a State body is not synonymous with the depiction or the designation of the body as commercial or non-commercial.  For example, Pobal is established as a company, but is classified as a non-commercial State body, while the ESB is established under an Act of 1927, but is classified as a commercial State body.  There is a bit of greyness around what applies in the code of practice because of those differences in designation.</p> <p>  The code of practice deals with fiduciary duty obligations on board members in general terms, but the terminology used relates to the interest of a company.  So there is a bit of ambiguity there as to whether the same principle should apply to any public body.  The specific bullet points that are included in the code are lifted more or less from the Companies Act.  It would seem to suggest that is specific to State companies as opposed to bodies.</p></speech>

There is also a section in the code dealing with the obligations on civil servants who are board members.  This refers back to a circular letter from the Department of Finance, as it was called then, circular 12/2010.  It deals with a protocol for civil servants nominated to the boards of non-commercial State bodies and outlines steps to be taken where a civil servant nominee to the board of a non-commercial State body has a concern that they have raised but that has not been answered to their satisfaction where a significant public policy issue is at stake.  This requires the Minister to be notified without delay where: there are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the board or the chairperson; there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed; or there are serious concerns about possible illegality or fraud occurring in a State body.  The note was just trying to give greater detail on the points I made at last week's meeting.</p></speech>

I have been raising this for weeks and what he has said is crystal clear; it reinforces the answers he gave me last week.  The way the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was constituted under the Health Acts means that circular 12/2010 and the code of conduct for State bodies which was brought up into line in August 2016 would apply to civil servants on that board.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General is obviously not in the political sphere so we will not go anywhere near that with him.  Repeatedly, including again last night, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach have said that the representative, the civil servant - I have no opinion or issue with him personally - who sat on this board was acting in a personal capacity.  We now know that is wrong and completely and utterly inaccurate.  That individual had a responsibility as outlined in the circular to bring it to the attention of the Secretary General and then the Minister.</p><p>Very specifically, the Minister needs to be notified &quot;without delay&quot; where &quot;there are serious weaknesses in <font color="#2F2F2F">controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the Board or the Chairperson&quot; or &quot;there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed&quot;.  We have an overrun of at least &euro;450 million.  It started at more than  &euro;60 million, increased to &euro;200 million, increased again to &euro;391 million and then increased to &euro;450 million.  Given what we now know and given the responsibilities set out in the code of practice in Circular 12/2010, how could that representative on the board not have brought these issues to the attention of the Minister?  They certainly come within the meaning of &quot;</font>serious weaknesses in <font color="#2F2F2F">controls&quot; and &quot;significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body&quot;.  We need to bring this circular and the opinion given to us here today to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach and ask them to explain and answer how this is the case.</font></p></speech>

Where weaknesses in controls are identified, there is an obligation on an individual who is a senior civil servant to notify the Minister and that did not happen.  That is something that we need to probe.  We need to give this circular to the individual in advance of him appearing before the committee because a number of issues issue.  The steering committee, which is a steering committee of the board and the Department, was made aware of issues.  Those would have had to have been reported back to the board.  The individual in question sat on the board but I do not think he sat on the steering committee.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot comment on the matter.  We need to be clear as to what meetings he attended.  I assume they were the board meetings.  We also need to be clear about what information was presented to him, as a board member.  We have the minutes and we can go through them.  This information would enable us to put questions to him fairly and he will be able to respond to them fairly, if he appears before us.  We should give him this circular in advance of him doing so.  I am confused as I thought we had agreed at the previous meeting that he would appear.</p></speech>

At the previous meeting, I asked who was protecting the public purse and various colleagues, notably Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, took up the issue, which was very helpful.  The chairperson of the board did not seem to know who on the board was protecting the public purse or representing the ordinary person.  It subsequently emerged from, I think, the Department of Health that the gentleman who was named was the nominee on the board but that was not clear.  I cannot remember what answer was given about his reporting duties.  The circular has provided some clarification that has particular significance for this board.  It also has a wider significance in terms of appointments to various boards generally and who protecting the public purse and acts as the voice for the public.  There is the specific issue of the hospital board and then generally.  This is just the beginning in clarifying where accountability lies.  The 2010 circular, which was issued eight years ago, refers to contributing to greater accountability in non-commercial State bodies.  Everything set out in the circular was good but it did not happen.  That is my comment on the matter.  I welcome this as the first step. </p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform responded that the circular applies to its officials and, as Deputy Murphy just said, all other civil servants.  Based on the factual statements - not opinion - we have had this morning on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, and all of the issues and consequences that will arise from this and our requests for people to revert to us or appear before us, there is a broader issue here.  If we are meant to believe that the most senior procurement officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not interpret this circular in the way in which it is set out, what is going on across the whole Civil Service and the various institutions and boards and how they are made up?  What is going on, as Deputy Connolly said, as regards reporting lines and their role in protecting the public purse?  This whole topic seems to be all over the place.</p></speech>

I was a member of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  The Oireachtas has generally accepted until now that a public servant on the board of a company would be constrained by company law and the fiduciary duty on directors in terms of informing a Minister.  This circular does not tally with what I believe was the general presumption in the Oireachtas.  We will probably have to do a trawl of each Department and ask what issues have been highlighted to each Minister by civil servants in his or her Department in respect of the membership of civil servants on various boards.  We need to get that list or perhaps it does happen or is ignored.  That information might be useful.  We will not sign off on that today.  Deputy Kelly has highlighted the broad issue.  Now that it has been highlighted, I do not believe this committee can walk away from that without following through.  Maybe we will not do so today but we will certainly come back.</p> <p>  On correspondence, how do members want to proceed?  We are behind time and we want to catch up.  We have invited guests coming.  They are not normal witnesses who are required to be here.</p></speech>

We will ask the secretariats to work out what has been published already.  We will agree to ask the HSE, the Department of Health and the various boards to which these documents relate to immediately publish them.  Let them take the responsibility for publishing their minutes as it not our function to publish them.</p> <p>  We want to highlight two reports that are separate from the minutes.  One is a review of the new children's hospital project at the Mater Hospital.  It is the Mazars final report on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which issued on 17 December 2018.  I propose that we agree to publish this because it is the seminal document that everyone relied on last December.  It is a very hard hitting report.  Deputy Cullinane is about to comment.  We will probably have to get clearance or consent for it to be published because I am sure it was not part of the engagement that Mazars would agree to the document being published by the committee. </p></speech>

I propose that we write to the board saying we wish to publish it, get its consent and consent from Mazars.  If we get their consent we will publish.  We will indicate our intention to do so but we will not do it if they do not give their consent.  Is that a reasonable approach?  I know the Deputy wants to discuss it without publishing it, which is fine.  We can discuss it but we cannot publish it unilaterally if that is contained in the terms and conditions on which the report was published.  I know that people have circulated it.  It is in wider circulation at this stage.  That is only an observation.  I call Deputy Cullinane.  We will spend only a couple of minutes on this topic because we have to get into the broader work.</p></speech>

My issue is that we had the Secretary General of the Department before us on this issue.  We were dealing specifically with the processes and procedures around procurement and the spend of taxpayers' money in respect of the national children's hospital.  We had to drag information out of the Department in respect of the cost overruns.  From the &euro;983 million to the &euro;1.4 billion to the &euro;1.7 billion, we spent the entire morning getting that information.  We eventually got a breakdown, which we should have had before the meeting started.  How in God's name did the Department not give us the Mazars report in advance of those witnesses coming in?  To be fair to Mazars, its report nails many of the issues.  It is a very good report.  It outlines the 57% increase in costs as soon as the project started.  In my view it is a damning indictment of the work of the design team and the implementation board.  It is a damning indictment of the reporting relationship between the board and the Department.  There was very poor oversight.  We talk about reporting lines in respect of civil servants sitting on boards.  The reporting lines between the board and the Department were very weak.</p> <p>  What we have now established from our work in the Committee of Public Accounts is that in April of 2018 the steering committee became aware of very significant cost overruns.  The Department was not informed until August and the Cabinet and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was not informed until November.  That is where we ended up but my point is that the Mazars report highlighted all of these weaknesses yet we were not given that report before the witnesses came in.  We were given it afterwards.  I believe that was disingenuous of the Department not to do that.  We had to go looking for that and when we got it, we saw that it answers many of the questions we would have wanted to put to them.  In my opinion it is a way of avoiding accountability because a report such as this one is done for a reason.  It is to identify where weaknesses exist and our job is to probe those weaknesses to seek improvements.  We are not here to do anything other than protect the taxpayer, make sure that if there are weaknesses in the system we can identify and highlight them and recommend changes and improvements.  That is our purpose.  We cannot do that if valuable and important documentation is not provided.  I cannot understand why that report was not given to us.  We got it on Monday with a mountain of other documentation that it is not possible for any member of this committee to go through.  I made the David and Goliath comparison earlier.  We are not the Goliath, and some people have their views about the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are doing a very difficult job with the mountains of correspondence that we get, and we cannot keep up with all of it.  I believe in this case it was a deliberate tactic by the Department not to give us that report because I think it would have been a very different meeting.  That is my point.  Do we come back to it?</p></speech>

I would publish the report now but if there is a wisdom that we need to get permission to do it, it should be sought very quickly.  If we get it we should publish the report because, to be honest, it is out there.  Every media outlet has it.  We need to stop messing around with this type of stuff.  There is a damning report.  We are waiting for another report that will cost ten times more than this one cost.  This is a report that answers some of the questions.  In my view it should be published in the public interest.  Let us get that advice, if the Chairman believes we need it.</p> <p>  In all the minutes of the sub-committees, which we got also, reference was made to the joint finance and construction sub-committees and that cost overruns were identified in those sub-committees of sub-committees.  That is the world we are in.  Can we get the minutes of those meetings because we need to follow that through?  If we are to get the witnesses in again, we do not need to hear, "There is another set of minutes over here" in which there may be more information.</p></speech>

We want to seek clarification that Mazars has given its consent.  If it has given its consent, the secretariat can publish it today, tomorrow or as soon as it is confirmed.  If the consent is not available, we are requesting that consent and when we get it, it is our intention to publish that report.  I was cautious not just because of what is written in it.  We were here previously with the HSE regarding the reporting to the charity Console and its internal audit report.  The HSE was happy for us to publish it but would not publish it itself.  The HSE wanted to use the Committee of Public Accounts to get parliamentary privilege for its internal report, with which we chose not to oblige it.  I am cautious about people using the Committee of Public Accounts to get parliamentary privilege for some documents.</p><p>We have to be cautious from our perspective and that is why I am cautious here.  If there is agreement, we will publish it as quickly as possible once we have consent.  Second, we will ask each of the organisations that sent us the minutes to publish theirs straight away, and if not, to give consent for us to publish them.  Then we are to get any further minutes that have been referred to any organisation.</p></speech>

This is part of our consideration of the appropriation accounts for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will be engaging with a number of broadband providers in regard to our examination of the appropriation accounts for the Department.  The committee decided that in order to understand how value for money can be achieved in such a technical matter as broadband provision, it would be worthwhile hearing from those companies engaged in this market and have direct experience of it.</p><p>The companies and the representative body of smaller providers are here voluntarily.  They are not under examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  They are here to help us understand the Department&rsquo;s effectiveness in regard to the national broadband plan and broadband provision in general.</p><p>We have five groups here today, BT, Eir, the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, Imagine and Enet.  The engagements will be short and we have asked each of the companies to address a specific number of items as follows: outline the company&rsquo;s involvement with the national broadband plan, or its non-involvement, as the case may be, or its discontinuance of involvement if it had been involved and is no longer involved; describe briefly what it sees as the administrative and bureaucratic challenges and financial and operational challenges with the plan; comment on any communications with the Department in regard to the operation of metropolitan area networks, MANs; comment on facilitation of provision of broadband services throughout the country and new technologies, such as 5G; comment on the potential use of MANs for rollout of the national broadband plan, where appropriate; and comment on mapping of MANs, private fibre networks and mobile blackspots.</p><p>I emphasise that the companies are here voluntarily to assist us and we are very grateful they are here.  They are not here as witnesses from a Government Department or agency, who can be required to attend.  They are here to help us with our understanding.  As Oireachtas Members, we are lay people with no technical knowledge of this area.  We had a preliminary discussion with the Department on it and we felt we could do with a broader understanding of the broadband issue, if the witnesses will pardon the pun.  We have asked people involved in the industry to come in so that we can listen and learn.  That is why we are here today, not to examine them in regard to their particular company.</p><p>I welcome from BT, Mr. Peter Evans, director of wholesale, pre-sales and strategy.  He is accompanied by Mr. John O&rsquo;Dwyer, head of regulation.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off or switched to airplane mode.  Leaving them on silent mode is not enough as they may still interfere with the recording and broadcasting systems.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  If any member happens to ask what the witnesses think of the Department's view, they are not here to answer for the Department.  That is a matter we will address to the Department, and there is no problem in replying in that way if someone inadvertently puts such a question to them.</p><p>I invite Mr. Evans to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am director of wholesale for BT Ireland, and I am joined by my colleague, John O'Dwyer, head of regulation at BT Ireland.</p> <p>  BT is the main alternative provider of fixed line communications services in Ireland, employing more than 650 professionals throughout the country.  With a global network in 198 countries, our expertise lies in building and managing complex communications solutions for multinationals, public sector organisations and large domestic businesses.  We are Europe&rsquo;s largest telecoms services wholesaler by revenue and market share, serving more than 50 Irish communication providers, including Sky Ireland and Three.  We have invested heavily in building a high-capacity fibre network with nationwide reach, supported by sophisticated IT platforms and an expert in-house team.  We are in our 20th year of organising the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, Ireland&rsquo;s flagship science and technology platform for primary and secondary school students. </p> <p>  Our formal involvement to date with the national broadband plan, NBP, has been relatively limited so I will comment briefly on this before focusing primarily on our perspective on the opportunity presented by the metropolitan area networks, MANs, to improve broadband service provision throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  On the national broadband plan, as mentioned, BT Ireland provides national and international business, IT and communications services to corporate and public sector customers, alongside wholesale voice and broadband services to fixed and mobile telecommunications companies.  We considered entering the NBP bid process to roll out broadband access but we found that our business was better aligned with providing wholesale backhaul facilities and connectivity to service providers.  BT Ireland, therefore, offered to be a subcontractor to the Gigabit Fibre bid, which ultimately did not proceed past the pre-qualification questionnaire stage.  BT Ireland considers that high-speed connectivity to every home and business is an essential goal for Ireland, and one we actively support.</p> <p>  The metropolitan area networks were established using EU state aid to overcome limitations in the supply of fibre for entrant operators to invest into 94 provincial towns, such as Tralee, Wexford and Sligo.  The conditions of state aid approval sought to ensure that the MANs achieved the aim of stimulating investment and competition in regional areas on an open and transparent basis for all users of the MANs, for example, network operators such as ourselves which provide services directly or indirectly to homes and businesses.  We believe there is a considerable opportunity for some relatively straightforward enhancements to how the MANs are operated and monitored today.  Such enhancements could include the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment requesting the support of ComReg in the governance of the contractual obligations of the MANs managed services entity, MSE.  In doing so, we believe it is possible to ensure that its original purpose - equitable, open and transparent operation for all operators - is preserved, and will encourage further investment for more consumer-friendly solutions to homes and business throughout these provincial regions.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to speak to the committee.  My colleague and I would be happy to provide the committee with further information or to support it with any query members might have. </p></speech>

As time is short, we might go forward and backwards with the questions and answers, and I might get fairly snappy answers, if possible.</p> <p>  I picked up on the part of the opening statement that referred to ComReg.  I looked at the Analysys Mason report that was published yesterday, although it is unfortunate it was only published yesterday as it did not leave much time to study it.</p><p>The report says there were several complaints in respect of the activity of the metropolitan network area, MAN, contracts.  Was BT one of the entities that made a complaint?  If so, what were the concerns that prompted the complaint?</p></speech>

We have had a number of correspondences with the Department in respect of the operation and governance of the MANs.  We welcomed the Minister's announcement yesterday and the publication of the Analysys Mason report.  While it was only published yesterday, in the limited time we have had to study it, we have seen that it addresses some of the concerns we raised back in 2014 and which we have continued to raise since then.</p></speech>

They include things like the transparency of pricing for the MANs.  We are a customer of the MANs.  We spend quite a lot of money every year buying services from them.  We were concerned that the pricing, the levels of pricing and the discounting were not as transparent as we believed necessary in a public contract such as that for MANs.  We also believed that, in managing that contract, the Department would benefit from bringing in ComReg.  ComReg is the expert in telecommunications in Ireland and the expert regulator.  It understands cost models, pricing and competition.  We sought the bringing in of ComReg to provide a level of governance on that contract not only now, but on an ongoing basis.  We had a number of other concerns around the operation of the managed services entity.  Does the managed services entity own and run the MANs or is it a telecommunications operator itself?  The EU state aid rules make it very clear that it was not to be an operator, but it clearly is an operator today.  We believe that necessitated a level of separation between the company that manages the MANs and the company that runs the commercial organisation.  Some of that level of transparency between the two organisations is addressed in the Analysys Mason report.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that.</p></speech>

Not only would the wholesale and retail elements have to be separate but, within the wholesale area, the commercial and non-commercial parts of the organisation would be also.  The MANs are a public asset and need to be managed by a body with a transparent and distant relationship with the commercial organisation.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to see the gap between them.  There is the managed services entity, MSE, function which runs the MANs, but there is also a commercial entity which is a separate company.  That issue is brought up in the Analysys Mason report.  The gap between the two companies cannot be seen and that has worried us.</p></speech>

That is not me.  That does not reflect me at all.  I have trouble finding the right dial on the oven, but that is neither here nor there.  I happen to have the press statement from the Department.  I completely concur with what Deputy MacSharry has said.</p><p>It is really annoying when a report arrives the day before a meeting because one needs time to study it and it was appropriate for today.</p><p> There were approximately ten recommendations that the Department drew attention to in its opening statement.  Most of those were implemented and some remain in progress.  It looks like there has been great progress.  The only way we can test that is by asking the people who are the subject of this and it is helpful to us to have that kind of understanding so as we make sure we get the optimum regulation and a cost effective delivery of broadband, where it is in place and where it may, and should, be in place in the future.</p><p> It would be useful if Mr. Evans could give us a note, even after the meeting, in response to the kinds of things that are supposed to be implemented and if he believes they are not implemented.  That would be useful for us to hear.  We only got this report yesterday evening.</p><p> Moving to the national broadband plan, BT has considerable expertise in the area of broadband, as outlined by Mr. Evans in is opening statement, as do other providers.  BT considered making a bid and it probably would have been beneficial if there was a lot of bids and a large amount of competitive tension.  BT considered partnering with Gigabit.  What put BT off?  Did it not make the cut?  Were we comparing apples and oranges?  Why did BT not proceed to make a bid?</p></speech>

We are not an access provider.  We do not build local networks in Ireland, although we do in the UK and Northern Ireland.  It is our business in the UK and Northern Ireland to build local access networks, as well as the services above it, but in the Republic of Ireland, our business is multinationals, public sector and wholesale operators.  The network here was about building fibre access.  While we had the expertise to do it in the UK, it was not aligned to our business interests in Ireland.  We decided, at a very early stage, we were not going to participate in the tender process.</p></speech>

Going back to the early stages in 2004, we expressed an interest at that stage in becoming the managed services entity.  However, the EU state aid approval stipulated that an operator could not run the MANs.  They wanted that separation so we could not bid for it at that stage.</p> <p>  When it became clear, over the following years, that an operator actually was running the managed services entity, in 2017 we expressed an interest in participating in an upcoming tender for the management of the MANs.  We were told the decision had been made by the Minister to extend the contract for another ten years.</p></speech>

That report recommended the extension to that existing company.

The Department went out to tender, eight or nine years ago, for a company to run that service on behalf of the State.  We have been running that service for the past eight or nine years.  Our agents take the 999 calls.

When the Deputy says "taken out", what happens is that one can only give state aid where the commercial sector has not invested.  This is worth clarifying.  What happened here was Eir went to the Department and said that it had decided to commercially invest in that 300,000.  By saying it was going to do that - obviously it made a commitment because there was a commitment agreement given for that - it was saying to the State it was going to commercially do this and the State cannot provide state aid where it has commercially rolled out.  In this situation, Eir made that decision to make that roll-out and to be honest, I do not think-----</p></speech>

We have had this discussion with the Secretary General who conceded that that had a bearing on the overall contract.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of it - I hear what Mr. O'Dwyer is saying - if it started off as 840,000 and Eir made that proposition to commercially invest in those 300,000, and they were the most commercially viable, did that have a bearing on the commercial viability of what was left as the remainder of that contract?</p></speech>

That discussion in the UK is happening as we speak.  There is a debate.  The universal service is looking at 10 Gbps, which is lower than is being required here, although in practice a lot of the technologies would give one 30 Gbps or above anyway.  It is going down the road of this universal service approach to it.  One of the things which may be quite useful here is that BT has put forward a proposal in the UK to pragmatically look at the remainder.  One of the things that has happened is it has looked at introducing this from 2020.  It is saying that in 2020 it thinks it will be short of meeting the 100% coverage by approximately 600,000 premises - very similar to the numbers here, to be honest.  It thinks it will be short by that amount.</p> <p>  What BT, our parent company, has done is make a proposal.  It is in the public domain and is on the Ofcom website.  It has made a proposal, which is being discussed with the regulator as part of consultations, etc.  It has looked at it pragmatically.  It has said it is a lot of customers and has asked how it can do this quickly and pragmatically.  It said, "Well, let us look at radio.".  It has asked if 4G or 5G can help, because that can be rolled out very quickly and it has already got a lot of coverage, could work.   It reckons it could cover approximately 450,000 of that 600,000 with radio technology, like 4G and 5G.  EE, the company we also own, runs very good 4G.  It reckons it could get on average approximately 30 Mbps downstream, which, actually, is the specification for the NBP download speeds.</p> <p>  It said, "Well, okay, that is the first 450,000.  Let us look at the next piece of it.  We are 150,000 short."  It asked what it could do now and it set a threshold."  It is &pound;3,200, or something of that order.  It asked what it could do within that.  In terms of a price range of &pound;3,200, it could pay for itself.  It said that it could probably do 40,000 and pay that itself commercially without too much of a hit and that it would recover that eventually.  It would then be down to 110,000.  At the moment, there is a discussion - it may not be arguing but debating - how do one deals with the 110,000.  It has taken a very pragmatic approach of chunking it to see what it can do rather than saying that it is just a big number, it is a big problem, let us break the problem down and see how we can split it up.  That is roughly what is going on.</p></speech>

This is where I am coming from.</p></speech>

Up until yesterday, ComReg had no role to play at all.  The report recommends that ComReg come in and do an investigation into the compliance of the managed services entity with the contractual obligations.  We believe it should go further.  We think ComReg should be involved in the pricing and cost methodologies that are used by the managed services entity going forward on an annual basis.</p></speech>

I find it unusual that this report was commissioned by the Department.  I wondered why the Department was involved, as surely we have a regulator that deals with all this.  It should not still be in the hands of the Department.  There is no regulator, effectively, in respect of the MANs.  As we speak, there is a proposal that the regulator would examine aspects, which suggests there is not a regulator for the metropolitan area networks.</p></speech>

My colleague is completely correct that the Department issued the concession agreement and the contract to run it, and the company running the MANs has to comply with that contract.  However, there is an extra piece to this.  This is a state aid and, in 2005 or 2006, the European Commission issued a state aid approval for this project.  There was some debate at the time as to whether it was the correct sort of investment for state aid.  The European Commission issued a document, which is quite easy to obtain via Google, providing a set of conditions for that state aid.  In the concession agreement and the operation of the MANs, in my opinion, they have to comply with those conditions set as part of the state aid approval.  That is where the non-discrimination is coming through from.  It is the European Commission state aid approval that states that it must be open and transparent and that it must not be an operator.  All these conditions came from the European Commission.</p></speech>

At the time of that contract being given for a managed services entity with the Department and at the time that contract was signed, the organisation that got the contract would not have been involved in the retail trade.  Maybe on day one it was in compliance with the state aid rules.  However, Mr. O'Dwyer is saying that due to the passage of time and the change of business model being operated by the company that got the contract, it is a matter that needs to be looked at because it might not meet the state aid rules now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Evans" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#Q00700"><p>Yes.  In our view, the state aid rules were very clear, as Mr. O'Dwyer mentioned.  Over the years, our view is that the managed services entity has been allowed to diverge from those rules that were set back in 2006.  Yesterday's report was the first attempt to bring it back in line with those rules.  We welcome the fact that the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, has published that report, brought ComReg in and involved it in this process in an attempt to make sure the governance is right around that contract.  That is to the benefit of competition, as I said.  Bringing in more operators means better prices for consumers and more broadband.</p></speech>

BT's concern would be that at the point of extending the contract, which was quite recently, certainly it did not meet the state aid rules at that point because it was an operator of the service and was doing the managed services entity process at the same time.  Mr. Evans and Mr. O'Dwyer have a concern about that now.</p></speech>

We appreciate it.  It is great that they have come.  On a similar thread to do with the MANs, around the issue of the extension, it is still not clear to me why it was extended two years before it was going to expire and with no tender process.  We are all about proper procurement procedures in here.  Is there correspondence between BT and the Department that would be relevant to that?</p></speech>

I think it might have been in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment or else in the D&aacute;il.  There was a question asked around this and the reply was that the Minister was providing for an extension.  When we saw that, we knew something was happening and that it looked like consideration was being given to extending it early.  We wrote to the Department to say that we would like to participate in an upcoming tender process, which we understood from the question was happening.  We got a letter back saying it was too late and the Department had already made the decision.</p></speech>

Given that ETNL and its backhaul business is a related company of enet, enet may have an incentive and the ability to discriminate against customers who buy only MAN products in favour of customers who buy MAN-plus-backhaul products.</blockquote> <p>There is an incentive to discriminate in favour of their own customers.

The Department was given the completed review a year ago.  The committee scheduled a meeting with the providers at which, inevitably, such matters may be discussed.

Mr. Evans stated there has been a 50% reduction in the cost of new connections.  I ask him to explain that to us in layman's language.  A major reduction of approximately 50% in the price of the service provided through the metropolitan area network for a new connection was announced yesterday based on a report that has been sitting in the Department for the past 12 months.  Coincidentally, that was the day before the providers, including the operator providing that service on behalf of the Department, were due to appear before the committee.  Lo and behold, a 50% price reduction was announced yesterday.</p></speech>

The Commission was very clear and it said the MANs must not be run and operated by a telecoms operator because Europe saw that there would be a conflict of interest.  If one is a telecoms operator and one is managing the MANs, there was a perception of an incentive to distort competition in that way.  They wanted a company to come in and just run the MANs.  We were a telecoms operator at the time so we were excluded from that process.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get my head around this issue this morning.  I thank the witnesses for coming in to speak with us.  I refer to the Norcontel report.  Do the witnesses think it is right?  Would they argue that it is not correct?  My understanding from what has been said here this morning is that the Norcontel report basically said not to fragment the market and that it would be better to have consistency and continue with company A.  Do the witnesses agree with that as people who operate in the business?  Was the Norcontel report correct?</p></speech>

It could have still achieved that by doing a tender and having the company that is the incumbent bidding for the tender and winning it.  That would have still achieved the continuity that was needed but it would have been in the environment of a competitive process to keep it competitive in how it will run the contract.  We deal with multinationals and public sector organisations and it is very rare that contracts get rolled over for the long term.  In almost all cases, the company will look for a retendering process to get the best value and service out of the bidders.  Even if that same company retains the business it still goes through a process.</p></speech>

Can BT match that price or is that commercially sensitive?  Is that the price of it?  How much is it per metre and how does it compare?

ComReg has recently done an analysis of Eir's duct pricing and fibre pricing and the ComReg regulated price for Eir is even below &euro;2.60.  It is below the &euro;1 mark.  The Eir network is different, it is a bigger network and it is in more places but even at the new and reduced price there is still a gulf between that and the regulated price from ComReg.</p></speech>

There is a difference between passing the availability of a facility and the penetration of the facility.  It gives the impression that there is a large take up.  Cost and the 50% reduction is important from that point of view.  Cost will be a determining factor for some people in taking up the contract because of affordability and that.  It is true that the language is more or less about the coverage running past as opposed to the penetration.  Would it be more appropriate to match the level of penetration?  Is that possible?  Is it done?</p></speech>

It would be quite useful to have a full mapping service so we know what is available and also what the penetration is as opposed to what is there in theory, what is being taken up in practice and what the impediments to taking up broadband might be.  Some of that has been addressed yesterday to some degree by a reduction in the costs.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

The Deputy's question is around operators talking about coverage of 1.6 million homes or 500,000 homes but what is actually more important is how many people have taken up the service.</p></speech>

What really drives that is competition.  If there are multiple operators, retailers and wholesalers in an area at lower prices, consumers will buy the best service.  It drops prices down but it also increases service levels.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carolan Lennon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#T02200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  We are happy to be here and hope that we can help with the information on the telecommunications industry and market in Ireland.  I will begin by addressing Eir's current investment strategy, which is underpinned by strong support from our new shareholders, NJJ.  We are focused on further network expansion of both mobile and fixed services and plan to spend &euro;1 billion over the next five years.  That is on top of the &euro;1.5 billion that we have already spent, making Eir the largest investor in telecommunications infrastructure in Ireland in the last five years.  The European Commission states that Eir's &euro;1.5 billion investment moved Ireland from a position where 30% of the population had access to high-speed broadband to 90% today.  Earlier this week, we announced a &euro;500 million investment over five years to expand our fibre-to-the-home network, FTTH, beyond rural Ireland to a further 1.4 million premises.  That will cover 180 towns and cities.  When this project is complete, 75% of premises in Ireland will have access to fibre-to-the-home technology, which will move Ireland to third place in Europe for fibre to the home roll-out.  Every town in Ireland with 1,000 premises will be included in this roll-out.  Eir also contributes more than &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy annually.</p> <p>  In our material submitted to the committee and our discussions today, we are conscious of the ongoing national broadband plan process and our own engagement with the one remaining bidder, as a likely subcontractor to National Broadband Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity to attend the committee and to be as helpful as possible.  However, there may be some specific questions about the process of the draft contract which we may not be able to discuss.</p> <p>  Eir's rural fibre investment, to pass over 300,000 premises, has attracted much public and political commentary and criticism.  When the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment approached all the network providers, we were asked to provide any future investment plans we had in the intervention area.  We faced a decision at Eir.  We were fast approaching the end of our fibre-to-the-cabinet investment programme, which brought high-speed broadband to 1.6 million homes and businesses in suburban and urban areas.  We put together a team of engineers, planners and contractors, to prove that we could roll out fibre quickly, efficiently and on budget.</p><p>We had to decide whether to dismantle that team and wait for the national broadband plan, NBP, process to conclude and possibly rebuild the team at that point or to keep that team moving forward and continue our fibre investment into the remaining commercially viable areas.  We knew we had a commercial business case for roll-out to another 300,000 homes in rural Ireland.  Eir decided to continue fibre investment into rural Ireland.  The specific 300,575 premises - identified by Eircode - were selected based on a number of criteria but essentially to provide the greatest number of premises which were commercially feasible that we could deliver within our &euro;250 million budget.  We needed to stay within that budget and we needed to see how many homes we could get passed for &euro;250 million.</p><p> In April 2017 we entered into a formal commitment agreement with the Department - at its request - and we shared with the Department an indicative deployment timeline.  I am pleased to say that as of last month, the programme is 76% complete and more than 228,000 of the specific 300,000 were passed.  We have also passed an additional 30,000 rural premises.  People refer to the 300,000 premises but these are not just statistics: 800 people have laid 22,000 km of fibre across the State from Drumcliff in Sligo to Rathmoylan in Waterford.  When we are completed in June this year, some 900,000 people in rural Ireland will have access to high-speed fibre broadband, as will 30,000 farms, more than 1,000 schools, 300 business parks and 50,000 small businesses.</p><p> Our rural fibre programme is an investment of &euro;250 million by Eir shareholders, connecting rural communities with high-speed future-proof technology.  We believe this is the single largest investment in fixed fibre technology in rural Ireland and is unmatched in scale and scope by any other operator.  I reiterate that our rural fibre to the home investment is Eir's own private capital.  It is not subsidised in any way by the Government.  Consequently, by June of this year more than 335,000 homes and businesses that originally required a subsidy under the national broadband plan will be able to avail of high-speed broadband without any contribution from the taxpayer.</p><p> As for the national broadband plan, as Eir began the rural 300,000 deployment we also remained a bidder in the national broadband plan and committed to securing the contract to deploy high-speed broadband to the remaining premises within the intervention areas.  We entered the national broadband plan process with only one goal, which was to win the NBP.  We invested more than &euro;7 million on our bid.  On 26 September 2017, we responded to the Department's invitation to submit a detailed submission, known as an invitation to submit detailed solutions, ISDS.  This included more than 3,000 pages of information, maps contained in 35 memory sticks and 52 lever arch files.  We actually had to make a wooden box to contain the submission.  The Department was aware that at that time, Eir had a range of commercial, regulatory and governance concerns about elements emerging in the procurement process.  We had raised these issues in August 2016 so the Department was well aware of our challenges.  We had decided, however, to remain in the process.  Even though there were three bidders remaining at that stage we were only one of two who submitted an ISDS.  It was a lot of work to put that ISDS together and submitting it.</p><p> In January 2018 my predecessor, Richard Moat, met the then Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten and the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Mark Griffin, to inform them of Eir&rsquo;s decision to regrettably withdraw from the bid process for the national broadband plan contract.  We confirmed this in writing on 30 January 2018.  Following protracted discussions we ultimately we came to the conclusion that the NBP framework would drive very substantial additional costs and delays to the roll-out of high-speed broadband to rural Ireland.  In our view the NBP framework resulted in duplication and inefficiency, adding to the ultimate cost to deliver high-speed broadband to non-commercial areas of rural Ireland.  We could not, therefore, accept it and we could not recommend it to our board.</p><p> There were specific requirements, such as ring fencing of funding, the creation of a wholly separate subsidiary company and the proposed restrictions on our existing wholesale division&rsquo;s ability to compete in the NBP areas.  These were all critical factors in our ultimate decision, as was the knock-on effect of NBP pricing and other decisions on our business outside of the intervention footprint.  This was a big consideration for Eir.</p><p> These challenges were unique to us because Eir is the only operator with an extensive wholesale division.  It was also looking as though Eir's infrastructure was the most likely to be built on.  There were processes and aspects that applied to Eir that did not apply to other bidders.</p><p> The committee has asked that we also refer to any other details we had on the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  The MANs did not form any part of our bid for NBP.  As we have a network everywhere there is a MAN, we do not use the MANs.  We did not have any communication with the Department on the MANs.  We had, however, been awaiting the launch of a re-tender of the MANs contracts and we expected to see it out in the summer of 2019.  We had planned to tender because, as I said, we have infrastructure everywhere there is a MAN and we thought there would be synergies there so we could probably put in a good bid that would save some taxpayer money.</p><p> The committee also asked for information on our mobile and 5G investments.  Recently we began a &euro;150 million mobile network upgrade and expansion.  This will grow our network by 25% with over 200 sites.  It will expand our 4G coverage to 99% population and geographical coverage.</p><p>It will also allow us to trial 5G later this year and to trial fixed wireless access as another potential mobile solution to rural broadband coverage.</p><p>  It remains a source of real regret for Eir, and for me personally because I was the managing director of Open Eir, which was heavily involved in putting together the NBP bid, that we ultimately found ourselves in a position where we could no longer remain in the NBP bid process.  I worked very closely on the process with a dedicated team of employees.  It was not a decision we took lightly.  We continue to engage extensively with the remaining bidder and we continue to support the Department in rolling out the NBP.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions that the members may have and will endeavour to be as helpful as possible, conscious of our obligations in respect of the communications protocol.</p></speech>

Ms Lennon said there were only two.  It can only be Eir and Enet who were still in it - if that is what the consortium is called now.  It would have been SIRO.  I understand it was in the process.

Right off the bat, the Department gave us the detailed communications protocol and we were very happy with that.  There was no issue there.  As part of that there were regular meetings with the Department's team for the NBP.  I was at many of those meetings in my previous role.  We were raising those issues for 18 months.  We started raising them in August 2016.  To be honest, those issues never changed and across that entire 18 months the issues remained the same.  As we worked through the process we knew the September date for the detailed submission was approaching.  Our chief executive officer got in touch in writing with the Minister in July and they met in August as part of an overall meeting on communications infrastructure and investment.  He raised those issues-----</p></speech>

We wanted to submit our submission and make sure he would raise these issues.  He raised them and we then went ahead and submitted our ISDS.  The next step was for the Department to issue the contract in the new year.  We were hopeful that between the submission of the ISDS in September and the contract in the new year a number of our issues would be addressed.  However, when we saw the contract in the new year, there were a few small changes, but none of the fundamental issues surrounding governance, cost and regulation had been addressed.  The next stage which was due to be in February was to sign off on the contract.  It was to commit to all of the commercial arrangements included in the contract, but we knew then that we would not be in a position to do that.  We had been raising issues for 18 months and the bid was due to be awarded in April.  We did not believe there was any opportunity between January and April for these things to be addressed because they had not been addressed in 18 months.  Therefore, we made the unfortunate and sad decision to pull out of the NBP.  That was the sequence of events.</p></speech>

The fact that there are state aid rules on top adds a level of complexity.  From where we were coming as a regulated ex-incumbent, Eir had a level of complexity.  However, we were of the view that if we had a commercial case to deliver the NBP - we do not, but if we did - we could have done it cheaper and faster than it could have been through that NBP process because of the complexity and cost that arose from it.</p></speech>

If the 300,000 for which we had a commercial case were still in the NBP, we believe, based on our analysis, that it would require a subsidy.  We had a case to make, that we could do it cheaper than if it was part of the NBP process.  Second, the subsidy required for the NBP is based on two things: how quickly one can do it and how many people are in it.  If other network developments happen at the same time and people avail of a fixed wireless solution, a satellite solution or whatever else, potentially, that will reduce the number of people who are in it.  However, building a fibre connection to the home network is a long-term investment.  As it is future proofed, we will not look at our business case in the next two years.  We expect the level of uptake to grow over time, but undoubtedly that will make an impact on the subsidy.</p></speech>

It is done on what is called a cost orientated basis.  The regulator looks as the cost of erecting and maintaining poles in rural Ireland and bases the regulated price on this.  We are bound by the regulated prices.  Again, we are concerned that in being asked to have a different regulated price in one part of the country we would then be required to have the same price in the rest of the country.  We are obliged to be equivalent to other operators all over the country.  We do not have varied prices across the country.</p></speech>

If one is in an area that can benefit from it and loads of people are not trying to benefit from it, one will have fibre-like speeds.  That is definitely the case.  The problem is that if there are 100 people on it, everybody is looking for the same footprint, whereas if one has a fibre to home connection, one does not have that contention issue.  The other issue is that the 5G network requires an awful lot of masts, which can be a challenge, particularly in rural areas.  I believe the 5G network can solve some of the problem, but it cannot solve all of it.</p></speech>

The challenge in dealing with mobile black spots comes back to commercial decisions.  As an operator, it is difficult to make a commercial case to gain access to a site.  They are black spots for a reason and perhaps one cannot get access to them.  However, all operators know where the black spots are.  From talking to other operators who are committed to trying to solve the problem, we would like the Department to state: "Here are the sites you can use because we own them.  Now, as mobile operators, you can tell us how this is going to work".</p></speech>

In our case, part of the tender and the requirement for the national broadband plan was that we would set up a completely new wholesale team.  We have a wholesale team today; we are the biggest wholesale operator in Ireland.  Part of the NBP was that we would set up a duplicate wholesale team to sell into the national broadband plan footprint and that our current wholesale team would not be able to sell into it.  If I had 80 people selling today, with all of the systems and costs involved in supporting them, I would have to have another 80, probably, selling into the national broadband plan footprint.  That did not make any sense for us and we could not stand over it.  Therefore, we could not recommend it to the board.</p></speech>

I will start with the existing infrastructure.  In the past couple of weeks there have been announcements by Eir, SIRO and Imagine Telecommunications Limited of increased investment in infrastructure.  I live in and represent part of a rural constituency.</p><p>In the past, issues were raised relating to old infrastructure, poles, and copper rather than fibre to the mast.  Are those the areas where investment will be directed?  I believe the sum was &euro;500 million.  </p></speech>

The investment announced on Monday relates to urban and semi-urban areas, that is, towns of over 1,000 premises.  The Deputy is correct.  We are over-building our copper network with fibre.  It is future-proofed technology, which will serve Ireland well into the future up to 10 GB.</p></speech>

They are often copper to mast.  Why is there no investment in those areas, particularly when they are the same areas?</p></speech>

We did those 300,000 rural build - and that is very rural - because there was a commercial business case but there is no business case for us to go beyond that.  That is the reason a national broadband plan exists in the first place, because it recognises that subsidy is required to bring fibre broadband to certain areas.</p></speech>

The lack of commercial business case is what I was getting at.  It goes back to the argument, which some might say is ideological, that the State has to intervene to ensure something is available when it is not commercially viable, but that it is necessary in the interests of the State that it be provided.</p> <p>  Ms Lennon referred to the NBP.  It has been problematic, to say the least.  Someone living in a rural area might hear a service provider say that it is not commercially viable for it to make the investments but that there is an NBP that will resolve their problem.  So far it has not resolved their problem and it has been dogged with difficulties.  I raised this with BT earlier.  Notwithstanding any changes in the structure of the company which have made it almost unrecognisable from when it first drew up its bid, one problem that has been raised is that the initial plan was for 840,000 customers.  Eir made a pitch for 300,000 of them.</p></speech>

The Department contacted all telecoms operators and asked what our plans were to build into that 840,00 or 850,000 intervention footprint.  We understand that several telecom operators, including ourselves, went back to the Department and told it our plans.  The only operator that went off and put its money where its mouth was, spent the &euro;250,000 and did the build, was Eir.  We signed a commitment contract at the request of the Department.  We would have done that build anyway.</p></speech>

As Ms Lennon has pointed out, the NBP deals with households and areas where it is not commercially viable.  That was to include the 840,000 customers.  When 300,000 of the most commercially viable of that figure are removed, it makes the remaining number more problematic in terms of their viability.  Is that part of the reason for the current difficulty and why there was not sufficient competitive tension in the process?</p></speech>

We know who we are in terms of our ex-incumbency.  Our regulation poses some challenges.  We raised all of the issues in the context of understanding that we would all love things to be simpler but sometimes that they cannot be.  We were disappointed that they were not addressed.  I can say this not as CEO.  I was the person who led the NBP bid from the start.  We wanted to win it and we thought we were best placed to win it because we know how to build networks and we know the infrastructure.  It was disappointing.  We kept thinking that the issues would be addressed but in the end, they were not.</p></speech>

Eir did that.  It asked the Department questions and told it about its concerns.  Did the Department say it would sort that out or that it would provide an answer?

For example, on the registration pricing and our worry that if we set a price over here, it would end up our <i>de facto</i>price over there.  That is a real issue for us with a business that is all over the country and an equivalence requirement.  The Department will state that this will be okay but we cannot take it that it will be okay because we are regulated, as are our prices.  There were some areas where the Department did not accept our issue and we believed it was an issue because we are regulated and know how the rules work while there were other areas where the Department engaged on them.  We went for it in terms of the ISDS submission.  We did an awful lot of work and produced a large submission.  We hoped that would show how serious we were about the bid in terms of the effort.  We hoped for changes after that.  That went in in September and the contract came out in January.  That was when we realised that nothing was going to change because there had only been very small marginal changes in the contract and none of the major issues had been addressed.  Up to then, we were probably hopeful that we might make some progress.  We kept making our arguments, kept pushing and put in a very good submission but it was obvious in January that we were not going to get traction on those issues.  At that time, the tender was meant to be awarded in April.  If we could not get traction in 18 months, we were not going to get in three months.  That was when we decided to-----</p></speech>

We need to get on with our own business."  I understand that.  When Eir indicated to the Department that it was pulling out of the process because it was not for it, did the Department say "Fair enough, good luck" or was there much of an effort to try to get Eir to stay in?</p></speech>

The feedback was that the Department asked us to reconsider and not to be hasty.  Richard Moat came back and we discussed it.  We also discussed it with our board.  At that stage, it was too late.  We were of the view by April that those major issues were not going to be fundamentally addressed.  They are major issues that require a lot of thought and many solutions.</p></speech>

My concern from the Department's point of view, not from Eir's point of view, is how the Department can run a competition on the basis of getting rural broadband to 540,000 houses without contravening state aid rules.  There is going to be a subsidy and then, lo and behold, someone says "sure I can do a third of them without any state aid".  Given where we are on this contract, I am sure Ms Lennon can understand my line of thought.</p></speech>

The complaint I am getting in rural areas is that people are willing to pay in and do not want to have to wait for the national broadband plan.  They want to get on with the job themselves but they are being held up by this process that has been going on for three and a half years with no sign of a contract.  Where we started out with the contract is worlds apart form where we are now.  I think the Minister is going through this matter with a fine tooth comb.  I would be appalled if he were to sign a contract for this now, given that a lot of it can be dealt with.</p></speech>

As Members of the Oireachtas, we are not experts in the area and, therefore, we have taken the opportunity to seek expertise.  People who work in the sector, including Mr. Matthews, have agreed to appear voluntarily before the committee to provide some information and background.  We are present to listen and learn in order that when we revert to the Department, we will be better informed on the topic, and that is the purpose of the meeting.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Matthews to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The statement is incorrect because it took Eircom two years to pass the said properties.  The Regional Internet Service Providers Association, RISPA, apologises to the committee and Eircom for the error and asks that it be corrected for the record.</p> <p>  I will take the opening statement as read and highlight certain aspects, including the background, for the information of the committee because I wish to ensure that the committee receives answers to its advance questions.</p><p>On behalf of the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, RISPA, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it and for the opportunity to contribute to its current examination of the NBP.  RISPA recognises the important role that the committee serves in scrutinising all matters pertaining to public expenditure and appreciates the privileged opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s work regarding the NBP.  It is the intent of RISPA to present information on selected aspects of the NBP, which collectively should offer the committee new insights with respect to the plans economic cost-effectiveness and general value for money.  </p><p> RISPA is a trade protection association comprised of 13 Irish owned and operated internet service providers, ISPs, each of which provide reliable high-speed Internet connectivity to predominately rural premises throughout the regions of Ireland.  Collectively, these companies provide a personalised customer service experience and are committed to expanding their network coverage and adding additional services like television, enhanced telephony and broadband at speeds of 100 Mbps and faster.  RISPA aims to raise awareness of small Irish owned and operated ISPs and to address the issues they face in delivering high-speed reliable broadband to rural Ireland.</p><p> I will now refer to the briefing on the purpose of RISPA's submission and appearance before the committee.  In the eight years since the NBP began, network technology has developed significantly.  This technology has been successfully deployed in other jurisdictions to address connectivity gaps similar to that faced by Ireland.  Given the much faster deployment timescales and better return on investment opportunity to Ireland that these technologies represent when compared to rolling out fibre in the same context, RISPA feels that it is in the best interests of Ireland and its economy that an up-to-date alternative to the fibre optic-centric, single wholesale operator model of the NBP be explored.  </p><p> This concludes the introduction to, and brief background on, RISPA.  I will now move to answer the questions the committee specifically asked all delegations to answer in their opening statements.  On the question regarding RISPA's involvement with the NBP, we have not been involved with the plan because we are a newly formed trade protection association.  Over the years, our members have attempted to engage in the consultation processes surrounding the NBP but have only ever received token responses to their submissions.  Accordingly, no RISPA member is involved with the NBP.</p><p> On the question of RISPA's involvement or discontinued involvement in the plan, our position is that the fundamental design parameters of the NBP preclude fixed wireless solutions that utilise license-exempt radio spectrum and, because the procurement process did not identify any suitable spectrum to be set aside for bidders wishing to submit a proposal which utilised fixed wireless technology, no RISPA member nor any other small ISP was able to partake in the process.</p><p> Regarding the committee's questions about challenges to the NBP, it is RISPA's position that there are numerous administrative, bureaucratic, financial and operational challenges with the NBP in its currently proposed format, a number of which RISPA will examine during its presentation.  In brief, the association's view is that the NBP's procurement process has failed to meet the standards required of such processes as set by the public spending code and that the NBP is a fundamentally out-of-date proposal due to more cost-effective technologies that have come to market over the past three years.  It is, therefore, the association's opinion that, based upon the project management principle of continued business justification, which is a rudimentary risk control concept designed to prevent the funding of projects with poor prospects for return on investment, the NBP tender be cancelled and that a new 12-month evaluation on how to solve Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity gap, which incorporates both the lessons learned from the NBP and genuine effort to engage with ISPs via a public private partnership consultative approach, be started.</p><p> On communications with the Department in respect of the operation of the MANs, neither RISPA nor its members have had any such communications, not least because these networks are under a contract that renders any discussion mute.</p><p> Regarding the question of broadband provision and new technologies such as 5G, RISPA's position is that such provisioning efforts are progressing at an unacceptably slow pace compared to the needs of Irish citizens and the wider economy.  It is the association&rsquo;s opinion that the approach being taken by the Government, the Department and ComReg is ill-advised and could be greatly improved by borrowing lessons learned from other jurisdictions with similar connectivity gaps.  RISPA's position regarding 5G technology specifically is that its inherent design makes it fundamentally unsuited to the needs of rural Ireland.  The association will give precise details during its presentation to factually explain why 5G technology cannot be a cost-effective solution for Ireland.  RISPA's position on new technologies generally, when these technologies are applied correctly, is positive.  However, it is RISPA&rsquo;s general assessment that 5G only offers benefits in high-density urban environments.  In contrast, the advancements that have been made with fixed wireless technologies and their application to similar connectivity gaps makes them worthy of consideration as a possible solution for Ireland.  In particular, the association believes that the latest generation of fixed wireless technologies, which came to market approximately three years ago, have the capability to deliver speeds of 100 Mbps or faster per subscriber connection.  Given the low cost of these technologies and their potential to rapidly solve Ireland's connectivity gap in an economically sustainable way, the association will examine them in further detailed during its presentation.</p><p> With respect to the potential use of MANs in respect of the NBP roll-out, RISPA has no direct comment since the contract governing the MANs would preclude them from being utilised in such a way.  Nonetheless, RISPA does believe that the MANs could play a vital role in addressing Ireland's connectivity gap if they were subject to competitive wholesale pricing.  In this regard, it is the association's opinion that the Department's decision not to run a tender process for the MANs, after BT Ireland gave the Department more than six months notification regarding its keen interest in competitively bidding for the contracts, was a grave misjudgement that has set Ireland&rsquo;s economy back 15 years.  RISPA will offer information during its presentation to support this opinion regarding the decision not to tender the MANs contracts.</p><p> Finally, I refer to the committee's questions about the mapping of the MANs, private fibre networks, and mobile black spots.  On the mapping of MANs, we believe that they have been sufficiently mapped and that there is little to be gained by remapping them.</p><p> Regarding the mapping of private fibre networks, it is our opinion that it is an important exercise because it could help the Government to make informed funding decisions that can avoid situations where such networks are overbuilt, that is to say, avoiding the occurrence of double spending where no additional benefit results from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective.  Consequently, RISPA believes that all private communications network operators, not just fibre operators, should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond to the mapping exercise and, in turn, that network operators should have an obligation to ensure that the data they supply is accurate so as to minimise the cost to the State.  Interlinked with this viewpoint, RISPA believes any decision to provide funding for a network operator should not wrongly disadvantage an ISP who is delivering quality services in their locality.</p><p> RISPA's opinion regarding the mapping of mobile black spots is that the exercise is of limited value with respect to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity gap.  Our position on this matter is due to the nature of mobile communications technologies being unsuitable for the provision of high-speed broadband in rural environments.</p><p> This concludes our opening statements and our answers to the questions which we were asked to address in advance.  I yield to the Chairman to decide whether the committee would like me to present RISPA's submission or to move directly to questions on it, if all members have read it.</p></speech>

In his written statement, he said that one of its objectives is to "work with wholesale providers of backhaul fibre-optic network capacity to achieve better pricing and terms of access for RISPA members."  Would that have to be done individually?  There are issues in respect of cartel activity and so on.  Will Mr. Matthews explain how RISPA's structure is an impediment or advantage in that regard?</p></speech>

Currently all regional ISPs have to deal with wholesale backhaul providers individually, which can be quite a difficult process.  It can be incredibly time-consuming, which is a burden for small companies with working directors and so on.  The main issue facing regional ISPs is the disparity in the costs of getting backhaul capacity.  A massive dimension of the problem of Ireland's connectivity gap is the lack of backhaul capacity to sites from which regional ISPs connect their customers.  The absence of regulated pricing is also a problem.</p></speech>

Regulated pricing in general is an issue, irrespective of whether there is site access.  Even if no fibre is running into a site, regional ISPs have to use microwave links, which are point-to-point fixed wireless high-capacity links, and daisy-chain them to bring the signal to a point where there is fibre.  In each site there is an annual fee to pay for each of the links and the cost of that can add up quite quickly.  The costs can spiral which means the money is not there to reinvest in order to serve more customers.</p></speech>

Mobile communications technology such as 4G, 5G and LTE is on nomadic wireless technology, the principal design of which is to support devices that move between sites, not to connect buildings.  The difference is important because the overall performance from mobile communications technology is not as good in a fixed scenario.  Fixed wireless is purposely designed to perform in a static context.  The difference is one of nuance but it makes a world of difference.  Fixed wireless technology has a committed information rate, which is a minimum speed that each connection is guaranteed to get for a download or an upload, irrespective of the time of day, how many users are on, what they are doing or how much they are downloading.</p></speech>

Businesses in rural Ireland need a reliable connection and reliability is more important than speed for any business.  I can give members some statistics for what the rolling 30-day peak requirements are.  These days, many businesses in rural Ireland work remotely and from home.  Those businesses require a reliable connection with a suitable amount of upload capacity, which copper cannot provide as its maximum speed, such as for ADSL which is the typical specification for rural settings, is limited to approximately 3.5 Mbps and will continuously drop.  In such cases, employees constantly drop out and productivity is lost.  This is why many businesses, which require reliability, become customers of regional ISPs.  Regional ISPs use fixed wireless technology because of its inherent design for fixed connections and because it can give businesses a committed information rate, which will be the minimum amount of upload and download they require.  The connection almost never drops and it is incredibly rare to lose connectivity.  I have had a fixed wireless connection for over a year and it has never lost connectivity.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of talk of 5G being an alternative, particularly in rural Ireland in the intervention area, but Mr. Matthews says it is more suitable to an urban area.  I understand that 5G is worlds apart from fixed fibre but why is it more suitable in urban than rural areas?</p></speech>

The current 5G involves a software upgrade to 4G hardware, which is why the technical term is 5G New Radio.  New radio code has been added to the software - it is not new hardware.  This is part of the reason industry leaders like the deputy chairman of Huawei have said that consumers will experience no material difference between 5G and 4G.  The chief technology officer of T-Mobile USA gave a presentation to the Federal Communications Commission and explained that it had only achieved a 19% performance increase with low-band spectrum, which is the band that relates to rural connectivity.  It is difficult to see how 5G can significantly help address Ireland's connectivity gap.</p></speech>

Because 5G is more orientated towards high-density urban settings and short distances, it uses mid-band spectrum which does not travel as well.  In rural settings, there are issues with trees blocking the signal, especially in summer when the leaves grow back.  A rural setting needs low-band spectrum to travel and make connections that are not based on a line of sight.  The amount of spectrum that has been assigned to mobile communications operators proves that the technology is not an efficient use of the spectrum blocks.  If regional ISPs had some of the low-band spectrum and some of the mid-band spectrum, they could solve the problem.  They have the coverage with their signal but because they operate in highly interfered, licence exempt bands, the spectrum they have to use cannot reach the customers for their service.</p><p>They cannot therefore deliver the download and upload speeds people need.  That is the technical explanation.</p></speech>

I will move on to the area of mapping.  We already know where the MANs are and accept that point, which is a fair one.  This is an area that I am concerned about as well.  There is other fibre available from the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Esat and whoever else.  There is more there than we know and it is not mapped.  We are talking about double spending.  I am big into saving money if we do not have to spend it and getting a good outcome at the same time.  Has Mr. Matthews any idea how much additional capacity is available that is under-used that could be leveraged, or is this just a mapping exercise that needs to be done?</p></speech>

Regional Internet service providers, ISPs, do not build those networks.  Their interactions with them are purely based on requesting quotations for a specific circuit to connect customers in a locality to get connected to the Internet, so to speak.  They are not privy to that kind of information.</p> <p>  What the Deputy is getting at is a point that needs to be understood.  We have so much capacity in the country, and regional ISPs cannot get access to that at a regulated price.  I discuss regulated pricing in the submission and give the cost ranges that regional ISPs are subjected to as compared to a regulated price.  They are more than 1000% more than a regulated price.  It is completely mad.  Part of the smart way to solve Ireland's connectivity gap is to put regulated pricing in a way that regional ISPs can access.  Even if one looks at Eircom's regulated price, in theory it is there, but getting access to that by regional ISPs-----</p></speech>

The balance of the properties, of 1  million odd were connected because they were commercially viable.  No state intervention of any nature was required for those.  That project with those figures achieved a per-connected property cost of &euro;1,250 approximately.</p> <p>  As to the approach it took to fibre - I will loop back around to the Deputy's point as to where fixed wireless comes in - on their figures as compared to what the NBP proposal is, our proposal would work out at approximately 23 times more expensive, based on a per property connection basis.</p><p>In Scotland's case, the DSSB was to bring fibre to as many properties as possible - achieving 95%.  For the remaining 5%, it launched an initiative called Reaching 100.  That programme aims to bring fibre to about 150,000 homes or to get as close as possible to 100%.</p></speech>

As part of that Reaching 100 programme in its procurement process or evaluation process for that initiative, Scotland realised it would not be economically viable to bring fibre to all those homes.  Therefore before even launching that programme, it had already begun work on a consumer subvention programme, similar to what the respected Irish economist, Colm McCarthy, noted in his 2015 report and provided as part of the submission.  The NBP probably should have looked at that.  The intervention that Scotland is looking at is to give grant vouchers to the consumers in a technology agnostic way, so they can decide themselves whether it is going to be fixed wireless or fibre.  They work with the ISPs to figure out what is viable.</p></speech>

I think the figure was 30,000.  Consumers get the voucher and can do with it what they want.</p></speech>

The key difference in terms of why the scope of that initiative is so well thought through - the parameters have not been defined - is that it is a quality-of-service intervention.  The ISPs will not get the voucher if they do not deliver the minimum amount of download and upload, response time and connection.  Irrespective of the technology, the quality of service is the same.  This is the type of intervention that would have made the most sense here in Ireland and would have allowed many of the regional ISPs to ultimately connect most of the customers.</p></speech>

I put in an appendix - I was interested myself - just to see which technologies were actually experiencing the most research and development.  I believe it is appendix A.  I put in a growth trend analysis which shows that wireless specifications which underpin fixed wireless technology are experiencing a growth trend, I believe, in excess of 9,000%, compared with fibre which is too small on the graph - I think it says less than 700% by comparison.  Also if one looks at appendix A-----</p></speech>

I am not saying anything about RISPA's product.  I am just trying to summarise.  My understanding is that the broadband plan is for high-speed fibre throughout the country.  There is an acknowledgment that it will not be possible to provide that everywhere.  There will be a balance left and that is where we bring in an organisation such as RISPA.  Mr. Matthews is arguing today that RISPA's product is currently equally good and therefore the idea of having fixed is not necessarily the best idea.  That is what I am taking from what he is saying.  However, all the evidence shows that in terms of laying down an infrastructure which can be upgraded and making it is as easy to set up a business in Tullow as in Terenure, from a planning and policy point of view the best infrastructure without doubt is connected with fibre optic cable.</p></speech>

There are many properties in the proposed intervention area that will ultimately be connected by fibre.  The question, however, is what are the properties that it is not economically viable to connect and how should we connect them.  There are many regional ISPs that lay their own fibre and connect homes with their own fibre rings.  They are not limited to fixed wireless technology and they also do copper.  They approach a prospective customer with the best solution for their needs, having identified the maximum speed, efficiency and viability they can deliver via whatever specification it is.</p> <p>  It also comes down to a cost issue, but also then the requirements.  In part the Deputy is saying we need to lay fibre because we need it for the demands going forward in the future.</p></speech>

Normal high-definition live stream requires 5 Mbps.  If these figures are considered in the context of an average Irish family of two parents and two children, and it is assumed that all are watching on separate screens at the same time, the total peak download requirement is 40 Mbps.</p> <p>  RISPA members who supply fibre optic broadband connections of at least 100 Mbps report that the 30-day rolling average for peak-time download demand, which is from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., is just 3 Mbps for 95% of customers on fibre optic connections.  If this figure is representative of all Irish households - I believe it would be - it means that 95% of residential Internet connections are already being oversupplied by 97% in respect of the capacity of their 100 Mbps-plus fibre optic connections.  </p></speech>

Professional services oriented businesses typically require 0.5 Mbps for each employee as well as another 5 Mbps for live hosting of web conferences.  This means that the vast majority of Irish businesses would function extremely well with a highly reliable Internet connection of 30 Mbps downstream, which is the minimum entry point of the NBP.</p> <p>  RISPA asked its members to present examples of the throughput needs of their business customers.  Two cases stood out.</p><p>These cases had high demand or intensive applications, not necessarily just a professional services business.  The first was an engineering business that had ten employees.  It had a 15 Mbps symmetric Internet connection, meaning it was the same speed in both directions.  The second case was a videographer who specialised in filming weddings in high definition and ultra-high definition, who had a 100 Mbps symmetric connection to support intensive uploading.  In both of these instances, the needs of each business was met comfortably by the throughput of the Internet connection supplied.  The question is why we are proposing to build this State-supported fibre optic network.</p></speech>

The 700 MHz band, which is a low spectrum band, is coming up for consideration, not just in Ireland but in several other countries.  I believe ComReg is part of a group from different countries, which is looking at this and how to reassign it.  Almost any household name, such as Microsoft or Google, or any company interested in deepening and advancing connectivity globally to parts of the world that do not have it, advocate that the 700 MHz band should be allocated to fixed wireless technology.  It is the last opportunity in the low-band spectrum for fixed wireless to get an opportunity to deliver services.  This is a band for which there needs to be an econometric assessment.  Does it make sense to get a couple of million up euro front?  The committee must be aware that the economic figures used in the procurement process for the NBP to justify the approach for fixed wireless providers are from 1990.  It is that far out of date because official bodies have not gone to get the information from regional ISPs and crunched the numbers.  We are basing these significant economic decisions on data that are ridiculously out of date.</p></speech>

Mr. Sean Bolger is the executive chairman and he is accompanied by Mr. Derek Kickham, chief operating officer.</p> <p>  I remind everybody to turn off their mobile phones or to switch them to airplane mode, at least, because putting them on silent can still interfere with recording systems.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p><p>We have met the Department to discuss the national broadband plan, NBP, before.  We have discussed the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  We are elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We do not have any technical knowledge in this area, so we have asked to meet a number of people in this industry so we can listen and learn.  The witnesses are not under investigation here.  They are here voluntarily and we appreciate that.  It is hoped we will add to our learning during the course of the day, so that when we meet the Department again, we will have a lot more information than the first time we met its representatives. <br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

We are here to help.  We have tried to address the questions put.  Our submission was in direct response to the queries raised to be as helpful as possible.  It is given in that context.  We intend to identify risks and issues concerning the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  I would like to begin with some clarifications.  We are bringing something completely different and new to the market.  We have taken time to provide some additional information.  It has been said that no fixed wireless operator has spectrum.  To clarify, Imagine Communications Group secured a large amount of spectrum in the previous auction.</p></speech>

Since 1993, Imagine has been an innovator and a strategic investor in the Irish and European fixed wireless and mobile telecoms markets.  Internationally, Imagine is an industry-recognised and credited innovator in the use of 4G long-term evolution, LTE, advanced and 5G fixed broadband.  That is a very important clarification.  In 2016, we deployed a trial network of 54 sites providing high-speed broadband with speeds up to 70 Mbps to 20,000 customers across regional and rural areas of Ireland.  This was the pilot trial of the commercial roll-out.  In July 2017, we secured 5G spectrum for the provision of fixed broadband services in ComReg&rsquo;s 3.6 GHz spectrum licence auction.  In April 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with Brookfield, which is the world&rsquo;s second largest asset management fund, with more than &euro;310 billion of assets under active management, and the funding of the roll-out of high-speed broadband infrastructure across Ireland.</p> <p>  On 13 February 2019, we formally launched our plans to roll out a national 5G-ready fixed broadband network with the priority to deliver high-speed broadband to the underserved areas of regional and rural Ireland.  With an initial project investment of more than &euro;300 million, the initial roll-out will see 155 sites live by June 2019 and 325 sites live by June 2020.  That is a rough estimate.  Commercially, our objective is to be first to deliver 150 Mbps broadband to the majority of the 1.6 million homes and businesses in our licensed coverage area.  Our current roll-out plans will initially cover 400,000 of the 540,000 premises where there is currently no planned commercial alternative.  That is about 75% of that cohort.  It would surpass this with regard to fibre.</p> <p>  It is important to make clear that while we have raised concerns about the NBP intervention strategy and process, Imagine continues to support fully the important objectives of the NBP.  This is clearly demonstrated by our significant commercial investment in the market which will help deliver the NBP objectives, de-risk its execution and, most importantly, ensure the delivery of high-speed broadband to underserved rural areas as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  Internationally, with the inevitable cost and significant time needed to deliver services, major companies such as Google are abandoning previously planned fibre to the home, FTTH, roll-outs in favour of alternative wireless solutions that cost less and are faster to deploy.  With the focus of current commercial investment and the intervention based solely on FTTH, users could be waiting for decent broadband for a great many years to come, not just in rural areas but throughout the country.  Currently our 5G-ready technology can deliver 300 Mbps services, which far exceeds user demand.  An industry roadmap shows service speeds will exceed 10 Gbps.  In fact, the most recent numbers have increased to 20 Gbps.  5G fixed broadband has become a mainstream alternative to FTTH for the delivery of future-proofed next-generation high-speed broadband to homes and businesses.  It is currently the primary business model and driver of commercial 5G infrastructure investment across the world.</p> <p>  We believe that in addition to delivering services in underserved areas, our investment will stimulate competition and investment across the market.  However our primary concern is that the current intervention strategy, unless revised, will delay the roll-out of critical backhaul fibre infrastructure on a national basis.  We have openly engaged with key stakeholders, Departments and elected representatives to outline our commercial plans and our view that the objectives of the NBP can best be achieved by a phased approach which prioritises State-subsidised investment in extending fibre backbone infrastructure into every region in Ireland.  That is the alternative to extending to every home as work goes along.  This approach would mean getting fibre to every part of Ireland first.</p> <p>  This approach would ensure the availability of critical fibre backbone infrastructure to support hospitals, industry and business on a national basis as quickly as possible while at the same time enabling commercial investment in demand driven "last-mile" connectivity, potentially using multiple access technologies, including FTTH and 5G fixed wireless.  This would provide the essential core infrastructure platform commercial investment needs to be able to extend services economically to customers in underserved areas now and in the future.  It is not necessary for the State to replace commercial investment completely as appears to be the case in the current NBP approach.</p> <p>  I will now address our participation in the national broadband plan process.  Imagine was an active participant in the high-speed broadband task force.  The initial NBP goal was to provide next generation access, NGA, high-speed broadband services using different technologies as provided for in the state aid guidelines, SAG.  This would ensure the delivery of 30 Mbps broadband to 100% of the population and 100 Mbps to 50% of the population by 2020.  In 2014 the Government approved a more ambitious plan with a focus on long-term future-proofed infrastructure with additional fibre backhaul, a key component underpinning the technology used to deliver the service to customers in rural areas.</p> <p>  I will now refer to the mapping process.  As required by the SAG and to avoid market distortion, the purpose of the mapping process is to assess existing and planned commercial deployments to identify market failure and minimise unnecessary intervention.  At the end of 2015 our plans for the roll-out of high-speed broadband were rejected by the Department and therefore not included in the NBP maps which defined the proposed intervention area.  Since then many of the perceived risks that led to our exclusion, such as the risk that Imagine would fail to secure spectrum in the ComReg auction and concerns about the availability of LTE advanced wireless equipment, evolution of the technology and market demand, have been shown to be incorrect.  The revised NBP strategy, including the 2020 broadband map published at the end of December 2015, effectively embedded FTTH as the preferred intervention solution.  Fibre to every home, which had never been done anywhere ever before and has never been done since, subsequently became the mantra of the NBP.</p> <p>  I will now outline our involvement in the NBP intervention process.  The project information memorandum, PIM, for the NBP set out very specific and detailed pre-qualification criteria for the financial, technical, building, operation and management work.  These included a requirement that in the preceding two years, consortia bid members had participated in similar relevant large-scale infrastructure projects with a value in excess of &euro;300 million.  Together with Macquarie Group, one of the largest infrastructure funds in the world with an impeccable and highly successful track record in Government infrastructure projects and public private partnerships in Ireland, we assembled a consortium of blue-chip international partners which exceeded all of the requirements of the pre-qualification criteria.  This consortium included Macquarie Group, Black and Veatch, which is one of the largest telecommunications infrastructure contractors in the US, and Huawei, the largest communications technology company in the world.</p> <p>  Due to an administrative technicality pertaining to the ultimate global holding company ownership structure of both Black and Veatch and Huawei, both were deemed ineligible to be a bidder member and the economic, financial, technical and professional capability of these entities was excluded from the assessment process.</p><p>Therefore, their contribution to the consortium was not considered in the evaluation of our pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, which then, unsurprisingly, failed to meet the stringent pre-qualification criteria.  Given their international experience, the bid members were very surprised and disappointed with their exclusion, and while an appeal was considered, this was not pursued as the subsequent immediate announcement of a gap-funded model, which favours existing infrastructure operators, in preference to a concession model consolidated the apparent preference for a full fibre to the premises solution, which our consortium did not consider to be financially viable.</p><p> We were asked by the committee to address the administrative risks to the NBP and there are a number of existential threats to the NBP process.  Given that the pre-qualification process was to ensure the financial, technical and operational capability to complete the roll-out, the significant changes in the last remaining consortium&rsquo;s membership raises concerns.  Does the remaining bid member meet the PQQ criteria, and if not, what are the consequences for the integrity of the process and the outcome?  In circumstances where the two bidders with experience in the roll-out of fibre to the home, FTTH, networks have pulled out of the process, apparently on the basis that they could not make a commercial business case, the inevitable conclusion is that either there is a significant risk to the successful roll-out of the network or there will be a significant increase in the final cost, or both.  With the sole remaining bidder determining the only proposed technical solution, without the required spectrum and absent any competitive tension, there is a risk that the process can no longer deliver its objective while effectively excluding the benefit of available, alternative lower-cost last-mile solutions.</p><p> With the current intervention based on an end-to-end FTTH solution, in the absence of a phased approach which prioritises fibre backhaul infrastructure, there is a risk that while some areas will eventually benefit, other areas will be significantly delayed and will have to wait many years to get any service.  With 5G essential to the future digital society and economy, and wireless mobile a part of that, the current FTTH approach can no longer of itself achieve the very objectives of the NBP, with the risk of further marginalising regional Ireland and rural communities.  An inherent risk to the proposed FTTH focused NBP intervention is the requirement for and cost of access to incumbent poles and ducting infrastructure, resulting in avoidable delay and unnecessarily high costs to the State and taxpayers.  There is a risk that unnecessary market intervention and cost could lead to difficulties with state aid approval.  All these identified risks will need to be addressed by the Department and in any contract.  This should happen to ensure the NBP is successful.</p><p> We have had no communications with the Department on the operation of metropolitan area networks, MANs.  However, this infrastructure is underutilised and could be a useful component of a fibre backhaul network across Ireland.  We are a major user of fibre backhaul so today's news of a reduction in price is welcome.  It will be a significant factor in bringing down the cost of fibre backhaul for our network.  With regard to the mapping of MANs, private fibre networks and mobile blackspots, in line with state aid guidelines, all existing and planned commercial investment should be taken into consideration prior to any state intervention into a commercial market.  The mapping of mobile blackspots is a different issue and should be looked at separately from the NBP.  In the context of the NBP, 5G mobile will have a significant impact on the future digital economy, and the availability of fibre backhaul infrastructure in the regions is also critical to the development of 5G mobile services in those areas.</p><p> On behalf of Imagine, I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to outline our views and I welcome any questions it may have.</p></speech>

They all connect to a national fibre network.  What differentiates them is how they connect from that network to homes and businesses.  It is important from our perspective to explain that fibre has always been in the network, and because of the heightened demands for speed and capacity, it is now about bringing fibre closer to customers.  There are basically four ways to do it and most people probably confuse them.  One uses cable, which is what Virgin Media does.  Another method is fibre to the cabinet, where fibre is brought to a local cabinet in a town or village and then copper is used to bring the service to a home.  The next method brings fibre past the cabinet into every single home, thus replacing the need for copper.</p></speech>

It is referred to in the business as the last mile.  The last mile differentiates the different solutions as such.  LTE wireless has the capability of 100 Mbps and up to 300 Mbps today but at the time of tendering for the NBP, the issue was the future-proofing element of fibre to the home.  The only way to achieve a future-proofed network was through fibre to the home, but with the announcement of 5G, there will be massive capacity that is also future-proofed.  That capacity will be up to 20 Gbps per user.  It is a very high-capacity solution that has fundamentally changed the industry.  It is being used internationally and is a major driver of investment.  It is an alternative to fibre to the home.</p></speech>

There is another understandable misconception that when people speak of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, it is always about mobile technology.  We are talking about 5G mobile services powering driverless cars, the future digital economy, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, remote technologies and remote automation of farm machinery.  To do this there would need to be an extensive additional build of masts because current masts do not have the coverage to support such services.  That is as it relates to 5G mobile technology.  5G fixed technology is a completely different build and network.  It is not built for what I have just described but specifically and totally to deliver high-speed broadband from fibre in the mast directly to premises.  It does not require a massive additional build of masts because the technology is not like that used to connect to a small mobile phone, which will not function properly unless the user is near a mast or outside a building.  5G fixed broadband will put an outdoor antenna on a premises.  It is being deployed around the world.  In the United States, for example, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Google Fiber and Sprint have all started to roll out 5G fixed broadband as an alternative to fibre to the home.  That is because technology has advanced so much.</p> <p>  High-speed data cannot be delivered across a long distance with a mobile phone.  If there are thousands of mobile phones using a service, the signal is variable.  A fixed broadband network using 5G limits the number of people on every mast to guarantee that the service can be provided with high quality to those people.  It does not need many extra masts because it can reach longer distances.  In Canada, this distance has extended to 30 km but it depends on how we would like to build our network.  In our network, approximately 13 km is the maximum distance we would allow, giving us a large range.  This means distance can be covered much faster.</p><p>It is very important to note we are talking about two totally different technologies.</p><p> In relation to some of the challenges in rural areas, which other people mentioned, is it line of sight, for example?  Yes, it is largely line of sight to get the kind of quality of a connection one wants but one is talking about new technologies.  Without going off too far, beamforming is one, which basically directly focuses the signal.  Things like trees or massive MIMO allow for the signal to be picked up from multiple locations.  If one has a mast and a connection on a house, whatever is in between will block one.  When one is building a national network, one is talking about multiple sites, so the signal can come from different directions and because it is also used in beamforming technology, it can direct the connection directly to one. </p></speech>

Basically, that box connects.  Others have talked about technologies and wireless.  One cannot do this with unlicensed spectrum because it is too variable.  One cannot do it with mobile because one is sharing this spectrum with everybody and people are on the move.  One can only do this by fixed broadband.  Today, one is talking about eight transmitters and eight receivers in one box that allow one to take signals from different locations.  Many of those challenges that existed previously have been addressed.</p></speech>

It could meet and exceed the existing requirements, and the Government was right to say not to take 30 Mbps for now.  It made a decision to do this for the future.  One was able to deliver a high-capacity, high-speed broadband service and then in the future, because one had fibre, it was basically future-proofed in terms of investment.  That is important for two reasons.  The first is that it is the right thing to do and the second is that from a funding, finance and banking perspective, one has a long-term infrastructure that can give one the returns, which justifies the investment.  I refer to building out a network.  We are investing &euro;300 million now to do this because we have a solution that has a long-term future.

The opportunity now is to ask if we can use different solutions.

As far as we are concerned, the national broadband plan is essential and should go ahead.  One of the major benefits of the national broadband plan is that it has driven commercial investment.  There is no doubt about that in terms of the fact the State took a view to build out and to have a national broadband plan.  The objective of the task force, of which I was a member, was to stimulate commercial investment and that is what it has done.  The objective is to get everybody high-speed broadband.  It is not about the State doing it; it is about getting it.  If one gets commercial operators to invest - the announcement by Eir is very welcome - and if more money is invested, more people will get broadband quickly.</p></speech>

First, the network we will launch will cover rural areas.  That is where our focus is going to be and it is for commercial reasons.  It will, however, automatically cover many of the areas where Eir is going to run out of fibre broadband connections on a commercial basis.  The reality for everybody is that this roll-out has taken many years and much investment.  It takes a long time to have fibre broadband.  This is an alternative solution which will create competition to make sure everybody will put in the best effort to move forward.  Is the Deputy referring to the areas that are left?</p></speech>

If the current approach to the roll-out, with an end-to-end contract, is followed, there is a risk that there will be two issues with the NBP.  The technology was chosen and it has now evolved.  It is evident that things have changed.  The second aspect was that a decision was made to ensure everybody received broadband.  The initial idea of the contract was that &euro;500 million would be put into backhaul infrastructure.  There were two ways to set it out.   One was to give a contract to roll out backhaul infrastructure.  Alternatively, a contract could be given for an end-to-end service to bring fibre broadband near homes.</p></speech>

Even if it was to start tomorrow, a fibre broadband roll-out that started in County Kerry, extending to Galway and then County Donegal to connect every home at same time, would take a lot of money and time.  I am simplifying it, but by the time the people at the end of the line were reached in that process they would have been waiting for years.</p></speech>

The service is then available to those who want it now.  It will not be the case that everybody will take the service straightaway.  There have been references to the take-up of fibre broadband to homes.  It does not matter what is done; there will be a take-up rate, at which nobody should be shocked.  Wireless technology allows us to provide coverage over a wide area, but, to be clear, we are not going to connect 1 million or 1.6 million premises.  We are going to make the service available and will add more capacity as people want the service.</p></speech>

Mr. Bolger has described his backers and the technical side of his operation.  Therefore, he has the combination required.  Is the last remaining consortium coherent as it has changed several times?

Everybody is asking the same question.   A clear process with high standards and qualification criteria was needed.  All of the bidders should have had to go through it to ensure they had the financial capability and practical expertise to build, operate and manage the network.  I do not know if that is the case with the current consortium as it has progressed and changed, but I am sure the original members of the bidding team were there for a reason.  Now that some of them are no longer there, how is the loss to be made up?  Again, we do not know.  It is an issue about which everyone is talking.

I thank Mr. Bolger and Mr. Kickham for coming.  I have found much of the discussion very interesting.  I worked in the industry well over 15 years ago, but it is still fascinating.  I have one question, the answer to which perhaps even Mr Bolger might share.  Which "G" will provide an alternative to fixed-line broadband?  I do not think it is 5G, but we are not too far off it.  Mr. Bolger touched on the originators of 5G - Huawei.  There are some global security concerns about the company.  I do not have sufficient information to make a judgment call on whether having those concerns is warranted, but I know that it is something that is under consideration.  Would the witnesses like to offer a view?</p></speech>

It is important to understand, however, in respect of future-proofing, that 5G is a global standard of technology under the International Communications Union and that Huawei is just one company that provides the service.  My response to the security concerns is the same as that of the Deputy.  There is insufficient information available at this point to make a judgment.  We work with Huawei, with which we have had a strong relationship for many years, as we do with many other vendors.  We are working with 12 vendors in our network.  Huawei is a provider for nearly every telecommunications company in Ireland and probably the vast majority of companies in Europe.  At this point-----</p></speech>

My interpretation of what Mr. Bolger said in his opening statement is that the national broadband plan envisages 100% fixed-line fibre broadband connections to all homes and businesses in Ireland.  That is what I picked up from what he said, but I do not think that is accurate.  I think the national broadband plan envisages that about 5% of homes and businesses in the State are not connectable.  They are in locations that are too far down a boreen to have any level of commercial or State interest in connecting them.  That is where wireless service providers step in.

We do not know at this point if there are homes and premises that will require a wireless solution.

Imagine Communications Group is a commercial operator and the best of luck to it.  It is a service provider in terms of the service to those rural parts of the country 13 km from its transponder, for want of a better description.  That is absolutely fantastic.

That is a very detailed process.  It is fundamental to designing the network.  Then one puts in masts strategically to fill in those gaps to the maximum extent one can.  The masts are done on a probability basis.  One tries to make sure it is highly probable that people will get a service.  That is how one mitigates, by building out masts.  One is building one site to service an amount of customers.  If they can see the site that is fine.  When one is building out a network at the density we are doing one ends up getting multiple sites that one can see.  However, we are not going to get everybody.  We are not going to cover everybody.  That is not what we are saying.  We are saying that as a commercial investor and operator on the market this is what we are doing.</p></speech>

We are not talking about something theoretical but what is working now today.  LTE was at 100 Mbps and the reality in the market would have been about 70 Mbps.  That is why when we did a trial we did not say up to 100 Mbps, as many people would have done.  We said it was up to 70 Mbps.  Right now we can do up to 300 Mbps but we are not saying that.  We are saying that, on average, people will get 150 Mbps.  Probably 95% of people who have fibre get 150 Mbps.  The evolution of the technology is not something we are saying but is a global technology and global standard.  We had the chief technology officer, CTO, of Ofcom with us yesterday at the launch.  These trials and roll-outs are happening all over the world.  We must be clear.  It is a very high speed broadband service and it is future-proofed given that it is a global industry with billions being invested in it.  The current standard for 5G is 20 Gbps.  In fact, Ofcom says it is 50 Gbps.  It has gone beyond practicality at that point in time.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

We are talking about a shift here in what previously would have been considered as fixed wireless, the unlicensed spectrums and the legacy technologies.</p><p>We need to put this in context.  No one in the world is spending billions building out 5G fixed broadband networks that are not future proofed.  We would certainly not invest the kind of money we are investing if it was not future proofed.  Future proofed means it will always meet the demands of the customers.  One cannot put this kind of money to work in a market and think one will not keep up to standard and speed when something else such as fibre to home is coming.  We must be clear about this.  We are not saying not to build out the national broadband plan.  We are saying it should be built out.  We are building out a network in parallel commercially and we will not do that unless we are 100% confident that the service our customers will get today is seriously faster than what they currently experience - that is why they will choose it - and it will continue to meet their demands.  The industry expectation now is that we will have 1 Gbps by the end of this year.  When we see it, trial it and it is tested, I will believe it.  The next thing is 10 Gbps.  Nobody is building these networks for the short term.  This is a major shift.</p></speech>

Will it then move on to additional sites and scenarios that its mapping exercises will have identified where there might be an area with a couple of hundred houses that it cannot penetrate because of topography or other barriers to the provision of services, whether man-made or otherwise?  Alternatively, is Imagine rolling out services in a particular region and trying to capture everyone in it before moving on to the next region?  What is its business model?</p></speech>

That is the first objective.  By definition, we are investing commercially, which is very important.  What makes it possible is that the technology allows us to make a commercial investment in areas where previously others would not have made that investment.  Our objective is to cover as many people as possible, make the service available and then meet demand.  That means that in each area we will have customers take on the service.  If they do not take it on, we will not add more capacity and if they do, we will put up more capacity.  That means we will put in our 5G fixed broadband equipment on more masts.  It may start with a certain amount of coverage and a certain number of customers and when one exceeds a certain number of customers, more capacity is needed.  To do that, we will build more base stations and reduce the coverage of each base station to service the customers.</p></speech>

It will continuously evolve.  I have been in the business for 30 years and seen 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G.  People will talk about 6G next.  The bottom line is that the wireless technology, which is backed by global industry, has now got to a starting point of very high capacity.  This makes it an alternative to other high capacity fixed networks.  It is not going to go backwards.  If one chooses to use that technology for mobile, that is great.  If one chooses to use that technology for a mix of mobile and fixed, that is also great.  However, it will not work as an alternative to a fixed broadband solution.  We are providing a fixed broadband solution.  People probably do not know a great deal about this because Ireland was the first country in Europe and one of the first in the world to release the 3.6 GHz spectrum, which now happens to be the pioneer spectrum for 5G.  We have worked with industry, regulators, governments and operators who come to Ireland to look at what we are doing.  It is very new and we are very proud of that and of being an Irish company.  As the committee heard earlier, Eir is also trialling fixed wireless as a solution.  Vodafone is using it in other countries and Three is using it in the UK.  It is the biggest driver of business investment.  So many masts will have to be built for the 5G network but the handsets to get there will not be available in large numbers, whereas today there is a deficit in infrastructure for fixed broadband.  That is what is making the commercial investments possible.  The reason we were successful in raising funding and bringing this project is that the infrastructure funds and banks around the world now see this as a real alternative.  These are the same people who invested in fibre.  It is not better; it does exactly what fibre will do in a different way.  It is just new.  We have been clear that this will raise questions but we are putting a large investment into this. </p></speech>

One of the objectives of the national broadband plan is to ensure that people get the service.  We think that is critically important.  If we do not deliver, we know that everyone else is coming behind us.</p></speech>

My question refers to a transponder, a mast or an antenna or whatever one wants to call it.  I am sure there is a technical term that I am not aware of.  If Imagine is broadcasting at a particular mast, what is its capacity or maximum number of users?  At what will Mr. Kickham call Mr. Bolder and tell him another mast is needed in Ballygowherever?  What is the number?</p></speech>

It depends on the configuration.  We need to achieve different configurations of coverage.  We cannot go out and blast this everywhere and get as much coverage.  We have to use different radio plans-----</p></speech>

Once we get to 70% capacity, we would say we need more sites.  As we roll out the network, we will have far fewer on each mast because of the rate at which we are building it out.</p></speech>

We talk about it as though there is a constraint or capacity limitation associated with fixed networks but all networks have constraints and contain within them design assumptions relating to how much capacity to put in at certain points.  A fibre network is the same as any other network.  We use a lot of fibre ourselves.  When we refer to a mast, it is not a singular entity.  Mr. Bolger said that there are several configurations but a particular bay station could be configured to have three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine cells.  The answer is that one deploys capacity where it is needed.</p><p>That is what it means.  It is not that there is only one of these things and that is it.  This is really about putting up what is needed to meet the capacity for which there is a requirement.</p></speech>

The network has load balancing, which means that if, let us say, the area in which one's house is located gets busy, one will switch to another sector.  It is very complex.  That is what makes it possible.  The concept of limitation is being lifted.  The cap is off with technology.</p></speech>

I do not want to twist his words but my understanding is that Mr. Bolger claims that perhaps when the national broadband plan was being developed, there were limitations but that it has evolved to a point now where he would see it as an alternative.  Am I misinterpreting what Mr. Bolger is saying or do I have the gist of it?</p></speech>

My remit, as an Oireachtas Member, is to ask Mr. Bolger questions.  I want a broadband plan for the people.  I have no vested interest in this.  Leave the commercial out of it.  In terms of providing for the people of Ireland and leaving money out of it, is it true to say that Imagine's product, wireless fixed, is equal now in terms of evolutionary status to fibre optic?</p></speech>

It is on our journey.  The standard that it is at is way above what is required today.  It is similar to the speeds that are being provided commercially in the market, the vast majority of which would be 150 Mbps.  The reality is that in places like Jersey, where there is 100% fibre penetration, the customers do not take more than 150 Mbps.  Fibre is being built for the future.  That is important.  We need to compare like with like.  If we are building for the future, at a point in the future somebody will need 1 Gbps.  I am telling the Deputy that the standards for 5G by that time will be at 1 GHz.  It will actually be beyond-----</p></speech>

I really need to deal with this because it is the crux of the matter.  Mr. Bolger is stating that 5G is evolving, on a journey to evolve, etc., but he is really predicting the future in terms of technology.  He cannot guarantee that wireless fixed in a few years' time will be equal in effectiveness to fibre-optic cable.  Can he predict that?</p></speech>

In fairness to the Deputy, we are quite advanced in this.  As a result of the fact that we had the spectrum, we have been involved in this for many years.  We are recognised as being one of the most advanced companies in this particular area.  We have no problem in providing the service.  There is a very good reference site that we can give the committee, putting it not wrong but in plain English, which is the UK Government website which basically sets out their expectations and strategy for their network.  That would be probably a good source for the Deputy, if it was helpful.</p></speech>

Mr. Bolger is stating that Imagine has enough masts already as a result of what it bought as part of the two previous transactions and from piggybacking on other masts and adding bits on.

We know that business is using the product.  We did not market it as a separate business product.  Business customers use it for business.  We have not distinguished between them.  This is a trial network that we have run.  We did not expand it.  When we launched the trial, the facts that we know are that it meets the demands and needs.  We have business customers.  As for the normal usage that we would expect on the international works, we have tested all of that.  We know that 20,000 people wanted the service in those areas.  However, it was a trial network and, therefore, we did not connect to anybody else.  We were not in a position to do it.  This is very important.  We could not make this announcement and investment because at the time we had not secured a spectrum until 2017.  It was only when we had the spectrum - we secured it at a cost of &euro;10 million - that we were able to make the plans to roll out the national network.  We could not do anymore more than the 50 sites, just to be clear.</p></speech>

It is helpful to look at it as the two components that it really has.  It has a backhaul requirement, which everybody agrees is required.  Everybody also agrees that this has to be fibre and that it has to be extensive.  There is no dispute about that.  Then there is what we call the "last mile", which is the access piece.  There are different views about that.</p></speech>

It is horses for courses.  There are a number of last-mile solutions such as fibre, copper or wireless.  We think that we should absolutely be doing the backhaul phase extensively and as quickly as possible because everybody needs it.  Then it should be horses for courses for the access.</p></speech>

The rural area cover started off as 850,000.  Eir has already done 300,000 from that total and we are now down at 540,000.  The Department has looked at that.  Eir has confirmed that it is now going to upgrade its existing network from copper to fibre and that it is going to take another 80,000 of the 540,000.  This means the number will have dropped to 460,000.  Eir has confirmed that commercially.  It will be done without a penny of State aid or taxpayers' money.  Imagine has stated that it can do a large chunk of the 460,000 remaining premises, although I am not tying anyone to a figure.</p></speech>

When we have witnesses in to the committee who have a product and when there will be a budget for that product, we as a committee have to be very aware of the facts.  I read a lot of documentation on fibre optics last night and today it has been discussed as an evolving sector, whether it is equal or not and that it is an alternative in Japan, in Jersey and in the United States of America.  This morning, however, we heard that Eir has announced &euro;500 million in fibre investment and a further &euro;250 million in respect of the rural fibre programme.  We are not getting the right information or non-biased information.  It is very important for the committee to have some sort of expert advice on this.</p></speech>

I would not.  I am sorry but I put it to the Chairman that I run a business and when a rep comes in to sell me something, I start by not believing a word he or she says.  However, I then end up believing some of it.  I see this as a glorified version of that, with respect, and I believe we need to be very conscious of where the industry is and the science behind it, as well as the factual information.</p></speech>

We are not looking for anything.  All we are doing is coming in to the market.  We think the national broadband plan should go ahead.  They should make sure that we deliver on it.  I ask that people be careful because some of the conversation is about "Eir is doing this" and "Imagine is doing that".  The bottom line is that we have to prove that we can do it.  Right now, the important thing for the national broadband plan is to make sure that we do it and that it should go ahead.  The most efficient way to do it is in a two-phased approach.  If one concentrates on fibre backhaul we will do our job and connect the homes.  If we do not, then the rest of the homes can still be connected: it is fine.  We are not looking for anything and we are not selling anything.  We will have to sell to our customers, which, in fairness, is what we do.</p></speech>

We have been busy all day meeting a number of groups.  I welcome Enet, and thank its representatives for being here.  They are here voluntarily to assist the committee and to provide information to us.  We are here to listen and learn.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment appeared before this committee some time ago to discuss the NBP, the process of which has been ongoing for a couple of years.  We wanted to interrogate the process to date, in terms of costs incurred so far and the future costs of the plan, and we decided that we needed to inform ourselves on the matter, being Deputies with no great expertise in the communications area.  Deputy Farrell has indicated that he has some knowledge in the area.</p></speech>

We decided that we needed to inform ourselves, and we are pleased to have so many people appearing before us today.  We thank them all for coming.  All of the information we are using and gathering will be distilled in due course.  When we speak to the Department about the national broadband plan and other issues we will be far better informed than we were at 9 o'clock this morning.  That is the purpose of this meeting, and we thank the witnesses in advance for providing information.</p><p>I want to stress that we are not here to examine the financial statements of the witnesses.  They are here to help us.  We are not here to interrogate them.  If the witnesses are asked a question about the Department that they feel is more appropriate for the Department to answer they can tell us.  Please do not hold back on that issue.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Peter McCarthy, chief executive officer of Enet.  He is accompanied by Mr. David Eyre, chief commercial officer, and Ms Claire Murphy, general counsel.  I remind everyone in the room to put their mobile phones on to airplane mode or to switch them off; merely putting them onto silent mode can still interfere with the recording system.  </p><p>I advise witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>

Everyone watching will want to hear what he has to say.  It is fine for us; we have the opening statement in front of us.  However, it is no good if we have the document while the people watching do not know what is being said.

I am the group CEO of Enet.  I am accompanied today by Mr. David Eyre, chief commercial officer, and Ms Claire Murphy, general counsel and company secretary.  As we have mentioned in our briefing materials, our entire leadership team is relatively new to Enet but we are here today to support the committee&rsquo;s work to the best of our ability.</p> <p>  The invitation to attend this session is designed to support the examination of matters related to the national broadband plan, NBP.  As such, we intend to outline our role in the NBP project.  While Enet, as a sub-contractor to the bidder, NBI, is subject to confidentiality regarding aspects of the plan, we will do our best to address the questions posed to us.  I would also like to take the opportunity to highlight Enet's operation of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, which is a State asset.  </p> <p>  Our company is based in Limerick, has staff of nearly 115 people and operates the largest alternative wholesale telecoms network in Ireland.  It operates over 5,400 km of fibre infrastructure, including the Irish state&rsquo;s metropolitan area networks &ndash; known generally as the MANs - and proprietary metro networks, a unique backhaul infrastructure and one of the largest licensed wireless networks in the country.  As it stands, Enet operates the MANs in 94 cities and towns across Ireland, operates over 3,700 km of backhaul fibre along the Irish Rail network and has access to Bord Gais and ESBT fibre, as well as access to Waterway Ireland&rsquo;s fibre.  </p> <p>  Enet&rsquo;s operations are at the very heart of Irish telecoms.  Our customers - almost 70 in total - some of which are the country&rsquo;s largest service providers, use our services to systematically improve their retail services and to bring high-quality broadband to more than one million end users throughout Ireland.  </p> <p>  Enet&rsquo;s shareholder is the Irish Infrastructure Fund, IIF, which now owns 100% of the business.  The IIF invests capital for 28 institutional investors, 25 of which are Irish pension funds including university trusts, union pensions, religious orders, construction worker pensions, pensions from a number of Irish companies, as well as Government bodies.  It has been stated previously that ISIF is one of the investors in IIF.  The fund purchased a 78% stake in Enet from Granahan McCourt, GMC, in July 2017.  The IIF subsequently agreed terms to acquire the remaining 22% in September 2018.  This transaction closed on 5 December 2018, and included the resignation of the GMC representative directors, effectively ending the GMC involvement in Enet.  Today the primary board of Enet has three board directors nominated by the IIF.  </p> <p>  In December 2015, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment launched its NBP procurement process.  At that time, Enet&rsquo;s shareholder, Granahan McCourt, developed a consortium to participate in the tender process.  In March 2016, the consortium lodged its pre-qualifying questionnaire, PQQ.  At this stage and throughout, Granahan McCourt was formally the lead bidder, and Enet&rsquo;s envisaged role was that of a key subcontractor.  In September 2018, the final PQQ was lodged.  At this point, Enet&rsquo;s role remained unchanged and we were reaffirmed as a key subcontractor.  Neither Enet or its shareholder, IIF, are directors, shareholders or direct advisers to the consortium.</p><p>We do acknowledge that, for most of the procurement process, the consortium was described as Enet-led.  At the commencement of the process, Granahan McCourt had control of Enet, both as a shareholder and with its chairman.  David McCourt referenced this in a Newstalk interview with Pat Kenny in October 2018 when discussing the consortium name, when he stated, "it was called Enet because at the time I owned Enet and I was running Enet and it was a convenient name to call it."</p><p> As regards the MANs, they were implemented by Government in response to market failure and the need to provide high-speed, open-access broadband networks in regional towns and cities.  Following an open tender process, Enet was appointed in 2004 to manage the 28 phase 1 MANs.  In 2009, following a further open tender process, Enet was appointed to manage the 60 phase 2 MANs.  Ownership of the 88 MANs remains with the State.  To date, Enet has made revenue share payments to the State in excess of &euro;8.8 million and has also made MAN-related infrastructure investments totalling &euro;31 million, with that value residing with the State.  From Enet&rsquo;s review of the policy deliverables which we have detailed in our briefing materials already provided to the committee, we believe that both the MANs and our operation of same has delivered in excess of the anticipated policy outcomes.</p><p> Our role has been about value creation for the State.  It has supported balanced geographical foreign direct investment, reduced costs to customers and enhanced State assets.  This has been acknowledged by a number of Ministers and public servants over the years.  No business is perfect.  People come and go, processes fail, markets go up and down but, most important, we always seek to improve what we do and to do so with professionalism and integrity.  With Irish pension money as the foundation of our shareholding today, and with close to 115 people directly employed through our business and hundreds more indirectly providing services to us, our primary focus is on improving everything we do to deliver the high standard of service required in the market place today.</p></speech>

Enet, therefore, has always been supportive of the national broadband plan, NBP, and the Government's vision for a ubiquitous high-speed broadband network.  In December 2015, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment formally launched its procurement process for the NBP.  At that time, Enet's shareholder was Granahan McCourt and that company developed a consortium to participate in the tender process.  A number of Enet staff were seconded onto the project to work on the bid on behalf of the consortium.  We have no seconded staff any more in the consortium.</p> <p>  In March 2016, the consortium lodged its prequalifying questionnaire, PQQ, which was the first formal milestone in the process.  At this stage and throughout, Granahan McCourt was formally the lead bidder.</p></speech>

Enet's envisaged role is that of key subcontractor providing services such as capacity via the MANs, co-location via MAN-enabled co-location sites and the Enet proprietary network, services in backhaul capacity, the provision of wireless access and network operations management.  In September 2018, the final PQQ was lodged by Granahan McCourt, the lead bidder, to reflect a change in bidder composition.  At that point, Enet's role remained unchanged and we were reaffirmed as the key subcontractor, the same role as we had originally.  For the avoidance of doubt, neither Enet or its shareholder, the Irish Infrastructure Fund, are directors of, shareholders in or direct advisers to the consortium.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that for most of the procurement process, the shorthand term "Enet-led consortium" was used in media coverage.  In all likelihood this came about because Granahan McCourt owned the business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#XX01800"><p>That is helpful.  At prequalification, the financial side of the consortium is coming through Granahan McCourt and Enet, as the key subcontractor, has a proven track record of being able to deliver as an operator in the system with operational knowledge of this type of project.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy must be the most modest person ever to have appeared at the Committee of Public Accounts because there was a press release from the Minister yesterday announcing a 50% cut in the rate Enet will charge for fibre, from &euro;5 to &euro;2.60 per metre.  That is a phenomenal reduction in price and it is remarkable that Mr. McCarthy did not make a reference to it.  He is here to discuss MANs and maybe his script was prepared before this announcement was made.  In any event, we were very pleased to announce this price reduction for the operating demands network and its customers at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning.  What was the timing of the cut and how did it come about?  Some customers were thrilled at the good news which they heard overnight.</p></speech>

Dark fibre is the physical fibre optic cable and one must consider that it is a physical infrastructure product.  Some refer to it as "unlit fibre" because physical infrastructure does not carry a 1 Gbps service, which is referred to as a "managed service".  Managed services are where one puts the electronics on it and the dark fibre is the cable product.</p></speech>

Enet is the only operator in the regional Irish market which openly sells both duct and dark fibre products and we price it on a per metre basis, which is a global standard for pricing such products.  One metre or 100 m of dark fibre would be cheaper than 500 m normally.  Depending on the distances involved in the geographical locations requiring to be linked, the price will vary.  The Analysys Mason report recommends that Enet and the Department discuss price changes for dark fibre subduct and duct to ensure that customers do not find it more expensive, on average, to buy passive products that are comparable to managed service products.</p><p> When we put our pricing up on our website, as is the case with all operators that we aware of, it is maximum pricing you put up, and this has been the industry norm both in Ireland and abroad for many, many years.  We published that pricing yesterday and I am going to explain to you the timing of that.</p><p> Regarding this specific point about the 50% reduction in prices yesterday, I would like to clarify this item.  The Analysys Mason report was sent to us in June 2018.  We had a number of discussions with the Department over June and July and a new pricing for the specific item of dark fibre of &euro;2.60 per metre was agreed with the Department.  It was also agreed that this price would be the maximum price per metre.  In other words, depending on what people are buying off you that price could drop considerably.  It could be down to &euro;1 something or whatever.  It depends.  At that time we were asked to publish this price at the time of publication of the report by the DCCAE.</p><p> I would just like to say that in July, now, in fairness, you have to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, that I can only go on records-----</p></speech>

Analysys Mason is a London-based consultancy.  The DCCAE commissioned them to review whether Enet is operating the MANs in compliance with its obligations under the code of practice in the MANs concession agreements to provide open access to the MANs on an equality of treatment, non-discriminatory and transparent basis.  This report represents the results of the review.  It provides their opinion on the changes that should be made to the way Enet operates the MANs to: improve the transparency of pricing; ensure non-discrimination between ETNL and other Internet service providers; increase separation from ETNL; and encourage further take-up on the MANs.</p> <p>  Enet co-operated with Analysys Mason on their review.  This involved site visits by their team to our Limerick headquarters, interviews with our staff and the sharing of records and data with them.  </p> <p>  The independent report sets out four possible options regarding optimal structure of operation for the MANs.  After thorough review, their chosen option recommends "improved processes, procedures and checks."  For the avoidance of doubt, the report states, at 2.5.5 overall conclusion, "this report shows a range of areas in which enet should improve its adherence to the Code of Practice".  This is stating that Enet is adhering to the code of practice, while suggesting improvements can be made in their opinion.  The 13 recommendations are internal and procedural in nature, and are actually helpful to us as a business trying to continually perfect our delivery of service.</p> <p>  After nearly 15 years operating the assets, it is right and proper that the code of practice and our procedures be reviewed so as to ensure they are still relevant for current market conditions and fit-for-purpose going forward.  The focus of the recommendations is on the improved processes, procedures and checks and relate to physical access, the cost of connection and pricing, and communication and take-up.</p> <p>  We have engaged with the DCCAE in addressing each individual recommendation, and these actions have been implemented or are being implemented in our business currently.  We are always striving to be the best we can be.  It is beneficial for the consultants from outside the business to come in and undertake a review, and give their views on what is good, what needs improvement and what needs to change.  In keeping with best practice, we are working in partnership with Government to make the economic recovery sustainable in parts of the country previously left behind.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify the following in case people listening to the debate or the public do not know who or what we are talking about.

Some of those would have been submissions and some would have been complaints.  One of the entities that we talked to this morning confirmed that it had made submissions.  Some of those issues have been captured in the report.  Predominantly, it would have been to do with pricing and transparency, and also the non-separation of the wholesale and retail business, which were very valid complaints.  Obviously the complaints were picked up in this report because they were valid.  We heard from a number of entities here today.  Two and possibly three of them said that they would have bid had the MANs concessionary contract been openly tendered.</p><p>Enet had a contract with a clause that allowed it to continue.  There was a report by the Department, but it is entirely appropriate for members to ask a question on what happened to the tender process.  There was an expectation that the tender process would have occurred.  We expressed our surprise and disappointment today that this did not happen.</p><p> Does Mr. McCarthy accept that he is operating in a commercial world and in that world, people bid for tenders all the time.  Enet bid for the tender in 2004 and 2009 and some of the rules changed during that time.  Does he accept that there was not a clear-cut relationship between the retail and wholesale entities, which has been picked up?</p></speech>

The first decade of the MANs programme saw significant investment and positive market impact from Enet and the company saw an opportunity to invest further in the asset to ensure that it remained at the heart of a rapidly changing telecoms landscape and to continue to deliver policy benefits for the State.  When Enet approached the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in July 2014, there was less than six years remaining on the phase 1 concession and given our investment plans and the fact that the payback period for infrastructural investment exceeded the remaining life in the concession, we felt it was more than appropriate to commence discussions with the Department.</p></speech>

The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment commissioned an independent report on whether it should re-tender the MANs contract or extend the term of the existing contract, as allowed for in the original contract.  We had a contract that started in 2004 and another in 2009.  Both contracts had a provision for extension.  It is not unusual for large infrastructure projects to have this extension provision and this contract had this extension provision in it.</p> <p>  The Norcontel report completed in June 2016 is unambiguous in its recommendations that the preferred option, based on the analysis, is to extend the current concession agreements.  This report also makes a variety of other conclusions.  The MANs had fulfilled the role for which they were conceived and designed.  The MANs had been successfully operated and managed by the MSC appointed.  The MANs continued to make a financial return to the State, as specified in the concession agreements.  The role and position of the MSC in providing open and transparent access and connectivity is acknowledged and accepted by the service providers that avail of MANs service. </p></speech>

There was one bill that did not differentiate, for example, between different components and whether there were discounts.  We have heard from British Telecom, BT, this morning and we can only test this with companies that are purchasing from Enet whether the contract's terms were fully implemented.  BT will revert to the committee with a note on the aspects it says were not fully implemented.</p> <p>  The purpose of teasing out the service is to ensure the delivery of a cost-effective product to homes and businesses.  There has been a sizeable reduction in the cost.  Enet did not need to wait for this report to be published to reduce prices but it the reduction happens to coincide with the publication of the Analysys Mason report and the Minister's announcement yesterday.  While the report was published last March, Enet saw it in July or August.</p></speech>

We have to look at things in that context and we cannot completely put that to one side.  Maybe if I address the next section of the Deputy's question, which was on inter-company pricing.  Enet is related to a sister company, Enet Telecommunications Networks Limited, ETNL.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019021400002#ZZ01800"><p>No.  I will explain it now.  ETNL was separated from Enet in 2015.  They are two distinct buckets on the Enet side of the house, namely, the MANs business which is Enet, and the wholesale business which is ETNL.  There is a retail business which sits over to one side, which is AirSpeed Telecom.  The MANs were built by the State.  They were merely rings of fibre in rural areas, which were not connected either to buildings or backhaul networks.  A ring of fibre was built in the centre of a town and one basically had ducts with one fibre cable in the ducts.  That is all one had.  It is a dead piece of infrastructure until one lights it up and connects it back through the backhaul network to some sort of termination point, probably in Dublin, where one will get international connectivity.  Without backhaul, the MANs would have been a complete waste of money as local traffic would not have the ability to reach other destinations.  Some &euro;176 million of taxpayers' money would have been wasted.  The State would not be in a position to receive nor would have been in receipt of the financial or policy benefits yielded to date.  Analysys Mason stated in its report that without these backhaul connections, the MANs would be islands of connectivity with limited usefulness.  Enet invested heavily in connecting the MANs to a national network, thereby making them utilisable and allowing regional broadband traffic to terminate in Dublin.  The only party at that time that had that type of backhaul connectively outside of the incumbent Eircom was BT.  By putting in this network, we increased the competition in reaching these areas.  The investment to date has been in excess of &euro;50 million on this infrastructure, outside of the MAN infrastructure.  That investment of &euro;50 million is on top of the &euro;31 million.  Therefore, the Enet group of companies has State owned assets as well as private owned assets.  On this basis, Enet created a company ETNL to hold the non-MAN assets.  This process acts to separate out the concession assets and the non-concession assets so that the State's assets remain easily identifiable at all times.  The company has an inter-company pricing policy between the entities Enet and ETNL.  This inter-company pricing is agreed with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p> <p>  Not having been involved in any of the process prior to October 2018, I went through the records of the business and consulted a great many documents to see what happened in respect of the splitting of the entities, how the pricing worked and how the contracts were constructed.</p><p>I have found that the company has acted in good faith at all times when going to do anything in that it has gone to the Department first and said, "We are thinking of doing this, this is how it is going to look, this is how it will sit, this is the way the contracts will be constructed and this is how we propose to do our pricing".  At all times, we have had that signed off by the Department in advance of making any specific moves, and that includes changing prices and anything else.  </p><p> I have reviewed, in particular, documentation exchanges between the Department and Enet in respect of Enet seeking agreement to set up ETNL and how the relationship between ETNL and Enet would work, the transfer pricing proposals and draft agreements, including Enet acting as agent to customers in order that they have the simplicity of a single bill.  In the case of AT&amp;T, Verizon and some of the large operators, which are trying to connect multinational companies, customers do not want to be dealing with two entities and two bills.  We are trying to provide a simple service and it is clearly documented because if it was not, we would end up with a grey area.  We have gone to great lengths to try to ensure that does not happen.</p><p> Enet did not embark on the process, including the agreement on transfer pricing, without the consent and agreement of the Department.  I am specifically referring to documents between the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, when ETNL was set up, which is important.  I have seen a correspondence chain between the Department and ourselves on that.</p></speech>

Has that been factored into Enet's business model?  The contract will have changed hands and, as Mr. McCarthy identified, there are investors, many of which are pension funds while others are from the IIF.  Will the reduction make a significant difference to Enet's business model?  Does it hope to sell more as a result of reducing the price?  How will it play out?</p></speech>

As I alluded to earlier, the pricing that is put on the website as the published pricing is maximum pricing.  The pricing is coming down, as it has been for a period of time, and the deals have been done accordingly.  Prior to this, the maximum pricing was probably far out of kilter with what we were charging and what the market was willing to pay.  Today, the maximum pricing is much closer to where it should be.</p></speech>

BT seemed to have an issue with the Norcontel report but, as he clearly outlined, it is only natural that it would, given that is Enet's chief competitor and it wants the business.  </p> <p>  On the report about the 50% reduction I received earlier, I wish to clarify that, having met the Department in July 2018, following the publication of the Analysys Mason report, Enet's understanding at the time was that the announcement would be made a few weeks later.

From what I have read, my understanding is that the basic intention of the NBP is to install a network around the country that, hopefully, will provide consistent speeds.  They might not reach 100% but it is hoped that there will be coverage of 95% for customers in, for example, Ballymaloe or counties Galway or Leitrim.  Unless I have missed something during the meeting, there is no better method for delivering that than high-speed fibre-optic cable, which is Enet's business.  While masts, fixed wireless, roaming or nomadic wireless have a place, and perhaps they will fill the residual void, my understanding is that, according to the evidence, the best product to deliver infrastructure for the people is the fixed-line cable.  Am I correct that nothing that beats fibre-optic cable?</p></speech>

There is no question that wireless has a part to play but in most cases, when rolling out wireless, it is being rolled out with fibre connected to it.  Great speeds will be attained by running fibre to the masts.  Over the past year, we have rolled out a lot of fibre.  Wherever people roll out rural broadband, we connect their infrastructure to fibre.</p></speech>

One is all the time trying to build the reach of one's network, much of which is done by me buying a piece from BT, Colt, Eir or whatever it might be.  Eir does not sell very much but the other operators do.</p><p>We are always trying to build our infrastructural reach.  We deal quite a lot with international carriers and they want reach. They want to be able to get to the business communities.  We are very lucky with the MANS in that we are providing unique infrastructure to areas of Ireland.  There is much infrastructure in Dublin but outside of the city the sort of infrastructure we have is unique.  There is also ESBT, which is the telecoms network of the ESB.  That is mainly a backhaul network.  We use pieces of that for connectivity.  It would be the same for Aurora.  It will buy bits from us and we buy bits from it.  We are always trying to strategically build our network.  We are all intertwined.  We have BT as a customer and we also provide some services to BT.  In fact, up until approximately 2014, we had nearly all of our backhaul with BT and then we moved it to CIE.  Up until that point, however, BT would have had a lot of business from us.</p></speech>

This morning we heard about the second phase of the tendering and I want to make sure I understand that.  Many of the questions this morning related to the extension.  I heard Mr. McCarthy explaining it to Deputy Catherine Murphy.  From July 2014, there was less than six years to run on the first phase.  Is that correct?  As a business then, Enet was wondering what it would do in six years.  Is that what Mr. McCarthy was saying?</p></speech>

It really was down to the Department to decide if that was the right to do.

As part of the extension, the Department negotiated changes to the contract.  As the incoming CEO, I can see that is biting and is benefiting the State and not us.

We genuinely welcomed the publication of the Analysys Mason report.  My team is a new one and we are very keen to get off on the right footing here.  We want transparency and we want to work with the officials to make sure we are not back here in 12 months trying to work our way through this again.  It is our plan to take this forward in a transparent and professionally-operated business.  This is a public-private partnership and we are not a regulated body.  This is about us working with the Department to deliver the best the value from this process.  It is a win-win situation.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, the State already received &euro;31 million in assets and &euro;8.8 million in revenue.  Foreign direct investment outside of Dublin is been facilitated by our partnership.  This means jobs in underdeveloped regions, taxes being paid by new companies and their employees and more affordable housing.  People will not have to leave Dublin to work.  This is good for everybody and this is what Enet and the Department are delivering together.  There has been a certain amount of trial and error but we have addressed and are addressing any defects we can identify.  That is the nature of every business and this is a success story for Enet and for the State. </p> <p>  We have to remember we are in a very competitive situation.  While we do not operate a regulatory department or have people who are constantly watching what everybody else is doing and putting stuff out, we are operating in a competitive space.  We are doing the best we can and we are totally focused on our business and driving it out, building our customer base and doing that with professionalism and integrity.  That is what I wanted to say.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy referred to some comments made by the Secretary General of the Department.  He was here before Christmas and I remember that very well.  He cited the Norcontel report.  We will take that up again with the Department and not Mr. McCarthy.  I want to get the facts on the record by asking Mr. McCarthy some questions.  He mentioned the competitive situation.  Where is the competition with MANs?  ENET is the sole monopoly operator of that network.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy is referring to competition to get the best price for customers.  I do not know.  Mr. McCarthy, however, mentioned the competitive situation twice.  There is a contract for ten years so where is the competition?</p></speech>

I did see the opening statement of the CEO of Eir this morning.  This is important.  When we are out in the MANs, we are the only alternative to Eir.  If the MANs was not there then Eir would be in a completely monopolistic situation.  It would also have been very difficult if Eir ever had bid to acquire the MANs because it would have given it a 100% monopoly.</p></speech>

The point made today by Eir was that under the European procurement rules an operator could not provide the service supplied by the Enet.  It had to be independent.

Paragraph 75 (e) of the State aid approval decision of the European Commission addressed to Ireland in respect of the State aid to be provided to Enet under the concession agreements for the Metropolitan Area Networks, phases two and three, states that the State retains ownership of the infrastructure and attributes its management to an independent MSE which cannot act as a retail service provider.

We will raise this matter with the Department, but does Mr. McCarthy have a view on it?  Eir has made it clear to us that, as part of the national broadband plan, the price that the company that wins the contract will pay for use of Eir's physical network for running fibre services will be set by the regulator.  Is that correct?  I am not blaming Enet but it appears that, in the case of the MANs, the regulator has no role in setting Enet's prices.  That is why it has maximum, discounted and reduced prices.  That the MANs are not under the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, when almost everything else is is a matter that we will raise with the Department.  It is just a straight agreement.  Am I right?  That is the impression we were given today.</p></speech>

We also know about the last bit and where Enet is with that, but it would be helpful if Mr. McCarthy would send us the explanation of the "middle mile".  The last topic I want to raise with Mr. McCarthy is the national broadband plan.  This might not take very long.  The national broadband plan was a principal part of Mr. McCarthy's opening statement and Enet is a subcontractor to the bidder, National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  Mr. McCarthy has stated that Granahan McCourt is the main shareholder.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, a State company, also has a significant stake.</p></speech>

At the moment, Enet will be a subcontractor if the national broadband plan, as it currently is, was to go into the preferred bidder stage and move forward.  Enet would be bringing the benefit of the MANs and all of that infrastructure into play.  From that perspective, IIF, and consequently ISIF, would benefit.</p></speech>

I just wanted to clear up that issue.  The last aspect of this matter concerns the national broadband plan.  It started in 2015 with 850,000 houses.  Today, we heard Eir has already taken 300,000  houses out of that original figure because it can do it commercially.  The company has also stated that it is now replacing some of its old network with fibre and that will take another 80,000 houses out of the remaining 540,000.  The total left will then be 460,000 houses.  Mr. McCarthy may not be able to answer my next question.  He can make a comment if he wishes or, if not, we can refer this back to the Department.</p> <p>  This plan is now for 20% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland.  We have had that figure and, between business and domestic, I think it is correct.  The national broadband plan was to cover probably the last 30% or 40% of premises when it started but it is now for the last 20%.  The commercial sector is now dealing with a big chunk of the original 30% or 40%.  Eir made it clear today that if its board approved further investment it could possibly work on a commercial basis to reduce that figure further.  </p> <p>  This committee will be concerned that the contract the Minister may approve - and I am not speculating on whether he will - will be for circumstances that are very different to the situation pertaining when negotiations commenced.  The numbers covered the by national broadband plan could be dramatically reduced.  As time passes, we are hearing that some of the premises currently included in the plan will be removed.  There is no doubt we need the national broadband plan in rural areas but the numbers covered by and scale of this plan seem to be diminishing all of the time.  Is that Mr. McCarthy's understanding?  How is Enet, as a subcontractor, affected by this situation? </p></speech>

Eir stated there were 330,000 premises, so the imaginary figure is now 460,000.  Those will also be hardest places to get to, the most difficult to connect and, I imagine, the places with the least penetration.  I imagine they are the most complex premises to deal with.  Everybody is going to take the low-hanging fruit first.</p></speech>

It was stated that "all existing and planned commercial investment should be taken into consideration prior to any State intervention into a commercial market".  We might advise the Minister to find out what exactly is in any contract before he signs it.  There might be fewer premises included by the time whatever company gets the contract actually gets around to doing the job.  We will have to raise that with the Department.

The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome.  I also welcome his officials and thank them for the briefing supplied in advance of the meeting.  I also thank colleagues from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for accommodating this approach to this meeting.

I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today to discuss the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019.   I also thank them for facilitating me by hosting this session today.  I appreciate the attendance of members of both the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence and the Joint Committee on European Affairs at this session.  I very much appreciate their time and engagement as we bring forward this omnibus Bill to address a range of critical issues that may arise in the context of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  While there are six weeks to go until Brexit formally happens on 29 March, the political process is continuing.  However, as they have done since the decision to leave the EU was first taken, the answers lie with Westminster.  </p> <p>  The EU remains committed to achieving an ambitious and comprehensive future partnership with the UK.  Should the UK's intentions for the future partnership evolve, the EU will adjust the level of ambition of the political declaration on the future relationship.  However, the EU has made it absolutely clear that it stands by the withdrawal agreement, and it is not open for renegotiation.</p> <p>  President Tusk and President Juncker reaffirmed this during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Brussels last week, and they reaffirmed the EU's continued solidarity on the backstop.  The Taoiseach also met Prime Minister May, at her request, in Dublin last Friday.  Throughout, our focus has been on securing the withdrawal agreement which is the best and only way to ensure an orderly and managed withdrawal. </p> <p>  While we have been working to secure agreement, preparations for Brexit and the changes it will bring have been under way since the beginning.  More recently with the impending approach of the Brexit deadline and the uncertainty in London, we have no choice but to ramp up our no-deal preparations.  This Bill is one of the most tangible expressions of the deep and broad preparations that are under way across multiple Government Departments.  Our work at national level is complementary to the significant work under way across the EU to be as prepared as we can possibly be just in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March.  While certain areas of our contingency planning require legislation, many do not and a wide range of other measures are under way such as the recruitment of customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officials, preparations at ports and airports, and a range of financial and advisory supports for businesses to help them to prepare and plan for Brexit. </p> <p>  This omnibus Bill covers the issues in primary legislation that need to be addressed immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  It also contains an amendment to the Interpretation Act which would be needed should the withdrawal agreement be ratified in order to facilitate a transition period.  Measures relevant in the case of a no-deal Brexit were identified following a detailed screening by all Departments of legislation currently in force.  The Government published the general scheme of the omnibus Bill on 24 January.  The Bill contains 16 Parts, addressing primary legislative issues which would require immediate attention in a no-deal scenario. </p> <p>  This is a very wideranging Bill, but given the emergency nature of this legislation, the Government took the decision that progressing this through the Houses as an omnibus Bill is the most sensible way to ensure that we have the necessary legislation enacted on time before 29 March.  This Bill focuses on protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors that are vulnerable.  It will underpin the common travel area and help to ensure that the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this longstanding arrangement will continue in any circumstance.  In the area of health, the Bill will provide for a range of existing reciprocal healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the UK to be maintained after the UK leaves the EU.  The Minister for Health will be provided with the power to make regulations in a number of matters, including to enable persons from Ireland to access healthcare in the UK.  In a practical sense what we are trying to protect is the ability of young children to come from Belfast to Dublin for specialist paediatric care, the many patients in Donegal who go across the Border to Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry where Irish taxpayers' money has helped to put some of the infrastructure in place, and so on.  We have particularly during the past 20 years found a way to co-operate in a pragmatic and friendly way to make the best of the infrastructure on both sides of the Border from a healthcare perspective, and we want to continue to do that, even when Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom is outside the European Union.</p> <p>  The Bill will also provide for the continued payment of 21 social protection benefits, including payments such as old age pensions, illness benefit and child benefit, in any circumstance.  It also provides protection for workers whose UK-based employer might become insolvent.  Currently, all these issues, essentially, are protected under EU regulations, derogations or directives.  Many of us will know British citizens living in Ireland who get pension payments from the UK every week or every month.  Certainly, many of us will know many Irish citizens living in the UK who continue to get their pensions from here.  Likewise, there are parents who get child benefit payments and so on across the Border or between Britain and Ireland.  It does not naturally follow that those payments remain intact in a no-deal Brexit scenario unless we plan for that.  </p> <p>  We are doing two things.  First, we are signing an agreement between Ireland and the UK to protect social protection payments but we are also putting primary legislation in place to make sure we can make that seamless transition, if we face this cliff edge at the end of March where Britain essentially crashes out of the European Union without a managed exit and all of the arrangements that should be in place for that.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the Bill will allow for Student University Support Ireland, SUSI, grants to be paid to eligible Irish students studying in the UK, as well as to UK students in Irish higher education institutions.  I am a beneficiary of this, as I went to university in the UK and the British taxpayer paid for some of my education.  There are many British students in Irish third level institutions, and they are more than welcome here.</p><p>We do not want to turn this into a situation whereby Irish students in the UK and UK students in Ireland would be obliged to pay foreign student fees.  We certainly do not want a situation where we cannot support through student grants young Irish students going to colleges and universities in future, as we do today.  Again, it requires practical legislation in education to protect that arrangement in the context of a no-deal Brexit, should that happen.  I am of the view that such an eventuality unlikely but we must plan for it.</p><p> On provisions in transport, we must see to it that cross-Border bus and rail services continue to operate thereby ensuring continued service provision for passengers and commuters on the island of Ireland.  One would assume that getting on a train in Dublin and alighting in Belfast would be a fairly straightforward process.  After Brexit, however, that train will leave the European Union, travel to a third country and then return.  These are things that we do not think about but which require a legal base in areas such as the recognition of drivers and various other matters, including those relating to safety provision and certification.  A similar situation arises in relation to bus journeys.  We need to plan for, and in this case legislate for, many things that nobody thought about when they voted for or against Brexit.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland will be given additional enabling power to further support businesses through investment, loans and research and development and investment grants so as to assist Irish businesses in remaining competitive and resilient in the context of a no-deal Brexit context.  This is one of the only areas in which legislation was likely to be brought forward in any event because Enterprise Ireland has sought this increased power.  However, it makes sense to take this element out of the larger Bill we plan to take at some stage in the coming 12 months and put it into this legislation in order that we maximise the capacity for Enterprise Ireland to be able to support businesses, particularly in vulnerable sectors through what will be a very difficult transition for many of them in the event of a no deal Brexit materialising.</p><p> Since the publication of the general scheme of the omnibus Bill, intensive work has been underway between Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.  On the basis of this work, there have been some updates and amendments to the draft Bill.   These include new provisions which will introduce postponed accounting for VAT purposes in a no-deal scenario.  This will mitigate against a potential cashflow burden faced by businesses post Brexit.  This issue was highlighted by industry, and this is a practical measure which will support businesses.  Put simply, we are helping businesses with cashflow.  Unfortunately, because of new trading relationships on the back of a no-deal Brexit, businesses that import and export products back and forth from the UK on a weekly or daily basis will have to pay VAT on each consignment in future unless we legislate to facilitate better arrangements.  Currently, businesses pay VAT every second month.  In that kind of environment, we are legislating to ensure that businesses can continue to calculate their VAT and, from a cashflow perspective, pay every second month rather than on the delivery of every individual consignment that may have to go through customs checks, SPS checks and so on, especially in the context of east-west trade, whether that comes through Dublin Port, Dublin Airport or Rosslare.</p><p> Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the original Part 16 of the draft Bill, which contained amendments to the Data Protection Act, will now be covered by statutory instrument.  Similarly, certain health provisions which were in the original draft Bill will be provided for through secondary legislation.  That is good news because it simplifies the arrangements.</p><p> While this Bill covers a range of areas, it is very much operational legislation to allow for many of our current arrangements with the UK to continue to function after it leaves the EU and becomes a third country.  The Government has discussed this proposed legislation during its meetings in January and February.  Its provisions are the subject of daily engagements between Departments and Parliamentary Counsel.</p><p> We expect to publish the full single omnibus Bill on 22 February and we will continue to work closely with the Business Committee to confirm timelines.  We propose to bring the legislation to Cabinet on Tuesday where it will be signed off by the Government.  As a complicated piece of legislation, it will then go back to the relevant Departments for a final check to ensure that it is correct and then it will be published.  It will be published on time, as we said we would, next Friday, 22 February.  I am happy to brief Opposition parties before next Friday before we publish the Bill to ensure that there will be no surprises and that everyone will understand what is coming.  We must work together in respect of the legislation.</p><p> Once published, the Bill will go before the D&aacute;il for Second Stage between 26 and 28 February; it will undergo Committee and Report Stages between 4 and 8 March.  We want to do this via a committee of the House.  Originally, we thought we would try to do it through this committee or combined committees.  However, having spoken to all the political parties, there is a view that this legislation is important enough to bring it through a committee of the House so that no one will be excluded.  As a result of this, no one will be required to be a committee member in order to contribute to the debates.  Anyone in the House will be able to speak, ask questions and secure clarification.  This will also allow us to bring in Ministers to take the sections of the legislation that apply to their Departments.  There are nine Departments, including the Department of An Taoiseach, to which sections of the Bill relate.  In the context of matters of education, the Minister, Deputy McHugh, will come before the House to answer questions and deal with any amendments that are relevant to his section.  Similarly, the Minister of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, can deal with anything related to her area, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan can deal with anything relating to his brief and so on.</p><p> If all goes well, the Bill will be send for Second Stage debate in the Seanad on 11 and 12 March.  That will be followed by Committee and Report Stage in the Seanad on 13 and 14 March.  Many Ministers will be away in the build up to St. Patrick's Day but I will not be, or, rather, I will be away for part of this week but I will be around for the legislation.  I will be visiting European capitals for obvious reasons.  That is the timeline on which we hope the committee can work with us.  Members will find me absolutely open in the context of briefings, reassurance and clarifications and any amendments they may wish to test.  We can do it offline or online as they wish.</p><p> The country is in an emergency situation and this is emergency legislation.  We need to get it done together in order to protect Irish people, whether pensioners, students or members of the travelling public.  We can get it done in the timeline I have outlined.  To date, engagement with other political parties has been very positive.  There is nothing party political in what we are doing and we will work in a very constructive way with everyone on this process.</p><p> This legislation is an essential part of our whole-of-Government preparations for Brexit.  Our contingency action plan was published on 19 December and an update was published on 30 January.  I will continue to provide such updates.  I appreciate the co-operation of all Members of the Houses and their assistance and co-operation in ensuring that we will be able to get this Bill - should it be needed - through the various Stages and enact it by 29 March.  I hope that the Bill will not be needed, nor do not think that it will be.  However, we cannot be sure and we would be foolish to take anything for granted in light of the unpredictable nature of the Brexit negotiations to date.</p><p> The potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland would be severe.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, recently outlined the potential macroeconomic impacts, and there would be negative impacts across a number of vulnerable sectors.  Our preparations, including through our legislative proposals, are focused on minimising these impacts and protecting as many people and sectors as possible.</p><p>Ireland will remain an active and enthusiastic member of the EU.  The Government is committed to working with the European Commission and our EU partners to minimise any disruption for our citizens and businesses and to forge a continuing positive relationship among the EU 27.  Of course, we also wish to maintain a positive relationship with the UK, which is of great importance to me and the country in general.  However, we will not follow the UK away from the European Union.  Rather, we will remain a committed and enthusiastic member of the European Union, the Single Market and the customs union.</p><p> I thank the Chair and members for allowing me to outline some aspects of our legislative planning.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

I was struck by the suggestion of the BBC radio presenter interviewing the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, that Ireland would leave the EU and rejoin the UK.  It was just another example of a lack of knowledge about and appreciation of Irish history.</p><p>On what basis does the T&aacute;naiste think this legislation will not be necessary?  The EU has been strong on Irish interests, but there is much talk about holding one's nerve and who will blink first.  Is he fully confident that the EU will not blink first, particularly in the context of certain trade matters?  An article published in <i>The Guardian</i>put forward the view that Prime Minister May wants to deliver the least worst Brexit for her country, that she wishes to do so as part of the Tory Government and that she is determined to avoid a no-deal scenario but will not be able to do so with only the support she has had to date and that of the DUP.  Rather, she will require support from the Opposition.  How confident is the T&aacute;naiste that she will receive such support?</p></speech>

I and my party will do everything we can to help to scrutinise and progress the legislation if necessary.  There are only 14 sitting days between now and 29 March, which shows that time is tight.  We are somewhat concerned that we still await publication of the detail of the legislation and that it is running down to the wire.  In terms of preparedness in other European countries, the Netherlands published legislation in November, France triggered its contingency plan on 17 January, Spain approved its plan on 11 January and Italy announced legislation on 21 December.  Draft legislation has been published in Poland and legislation is before the parliaments of Germany and the Czech Republic.  We are a little behind the curve.  The Oireachtas may require extra sitting days between now and 29 March.</p> <p>  I wish to flag certain specific issues to the T&aacute;naiste.  He may not be able to address them today but I wish to make him aware of them.  He will be aware of the recent AIB Brexit sentiment survey which revealed that only 8% of SMEs surveyed had a formal Brexit plan in place in quarter 4 of 2018.  The T&aacute;naiste will indicate that the Government has been engaging with industry and SMEs on an ongoing basis, but it is very worrying that only 8% of SMEs have plans in place.  That is backed up by take-up of the various funds that were put in place.  Only 5% of the &euro;300 million set aside for the Brexit loan scheme has been sanctioned to date and the Brexit loan scheme for farmers and fishermen announced in October and to which &euro;25 million was allocated is still not open.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to update us in that regard and provide an overview of contingency planning at that level because some of the figures that are emerging, particularly from the AIB sentiment survey, are quite depressing.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to education and SUSI grants.  While the clarity regarding SUSI grants will be welcome, as is the fact that the arrangements will continue, will that be the case for the remainder of current students' courses or will it continue into the foreseeable future?  Is there any clarity on the fees to which Irish students who choose to study in the UK will be subject, particularly from the 2021 academic year onward?</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will be familiar with many companies in the medtech sector.  Some are based in Cork and others in the mid west, with Galway a particularly popular location.  The EU estimates that between 30% and 40% of medical devices in use and demand are approved through UK designated notifying bodies.  I have been informed by members of the medtech sector that the UK-based notifying bodies will no longer be recognised by the EU after 29 March and that certified devices will no longer be in conformity with the EU directive.  A significant problem may arise in that regard.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of that potential issue?  Is it being worked on?  It will have a sharp impact if we the calamitous event we are all trying to avoid comes to pass on 29 March.</p> <p>  A report published today by Reuters, a relatively reputable news agency, quotes sources in Brussels as stating that the Government may get a transition period or some temporary opt outs to avoid putting up a hard Border, and that it will soon be required to come up with a plan to protect the EU Single Market or face checks on Irish goods entering the remainder of the EU bloc.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste has seen or been made aware of that report.  Given the possibility of a no-deal Brexit because of opposition to the backstop in Westminster, has the Government considered or been asked to come up with an alternative to the backstop?  Has the Government been asked through the back channels to come up with an alternative to the backstop or has it had any discussions on an alternative plan for the Border?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019021400002#C00700"><p>On why I think the legislation will not be needed, we will need to get it ready to be enacted.  However, I am of the view that a strong majority of MPs in Westminster do not want a no-deal Brexit and will act to avoid it, although I cannot be sure that will be the case.  The reality is that any sane individual who looks at the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for Britain and Ireland in particular, as the two countries that would be damaged the most, as well as many other EU countries, would try to avoid it.  A no-deal Brexit is unlikely, but it is possible.  I believe we will find a way to prevent it.  I hope the British Parliament can find a way to so do because, essentially, the problem is there, not here.  The British Government signed up to a deal which took all perspectives into account, had taken two years to negotiate and involved compromise by all sides.  The British Prime Minister defended it and, in my view, still believes in it.  However, because of the political pressures and realities in Westminster, she has been forced to move in a different direction.  The responsibility to come up with ways to solve the current impasse lie where the impasse is, which is London and not Brussels, Dublin, Belfast or anywhere else.</p><p>I believe a way can be found, but the only thing the Irish Government can do is continue to be respectful but firm and fair.  It is not reasonable to ask Ireland to essentially undermine core commitments that were made to Ireland, North and South, to protect the peace process and guarantee the absence of Border infrastructure.  Those guarantees were not time-limited and did not come with exit clauses.  They were guarantees.  By the way, the British Prime Minister repeated them last week, when she gave what I would regard as a quite generous speech in Northern Ireland.  The problem here is politics.  There is a fair deal on the table but there are some who want more, who seem to want to change the current deal to take out compromises that the UK has been asked to make but insist that the EU maintains all the compromises it was willing to make.  One cannot negotiate on that basis and I do not believe the EU will negotiate on that basis.  That is why I do not believe the withdrawal agreement will be reopened.  Of course the EU will act and try to put together a package that will give reassurance and clarification to the British Parliament.  We all need to work to try to do that.  There is a lot of scope in the political declaration, which is of course open to discussion and change.  That is a political ambition for the future.  It is not a legal divorce agreement, which is what the withdrawal agreement is.  <br/><br/><b></b>I am not comfortable with the language of a game of chicken or a question of who will blink first.  We are all neighbours and friends here.  One of the things that is so uncomfortable about this negotiation is the pressure that has been put on the Parliament in Westminster, and indeed the Government and Parliament here and in other parts of Europe.  I refer to lobbying, undermining of people's positions and so on.  Britain is a very close friend of Ireland.  We are close neighbours with a very complicated and tragic history.  We have to find a way through this and out the other side that does not damage that relationship and provoke tensions many people thought we had left behind.  I ask people to think about that when they talk about playing games of chicken.  That applies on both sides.  One of the big mistakes made in London is the perspective that the EU needs a deal as much as we need a deal.  First and foremost that is factually not true.  However we do want a deal.  When I say &quot;we&quot; I am talking about the EU.  We want to be reasonable and fair about that.  We want a future relationship with Britain which is positive, whereby there are not winners and losers in these negotiations.  We want to find a compromise to move this process forward in a way that respects that relationship.<br/><br/>In regard to Opposition support, I have been critical of the party in government in Westminster but also the party of opposition.  Compare it to what is happening in our Parliament.  We have been working with the main Opposition party and with Sinn F&eacute;in, parties that are in intense competition at election time and do not agree with each other's political approaches and perspectives in lots of areas.  By and large people are willing to work together on this issue and try to find a way forward.  It is regrettable that this kind of approach has not been possible, even now with 43 days to go.  We still do not have a proper formal dialogue between the two main parties in the British Parliament.  I say that as somebody who spent a lot of my life in England and is a product of the Anglo-Irish relationship.  A lot of my family on my mother's side have British passports.  I was in university there.  I worked in Scotland.  Britain is a great country, but we have to call it as it is.  It is incredible, in my view, that the British Parliament has allowed it to come to this.  That being said, I still believe there is a way to get through this process and have a managed, controlled and predictable Brexit.  We have the basis for the deal.  It is there, if people would just take it rather than trying to look for more all the time.  Instead of trying to compromise with hardliners on both sides, if middle-ground sensible thinking took control of this process I think we would find a solution a lot more quickly. <br/><br/>Deputy Collins asked about the 14 remaining sitting days.  We can get this done.  The reason the Netherlands, France, Spain and others either have legislation in train or have passed legislation is that they have done it very differently from us.  Their legislation is much more straightforward.  In some cases they are essentially giving the Government powers to act by decree.  In other words, they are giving emergency powers to a Minister or Ministers in certain sectors.  We are not really doing that.  We are actually passing more detailed legislation which primarily provides for the protection of a common travel area between Britain and Ireland, whereby British and Irish citizens are essentially almost recognised as citizens of each other's countries.  In multiple areas we have much more comprehensive legislation than most other countries that passed short and punchy emergency legislation.  Because ours is a much bigger piece of legislation, passing it weeks or months ago without knowing that we really needed to do so would have taken up an awful lot of parliamentary time and would have been unnecessary.  However, we need to do it now. <br/><br/>On the Brexit sentiment survey I note that lots of surveys have taken place.  The one thing we know for sure from speaking to Irish agencies like local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, or the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is that there has been a dramatic increase in awareness of Brexit issues over the past six to 12 months.  I am sorry, but I just do not believe anybody who tells me that businesses are not talking about Brexit right now.  It may be the case that the percentage of businesses with a formal Brexit plan is not high enough.  That is true.  However, many businesses simply do not know what kind of plan they need to put in place because they do not know what Brexit is going to look like.  That is also the truth.  Just because a business does not have a formal Brexit plan does not mean it has not put contingencies in place for different scenarios.<br/><br/>In regard to the Brexit loan scheme, we never expected a huge uptake of that scheme until Brexit actually crystallised.  For example, if a company knows it will have to significantly invest in increased storage if Brexit goes the wrong way because it cannot rely on the just-in-time economic model that goes with the Single Market and the customs union, but it will have to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of euros to do that, it will not trigger that decision until it actually knows it needs to.  Those Brexit loan schemes are important.  There has been quite significant uptake of previous Brexit schemes for farmers.  I think people are holding back from the current &euro;300 million loan scheme until they get more clarity on what they need to do. <br/><br/>In regard to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants, the legislation initially deals with 2019 but the intention is to renew it year after year.  The key thing is that we will have the base legislation to facilitate that.  This Government has no intention of removing the supports for young Irish students going to college in the UK. <br/><br/>This is a huge issue for the medtech sector.  The truth is that medicines and a lot of medical devices are authorised and approved for the EU market in the UK.  That authorisation is not likely to be available in the UK any longer.  Businesses will essentially have to reshape their supply chains - where they get authorisation, where they take product and where they finish product - in order to get authorisation.</p><p>It also needs to be taken into account in the supply of medicines, in terms of where and how we will source them.  The European Medicines Agency has signed off on all of the medicines produced and approved in the UK, where it is a significant industry.  That certification may no longer be available in the UK, therefore, these supply chains will need to change.  A huge amount of contingency planning has been done in the medicines, medtech and pharmaceutical sectors generally.  Last night, I was at a Brexit meeting where I spoke to two pharmaceutical companies afterwards.  They have been planning for this for two years.  Six months ago, they signed off on assuming the worst.  Much of the money has already been spent in terms of reshaping supply chains because companies cannot wait for political decisions given the time it takes to implement new plans.  A significant opportunity has already been lost even if Brexit becomes a more controlled and managed process than it is threatening to be.</p><p> I am wary of Brussels sources, quite frankly.  Every day, I hear rumours about Brexit coming out of Brussels just like I hear rumours coming out of London.  Unless there is a name behind a source and a quote I am pretty suspicious of it.  There is a lot of spin, manoeuvring and politics on this issue.  We continue to talk all the time to the European Commission on contingency planning, where the EU must make decisions collectively and where Ireland has responsibility to make decisions.  The sensitivity of the Border issue in Ireland is understood in the European Commission.  As far as I am concerned, the British Government has made a commitment to Ireland not to make decisions that would result in physical Border infrastructure re-emerging between the two jurisdictions on the island and it has an obligation to follow through on this commitment.  As countries we are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of its text and spirit.  This is why the backstop emerged as the compromise solution.  Deal or no deal, there is an obligation on the Irish and British Governments and the EU to try to work together to find a way to avoid physical Border infrastructure on this island.  We have been very clear and firm on this and will continue to be so.</p></speech>

I have read the general scheme of its provisions and I am somewhat acquainted with what it hopes to achieve.  Whatever we can do to support the passage of the Bill we will do.  I concur with Teachta Collins that it would have been better if the Bill had been published earlier.  The Minister spoke about the Bill going to the Cabinet next Tuesday, being published the following week and going before the D&aacute;il at the end of the month.  This means it is three or four weeks before D-day.  It would have been better to have had more time.  The Minister appreciates it is a comprehensive Bill that will cover nine Departments.  Spokespersons for these respective portfolios will want to have an input.  Notwithstanding this, whatever support we can give the Bill we will do so to ensure it is passed because we need to plan for every eventuality.</p> <p>  I want to make a point on the general politics.  The Minister is right to point out there is an agreed and consistent Irish position from the Government and the Opposition on this issue.  I have been in Westminster several times in recent months and have met political parties, politicians and media.  The commentariat in Britain is struck by the level of unity that exists in Ireland in comparison with the disunity in Westminster.  It is quite striking to them and it is to our benefit that we have it.  I want to point out it is not just in the South but also in the North, with the exception of the DUP, where the other parties have been united and have done a lot of collaborative work on supporting the backstop and having meetings in Brussels and Westminster.  This has been for the good.</p> <p>  With regard to the politics, and to bring it back to the Bill, the Minister is right to say the solution to any problem should come from the people creating the impasse, which is the British Government.  It is reneging on a deal that was already done.  The Minister is right that we must watch our language and temper what we say because we do not want to end up, by accident or design, in a situation where we have a hard crash.  If we arrive at a hard crash it will not be the fault of any politician in Ireland and that is for sure.  If we arrive at a situation where there is a hard crash, and however unlikely people think that might be it is still a possibility, tough decisions would then have to be made and action would have to be taken by the Irish Government on the Border.  All of the other provisions in the Bill are all very necessary and important but what happens at the Border in the event of a hard crash is the elephant in the room.  I have heard the Minister say previously why he cannot answer this question but it is the question being asked.  As the Minister knows, a very important event took place in Belfast at the Waterfront with 1,700 people from throughout civic nationalism, where very real concern was expressed about what will happen in that scenario and the lack of clarity on it coming from the Irish Government.  It is something that is lacking.  It is the biggest contingency that will have to be put in place but it is not at all covered in the Bill.</p></speech>

In a no-deal scenario my point is the biggest contingency we will have to deal with is what happens at the Border.</p> <p>  With regard to the process, I welcome the fact that the Minister is making himself available for briefings.  It might be useful if other Ministers make themselves available to spokespersons with regard to their respective sections of the Bill.  This might be necessary.  It depends on the depth of the provisions and we will wait to see what is in the Bill when we get it.  It seems that it will be substantial in some areas, which is good.</p> <p>  With regard to the provisions in the Bill relevant to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Bill speaks about further support for businesses, loans and research and development, all of which is good.  It could be argued that it is necessary whether there is a soft or hard Brexit.  IBEC and ISME have been calling for these provisions.  There will be an economic impact regardless of whether or not it is a hard crash.  Why is it only in the event of a hard crash that we would put in place these additional resources?  Something that is not covered, which I have heard raised at meetings of the transport committee, is the insurance green card.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to answer questions on it.  It has also been raised in the national media.  Concern has been expressed about why it is not covered in the Bill.  Is it something that will be covered somewhere else?  How will the Government deal with the issue?</p> <p>  Will some of the provisions of the Bill require additional spending?  If so, will the Minister identify from where the additional money will come and in what areas additional spending will be incurred?</p><p>While it is a given that investment will have to be made by the Irish State, what is coming through from the stakeholders I have met, such as the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, business groups and trade unions, is that Europe also needs to step up to the plate in respect of funding streams and easing state aid rules.  Where is that in the context of this Bill?  Is it being looked at separately with the European Union?  What responses will be required of Europe in the event of a hard crash?  I will leave it at that.  Obviously Sinn F&eacute;in will critique and support some elements of the Bill.  There will be amendments but we will leave that until later.  We are not going to go into any criticisms or critiques now beyond what I have said.  I look forward to the publication of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Working Group of Committee Chairmen had another comprehensive briefing yesterday.  I definitely sense full support from all committee Chairs in all parties to get this through in time.  Deputy Cullinane is right to remark on the unity in the Irish political process, but we cannot leave out the clear unity in the European political process.  It is a serious achievement to see 27 member states and the most powerful supranational institution in the world maintaining unity in the face of absolute chaos in Westminster.</p> <p>  Parallel to this Bill, the Commission produced its 19 legislative proposals on 19 December.  What is the process of transposing them into Irish law?  Is it under way or is it done through this Bill?  The T&aacute;naiste rightly says that it is immensely regrettable that we are even having to look at the heads of this Bill or have briefings.  It is regrettable that it has come to this, and that regret is in no way the fault of the Irish Government or any European government.  It lies with the confusion in Westminster.  How much time has been taken up preparing this Bill and the crash-out measures on the Irish side?  It is absolutely necessary given that we are less than 50 days away from Brexit, but it is an awful lot of very valuable time from very skilled individuals, particularly in our diplomatic corps, that could be put to better national use.  I hope very much we do not have to use it but I regret that we have had possibly to waste so much time on something that is not in our control.</p></speech>

I am comfortable that we can do this in time.  If we introduce emergency legislation, it needs to be reasonably close to the emergency.  If we had been doing this in November or December, it would have taken up a huge amount of parliamentary time.  Many people might have predicted at that stage that we would have a lot more clarity by now.  With the co-operation of others, I think we can get this done.  The amount of legislation the UK will have to introduce in a no-deal scenario, or indeed even if there is a transition period agreed, is considerable.  Even if the withdrawal agreement were signed off on in the morning, there would be a considerable number of weeks' work required in the British Parliament to bring in legislation.</p> <p>  On some of the bilateral arrangements around the common travel area and so on, we have worked very well with the British Government on trying to protect some core issues such as the Good Friday Agreement and all its complexity in the context of Brexit, the common travel area, cross-border healthcare and students.  Without reciprocal arrangements on the British side, we would not be able to solve problems here.  It is important to say that.  While there is a lot of frustration across the EU and especially in Ireland that the Brexit issues do not have more clarity, in terms of some of this contingency planning there has been good co-operation.</p> <p>  On no-deal planning, if there is a no-deal and Britain crashes out, Ireland, Britain and the EU will have a very difficult job to manage the consequences in the context of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Our view has always been that if there are no agreed solutions, the default position is regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the areas necessary to prevent physical border infrastructure, for good reason.  That was agreed in December 2017, long before the withdrawal agreement was signed off.  It was agreed that we would resolve the border issues through one of three ways.  The first of these was a comprehensive future relationship and trade deal.  If that was not possible, the UK would offer bespoke solutions to Ireland to solve this problem, presumably in the shape of some form of technology or other ideas.  If there was no agreement on the capacity of that bespoke solution to do the job, the commitment was very clear in writing that the UK would maintain full alignment with the rules of the customs union and Single Market in the areas necessary to prevent border infrastructure and protect the peace agreement.  That commitment was given in return for the EU and Ireland allowing the process to move on to talk about the future relationship, which had not really been discussed at that point.  As far as I am concerned, those commitments still stand.</p> <p>  We cannot just wipe the slate clean and have people making farcical arguments along the lines of "we do not want a border, you do not want a border, the EU does not want a border so let's just pretend it is not a problem".  That is kindergarten stuff.  To be fair to the Prime Minister, I think she has faced down that kind of thinking.  There needs to be a legally sound, practical solution here.  If there are alternatives to the backstop, they should be explored and tested.  They have been, for two years.  The best solution that people could come up with in terms of a guarantee, fallback or insurance mechanism was the backstop.  Even in the withdrawal agreement and the future relationship declaration, there is a mention of alternative arrangements.  There is mention of the fact that the backstop is a temporary arrangement that can be replaced by alternative arrangements but they have to do the same job.  We need to be honest with people.  I have yet to see another approach that can do the same job unless we have a future relationship agreement and trading arrangement that is so comprehensive it does not require border infrastructure.  We will continue to try to work in a constructive way on that issue.</p> <p>  Ministers will be available for briefing.  We will probably bring Ministers in individually for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il so they can deal with their sections and take questions, potential amendments and so on.  If they cannot be there, we can make sure they can provide briefings separately and I will take the legislation for them in the D&aacute;il.  I expect that the Ministers will be there.  On the Enterprise Ireland issues, as I said, Enterprise Ireland wants these powers anyway.  We have essentially plucked this element out of an industrial and commercial Bill and put it in the omnibus legislation because we want it done quickly so Enterprise Ireland has the maximum flexibility in terms of offering loans and support to businesses in some of the sectors that would be under a lot of strain if there was a no-deal Brexit.  That is the only legislation that we would be introducing anyway but we would not be introducing it by the end of March.  It would probably be a year or so away.</p> <p>  We cannot legislate for the insurance green card issue because it is an EU competence.  I will read the note on that to put it on record.  Currently, all Irish motor vehicles travelling within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU's motor insurance directive.  This allows motor vehicles to travel freely between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain as well as across other EU countries.  Should a no-deal Brexit occur, the UK, including Northern Ireland, will no longer be party to the motor insurance directive.</p><p>The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland has published advice for policyholders on when and how to get a green card, if needed, in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  Green cards provide proof of insurance and are part of an older system that pre-dates the European Union.  Citizens driving their Irish registered vehicles in Northern Ireland or any other part of the United Kingdom will be required to carry a green card to prove that they have motor insurance.  It is not that they will be stopped and asked for it, but if they are stopped, it is proof of insurance that will be accepted across the Border.  The green card system does not affect motorists' cover.  Where they are currently covered to drive in the United Kingdom, they will remain so under their policy.</p></speech>

We cannot do our own thing.  We have spoken to the Commission about it because the European Union could put in place a reciprocal arrangement with the United Kingdom, as it has done on a temporary basis for hauliers, for example, in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  However, from a contingency point of view, the insurance industry is doing the right thing just in case to ensure people will be able to continue to drive.  There are hundreds of thousands of crossings of the Border every day.</p> <p>  On the cost of the Bill, to be honest Brexit is costing the country hundreds of millions in working capital facilities, loan facilities, upgrading the ports in Dublin and Rosslare, supports and incentives.  This is not without a cost of time, money and political distraction.  We would be doing many other things if I did not have to fill virtually half of every day with Brexit issues.  However, that is the reality.  This is not an Irish policy and not something we like or support.  It is something our neighbours have chosen to do.  We must respect that and I am very strong on it.  Any country has the right to leave the European Union if it wishes, but I would like to think we have the type of relationship with the United Kingdom where it will follow through on the commitments it made to us in the context of its decisions.</p> <p>  On state aid rules, we have spoken to the Commission about relaxing them, if necessary.  We have also spoken to it about protecting vulnerable sectors, particularly agriculture and fishing, through a combination of a relaxation of state aid rules and EU supports.  We are fortunate that an Irish Commissioner has the agriculture brief in the Commission.  That is not because he is in any way biased towards Ireland but because he understands the Irish agriculture industry and how vulnerable it will be in a no-deal Brexit should we have to trade with the United Kingdom on WTO terms, including tariffs and so forth.  The impact that would have on the beef and dairy sectors would be very significant and we must respond to it.  I believe the European Union will respond to it with the appropriate solidarity.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the response on the easing of state aid rules and supports for the agrifood business from the European Union.  That would be very useful.  On costings, of course, Brexit is costing us.  To be fair, however, if the Opposition brought forward a Bill, the first thing we would be asked is how much would it cost.  As we are going to be asked to support this Bill, it is fair and reasonable to ask how much it will cost and from where the money will come.  We can deal with that issue on Second Stage, but it could be dealt with today if the Minister has the figures.  That would be useful.</p></speech>

We simply do not know.  The Bill is primarily about the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>in being able to continue to give grants to students, facilitate travel, healthcare and so forth.  In fact, the absence of this legislation would involve an increased cost too, for example, if we could not use Altnagelvin Area Hospital.  It works both ways.  Much will depend on what Enterprise Ireland does and the amount of money it has available to it.  We can come up with an estimate, but most of the elements of the legislation do not have a significant financial cost attached to them.  They are about protecting in law what has been facilitated until now by joint EU membership.  However, there are other areas that could be very expensive in providing support packages for vulnerable sectors.  That is why we are lucky we have set aside a rainy day fund.  It is a significant fund which, if necessary, we could use in an emergency.  That is the reason a supplementary budget will not be required.</p></speech>

Most will either take direct effect or we will cater for them in the statutory instruments we are introducing.  There is no issue of delay.  Most are changing EU law or making an exception to EU law on a temporary basis.  Most of the contingency solutions coming from the Commission are only temporary until the end of the year.  Incidentally, if anybody thinks a no-deal Brexit can hold onto the contingency measures being introduced temporarily by the European Union forever, the idea of a managed no-deal Brexit is a fantasy.  There will be a temporary set of contingency plans in place to facilitate basic movement and so forth, but there will be a need for the negotiation of a more permanent arrangement.  In a no-deal Brexit scenario those negotiations would be very difficult.</p></speech>

I commend the work he, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and all of the officials have been doing so far.  It is great that the work commenced right after the referendum.  They set to work to have us as ready as possible for something so unknown.  The potential impact of a no-deal Brexit is very severe.  The legislation is welcome to protect workers and students, including many Irish students, and to continue co-operation in the health sector across the Border.  There is a logistical or practical matter that worries me.  Should there be the scenario we all dread on 29 March, what will happen in practical terms at midnight or the following morning in the protection of workers or students?  If the Bill is passed, as I hope it will be, will it continue flawlessly, as it were?  I agree that the Bill should be brought through a committee of the Houses and it is welcome that all Members will have a chance to have their say on it in order that there will be a whole-of-government and Oireachtas approach.  In so far as I can say, as Whip, the Minister will have the support of the Seanad in that regard.  However, I would appreciate it if he could give us an idea of the practicalities involved.</p></speech>

I am a member of the other committee and glad to have the opportunity to be here.  </p> <p>  I agree with the strategy, as I strongly believe it would be inappropriate to bring forward the contingency legislation in this country too soon.</p><p>Its existence at too early a stage could undermine any bargaining position and examination of alternatives and would facilitate a concentration on the no-deal, all out, Brexit we are ultimately trying to avoid.  The strategy is correct and has been hugely important.  I am sure it has been important to the T&aacute;naiste.  Unity among all parties on the island of Ireland is important in response to the proposal for a simple and good reason.  It is not only for the purposes of unity, it also stems from the fact that there was no alternative on the island of Ireland for the business sector, the political fraternity and everybody engaged in trade.  The options were limited and the only option we could in any way continue as best we could after the separation of our next-door neighbour from the European Union would be on the basis maintained by the T&aacute;naiste, the Government and the Opposition parties, for which we should be grateful.</p><p> We should be equally grateful for the unity illustrated by our European colleagues, particularly the negotiators, without whose single-mindedness of purpose the process would have collapsed a long time ago.  They are all to be congratulated for the way they have understood the Irish position, how they have maintained their position and how they have kept the European Union and its objectives in mind from start to finish.  That is important and I hope it will continue.</p><p> I have two questions.  It is envisaged that the common travel area can be to made work after Brexit, whether it is a crash out or whatever form it will take.  Can any comparisons be made with the excise union on the island of Ireland, with a view to extending the latitude identified in the common travel area?</p><p> Given the massive interdependence north and south of the island of Ireland in the business, commercial, export and import sectors, is it envisaged that dialogue and contact can be maintained with our colleagues in Northern Ireland throughout the next six months, or more, or whatever length of time it takes?  Can a means be found to have a consultation and dialogue with political and business representatives in Northern Ireland, given the fact that we share the island, have common concerns and positions and, particularly, that in Northern Ireland a majority did not vote to leave the European Union.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of our diplomats in Europe who, as the T&aacute;naiste said, have put a huge amount of work and effort in the past few years.</p> <p>  I will take up the point made by Deputy Cullinane about the EU motor insurance directive.  It will come as a surprise to many motorists that obligations will be placed on them in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit both for Irish motorists in the United Kingdom and British motorists coming here.  The Government will need to be proactive and put some pressure on the insurance industry, if need be, to alert motorists to their obligations.  The insurance companies could be required to contact their clients directly to make them aware of their obligations in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  We need to be more proactive in that regard.</p> <p>  I presume the Oireachtas will pass this legislation which may not be needed.  What will happen afterwards if it is not needed?  I presume there will be commencement orders, or whatever else.  Does the T&aacute;naiste envisage the whole Bill being commenced?  How will that work in practice in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit?  Is it envisaged that there will be commencement orders?</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the budgetary implications.  We have been told that there there will be no need for a supplementary budget this year.  The T&aacute;naiste also mentioned the rainy day fund.  A no-deal Brexit will have devastating consequences for this country.  It could impact on our economic growth, the public finances and so forth.  Is it a definite commitment that there will not be a requirement for a supplementary budget this year in the event that Brexit takes place?</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure us that the solidarity of the EU 27 is still holding?  At one stage the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made reference to eleventh hour wheeling and dealing in smoke-filled rooms.  I presume there are still smoke-filled rooms in Europe.  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure us that the solidarity is holding and that we are not coming under any pressure to modify our position?  There were comments from the Polish Foreign Minister which did not represent the views of the EU 27, but I would like such an assurance.</p> <p>  I know that the T&aacute;naiste has taken an interest in the horse racing and bloodstock industry, particularly when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but there was nothing in his contribution today about it.  Is a lot of work needed to address the implications of a no-deal Brexit for the industry?  Will the T&aacute;naiste enlighten us on what needs to be done in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019021400002#H00300"><p>What will happen on 29 March?  We will have done everything we can by then and enacted legislation in time in order that, at 11 p.m. on 29 March, currently the time and date at and on which the United Kingdom will formally leave the European Union, this law will take effect.  Students will be able to continue as previously.  It may mean that cars travelling back and forth across the Border will need a green card on the windscreen, but, by and large, the common travel area will continue as it does today.  That will not solve the problem for many in Ireland who do not have an Irish or a British passport.  In the Irish economy there are 200 different nationalities and, while they will continue to be able to move between Britain and Ireland because there will be no barriers because of the common travel area, they may not be able to work the way they do now and they will not have the benefits of this legislation which applies to Irish nationals.  It changes the relationship and causes issues.</p> <p>  The real impact will be felt in sectors such as agriculture.  We sell approximately &euro;2 billion worth of beef into the United Kingdom each year.  I do not believe the United Kingdom will leave without a deal, but, if that were to happen and it decided to implement full the WTO trading arrangements, something for which some are openly advocating in the British Parliament, it would mean tariffs of up to 65% on beef and approximately 43% on dairy products.  The commerce and trading environment for important sectors in Ireland would be changed dramatically.  That is also true in the United Kingdom.  We buy approximately &euro;3.5 billion worth of food and drink from there each year.  All of the complexities of the relationships, north and south on the island, and figuring out solutions in a short period of time would exert pressure.  It would be difficult, from which there is no getting away.</p> <p>  We are preparing as best we can.  The European Union is putting practical contingency plans in place, but it will put Ireland under a lot of strain.  In my view, it will also put the United Kingdom under enormous strain.  It will cost jobs and damage the economy.  We have many contingency plans in place to reduce the damage, but it will be difficult.</p><p>In response to Deputy Durkan, we have very strong EU unity.  That will continue.  The EU wants a deal; it wants to manage Brexit.  It is watching in astonishment how the debates are progressing in Westminster but it is what it is but we have to accept that and we have to be respectful of that, even though it is frustrating.  I do not believe the EU is in any mood to sacrifice Irish interests to get a deal.  We are a member state that is staying and that is committed to the EU.  I have never experienced anything like the solidarity with Ireland on this issue in my political life.  I have been in the European Parliament and I have been in multiple different Ministries and in different positions in respect of the EU.  The solidarity we have got from countries a long way from us geographically is extraordinary and I think it will hold.<br/><br/>We cannot extend the latitude of the common travel area to include trade because trade is an EU competence, we are part of an EU Single Market and customs union and the Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is an EU border as well as a border between the UK and Ireland.  We need solutions that involve the British Government and the EU.  We will have an All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit again tomorrow in Dublin Castle, which will bring everyone together.  Everyone is invited.  Some people will not be there but that is their choice.  I am a regular visitor to Northern Ireland.  I will travel to Belfast tomorrow following the civic dialogue.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Haughey's questions, the insurance sector has been proactive on the green card issue in letting its clients and customers know but we may well have to shift gear on communication if it looks like this will happen.  I also suspect, however, there will be some recognition that it will take a few weeks to adapt to the new realities and so on but I take the point on communication.<br/><br/>On the commencement orders for this legislation, they will be introduced section by section.  I am sure Ms N&iacute; Choigligh will correct me if I am wrong but if there is a deal and there is no need to enact most of this legislation, and if we move into a formal transition period consistent with the withdrawal agreement, only section 13 will be enacted because that effectively redefines in law the term &quot;member state&quot; to apply to the UK outside of the EU but in a transition period with us.  The <i>status quo</i>will be maintained through transition in all the different areas where EU law applies.  The rest of it would not be necessary.<br/><br/>I am told there will not be a supplementary budget.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach about this.  If the UK were to crash out without a deal at the end of March, in April and May there would be implementation of contingency measures supporting vulnerable sectors and so on and then we are quickly into the summer and there will be another budget in October.  There is not any likelihood that there will be a supplementary budget before the summer.  We are fortunate.  Ireland is back into surplus.  It means that we will have to borrow more money and that the outlook for economic growth will change and, therefore, the budget arithmetic will change but we will not need to introduce an emergency budget or anything like that.<br/><br/>Earlier this week I spoke to the horseracing industry, which is one of several sectors that is vulnerable.  Even with the all-island approach to horse racing, 7,000 thoroughbreds cross the Border each year for breeding purposes to places such as Down Royal for race meetings.  It is an industry worth &euro;1.85 billion to the economy each year.  Every county in the country has an interest in it and it relies on a seamless relationship between the UK and Ireland.  Brexit will interrupt that particularly east-west in terms of veterinary certificates and management of disease.  We have seen an example of that even in the past week with equine flu in the UK, which has been managed well there and here to keep it out of Ireland.  There is uncertainty for the horseracing industry, as there is for other sectors.  The industry does not face the same tariffs that the beef and dairy sectors could have to face.  The tariff is approximately 11% on the sale of a horse, which is still significant, but nothing like the dramatic tariff impact on dairy or beef.</p></speech>

As Senator Richmond said, we received a good briefing from him yesterday at the meeting of committee chairs.  I was very glad, on a quick perusal of the draft Bill, that many of the issues that affect constituents of mine, such as those who worked in Britain or came from Britain and who access pensions here, and people crossing the Border to the North or coming South for employment purposes or to access education and health services, will be protected going about their daily business.  We welcome that.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that there is a willingness at EU level to relax state aid rules and, hopefully, market support measures for the agriculture and agrifood sectors will be activated to help deal with the difficulties facing the beef sector and, if there is severe market disturbance, additional measures will be implemented and activated to help that sector.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane referred to the cost but we cannot quantify the cost in any way because I know from my area, and the Border region in general, uncertainty has set in and there has been damage to business and commerce.  Some enterprises that were planning to expand put those plans on hold.  There is uncertainty and a great hesitancy to invest or expand.  Deputy Durkan used the word interdependability.  As we all know there is great interdependence in the agrifood sector, construction products and engineering sectors in the economies both North and South.  The Brexit referendum result has impacted negatively on all of those sectors so far.</p> <p>  I welcome the members of the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN and the east Border region who have joined us in the Public Gallery.  They represent local authority public representatives in the Border region, North and South.  They were with us earlier today at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement where they outlined the difficulties that the area faces now and the need for additional investment.  They put a good case about the large-scale and widespread co-operation that has existed, particularly since 1998, and we do not want that damaged.  We want it to continue.  I compliment those at local authority level, supported by their officials, on the good positive work that has been done to support the Good Friday Agreement as well.</p> <p>  I travel around my constituency regularly, into Fermanagh from parts of Cavan and Monaghan, and internally in Cavan and Monaghan.</p><p>In the past few weeks in particular, quite a number of British citizens who have been living in our State for quite a long time have become concerned about their pension entitlements and their rights.  I am glad that this will be underpinned by legislation and that those people will continue to have their entitlements, which is very important.  All of the party spokespersons stated that everybody in the Oireachtas will be very supportive of the legislation.  I want to assure the T&aacute;naiste of the committee's co-operation in the context of any legislation with which it will be obliged to deal.</p><p> I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his detailed presentation and for his good engagement with all of the members.  We will now go into private session.</p></speech>

The eight council members of the partnership are Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo, Armagh city, Banbridge and Craigavon, Fermanagh and Omagh, and Mid-Ulster.<br/><br/>The partnership has been advocating for common solutions to common cross-Border problems since 1995.  The region, though largely rural, contains some larger urban centres.  It is remote from national or regional capitals and, as a consequence, the area and its communities are regularly overlooked in terms of investment.<br/><br/>ICBAN's area of focus is on promoting and developing co-operation between member councils and their communities on matters of cross-Border and regional development.  There has been a positive history of collaboration between the local authorities and their communities.  This has been delivered in spite of often historic back-to-back development shortcomings.  Instead, the ICBAN partnership works against this in joining up planning.  A recent example has been a joint submission to the regional spatial and economic strategy of the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.<br/><br/>I will explain some of the challenges and issues being faced in the region.  The need to foster cross-Border co-operation is now even more acute, given the challenges of Brexit.  As a by-product of the Brexit process, the Border has been front and centre in discussions and media coverage.  Indeed, the questions of the Border and co-operation have been elevated to levels not seen for many years.<br/><br/>With the implications of the UK referendum decision to exit the EU still to be finally determined, it is considered that the area of these islands likely to be most significantly impacted will be the central Border region.  Even though the Border areas could eventually see some communities within the EU adjoining what will become areas then not within the EU, the issues in maintaining co-operation across the Border will remain.  The central Border region councils have reaffirmed their commitment to co-operation despite what happens.<br/><br/>One notable issue is the important role that local authorities must play in the continued delivery of local services.  While national governments and political attention will likely continue to be focused on Brexit for some time yet, the delivery of local services to citizens must continue.  In the vacuum of a Northern Ireland Executive, local authorities in Northern Ireland continue to play a key role in the democratic functioning of government.  Through engagements and joint delivery in community planning, for example, and its focus on the economic and social elements of well-being, the impact on local services could be minimised.  Cross-government support to this developing key role would be welcomed.<br/><br/>In more than 20 years, the partnership has helped lever significant investment into the region and cross-Border projects between local authorities have had a positive impact on local communities.  The significance of these investments on both sides of the Border cannot be underestimated and given the importance of the challenges in the times ahead, the continuation or replacement for such co-operation funds must be a key priority. <b></b>It is vital that a high-level strategic focus is prioritised for the wider Border region by both Governments and involving the EU, where appropriate.  It would be considered that while important EU programmes can only marginally make a difference to lives and the economy of the area, a much more intensive and encompassing intervention over and above any such EU cohesion funds will be necessary to help resolve long-standing issues which still challenge the fabric of Border life.<br/><br/><b></b>It is hereby recommended that consideration is given to developing an island-wide territorial cohesion policy, which would include a cross-Border infrastructure and investment plan or fund to replace any loss of common INTERREG and PEACE funds.  However, there is little evidence yet of such a debate or consideration on either side of the Border, which is concerning.<br/><br/>Brexit is not the only significant challenge facing the area.  There are pre-existing infrastructure deficits which existed before Brexit and still remain.  There has been a lack of attention to the central Border region and in the national planning framework, NPF, which highlights supports for other regions including adjoining Border areas by comparison.<br/><br/>Brexit reinforces the importance of giving recognition to the central Border region.  We hereby ask that the committee explicitly identifies and promotes the region as an area of national importance.  We can explain the untapped potential of the area as an economic driver later.  Such designation must be reinforced by a national commitment to address the identified strategic infrastructural shortcomings and redress historic under-investment<b>. </b>That would enable economic growth and help mitigate the impacts of any negative Brexit outworkings.<br/><br/>Component areas of such a policy have precedents for exploration.  For example, in 2014, the Centre for Cross Border Studies published a scoping study into the creation of a cross-Border development zone, an initiative actively supported by our partnership.  The objective would be to promote the economic development of the cross-Border zone on a co-ordinated basis, maximising the use of national resources and stimulating the use of local resources and expertise.  There would be three component parts: spatial, structural and institutional.  The spatial part examines three spatially defined areas, one being the central Border region.<br/><br/>Businesses need a modern, effective transport infrastructure through which they can get goods to market.  While there have been improvements across the region, there remains important strategic projects which have not been sufficiently advanced and thus hinder regional growth and regeneration.  The ways and means must be found to accelerate their delivery.<br/><br/>The wider area includes subregional pockets.  Key industries include engineering, manufacturing, tourism and agrifood.  In planning terms, it should be recognised that it is not just about connecting large urban areas.  It is also about connecting centres of production with customers, workers and the supply chain.  The spatial approaches we take must be reconsidered in terms of development.<br/><br/>There is a high dependency on travel by road in the region.  In the absence of a rail network, strategic road corridors are key for access and movement.  Both Governments must formally recommit to the long-planned A5-N2 Dublin to Derry dualling project, highlighting its priority nature and re-pledging what was originally agreed.  Elsewhere, upgrades are needed to the N16-A4 from Sligo to Ballygawley, the east-west link to Dundalk, the N4 from Sligo to Carrick-on-Shannon, with an extension of the M3 to Cavan town.  The A29 from Coleraine to Monaghan must also be highlighted as a key road corridor for North-South freight movement in agrifood, minerals, engineering and quarry products.  We can explore later the challenges of these freight movements, the impacts they have and the challenges for the area.<br/><br/>There is evidence to suggest that the Border area has not received its fair share of infrastructure investment compared to other regions.  For example, a review of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, investment in road schemes suggests that spending per head on transport infrastructure is only approximately 45% that of other regions.  If this disproportionate spending pattern continues, the Border area will fall further behind economically, amplifying the issue of a three-speed economy.<br/><br/>The lack of broadband connectivity is one of the most pressing and concerning issues for the councils.  Improvements are critical to help maintain competitiveness and to realise economic and social ambitions.  It is vital that the peripheral rural areas are not left until the end.<br/><br/>There are concerns about the pace of delivery of the national broadband plan, NBP.  The ambitions were first promoted in 2012 and the delays will see that the latest delivery targets of 2022 will not be achieved.<br/><br/>Related to this, equally ambitious programmes must ensure that mobile telecommunications coverage is also effectively delivered.</p><p>There would not, however, appear to be any effective joint planning of these two platforms, and mobile connectivity is not even referenced in the NBP.  Our small towns and villages could flourish again, because they would be effectively future-proofed.  Such connectivity would enable many businesses to operate in rural areas instead.  This would reduce congestion in Dublin, which is just one hour away.  It would also offer the added attractiveness of idyllic locations, leisure and recreation, cheaper living and less crime.<br/><br/>Delivering on the NBP is critical.  The communities and businesses in the Border region cannot wait another seven years.  If the plan cannot be advanced further to delivery in its current format, as interested commentators we would encourage that an alternative solution is quickly realised.  It is not too late for considerations to be given to North-South alignments given that the need and stage of development to enhance broadband is at a similar stage in Northern Ireland.  It could be timely to examine potential all-Island solutions and synergies, in the same context as strategic approaches to all-island energy.<br/><br/>There is collective local authority support for opportunities to promote slow tourism markets, such as cycling and walking, and for utilising interlinked greenways across the Border area. <b></b>A business case was developed by four councils for the Sligo to Enniskillen greenway.  These are prospective areas of growth and aided by the requisite Government investment they can increase overnight occupancies and visitor spending.<br/><br/>The business case for the Ulster Canal highlights the many positive outcomes.  It has been regularly referenced in cross-government agreements, including Project Ireland 2040.  It could be delivered on a phased basis to minimise short-term demands on public funds.  All the cross-Border councils directly involved promote the canal&rsquo;s regeneration.  This committee's highlighting of support for the phased development of the Ulster Canal and associated tourist amenities would be welcomed.<br/><br/>We have set out the key needs and challenges facing the central Border area. <b></b>We appreciate the committee taking the interest and welcome representation and support within Government.  It is a critical time for the area.  There are new arising challenges but it could be argued that the Border area's weaknesses should have been more strategically addressed in the advent of peace and the end of conflict.  Now is the time to address them.<br/><br/>As can be seen through our sizeable delegation today, this is a collective issue for all of the area's eight councils.  We are not here asking for Government to solely resolve the issues but we seek overarching high-level interest and assistance to help us - the local authorities - to tackle these, through cross-government, cross-sectoral, cross-Border and cross-community engagement.  We, for our part as a partnership of local authorities, are ready to play our role.  When we engage government, we are often challenged that co-operation must happen locally first.  There are many examples such as the UNESCO Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark between Cavan, Fermanagh and Omagh, and the referenced statement of common good on planning between four local authorities.  This collective attendance today is also proof of the commitment by local government. <b></b>Our local authorities bring resources and energies and we genuinely need the recognition and the support of central government to help realise the area's untapped potential.</p></speech>

The witnesses are welcome and I am delighted to see them all here today.</p> <p>  Having grown up beside the Border between Aughnacloy and Culloden, I know all too well the challenges that have faced the region.  It is worth remembering that when many of the Border roads were closed in the early 1970s, the final two Border roads to be reinstated were only reopened in 2010.  This was a long time after the Good Friday Agreement and only a few years before the imminent Brexit.  We do not know what the future is likely to hold for the region.</p> <p>  Mr. Campbell's presentation touched on a lot of the issues that are close to my heart such as rural roads, broadband, the greenways and the Ulster Canal.  There is a lot in there.  If we were able to bring about all of the things that Shane talked about then we would have a very dynamic region.</p> <p>  I am aware that this is outside of the witnesses' remit but I want to put it on the record today.  We have a unique and special facility in the stroke unit in the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen.  We have one of the best stroke units on these islands.  Stroke patients are often treated with lysis therapy within ten minutes of coming into the hospital.  Despite all the challenges in the region, we still can be world leaders in what we do.</p> <p>  The Border has Newry at one end and Derry at the other end.  Our bit is the big section in the middle.  Given the lack of infrastructure how does Mr. Campbell see the reality of Brexit affecting us in the future, and in the Border network trying to hold on to what it has achieved over the years to ensure we do not roll back from that?</p></speech>

This is an important subject and it is timely to get their views on what is happening currently.</p> <p>  Looking at what has happened over the past while, there was talk of a commitment to the A5 road project for example, but, unfortunately, this week we have seen the lack of commitment from the Taoiseach on this.  Once again it is being used as a political football.  From the role that the witnesses play in the Border region, is there any indication from an EU angle of what can be achieved, particularly from the ICBAN?  As a past member of the network, I am aware of the good work that has been done over the years in trying to build the infrastructure - and in some senses on a purely commercial basis - to try to utilise the Border area.</p> <p>  The other issue is the A29.  Although it is not directly affected, if one looks at the map, there is no direct link North or South.  It is a zigzag of roads back and forwards.  Unfortunately, development has been east-west with very little North-South.  That is an road we are going to need, especially from a cross-Border point of view.</p> <p>  The big one that has not been mentioned is the circumstances of the interconnector.  From mid-Ulster's perspective, the interconnector is probably one of the most crucial issues.  We need it to be in place as quickly as possible.  Everybody knows and appreciates the work of the engineering sector and the job creation by the sector in mid-Ulster and right across the west.  This is currently being curtailed because businesses cannot expand further.  I was at a recent meeting at The Rock in Pomeroy where three companies were trying to divide up the electricity supply between them.  They had 900 kW between them and each one of them was looking at it all, but it could not be got.  They were working with generators in a makeshift situation.  If we are serious about expanding west of the Bann - which we have complained about for so long - then we need the interconnnector to be in place.  Areas such as Cookstown, Magherafelt and west of the Bann could have no supply in 2020 if we do not get that connection.  This is one area where we need to refocus to see what can be done to get that in place as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The words of the T&aacute;naiste were that the A5 was being postponed.  This was reiterated by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il earlier.  Would the witnesses like to avail of the opportunity to respond to those two contributions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1653" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Campbell" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#D00900"><p>I will respond first and others may join in.  I may not touch on all of the points but I will cover Brexit and transport.  The others and I may also address the issue of the interconnector, and they may also come in on Brexit and transport.  I will pick up on a couple of the points that were made.  If there is time, I will also present some other information to the committee.</p> <p>  The issue is not about what will be the impact of Brexit: it is already impacting.  We carried out a study last year with Queen's University Belfast.  It was a project through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reconciliation fund and we engaged with 600 people and businesses across the Border region.</p><p>Three quarters of those people and businesses expressed the opinion that Brexit is already impacting upon them.  That impact occurs in many ways, including confidence, uncertainties, businesses putting off job expansions and young people rethinking their education choices and study locations.  We have also come across many case studies examining the impact of Brexit on investment in the region.  There are, then, many concerns about Brexit.  We will all be concerned until we find out what the final direction of travel will be on this matter.  </p><p> ICBAN, as a cross-Border group, is representative of the different political interests on both sides of the Border.  We recognised, and the board took the mature attitude, that it was not going to be a network about rehashing arguments on issues such as remaining in or leaving the EU.  Brexit, however, is a pressing issue on which we as a board have to make collective decisions.  The collective decision and policy reached by the board was to work together, regardless of different opinions on issues, to withstand any negative consequences arising from Brexit impacting on the Border region.  We have gathered and shared stories to which I have referred and presented them to MPs, Deputies, MLAs and Senators.  Concerns about those issues are being expressed by people across the region.  We are delighted they have been reviewed at the highest levels by the Irish Government, the United Kingdom Government and the negotiating team in Brussels.</p><p> Turning to transport, I would like to highlight some issues in the region.  The A5-N2 road from Dublin to Derry and the A29 road from Coleraine to Monaghan are among seven key roads in our area.  I will share a map illustrating my point with the committee.  There are 45 million vehicle crossings annually and 11% of those involve light or heavy goods vehicles.  Similar numbers cross from North to South.  In the Border region, it is possible to estimate that each year there are between 4.5 million and 5 million freight crossings of the Border.</p><p> The key Border crossings can be seen from the map we have shared with the committee.  Our area includes the Border crossings labelled D, E, F, G, H, I and J on the map.  They span the central Border region and that is the geography of the area.  The north west and the east are also shown separately on the same map.  When we add up the percentage of the total number of goods vehicle crossings of the Border using these routes, give or take perhaps one or two percentage points, some 35% of crossings happen in the central Border region.  One third of goods vehicle crossings take place in the north west, one third take place in the east and the remaining third are in the central Border region.  That is mainly along the A5-N2 and A29 roads, which is our key industrial belt from mid and east Antrim right down through mid-Ulster and into Monaghan and Cavan.  It is an area overlooked in Government policy.  There was scant mention in the NPF of the region we inhabit.  The north-west city region is profiled yet it has the same number of freight movements.  The eastern corridor is also profiled and that is significant because of the Belfast to Dublin link through Newry and Dundalk.</p><p> I am not making an argument for the central Border region versus the north west or the east regions.  Instead, I am highlighting that Government policy for the entire region, on both sides of the Border, has not been considered collectively.  Taking into account just this one economic indicator of freight movement and travel, if we do not address the issues faced by the central Border region, we will not be effectively balancing development across the area.  We might well all be sitting here again in another 20 years wondering what we are going to do about the Border.  </p><p> The central Border region area is as important as any other.  We may have seven routes overall, with two or three in the east and two or three in the north west, but when we examine our central Border region, it is as economically important.  We could even argue that much of the traffic that should come through our area is not coming through because the roads are deficient compared with other areas.  That is the collective case that must be made for these eight county areas to be considered as part of Government policy.  To date, that has been missing.  I will leave it at that to let others in.</p></speech>

I live in and represent a community which is about a mile from the Border.  Until recently, people did not want to even engage with the issue of Brexit because it was such a hurtful experience remembering what happened in the past.  We ask this committee to ensure that all of the elements in the Good Friday Agreement are used to try to defend our rural Border communities, including the reference to a Border poll.   All possible solutions to the Brexit issue as it affects the Border should be investigated.</p> <p>  This issue has been the subject of much media attention.  Members of our local community have appeared on many programmes and taken part in many interviews.  They have explained the statistics and that in the recent past local businesses have withdrawn or withheld further investment and development because of uncertainty.  Assistance, therefore, is needed in that area.  While we welcome the focus on investment and development in the eastern and north west parts of the Border region, we feel that we are, in many ways, overlooked in ways similar to rural Ireland.   Communities on both sides of the Border in the central region have suffered neglect over many years.  We need some focus on our area as well.  </p> <p>  Ms Gildernew's question on the health issue is vital.  ICBAN, with the help of bodies such as the Centre for Cross Border Studies based in Armagh, has undertaken reports on the positioning of emergency hospitals, etc.  We have been developing responses to emergencies, including enabling the ambulance services to travel across the Border.  The fire brigades have also advanced greatly in co-ordinating and dealing with emergencies such as fires and road traffic collisions in a cross-Border context in our region.  We are approaching the point where people are ignoring the Border and just delivering the services which all of the people of the region deserve.</p> <p>  The energy interconnector is a similar issue.  Mr. Campbell mentioned in his presentation the importance of the all-Ireland energy strategy.  Mr. Molloy also referred to the 400 kV interconnector being developed between County Meath and County Tyrone.  It goes through the eastern part of County Monaghan, and, as the committee will probably be aware, EirGrid and SONI have turned that into a very controversial project.  There is major opposition locally to it being constructed as an overhead project with approximately 300 pylons positioned along the path of the interconnector.  I have been at public meetings with landowners.  Those meetings sometimes include 300 to 400 people very determined that they will not allow the construction of that project over land.  It is fully accepted that the interconnector is needed and that the all-Ireland energy strategy is a good one, which protects and delivers for us all.  I appeal to the committee to bring to bear any authority or influence it may have to try to force EirGrid to consult and listen to the local communities.  Constructing the energy interconnector underground is possible.  We have been to Europe and to Brussels, and investigated a similar project between Belgium and Germany.  We heard from Elia, the company responsible for that project, that there is a possibility of putting such an endeavour underground.  What we been learned from that project is that public confidence is the first requirement of successful infrastructure construction anywhere in Ireland and particularly in the Border region.  Public confidence is vital.</p></speech>

Most of the other members also want to contribute, so I am conscious of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1658" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian McCreesh" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#E00500"><p>I will be brief.  I want to pick up on a number of comments made by Ms Gildernew and Mr. Molloy regarding potential investment and the impact of that investment within our region.</p><p> I am reminded as I look around that we, as a group, represent nine of the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland, North and South.  This equates to approximately one fifth of the entire land mass of the island, a sizeable fraction, and one tenth of the entire population.  When we refer to the central region, we are talking about a significant element of this island, North and South.  I say this because many of us are of the view - as a practitioner in economic regeneration for 29 years, I am of this view - that all we have ever asked for in our part of the world is a level playing field.  We have never asked for a handout; we have always asked for a leg up in order to ensure a level playing field.  My ask today is exactly this because I genuinely know what we could do if we had decent roads, decent technology and decent access to investment and labour and skills development, as other areas have enjoyed over the past ten, 15 or 20 years.</p><p> I say this for two other reasons.  Our part of the world has particular characteristics.  We do not have public sector investment.  We do not have the luxury of relying on significant public sector jobs.  What have we done then?  We have created our own jobs.  Our people are the entrepreneurs of this island.  We are the enterprise capital of this island.  We are the ones who have created the greatest, biggest, boldest and broadest exporters on this island despite the lack of investment, North and South, that we have experienced.  As a result, our ask is very simple: in any regional economic strategy, we urge a focus on where the entrepreneurship is and some focus on the creativity and the enterprises.  Then we will demonstrate, by way of delivery, what we can do with a level playing field.  In spite of poor roads, poor broadband and all the other deficiencies, we are very proud people.  We boast a significant element of civic and economic pride throughout Tyrone, Derry, Monaghan and Fermanagh.  We have pride in our families and our communities, and this is what keeps us going through the bad years and into the good years.  We also say this: we do not want repeats upon repeats of emigration and losing our young people again and again.  This is an opportunity through this strategy on the southern side of the Border to make a substantive investment in the central Border region.  We ask and expect that this will be forthcoming, not just because we deserve it, but also because we will significantly return on the investment - fivefold, tenfold or perhaps more.</p></speech>

They should feel free, if they leave something out, to come back in when the other speakers have contributed.  I will take Mr. Doyle and then Mr. Baird before reverting to Deputy McLoughlin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1661" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Doyle" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#F00300"><p>I will make two very brief points.  First, I want to impress upon everyone the strength of the collaborative offering here today.  There are local authorities North and South that are very familiar with one another and have an excellent track record of delivery and a desire to work together.  This is evident not only through ICBAN, but also through our regional assembly and offerings such as the European social entrepreneurship funds, EuSEF, partnership, which was piloted by my colleagues in Leitrim County Council.  There are local authorities that are ignoring county boundaries, looking at the regional whole and delivering where they are given the opportunity.  As my colleague stated, we are only looking for the opportunity to play on the same field.</p> <p>  I will make just one other point, which I think the members would want me to make.  We have had for many years a PEACE investment programme in the Border counties.  It is different from the way in which local authorities work in other parts of the country but is an integral part of the way we work.  It involves soft workings between communities in conflict areas, communities that have not met one another in generations and that are now working on community and enterprise projects.  It is a hugely important part of the success story since the Good Friday Agreement, and we strongly encourage Members of the Oireachtas to emphasise the importance of peace work and the PEACE programme to local authorities in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1662" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alex Baird" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#F00400"><p>Fair fa' ye, and I hope the Vice Chairman accepts that Ulster Scots greeting in the spirit it is given.  Ms Gildernew mentioned the Border roads.  I will offer just a point of information.  Lately, only two roads have reopened.  Before I went into politics, I was a civil servant working for the Northern Ireland Office and my title was "civil representative".  In the words of Michael Caine, not a lot of people know this, but my role at the stage after the Good Friday Agreement was to work with the roads service to ensure all the Border roads were reopened, so I am only too well aware of the difficulties that were caused by the closure of the Border roads, and none of us wants to go back to that situation again.  I am surprised that the two to which Michelle referred took so long but I think there was a bridge involved.  I just wanted to get that information in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1343" speakername="Tony McLoughlin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#F00500"><p>All our guests and representatives from the nine areas we are talking about are very welcome.  As a Deputy representing the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and a former councillor in that area, I am very well familiar with and very aware of the deficiencies we have had in the area.  Our guests are highlighting issues in both the North and the South.  It is wonderful to have them here because it is an opportunity to engage with them and their colleagues on the local authorities and talk about issues, particularly infrastructure.  I see the divide between the east and the west, particularly the north-west, the investment and what has taken place in recent years.  I have always said we do not have any such investment in our area, unfortunately.  A very fine announcement was made to me last week on the N4, that is, the road between Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon.  There is to be an upgrade costing &euro;121 million which will start very shortly.  There are, however, many other areas within our constituencies that lack funding and the initiative to get moving.  Infrastructural investment other than roads and so on was mentioned.  Our guests have been before the committee before and members have listened to their concerns, and there are major concerns in the areas raised.  Not only road infrastructure, but also broadband was highlighted.  Broadband is a major issue for businesses and indeed everyone living in the areas affected.  This must be dealt with.  Greenways offer huge tourism potential.  Reference was made to the Sligo-Enniskillen road through Manorhamilton, the greenway in my area and cycling and walking.  These are the ways forward.  Mr. McCreesh is right that we need not only investment, but also clarity as to where this funding can be made available, particularly with a no-deal Brexit.  We have spoken about the lack of INTERREG funding at some of our recent meetings.  That is an issue.  I refer also to the economic development of our area.  We are talking about the Border areas.  They are vitally important.  I speak to haulage contractors who are very concerned, and have been for many years, but are more concerned now with the possible prospect of a no-deal Brexit happening very shortly.  I would appreciate if our guests could comment on some of these issues.</p></speech>

I compliment Mr. Campbell on the quality of his contribution.  It covered a broad sweep of the various activities in the Border region.  It was very comprehensive and welcome.  I also compliment him on the publications he has produced in recent years in conjunction with Katy Hayward of Queen's University.  Deputies Breathnach and McLoughlin and I, as members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, had Dr. Hayward giving evidence to us at the assembly's committee meetings.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence - Mr. Doyle and Mr. Traynor would be aware  of this - I brought parliamentary delegations from abroad to Cavan and Monaghan, including the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons.  In the presentations that were made to Monaghan County Council and Cavan County Council, we drew widely on ICBAN's publications.</p><p>I compliment ICBAN on them.  At the time, I passed on our thanks to Councillor Paddy O'Rourke, who chaired ICBAN, for the quality of the publications.  Mention was made of the delivery of health services and Deputy Breathnach, as then chairman of the North Eastern Health Board, was instrumental in bringing about Cooperation and Working Together, CAWT, when an agreement was signed in Ballyconnell in July 1992.  That initiative has worked well and we would like to see it expanded.</p><p> With regard to waterways, the potential of the Ulster Canal was quite rightly mentioned.  I would also like to see the Erne system made navigable from Belturbet, Killykeen and Killeshandra, building on the Shannon-Erne Waterway, formerly known as the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal, as Mr. O'Rourke knows so well.  We both live adjacent to the area.  It has been phenomenally successful.  Waterways Ireland came before the committee, as did the Loughs Agency.  Obviously they have limited budgets and do not have a budget for the capital investment required never mind rolling out new products or enhancing products for maintenance due to the usage of the waterways.  There is huge pressure on the capital budgets . We must keep pointing out the potential of the waterways system in our area to grow considerably.  I know very well that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the restoration of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was mooted, many cynics in many political parties and organisations said it would never work.  It proved to be phenomenally successful, as will be the Ulster Canal when it is restored.</p><p> With regard to the A5 and N2, prior to Brexit, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport came before the committee on a number of occasions.  The committee was very concerned that the project was not moving along and that a commitment had not been given on the necessary preparatory planning and design work, particularly on the N2 in County Monaghan.  It has moved on somewhat but it was disappointing to learn this week that the particular funding allocation may not be available.  We sincerely hope it will be because it is so important for the north west of the country.</p><p> The witnesses quite rightly pointed out an issue we have been raising with regard to Brexit.  Individual committee members have been raising here and in discussions in the D&aacute;il the very high dependence of the local economies, especially in Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Leitrim, on the agrifood sector, construction products and engineering.  They are the three sectors that are more highly dependent on the British market than elsewhere.  Some of the sectors have been impacted already by Brexit.  Any fluctuation in sterling or any weakness could cause immediate difficulty.  Our key sectors are those that are most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of Brexit, and this must be a source of concern.  Other colleagues and I have argued with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in particular that if we are trying to help industry and business in the region remain competitive, we must invest in infrastructure.  Upgrading infrastructure can reduce costs somewhat, but if we do not have modern infrastructure, it will be an extra impediment and cost to business.  It is a message we would heartily endorse with regard to the presentation that has been made.</p><p> Island-wide territorial cohesion policy has been mentioned.  As we all know, European funding such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is for post 2020, but the overall budget for the European Union is in multi-annual cycles.  Perhaps the witnesses will draw up proposals we could use to help advocate for specific Cohesion Fund payments.  We remember the debate in the State about Objective 1 status.  The huge growth in the economy in the 1990s and the early 2000s changed the status of some of our regions.  We should be making a very strong demand for the Border region, North and South, getting specific cohesion funding because of the challenges it will face as a result of Brexit.  It is a very important area.  Perhaps more work can be undertaken by the witnesses on how we can push the Governments here and elsewhere to support specific proposals to draw down Cohesion funding.  Some of the countries that acceded to the European Union in the mid-2000s and subsequently had significant infrastructure upgrades through Cohesion funding.  We should argue that we are a special case.  It is very important in this respect.</p><p> I compliment the witnesses, whom I know have done very good work on broadband infrastructure and mobile telephony in the area.  All of us can readily agree with and support the witnesses on what they have told us today.  I thank all of the witnesses who have contributed to the meeting.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to hear that local authorities are working together across the Border.  It is wonderful to hear.  They have touched on many issues.  Local services were mentioned.  The areas in which I am specifically interested with regard to the impending doom and gloom of Brexit are mental health and addiction services.  From the perspective of the witnesses, what is it like with regard to mental health?  Are mental health services and addiction services being impacted upon?  How do the local authorities see this opening up?  I am sure the INTERREG funding will impact on this also.</p> <p>  Are the witnesses concerned about the Good Friday Agreement?  From our perspective, how do the witnesses feel the committee can support them?  What I would like to see happening today is the committee supporting the witnesses in the great work they are all doing.  The fact they are all working together is powerful.</p></speech>

No matter how far east I have gone, I have found nobody in Europe who is not aware of the Irish Border and the issues surrounding it.  The witnesses are to be complimented on this.</p> <p>  Cross-Border development has been mentioned and, I am afraid, this is where I come with a rather negative view of the world.  My fear is that Brexit, whether it is a crash out or negotiated, will change forever the relationships that exist in the Border region.  If we were to look for a solution to the Irish problem, perhaps we should step out of London and Brussels and come back to the witnesses and let them find a solution because they would have one in jig time.</p> <p>  Some time ago, Senator Black brought us to Cushendall where we met a haulier who will relocate to the Republic if there is a negative impact from Brexit on his business.  What fears do the witnesses have with regard to businesses relocating out of Northern Ireland into the Republic or elsewhere in Europe to maintain their businesses?</p> <p>  The mismatch of funding bothers me.  After Brexit, European funding will be guaranteed to the southern side and the Irish Government will continue to push for financial support for various projects along the Border.  There is a possibility the UK will not provide equal funding.  We will finish up with a mismatch and a poor relation on the other side of the Border.</p><p>Years ago, one knew one was in Northern Ireland because one would be driving on the best roads in the country.  Now one knows one is in Northern Ireland because one is obliged to drive on the worst roads in the country.  Somebody mentioned the central area of the Border region.  I would drive to Sligo rather than try to cut across the Border.  The mismatch of funding concerns me greatly.  Have our guests considered local authorities on the other side of the Border?  If they lose businesses, they will lose rates, funding, taxation, etc.  That is a concern.</p><p> Have our guests had an opportunity to make a similar presentation to Members of the Westminster Parliament?  I know the House of Lords has been fairly active, but have they had an opportunity to speak to MPs apart from those present at this meeting?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I wish to make two comments in reply to Deputy McLoughlin and to some of the issues that Deputy Brendan Smith touched on regarding the economic impact, what we can do to shape the economic future and the role European investment can play in that.</p> <p>  I do not want to be negative.  I, too, have been involved in developing, acquiring and securing European funding and trying to get it invested in economic regeneration activity through local government, in both an urban and a rural setting.  I have been extremely grateful for that opportunity and that experience.  It has had a wonderful impact on my part of the world in east Tyrone and south Derry.  That being said, there is a big difference between cross-Border activity and Border-specific activity.  I want this to be as positive as I can make it but I am going to be critical here.  It grates when people talk about cross-Border activity and investment such as INTERREG funds and so on.  In 2015, elected members of my local authority and I spent a lot of time preparing a very comprehensive response to the previous INTERREG programme and the forthcoming INTERREG programme running from 2015 to 2019.  While we welcomed the investment and the hundreds of millions of pounds that came through the INTERREG programme, we warned the European Commission that in no way, shape or form does it attempt to address urban plight, urban deprivation or urban or rural dilapidation.  Innovation and research and development at academic level are wonderful for universities and academic institutions, which have availed fantastically of INTERREG programmes.  However, I would make a very simple point.  I invite anyone to go to the Border and walk through Newtownbutler, Lisnaskea, Emyvale, Carrick-on-Shannon or Aughnacloy and show me the benefit of the millions of pounds of INTERREG funding.  I invite anyone to look at the empty shops, the empty buildings, the dilapidation and the dereliction.  There is a raft of work to be done in Border towns and villages, in both urban and rural areas.  We are probably only going to get a few chances to get it right in our entire careers.  I am here to say that I welcome cross-Border co-operation and I also welcome everything Deputies Brendan Smith and McLoughlin just stated.  However, I remind the committee that INTERREG funds going into academic institutions in Belfast do not address rural and urban deprivation, decline and emigration in the multiple Border towns where, quite frankly, communities will say when asked that they saw no discernible benefit.</p> <p>  Our ask is very simple.  A regional and spatial strategy is being developed.  If we are talking about cross-Border issues, let us make them Border-specific, not exclusively but inclusively.  Let us really go into Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Tyrone and Fermanagh.  Let us get down and dirty in Border regions and towns and ask what the issues are, what the problems are and what needs to be done to deal with them.  If we do that, I might be here with a more positive demeanour in seven years.</p></speech>

Like every other region, ours suffers from a lack of investment.  Through the public participation networks at local councils and social inclusion policies, we are starting to deal with people who have been excluded for all kinds of different reasons.  There is a particular understanding that some of them are not involved in citizenship in everyday life because of mental issues.  Again, there is not nearly enough focus on it.</p> <p>  That brings me to the questions about relationships under the Good Friday Agreement and people's concerns.  There are other aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, particularly those relating to the implementation bodies.  There are other articles and sections of it that deal with civic participation, the civic forum and the feed-in from community groups.  After the Good Friday Agreement there was a great rush of community groups on both sides of the Border meeting to deal with common issues.  However, two things happened very quickly.  First, they ran into jurisdictional legal differences.  Second, funding for their involvement was cut by about 40%.  There is frustration there, but also a willingness to get engaged again and stay involved.</p> <p>  There is another aspect of the Good Friday Agreement.  When we talk about all the economic developments and progress that has been made, the other aspect around reconciliation and peace-building that is not as measurable is the fact that we as councils are working together on the issues that affect us.  Trying to address the problems helps to create trust, respect and appreciation for where other people are coming from.  That feeds into the outcome of the Good Friday Agreement.  Confidence is low at times, because we are 20 years on and the Good Friday Agreement really raised people's hopes and expectations.  We need to do more work.  Confidence does drop at times.  The work the committee is doing is vitally important for all of us and for the country, particularly for building relationships.</p> <p>  We are here to represent ICBAN.  It is notable that Mr. Baird of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party and I, a representative of Sinn F&eacute;in, work together on all of these issues.  Sometimes, watching the TV news at night, one would not think that is possible, but it is.  We have grown to know, respect and appreciate each other's point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Doyle" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#H00500"><p>I wish to make three brief points.  I emphasise how proactive this partnership is being in getting the message out to Westminster and to the decision makers.  In recent times, primarily through the offices of Deputy Brendan Smith, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, very high-level delegations from Westminster have visited the Cavan-Monaghan region.  They have stayed in Cavan and they have met with people and businesses on the ground.  Likewise, we have had very high delegations from the French Parliament and the German ambassador.  Next week, the Maltese Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion and the Maltese ambassador will be visiting the region.  The message we want to send is that we are being pro-active in selling the needs of the region beyond these Houses, wherever we feel it would be productive.</p> <p>  In regard to relocation, there is very strong evidence that businesses are not in a position to expand or to radically change their business models.  Our principal worry is that the withdrawal of markets or the creation of obstacles to markets may pull the rug from under businesses that are currently very strong.</p> <p>  Finally, I emphasise again the strength of the relations within the local authorities and communities at present.  That is a testament to the Good Friday Agreement and what it has achieved for the country.  It behoves us all to ensure that is not undermined in the future.</p><p>In terms of broadband and its importance, the announcement by Eir this week of investment into those towns and areas with more than 1,000 homes is to be welcomed.  It is great to see that happening; it will impact on our region.  However, the hard to reach areas are still missing out.  I am referring to rural areas not covered by this delegation.  We await with interest the delivery of the national broadband plan and the results of that tendering process.  We hope that can be linked into mobile connectivity proposals, as we have spoken about previously.  That must be delivered across a region such as ours because one roams into areas of inadvertent roaming.  When one crosses the Border one experiences a drop in signal.  That is not good for businesses, people or homeowners living on the Border whose homes are constantly moving in and out of roaming charges.  If Brexit comes to pass and the UK leaves the EU Digital Single Market we are back to a charging regime which puts the region at a competitive disadvantage.  That must be engineered out through licences, and I believe it is possible to do that. </p><p> The Ulster Canal could be a fantastic project, and has been long advocated for in our region.  We have no doubt that if it achieved the required investment it could be a huge success.  We only have to point to the example of the Geopark between Cavan and Fermanagh and Omagh, which is something we should shout about a bit more.  It is the largest single visitor attraction in the Border region, with some 400,000 visitors.  I appreciate that Fermanagh, Omagh and Cavan might never have thought to aspire to that level of success originally.  The growth potential and the ability to deliver good projects is there in our region.  The agrifood, engineering and manufacturing sectors in our area are interlinked; that is what has happened since the Good Friday Agreement and the opening of relations, and the work of groups such as this committee have done have brought people together.  We have a concern that Border relations might be affected because of the wider discourse around these issues.  What the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, proves is that Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP, the DUP, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the SDLP and others to work together on a common agenda.  Politics is essentially left outside the room, and we work, where we can, on the common issues of the time.   </p><p> Mental health is a big issue in our region, as we found out through the research we carried out on Brexit in conjunction with Queens University Belfast.  Community planning officials from the region meet regularly; the next meeting, next month, is all about mental health and the issues affecting the region.  We will really dig into it.  This initiative is being led by the local authorities, the local community development committees, LCDCs, and the community planning partnerships respectively in each jurisdiction.  </p><p> We are not here to complain that our region has always been left out.  We are here to say that when investment has been made in this region we deliver.  The facts are there.  This region is as busy as the other Border regions.  It is great to see that they are so busy and to see that they are in receipt of support.  We should fill in the missing link, which is the central Border region.  We have the key centres of production.  Mr. McCreesh spoke about the enterprise focus and the enterprise centre.  Mid-Ulster, to pick one area, is the single biggest single contributor in Northern Ireland to gross value added to those indicators, in terms of manufacturing outputs.  We look at the industries right across our area, down into Monaghan and Cavan, and west into Leitrim and Sligo, which has a thriving small business economy.  It covers an area of approximately 750,000 people, and is the biggest cross-Border area, and the area with the most crossings.  We work with its complexity and richness.  We also offer an alternative to the traffic congestion in Dublin.  There were reports yesterday that Dublin is the third most congested city in the world after Bogot&aacute; and Rome.  We are only an hour up the road, and can offer fantastic quality of life.  If the final investments we need in roads, in connectivity and broadband are delivered it would mean that people would not have to commute so much and allow us to deliver on creative economy solutions. </p><p> We ask for the committee's help in profiling the importance and the value of the central Border region.  The members are Deputies for these areas, and we ask them, within their political parties, to remember to profile the central Border region as being important.  It should be raised as regularly as possible with the Irish Government, and indeed with the Northern Irish Government.  We want it to be raised in Westminster as often as possible too.  Mr. McCreesh mentioned the work we have been doing on regional spatial strategy.  The presentation we gave today is based on a collective response to the regional strategy, because we feel the national planning framework has ignored our region to a large degree.  If we could have some support or assistance from Government, either by way of funding or help or assistance to develop and build upon our spatial plan, our economic policy resolution and our ideas on how these areas could be more effectively knitted together, we could turn an area with untapped potential into a major economic driver.  It is holding its own with other areas at the same time as being the area that is most neglected in terms of investment.  </p></speech>

Mr. McCreesh mentioned the issue of being fully recognised as a region and as a collective unit.  Do the witnesses see merit in the co-ordination and facilitation of efforts between the three groupings working together?  They could identify the various sectors that are important to one region but which are totally different from another region.  One simple example of this is the education sector.  Letterkenny and Derry work on specifics that are required for programmes in that region, whereas Dundalk Institute of Technology and Dublin City University would have different requirements.  If we want to get additional moneys from Europe in a post-Brexit situation or otherwise, is there merit in facilitation?  The Centre for Cross-Border Studies and others are offering guidance in this area, and Deputy Brendan Smith referred to help from the universities as well.  We have to make sure that we maximise the spend and the investment to ensure that all the regions survive.</p></speech>

There has been co-operation between the three Border areas and there could be more.  It would be good to probe and ask that question of the other Border regions.  The central Border region has always been open to engagement, and has backed the idea, developed by the Centre for Cross-Border Studies, of a Border development zone.  There are many examples where issues can be tackled Border region-wide, and there are examples which we have mentioned today that have to be tackled.  We would be very keen to engage.</p></speech>

I believe we need to find a bit of common ground, when it comes to tackling Brexit, between North and South and the UK.  We have to keep trading as we have been, without tariffs or things like that.

It shows the importance of collegiality and of people having a voice.  In my time in this House this is the biggest delegation to come into the Gallery.  I reassure them that this will not be the end of our engagement; the secretariat, in the planning programme, will note that we intend to have an outreach visit to the central Border region shortly.  I cannot indicate exactly when that engagement will occur - Brexit is taking precedence at the moment - but we are in the process of planning that visit.  We hope to spend much more time with the witnesses and to see the issues first hand, in the same way that European parliamentarians visited the Border region to find out how the Border operates, as Senator Craughwell and Deputy Brendan Smith pointed out.  I can assure the witnesses of that, as someone who has worked in and lived around the Border.</p><p>If one were to close one's eyes when meeting a group and if one did not know who the group were, what their faith was or what region they came from, one would see the problems are the same whether in the north west, ICBAN or the north east.  It is a question of identifying issues and working collaboratively; that collegiality was referred to by many here today.  Mr. Baird spoke about Ulster Scots; I developed Ulster Scots in Dundalk.  I thank the witnesses for their time today.</p><p> We will suspend briefly before our next guests come in.  </p></speech>

The Ireland-Northern Ireland Border area is the focal point of Brexit negotiations.  Much mention has been made of the peace process and the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  This is in no small part due to the proactive approach taken by local authorities along the Border in the wake of the June 2016 referendum on Brexit.  EBR is a genuine cross-Border organisation.  It includes three local authorities in the Republic of Ireland and three in Northern Ireland and comprises elected members from all political parties, North and South, chief executives and senior officials from the six member councils.  The post of chairman rotates annually across the Border.  EBR was the first cross-Border group to elect a chair from the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP.  Apart from the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement, there are very few other genuine cross-Border organisations on the island of Ireland.  Examples include the North West Region, ICBAN, the Centre for Cross Border Studies and Co-Operation and Working Together, CAWT, which operates between the health boards.<br/><br/>Cross-Border co-operation on the island of Ireland is relatively young.  The impetus came in the 1970s from local elected representatives, North and South, who recognised the value of cross-Border co-operation.  The North West Region in 1995 and EBR in 1996 were the first cross-Border organisations on the island.  It is important to note also that cross-Border co-operation was not then fashionable.  The policy of both Governments was &quot;back-to-back&quot; development.<br/><br/>One of the founding members of EBR, Councillor Jim McCart, who lived in Warrenpoint, County Down, stated:</p><blockquote>Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s there was literally no cooperation at any level, political or otherwise, between Local Authorities adjacent to the border.  I didn&rsquo;t know any of the councillors in Omeath despite the fact that I could look out my front door and see Omeath.  It simply wasn&rsquo;t the done thing.</blockquote> <p>Councillors and officials who were members of EBR worked under the shadow of the wider political situation.  The political climate made it difficult to attend meetings across the Border but local representatives persevered because they quickly realised that back-to-back development was not working.  They also realised that there were areas of common concern across the Border, that there was a strength in working together and that the Border region, North and South, was disadvantaged.  Working on a cross-Border basis was extremely difficult throughout the 1970s and 1980s.There was no funding from the authorities in Dublin or Belfast because cross-Border co-operation was not fashionable.<br/><br/>EBR, however, has always worked against the backdrop of the European Union.  Indeed, it was the European Union in the early 1990s which first provided financial assistance for cross-Border development in the form of the INTERREG programme and the subsequent PEACE programme.  While there are more than 70 INTERREG programmes across Europe, the PEACE programme is unique to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and demonstrates the commitment of other EU member states to peace in Northern Ireland.  Substantial EU INTERREG and PEACE funding from the 1990s enabled the transformation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland Border region economically and socially.  It also ensured that local authorities were at the forefront of cross-Border economic development.  EU funding enabled EBR to be more outward looking, to share and learn from counterparts in other areas across Europe and to realise that the Ireland-Northern Ireland Border area suffers similar problems to other border regions in Europe.<br/><br/>While the Good Friday Agreement was a catalyst for further cross-Border co-operation, it is important to note that such co-operation has never been easy and must not be taken lightly.  Over the past 40 years, the members of EBR have believed that cross-Border co-operation makes sense.  It still makes sense in the face of Brexit.  Capacity and trust have developed between elected members and officials and EBR has built up an excellent track record in the management of EU funding.  EBR has always adopted a bottom up and needs-based approach to cross-Border co-operation, where the views of local authorities and key stakeholders in the region are paramount.  This strategy has been extremely successful as Alderman Hatch will now outline.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

It is nice to see what I will not term old faces but faces I have known for some time.  EBR is financially managing eight large strategic INTERREG VA projects to the value of &euro;91 million.  An application for a further &euro;9.2 million is being assessed by the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB.  All of these projects are highly innovative and EBR is delighted to play a pivotal role in them.  I have circulated a copy of our most recent annual report, which will provide members with some detail on each of these INTERREG VA projects.  I hope members will find that interesting reading.</p> <p>  EBR has been involved in all of the INTERREG programmes to date, drawing down millions of euro for a host of projects which have benefited communities along the entire Border corridor.  This money has contributed significantly to the modernisation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland Border corridor.  I will outline a few examples to give members a flavour of the type of projects EBR is currently implementing.  We are involved in two greenway projects.  One is from Newry to Carlingford, and links in to the existing greenway from Carlingford to Omeath, and the other runs from Smithborough in County Monaghan to Middletown in County Armagh.</p><p>These are two genuinely cross-Border greenways and they will have a significantly positive impact on the Border region.</p><p> The current application, for &euro;9.2 million, is to install a necklace of 73 rapid electric vehicle chargers along the Ireland-Northern Border and to include the western coast of Scotland.  This is a highly strategic project involving organisations such as the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Ulster University, Dundalk Institute of Technology and the local authorities along the Border corridor.  It seeks to raise public awareness and increase the use of electric vehicles.</p><p> As well as working with our local authorities, EBR has entered into strategic partnerships with a wide range of key stakeholders that are implementing INTERREG VA projects.  This includes organisations such as Irish Water, Northern Ireland Water, InterTradeIreland, and the Ulster Wildlife Trust, in addition to a number of universities in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  EBR provides a unique service to these projects in respect of the financial management of EU funding, thus ensuring all expenditure is in line with the programme rules.</p><p> The Co-Innovate programme led by InterTradeIreland will assist 1,409 businesses within the INTERREG VA eligible area and is particularly useful in the current context of Brexit.  As a result of this collaborative approach and the expertise that has been developed over the years of managing EU funding, EBR has built up strong networks locally, nationally and internationally.</p><p> We remain an active member of the Association of European Border Regions, AEBR, which is a network of cross-border regions across Europe.  EBR is respected by government departments in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Brussels, and it has developed good working relationships with the special EU programmes body, Deputies, Senators, MPs, MLAs and MEPs.  The former secretary general of AEBR, Mr. Jens Gabbe, said EBR is an indispensable link in the Europe-wide network of AEBR.  He also stated this cross-Border co-operation has contributed to remarkable positive economic and social development in Ireland and Northern Ireland and created verifiable added value.  While there is no doubt that the myriad EU-funded projects that have been drawn down over the past 25 years have significantly contributed to the growth of the Border economy, there is no room for complacency.</p><p> Over the past 40 years, EBR has displayed an astute ability to adapt to the many challenges that have faced the organisation at both local and national levels.  This flexible approach and the pragmatism displayed by local elected politicians and local authority senior officials have ensured that EBR has survived while similar organisations have come and gone.  In the face of the Brexit challenge, it is essential that we adhere to our core principle, that is, to promote sustainable, cross-Border economic development that benefits the citizens of the region.  Brexit, however, will be a game changer.  I will now hand over to our chief executive of many years, Ms Pamela Arthurs, to discuss this further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pamela Arthurs" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#M00200"><p>The Ireland-Northern Ireland Border corridor will be most impacted by Brexit, irrespective of what type of Brexit we end up with.  Even if there were no Brexit, there would still be an impact.  The impact will be on economic, political and social levels.  Economists agree that despite the supports the Border region has received to date, it still lags behind the rest of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Economists also agree that Brexit will exacerbate this.  Business in the region is less confident and more reluctant to expand as the future is so uncertain.  Current developments at Westminster have compounded the problem.  This has already been evidenced.  Mr. Dan O&rsquo;Brien, chief economist of the Institute of International and European Affairs, stated at a Brexit event in Dublin on 4 December 2018 that while employment growth overall in Ireland is good, employment in the Border region has faltered since 2016.  While Brexit has highlighted many needs that already exist, it has also highlighted future requirements.<br/><br/>What has been the local authority response to Brexit?  In the immediate aftermath of the referendum, once we all picked ourselves up off the seats, local authorities began a sustained lobby to highlight the needs of the people of the east Border region.  It quickly became clear, however, that we needed to work with our colleagues along the Border because it is a Border issue, affecting the North and South. <b></b>Especially with the absence of a government in Northern Ireland, local authorities along the Border felt it necessary to articulate and lobby for the needs of the 1 million constituents of the Border region.  I hope members are all familiar with the report, Brexit and the Border Corridor on the Island of Ireland: Risks, Opportunities and Issues to Consider.  It was commissioned by the 11 local authorities which make up the Border corridor.  Facilitated by EBR, this report brought together the chief executives of the councils and clearly identified that the economy of the Border region lags behind the economies of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It also outlines that the Border will be most detrimentally affected by Brexit.<br/><br/>What were the recommendations of the report?  We need to address the structural weaknesses in the Border region.  Also required are the upgrading of transport and broadband infrastructure, which would assist with connectivity in the region, and ongoing business support measures to assist businesses in preparing for and dealing with the impact of Brexit.  The majority of businesses in the Border corridor are small.  Many are microbusinesses, with fewer than ten employees.They do not have either the money or time to prepare for what they believe might happen as a result of Brexit.  The uncertainty will see many of them go to the wall.<br/><br/>Also important are a focus on relevant skill levels in the region and some kind of Brexit transition programme along the lines of a territorial co-operation programme to assist the Border region to adapt to the challenges of Brexit.  This needs to be broadly based because Brexit will affect every sector.  I do not believe we care who provides funding, but the continuation of the EU-type funding programmes, or alternative funding programmes, is required.  I refer to the broad range.  We are most familiar with INTERREG, the cross-Border group, the PEACE programme, Horizon 2020, the rural development programme and Erasmus.  We will lose a raft of programmes in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>We believe in the east Border region.  Members will have heard Mr. Hatch say we have always been ready to adapt to the particular challenges of the Border.  We need new policy, new thinking and new methods of co-operation and partnership between local authorities in conjunction with central government in both the Republic of Ireland and Belfast.  That is important.  It is essential for Border management to work in the wake of Brexit.<br/><br/>To date, the majority of the funding that has come to the Border region through cross-Border initiatives has been from Europe, not the Government.  There has been some funding from the South but nothing really from Northern Ireland.  The money that has come in through the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which are cross-Border programmes, has come from the European Union.  Both Governments could argue they match funding but the impetus and drive have been from the European Union to date.<br/><br/><b></b>The 11 Border local authorities now want to work with both Governments to develop and propose creative solutions for Border management.  Local authorities along the Border wish to develop a bottom-up, needs-based strategy for the Border corridor to offset the challenges and identify any opportunities associated with Brexit.  One should bear in mind that there are members in the Northern Border council areas who believe there are opportunities.  We must take the mandate of all those elected representatives.  As local authorities, that is what we will do.<b></b>This fresh strategic approach should be endorsed by both Governments to support the Border region practically.  This is not about airy-fairy considerations.</p><p>This is about what we require practically.  The strategic work will build on the report.  Tomorrow we will meet chief executives from along the Border and officials from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Northern Ireland Executive to drive this forward.  We want to use this to establish priorities for action.  We need to engage with local stakeholders, social partners and business.  It is needs based and must take account of the people of the area.</p><p> Implementation structures and sources of funding are very important.  While local authority staff and elected members have the knowledge and commitment at local level, some aspects of the work may require a more regional approach.  Issues may be identified that can best be tackled at Border corridor level.  There may also be issues that are particularly pertinent to the east, central Border or north-west region.  The strategy we are commissioning as we speak will identify these.  We will have requirements along the Border corridor and at high level, and within these we will have priorities in each region.</p><p> High level support and commitment from both Governments is essential if this approach is to be successful.  Existing local authority cross-Border groups, including ICBAN, ourselves and the North West Region Cross Border Group, are well placed.  We have a proven track record in co-ordinating, facilitating and managing dedicated interventions in respect of this approach.  To be carried out, it also needs to be led at top level, as this approach is, by the chief executives of the 11 local authorities but they require the resources to do this.  In my view, the solution suggested by the Border corridor local authorities, which is bottom-up, needs based and driven and delivered locally has the best opportunity for success.</p></speech>

When Mr. O'Hanlon began his presentation he reminded me of how local authorities can overcome all sorts of issues by working together.  Sometimes things are driven locally that nationally we could not dream of doing.  I am mindful of the fact that the day after the referendum Ms Keogan was on the phone to me demanding resources for local authorities for the Border region.  There is serious drive at local level and I am delighted to have heard the presentation.</p> <p>  Not one of the witnesses presented anything negative.  They have created an air of co-operation that feeds through what I have heard from various ambassadors.  I am a member of the European affairs committee.  All of the ambassadors speak in glowing terms about how they were treated on the Border and how they were briefed on it.  This is the same as all of the parliamentary delegations that have come to Ireland.  They have gone away in no doubt.  Michel Barnier himself speaks about the Border with a level of passion one would not expect from a foreigner.  This is down to the work being done by local authorities in the area.  However, the day after the referendum I wrote a piece on the Border and, I am afraid, it was negative.  It had anything but the positivity I have heard from the witnesses.  Whether it is a hard or soft Brexit, I fear it will change our relationships forever but, after listening to Mr. O'Hanlon and Mr. Hatch, I am not so convinced that the change will be detrimental because I believe they will find ways of working around issues and this is important.</p> <p>  As we heard from the previous witnesses, much of the money that has gone into Northern Ireland since 1998 has gone in at a high level, such as into academia, and not much money is going down to the ordinary level.  Infrastructure has been mentioned and my fear is that in a mismatch of funding post-Brexit the infrastructure on the Northern side will change to the detriment of the development of the economy or sustaining the economy as it is now.  I am interested to know the view of Ms Arthurs specifically on how she sees the UK matching funding from the EU.  I do not see EU money going North of the Border.</p> <p>  With regard to the flight of industry, I am sure the councillors from the South will accept it would be so easy for a company that wants to remain in the European Union but, post-Brexit, is on the wrong side of the Border - for the want of a definition - to slip across the Border and set up offices in Dundalk, Drogheda or County Meath.  We have met businesses in Northern Ireland that have said they will do this if the business is interfered with.</p> <p>  The group of Independent Senators of which I am a member went to Belfast prior to Christmas to meet members of the business community.  They told us the only thing they want is certainty.  They do not care whether it is a hard, soft any other type of Brexit, they just want certainty so they can start to make plans.  Has Ms Arthurs had any negative feedback from businesses in the area?  Clearly this shows there is a huge commitment to the area.  Have the businesses come to her and said they are in trouble?</p></speech>

An example I can give is that when a group of MPs in Westminster were looking into the UK prosperity fund that will replace EU funding a number of cross-Border groups were asked to comment on it and we did so.  We delivered a strong response on the need for cross-Border co-operation.  When the report was published it made little or no reference to cross-Border co-operation.  We must bear in mind the Northern Ireland Border region will be competing with England, Scotland, Wales, the rest of Northern Ireland and Belfast.  We have always been on the periphery and we are still on the periphery in this respect.  I do not see money coming to replace the moneys from Europe that we along the Border enjoy, and bear in mind we punch above our weight with regard to the money we have received to date.</p> <p>  Europe is committed to cross-Border co-operation.  The British and Irish Governments have committed to seeing out the current programmes and the PEACE PLUS programme, which will comprise INTERREG and PEACE as we know them today.  The EU has committed it will fund this programme to the value of &euro;600 million.  We know we have this, irrespective of a no-deal Brexit.  This shows the commitment of Europe and the other 27 member states to peace in Northern Ireland.  There will be no funding from Westminster, unless, perhaps, we engage in sustained lobbying to try to raise the profile, but we must bear in mind that Brexit will cost money and there are many priorities that will come above cross-Border co-operation.  I do not think enough money will be left to look seriously at cross-Border co-operation and the work we have done to date.</p> <p>  I am speaking about economic development and we can see INTERREG on the ground, which is good, but there will be a hard economic impact on members working together and this could possibly be lost.  I hope an organisation such as ours, with 40 years of history, will be able to keep it going.</p><p>We will be able to keep that going, but without money, there is always a need for a carrot.  As Councillor O'Hanlon said, cross-Border co-operation is never easy.  One is constantly walking a tightrope, particularly in Northern Ireland with all of our history.  It is something that is not easy and could be impacted despite the best intentions of everybody, not just here but on the boards of the groups along the Border.</p></speech>

If a company slips across the Border and sets up headquarters in this country, 90% of the companies are probably getting their goods from somewhere in the UK, whether it is Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  There will be difficulties if there is a hard Brexit and I think we all accept that.  Some transport companies we know have set up on both sides of the Border, on both sides of the river, to get the best of both worlds.</p> <p>  In terms of infrastructure, we would see it as being very important to get the A5 started, as it has been on the go for so many years.  Jim Nicholson, MEP, asked a question in the European Parliament this week about PEACE PLUS because it is not clear how that will be delivered in co-operation with the UK Government.  We have to keep lobbying.  One of the fortes of the East Border Region is that we can lobby right across Europe if we have to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P.J.

I have lived along the Border and spent two years in Donegal.  The people of Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal, without putting a tooth in it, have been forgotten about.  The project has been talked about for 30 to 40 years.  It is grand coming down here and having meetings and making presentations but it is disheartening for those living in those areas to see what is happening.  One asks oneself what it is all about.  How serious are we about Brexit?  Unless we have a proper infrastructure in place, we are not sending a very good message out to the people in Border regions.  Anyone who has travelled from Emyvale to Letterkenny knows it is a four to five hour round trip.  It is nearly easier to travel from Emyvale to Cork than it is to go to the top end of Donegal.  Nothing is being done about it.  If we are genuinely serious about this, we need to invest and put infrastructure in place.  Without being political, I accept there are challenges such as Brexit but to leave part of the island of Ireland without proper infrastructure, is extremely disappointing.</p></speech>

It is enlightening to hear the work that is going on and the commitment to delivering it.  Reference was made to the Border corridor.  I have always thought we could have an economic zone the full length of the Border.  Would Ms Arthurs envisage the three or four groups along the Border linking up to try to create that in the future?  It may not be necessary to maintain all of the groups in order to create such an economic corridor right across the Border on both sides.  Have the witnesses found any possible sources of funding?  The European Union provides cross-border funding to countries that border it in order to alleviate problems.  It would be useful to see the examples of that.</p> <p>  In the past, the Assembly's finance committee approached the British Government on the possibility of funding from the European bank.  The UK, as a net contributor to the European Union at that stage, was reluctant to fund too many projects in the North because it would have to co-fund them as well.  That is one of the problems we have in that situation.  If we could create an economic corridor along the Border, rather than being a Border of disadvantage it could become an advantage in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pamela Arthurs" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#O00600"><p>I think that is what is needed if we are to properly tackle the disadvantage along the Border.  Many people say one is better off on the east but there are still pockets of deprivation, for example, in Dundalk.  We talk about the road infrastructure, which is important, but the B roads are not particularly good.  There is a range of needs right along the Border.</p> <p>  We are currently talking to the 11 chief executives along the Border.  We do not know what to call it.  Sometimes there can be sensitivities around the name and whether it is an economic development zone or whatever else.  It does not really matter what it is called, what is important is identifying the priorities and needs and getting them funded.  That is essential and if we speak as one voice, we will be stronger.</p> <p>  We do have history in that regard.  Twenty years ago the three groups &ndash; the East Border Region, ICBAN and the North West Region Cross Border Group &ndash; worked really closely because our members wanted local people to make decisions on the then INTERREG III programme.  Some of those present might have been involved at that time.  Civil servants in Belfast and Dublin did not want to let go of the control so what happened is that decisions for the Border were made in Dublin and Belfast by officials.  We had a concerted lobby.  The three groups worked together, which was a challenge.  We had a Border corridor strategy at that time and we ended up with &euro;53.9 million out of an &euro;180 million programme which the Vice Chairman will remember.  The programme was delivered locally be elected members and social partners.  That was a high point of cross-Border co-operation.  Unfortunately, what has happened since that time is the two programmes have become centralised again and sometimes one finds that the pure local cross-Border groups are not being funded to their detriment, depending on the priorities of the Government.</p> <p>  Even with the PEACE PLUS programme we need to have elements of that strategy for a Border corridor.  We can develop that quickly and elements of it require funding, going into the consultation for PEACE PLUS.  My view is that the genuine cross-Border needs should be funded by a cross-Border programme.  I entirely agree with what was said about the strength and the impact being in working together.  Many years ago when it was only the East Border Region and the North West Region Cross Border Group, they competed all the time and there was always this idea in the east that John Hume got everything for the north west.  Perhaps that was not true but perception is reality.  When we worked together 20 years ago we became a bit subsumed in INTERREG and managing the money and perhaps the higher strategic aims were lost at that stage because we have a small staff.  In the face of Brexit there is an opportunity to turn something which is a big disadvantage into an opportunity moving forward.  Again, the key point is that we need the Governments to work with us.  We need them to recognise the need in the Border corridor as well.  The good thing about the meeting tomorrow is that we have the Departments here and we also have the officials from the Northern Ireland Executive who will be around the table with us.  Hopefully they will buy into the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

Does Ms Arthurs see that as important?  As I stated, many areas have the same issues but many of them also have strengths that can be used to attract funding.  Does she see merit in that type of approach?</p><p>Do the three groups here - North West, ICBAN and the East Border Region - need to be facilitated in order to return to the position of 20 years ago?</p></speech>

It is probably the point at where it started 20 years ago where the chief executive and council level worked together.  It is important that they do that.  We have been facilitating that since the referendum.  It is difficult to get a date that suits 11 chief executives in order to get them around the table but they have been doing that.  I think that they will agree the approach and if they decide there are three groups, then we will develop that for them.  There is a need to work in a cross-Border manner and the current structure is cross-Border groups.  I do not anticipate that they will propose a new structure; there are already enough structures there, but it is about making the best use of them.  In the East Border Region, we have continually adapted to whatever the need is and will continue to do so.  It is best that it is currently led by the top level in the 11 local authorities.  That is the message that the Governments here and in Northern Ireland have been given.</p></speech>

Brexit is a challenge to the whole island of Ireland, there is no question, but for counties such as Fermanagh, Tyrone, Armagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal, it will have a massive impact compared with Cork and Kerry.  The amount of business, and their interaction, that I have seen in recent years that crosses the Border has developed Monaghan as a county.  So much good work has been done by East Border Region.  Mr. Molloy is 100% correct.  Something must be put in place.  I am very concerned that the amount of business that is done on the Border between those counties would be significantly harmed compared with the rest of Ireland.  We cannot allow that to happen.  It has been so beneficial.  For people who have lived along the Border, such as Deputy Breathnach, it has been fantastic to see how these counties have developed in recent years.  If something is not put in place, whether it is bringing all the groups together as an entity and working together, I am fearful for what will happen along the Border.  I do not want to contemplate that, we just cannot go back there.</p></speech>

Members maybe familiar with Flurrybridge Enterprise Centre.  It is across the road from the Carrickdale Hotel.  Some years ago, people working in the Newry co-operative identified that site and said they wanted to build a business park there.  At the time most people asked who in their right mind would build a business park there but it currently employs 300 people.  It has taken small businesses - only small businesses - from barns and so on in the area - some of them may not have been as legal as they should have been - and brought them out there.  Again, it was the EU which funded it, based on the local people identifying a need there.  None of the units in the centre is empty.  If one is leaving the business park and turns left, one is in Ireland and if one turns right, one is in Northern Ireland.  Many groups have visited.  One group of MPs from Westminster asked a businessman who is based there for many years why he would not just move across the Border or go to Dundalk.  He told them that it suited him to be there and asked why he would do that.  He said that he has leased property in Dundalk, which was costing him a lot of money, although he hoped he would never have to move to it, but that many others in the centre did not have the finances to start leasing in the South.  That is the reality.  I think many businesses would say that the worst thing is the uncertainty.  When one knows what one is dealing with, one can start to deal with it but instead there is ongoing uncertainty which is costing people money.  It was pointed out earlier in the week that businesses are not expanding because they do not know what will happen.  They want some answers but they are not forthcoming.</p></speech>

Most of the councils in Northern Ireland are in some sort of a city deal, such as Belfast which includes Newry, Mourne and Down, while the consortium in the north west of Derry, Strabane and Fermanagh and Omagh, then Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council etc., are involved in discussing a growth deal.  Is there something similar for the regional assemblies or the D&aacute;il that might buy into that concept of a structure along the Border which could focus on those Border counties?</p></speech>

As I said at the earlier session, one could close one's eyes and listen to either group, or even people of different persuasions North or South; if one did not know their names and where they came from their problems are exactly the same.</p> <p>  To respond to Mr. Hatch's question, I agree that there is need for a co-ordinated strategy, accepting that the East Border group is working on one with the 11 managers.  Someone at intergovernmental level needs to listen and recognise that as Mr. O'Hanlon and others have noted, in the vacuum that is there, and regardless of what happens, whether there is a soft Brexit or no Brexit, there needs to be an impetus for the region which needs reinvestment.  The peace is fragile - that is not a throwaway phrase - and the area needs economic injection collaboratively and collectively.  There was a clear message from the previous session that there is a need to identify the strengths of the different areas and work as a unit in relation to the various funding streams, regardless of Brexit.  As Mr. Molloy noted, the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, was before the committee over 12 months ago.  It said there were opportunities for other programmes that were trans-territorial that may not necessarily involve parties' membership of the EU.  We will have to wait and see about that.  However, there is a real need for joined-up thinking, although I hate that phrase, in getting Europe and others to recognise the need for investment. </p></speech>

Their contribution today has been very insightful and I am delighted to see them all in Dublin for this.</p> <p>  Ms Arthurs put it that if businesses know, they can plan.  I have been saying that for the past two years.  There is now more meat on the bones of what will most likely happen post Brexit.  Businesses are finding that it is impossible to implement a plan.  </p> <p>  This week Seamus Leheny from the Freight Transport Association tweeted that he had been contacted by a company that had applied for 37 licences and been given two.  The agrifood industry is deeply integrated and the supply chain is across the island.</p><p>One of the businesses in the ICBAN region, which is part of my constituency, has primary processing on one side of the Border and secondary processing on the other, and it has been told it cannot import or export.

Unfortunately, as a result of the currency situation, some companies and businesses will go to the wall.  It is a sad state of affairs.  Ms Gildernew spoke about the Fermanagh area but it applies throughout the region.  The food industry is very important for the cross-Border region because of the agricultural background.  What the Government needs to do is make it easier for these people.  Somebody with a freight company making an application in regard to processed food, for example, has to deal with far too much red tape.</p> <p>  We are telling the committee what we feel are the issues on the ground, but it is the Government that needs to make decisions.  I listened to a presentation two weeks ago by a gentleman from Customs and Excise on the issues and challenges.  While I do not want to be dramatic, if we do not have anything in place for this, there is no doubt there will be serious consequences.  All the good work that is being done economically in regard to jobs and so on will be seriously negatively impacted.  Whether it is done by civil servants from Northern Ireland or the Republic, solutions need to be found to make life easier.  It is difficult enough to run a business and make it successful and viable in the current economic climate without adding challenges.  My deep concern is that, two months out from Brexit, and we all know the can will probably be kicked down the road-----</p></speech>

Councillor O'Hanlon referred to InterTradeIreland, but Northern Ireland businesses have not had much support for something that is so dramatic.  Change is always difficult, but there has not been that support on the northern side of the Border.  We heard about Brexit fatigue a year ago from people here.  We have not had it in Northern Ireland, apart from my children saying they are sick listening to it on the news, and asking why, if it is all that bad, people are continuing with it.  There has not been that support or that leadership in Northern Ireland that there has been here, where the local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been working consistently with businesses and there have been a number of workshops.  We have not had the same degree of support when there is the same need in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

The chambers of commerce are going to Westminster and Theresa May is coming over here and getting different stories on different visits.  Many small businesses are just sitting waiting until somebody tells them what the decision is so they can get the paperwork ready if they have to or do no paperwork if they do not have to.  That is the point they are at.  However, there is no Government-led support in Northern Ireland.  We are a remote north-west corner of the UK, so we are not a big player in the total scheme of things.</p></speech>

Others have mentioned issues of broadband and mobile coverage, especially in the cross-Border context, and the need for people to recognise those issues need to be addressed.  Mr. Hatch mentioned the absence of the Executive.  Clearly, we are being told that the postponement of the A5 is based on the fact arrangements cannot be made in that respect, and we were told the same in regard to what is happening with the interconnector.  Does anybody care to comment on those issues around broadband and the need for us all to realise we have to start to work together to deliver for our region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1716" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P.J. O'Hanlon" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019021400002#Q00900"><p>In regard to broadband, whatever about working together, we have had a plan here for many years and I do not know where it is going.  There are parts of Monaghan which do not have broadband and the way things are going, without being disrespectful, the can is being kicked down the road with regard to the introduction of broadband.  It is an issue for Government when it is going to deliver on that.  From the perspective of local councillors in the east Border region who are trying to help the situation, there are people in these Houses dealing with this issue and we have had resignations and people coming and going in this context.  The Government needs to get its act sorted out in regard to broadband.  That is why it is here.  While I do not mean to be disrespectful, I do not think it has been very successful.</p> <p>  With regard to the interconnector, nobody in County Monaghan is stopping the interconnector.  Let us be clear about that.  There is this perception that we are holding it up.  Instead, we are looking for the interconnector to go underground.  We were told, when this came out a number of years ago, that it was going to cost 40 times more to put it underground than overground, when I have been told it will cost twice as much.  As a group in Monaghan County Council, we are 18 councillors from all political persuasions and groups.  We do not always agree but we steadfastly stand together in regard to the interconnector.  We are not stopping development and we are not saying we do not want an interconnector.  However, the people of County Monaghan, including the landowners, deserve better and they have not been given the respect they deserve on this issue.  We, as political groupings, stand together with those people, not because it is political but because it is the right thing to do for our county.  There is not a word about Grid West.  It is gone by the wayside and I wonder why.  We all know why.  What I am saying is that the group of 18 councillors have no issue with an interconnector but we want it underground.  The people who are looking to do this, and I might as well say it while I am here, made a planning application 12 to 18 months ago that cost the taxpayer &euro;7 million and had to be withdrawn.  There is no accountability.  Nobody is talking or dealing with the people on the ground.</p> <p>  Let us think about it.  This unites Sinn F&eacute;in, Independent, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors.  It does not happen too often and it certainly does not happen in this building, but we are united in regard to defending our own county, and we will always do that.  Let us be clear.  We have no issue with the interconnector but we have an issue with overground.  That is what the people of County Monaghan want and that is what we are elected to do.  While we are there, we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

There is an industrial estate there, the Carn industrial estate, where Moy Park, Irwin's and many food companies are located.</p><p>If we do not get a better electricity supply we will not be able to expand.  Development in Craigavon is held up because of the lack of the interconnector.  I cannot comment on whether it should go over ground or underground.  As the planning application may well come to the planning committee of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, I have to keep an open mind on the subject.  Regardless of from what source it comes, be that Scotland or Dublin, it is needed now for Northern Ireland to grow, never mind the Border corridor.  We are only 20 miles from the Border and we are affected.  </p><p> In terms of broadband, I was living in cuckoo land because I thought that the programme in the South would roll out a minimum of 80 Mbps of fibre to every household over the next for or five years.  I presumed that was going ahead and we were sitting jealously watching from the North.  One our of councillors who lives in the Banbridge area cannot get broadband.  There are two contracts floating about, one of which is a local contract with BT which will take fibre to hubs which will then circulate it to businesses.  The second contract is a BT contract which allows the company to decide where the work starts, which is usually the highest area, working outwards into the country because there is more money in the cental areas than there is in the peripheral areas.  We are trying to get a contract which is the opposite.  We want BT to service the worst areas first and work inwards.  Regardless of what way it is done, we need it done now.</p></speech>

As I listened to them I realised the nightmare they are going through.  I live in Dublin.  I sometimes feel that even in Leinster House we are in a cocoon.  Mr. O'Hanlon nailed it when he said that what is happening to the people in the Border regions is really sad.  It is scary.  Until I heard the presentations today from both groups I was not aware of the anxiety among people in the Border region.  I get the impression from what the witnesses said that they feel the Border counties have been forgotten.  It must be scary that businesses are anxious and constantly worried about job losses.  All of this must be having a huge impact on people's lives.</p> <p>  Earlier, I spoke about mental health and the impact of anxiety on people.  I know from my charitable work that the number of inquiries from the Monaghan, Castleblayney and Dundalk areas has increased.  We have a service in Dundalk but there is a demand for our service in the Monaghan area, which seems to have arisen out of the referendum.  My point is that but for the witnesses being here today talking about the fears, anxiety, stress and worry among people in the Border area, I would not have been aware of it.  It is wonderful that they are unified in trying to address the issues.  There is no doubt but that there is strength in unity.  Ms Arthurs mentioned how the three organisations came to work together.  There is no doubt that when people work together they are heard.  The delegates are fighting for the people in their communities and that is important.  </p> <p>  I do a lot of work in the mental health and addiction areas.  These are areas I know a lot about and at every opportunity I raise them.  The mental health of people is what I would be most concerned about.  I cannot imagine what it must be like to live in a community that is anxious all of the time.  I will put the same question to this group that I put to the group we met earlier.   What would the delegations like the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to do?  Do they have a specific ask of us as a committee?  This is a good committee.  We are all very passionate about the Good Friday Agreement and the issues raised today.  What do the groups need from us?</p></speech>

We can want to do various things along the Border and demonstrate the need for same but if central Government can work with us that endorses the work we are doing.  We also know then that Government recognises that work.  We have outlined the disadvantages for the Border area, North and South.  We are working to put meat on the bones in terms of what needs to be done.  As I said earlier, the Taoiseach's office and the Northern Ireland Executive have asked us to set out our requirements.  It is important we can move forward together to develop the Border corridor.  We have key asks and priorities in respect of which we need Government to support us.  For example, earlier we mentioned the &euro;600 million for the PEACE PLUS programme.  We would like to see that money, and a large part of the INTERREG funding, focused on the Border area.  We are grateful for the current INTERREG programme under which we are financially managing eight large strategic projects.  However, I think this programme is very centralised.  We are about local delivery that suits the needs of local people along the Border.  The two member states can influence that programme to ensure it delivers on the identified needs of the Border corridor.  We would like funding from this programme ring-fenced for the Border corridor.  The EU definition of a border region is any region within 250 miles of a border.  We can demonstrate that the areas closest to the Border are the most deprived and have the most need.  Therefore, we suggest that these areas should receive a chunk of cross-Border economic development funding to assist them.  The cross-Border organisations that work on a daily basis in these areas should also be supported.  We need central Government to recognise and value the work we are doing and to put its money where its mouth is by supporting us.  These programmes require buy-in from Northern Ireland as well.  That is what would make a difference to us moving forward.  The PEACE programme is there to be consulted on.  We have taken part in consultations in the past and we have sometimes wondered if anybody listened.  It is key that the areas that are most deprived and most in need of funding benefit from cross-Border moneys.</p></speech>

Belfast clearly has very little say on what is going on.  I have heard and understand the witnesses' frustration.  It strikes me that nobody is going to blink until everybody blinks and we are 43 days away from Brexit.</p><p>Going back to Senator Black's point on mental health, if I was a businessman in the North I would be screaming to the high heavens today.  They told us that on 20 December when we visited Belfast.  They wanted politicians to just tell them.  Hard, soft, they did not care.  We need to push for that. </p></speech>

Mental health is high on the agenda.  Ms Linda Barnes, a former BBC reporter, emphasised that.  It may surprise the committee, but I can provide a specific ask.  The Good Friday Agreement we have now is not what was agreed in 1998.  Whether it is politically possible or not, we need to go back to the principle of designation as opposed to privileging the largest party.  As long as the two largest parties nominate the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, there will always be division.  That can be seen clearly since the agreement was changed to operating on the basis of the largest party rather than designation.  That is my big ask.  If we are ever going to get Northern Ireland up and running properly so that there is proper co-ordination between all the parties, it must be shared fairly and equally among all of them.</p> <p>  I support Ms Arthurs on how to get this structure together, but we need to keep talking.  There must be an easy structure that would not make it too bureaucratic, which both Governments can feel comfortable feeding into.  The east Border region has the longest record of delivering cross-Border programmes so we are in pole position in terms of delivery if the Governments can just give us the funds to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P.J.

She referred to forgotten people.  I must be quite blunt and frank.  We have an awful lot more in common with the counties north of the Border than we do with the counties in Munster and so on.  That is the reality.  Socially and culturally we have an awful lot more in common with them.  For the past several years, the majority of people who have created employment in the counties along the Border and the county I live in come from Monaghan or Cavan.  We now realise as counties that we are the ones who will solve our problems.  Members asked if there was one thing the Government could do.  The one thing we need is hope.  I mean hope in respect of how we are going to develop.  I am in Omagh an awful lot more often than I am in Killarney or Cork.  That is not being disrespectful.  Those are the places that interact with where I live.</p> <p>  I will go back to this point, though people say it will not have any effect.  The A5 was the first project to go when there was an overspend of &euro;1 billion on a hospital.  The first message that was sent to the people, with Brexit 43 days away, was that it was off the agenda.  What message does that send to the people along the Border?  I ask the committee members to use whatever influence they have to change that decision.  Brexit is coming down the line.  I ask members to recognise that these people are going to be living and working with the challenges of that and commit to helping them as best they can.  That type of understanding and that message to the people along the Border would mean an awful lot. </p></speech>

I will make a couple of comments to conclude.  Having heard representations from two groups and having met representatives of the north-west region on the ground, it is important for the day that is in it to pay tribute to all of the committees working along the border.  Reference was made to the local authorities, the various committees and their executives, particularly the elected representatives from both sides who sit on them.  Equally I note the communities that have benefitted from them.  There have been many such communities over many years.  I commend all those groups for their work.</p> <p>  On a personal basis, as someone who has lived along the Border and who, like the witnesses, is passionate about the issues, the full and frank discussions with them and the previous group speak for themselves.  We could be negative but we have to be positive and ask what solutions can be found.  This committee looks forward to working with them.  We have heard what they have said.  The secretariat has taken note of what has been said and, hopefully, we can find solutions to work together.  Reference was made to the importance of getting the Executive up and running.  Co-operation, both North-South and east-west, is the order of the day in our efforts to move and progress.</p> <p>  Without any further ado I want to particularly thank Alderman Hatch, Councillor P.J. O'Hanlon and Ms Arthurs.  It would be remiss if I did not make reference to Ms Dette Hughes, Councillors Keoghan and Andrews from Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.  Hopefully, we can have further interaction with them.  This will not be the end of the discussion.  Our next visit will be to the ICBAN area.  It is in the planning stages, but we intend to undertake a visit to the region that would take a day or perhaps a little more, visiting projects and talking to communities.  This will, hopefully, lend weight to what the witnesses have said.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for providing that briefing.  In adjourning the meeting, we are looking forward to having the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, here at our next meeting.  We will meet again on 21 February, when the T&aacute;naiste will hear not just our views but also those that have been expressed here.  We will raise the concerns on Brexit and, equally important, the Border region's need for new and enhanced PEACE programmes and INTERREG initiatives to be put in place.  We also recognise that an economic zone needs to be catered to, including my own constituency, from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle and beyond.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance. </p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee members for this opportunity to update the committee on progress within the water sector.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Eamonn Waters, principal officer, water policy and rural water programme, and Mr. Colin Byrne, senior adviser, water and marine advisory unit.</p> <p>  I note that the committee specifically sought a briefing on developments on the recast directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption.  A separate written update briefing has been provided on this matter and we will be happy to deal with any questions arising.  The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, published by Government in May 2018, sets out the broad vision for the development of water and wastewater services in Ireland, whether through the public network or otherwise.  The statement, with three thematic areas of quality, conservation, and future proofing, is aligned with the river basin management plan for Ireland 2018-2021, Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland.  Irish Water published its strategic funding plan 2019-2024, as approved by the Minister on 7 November 2018.  Together, the policy statement and the strategic funding plan ensure a shared understanding between Government and Irish Water of the broad financial parameters and investment priorities and we will be happy to expand on these key documents.</p> <p>  The policy statement sets out four key principles that provide a useful framework within which I can update members on developments generally across the sector.  The principle of one, single, publicly-owned national water services authority is consistent with the recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, and the legislative reforms in the Water Services Acts.  In July 2018, the Government decided that Irish Water would become a stand-alone, publicly-owned, commercial, regulated utility separated from the Ervia group during 2023.  This was considered to be in the best strategic interests of the water services and gas networks businesses.  The separation also enhances the heightened level of transparency and accountability required for Irish Water, given the level of Exchequer funding being provided to it.  In this context, Irish Water has proposed fully integrating its operations and ending the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through service level agreements, SLAs, with local authorities.  This, of course, will give rise to significant organisational change for local authorities and their staff.</p> <p>  To this effect, on 19 September 2018, the director general of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, reported on a process of engagement, undertaken at the Minister&rsquo;s request with the parties involved in the transformation programme for Irish Water, including ICTU and relevant affiliated unions, local government management and the Department.  In response to the WRC report, the Minister asked the parties to engage in a process to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future.  This engagement is to commence in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Outside of the WRC process, the question of a constitutional amendment on the public ownership of water services is an important consideration in the context of the transformation programme.  The Minister&rsquo;s letter of 21 January 2019 to the chairperson of the committee outlines the current position on this matter.  We also note the committee's letter to the Minister, which was received this week.  The question of improving accountability through a potential role for the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding Irish Water also continues to be explored.</p> <p>  In line with the principle of fair and efficient delivery with a customer focus, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has a statutory responsibility to regulate the efficient delivery of water services in a balanced and even-handed manner that gives certainty and stability for customers and for Irish Water.  The approved strategic funding plan for 2019 to 2024 sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic funding requirement of &euro;11 billion to 2024, comprising a &euro;6.1 billion investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.  This certainty about the level of Government funding will give Irish Water a reasonable time horizon to plan and work towards achieving cost efficiencies and service improvements during this period.</p> <p>  The CRU is also overseeing Irish Water&rsquo;s policy proposals for addressing excess use of water services by domestic customers, as required under the Water Services Acts.  The amount to be charged for excess use will be determined by the CRU, informed by a public consultation commencing shortly.  The aim of this measure, as envisaged by the Oireachtas committee, is to encourage water conservation rather than to generate revenue.  We can discuss this in more detail if required.</p> <p>  On broader issues of public health and the quality of our environment, the Government approved the general scheme of a water environment (abstractions) Bill to bring us into compliance with the abstraction control requirements of the Water Framework Directive.  This will also ensure that there is an appropriate legal framework and a consent process in place to facilitate critical capital projects such as Irish Water&rsquo;s eastern and midlands water supply project to serve the Dublin and mid-east regions.  The current expected timeline would see legislation published by summer 2019.  The CRU, as economic regulator, has been asked to review Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed approach to the eastern and midlands water supply project.  The review report is expected later this year.</p> <p>  At a more general level, the important research, analysis and monitoring work undertaken by the EPA has shown that, over the past decade, the quality of our water has stood still, at best, with some concerning indications of decline in certain areas.  The European Commission has taken infringement cases against Ireland regarding the urban wastewater treatment directive and the drinking water directive.  Of the urban areas where wastewater works are required, the majority will be compliant by end-2021, including Ringsend, which is the single largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, accounting for 41% of the total wastewater load.</p> <p>  Regarding the drinking water directive, Ireland has made significant progress in addressing THM, or trihalomethanes, exceedances at public water supplies managed by Irish Water.  THMs are formed when chlorine used in drinking water treatment reacts with natural organic matter that remains following pre-treatment processes.  Full compliance is expected to be achieved by the end of 2021, with the exception of the Lough Talt regional water supply scheme where particular planning difficulties arise.  Irish Water has put in place new procedures for informing consumers of water quality issues where they are served by supplies listed on the EPA remedial action list.</p> <p>  It is essential that we take strong steps to protect and improve our water quality.  The River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021, published in April 2018, sets out a range of detailed actions and implementing measures.  Several specific actions are to be undertaken or are under way, involving local authorities and a range of State agencies.  We can expand on this area as required.  Public engagement on the next cycle of river basin management plans, to cover the period from 2022 to 2025, is also under way.</p> <p>  I want to conclude by making a brief mention of some recent developments which serve to strengthen public and stakeholder engagement.  The Water Advisory Body is now up and running on a statutory basis.  It has been empowered to advise the Minister on the measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water and to report to the Oireachtas on the performance of Irish Water in the implementation of its business plan.</p><p>An F&oacute;ram Uisce, the national water forum, is now place.  The purpose of the forum is to provide a national stakeholder-led platform for public engagement on all matters relating to water as an environmental, social and economic resource.  The forum provides an opportunity to debate and analyse a range of issues with regard to water quality, rural water concerns and issues affecting customers of Irish Water and the implementation of the EU water framework directive in this jurisdiction.</p><p> Last week, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced a revised multi-annual rural water programme.  The improved capital programme of &euro;23 million in 2019 provides for increased capital investment in group water schemes, a new grant measure for the development of community water services connections and enhanced grant schemes for private wells and septic tanks.  A total of &euro;75 million has been committed under the national development plan to 2021.  I have addressed some of the more significant recent developments in my remarks and I and my colleagues are happy to respond to any questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Darragh Page and Mr. Andy Fanning, who are programme managers with senior responsibility in the areas under discussion.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is an independent statutory body established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  It has a wide range of responsibilities, including that of environmental regulator of Irish Water.  The EPA's regulatory activities include the authorisation of wastewater facilities and the enforcement of those authorisations.  The urban wastewater treatment report series provides an annual overview of key compliance findings and recommendations relating to these facilities.  In addition, the EPA has statutory responsibility for monitoring the quality of the Irish environment, including the quality of our water courses and public access to this monitoring information.  The water quality indicators report series, which commenced in 2018, is part of the EPA's activities to meet its public information responsibility and it supplements the EPA's more comprehensive three yearly reports on water quality in Ireland.</p> <p>  The EPA's role in wastewater regulation is to regulate discharges under the wastewater discharge regulations, as amended.  While Irish Water, as the authorisation holder, is responsible for complying with authorisation conditions, the EPA enforces those conditions through an annual programme of inspections, monitoring and assessments.  To enforce compliance, the EPA uses its legislative powers when necessary, up to and including prosecution.  While committee members will note the detailed findings of our urban wastewater treatment report for 2017, I would highlight a number of them.  Of the 179 large towns and cities monitored, wastewater treatment at 28 of them failed to meet the required standards set to prevent pollution and protect public health.  Raw sewerage from the equivalent of 86,000 people in 37 towns and villages is still flowing into the Irish environment every day.  Wastewater is one of the main threats to the quality of our rivers, lakes and estuaries and contributed to poor bathing quality at six beaches in 2017.  The EPA acknowledges that these issues have not arisen overnight, that deficiencies exist in many treatment plants and public sewers due to a legacy of underinvestment, and that it is not possible to fix all the issues in the short term.  In the meantime, the resources that are available need to be targeted to deliver improvements where they are most needed.  In this regard, the EPA has identified the following as the most pressing issues that need to be addressed: the elimination of discharges of untreated wastewater; to treat wastewater from all large urban areas to meet European Union standards; to ensure wastewater does not cause pollution of inland and coastal waters; to improve treatment where required to protect bathing waters, shellfish waters and freshwater pearl mussels; and to rehabilitate or upgrade priority wastewater collection systems.  While welcome progress is being made, it is the EPA's position that Ireland is not addressing the deficiencies in wastewater treatment infrastructure at a fast enough pace and, consequently, our health is continually exposed to risk and the water quality of our rivers, lakes and coastal waters continues to be negatively impacted.</p> <p>  The EPA has a statutory role in monitoring the quality of the environment, including a specific responsibility for a programme of monitoring to provide a comprehensive overview of water quality status in Ireland.  To this end, we work with local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the Marine Institute and Waterways Ireland.  Arising from this work, and as part of our public information role, we published the Water Indicator Report 2017.  Each indicator summarises a particular water quality parameter and presents the current situation and an indication of recent change.  The findings include that there has been a net overall decline of 3% in good water quality over the two years 2016 and 2017, and long-term loss of high-quality river sites is continuing, with a further 0.6% decline since 2015.  Most water pollution is caused by too much nitrogen and phosphorus entering waters coming from human activities, predominantly farms and urban areas.  The increases in nutrients identified in the report are an early warning that we need to address the sources and the pathways by which these nutrients make their way into our rivers and lakes.  On the positive side, the report also found that serious pollution continues to decrease and fish kills were at an all-time low in 2017.  In summary, the signals in this report are not good and tell us that water quality is getting worse in some areas despite improvements in others.  The success in addressing serious pollution and the reduction in fish kills shows that we can make positive changes with appropriate interventions through targeted investment in infrastructure in tandem with improved operational practices.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for its interest in this important area of environmental protection and the EPA delegation will be happy to take any questions that members may have. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gallen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021400002#D00300"><p>I am the managing director of Irish Water.  I am joined today by Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, general manager, and Ms. Katherine Walshe, head of asset operations.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to provide a general update on progress and developments in the water sector.<br/><br/>The year 2018 presented many challenges to Irish Water's operations.  Two major storms, a number of serious incidents and a one in 70 year drought put our resources under significant pressure.  The Irish Water crisis management team was mobilised for long and sustained periods of the year managing these events.  While the effort required during these incidents was a considerable draw on the organisation, by working closely and collaboratively with our partners in the local authorities, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and a number of agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, the HSE, Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, the ESB, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and others, we managed to keep the water and wastewater plants and networks operating, despite very challenging conditions.  Field staff supported by logistical, procurement, communications and management teams worked tirelessly to minimise the impact on the people.<br/><br/>Managing national incidents helps Irish Water to refine continually its response to future events.  We have stores of spare parts, large static water containers and bottled water supplies strategically located, and arrangements are in place to mobilise tankers at short notice.  In addition, we work closely with our supply chain to ensure ready availability of critical equipment such as standby generators, etc.  We regularly test our processes, including communication protocols, and we are key participants in the national emergency  co-ordination group.<br/><br/>The most prolonged disruption to water services in 2018 was the drought, with<font color="#FF0000"> </font>water levels in rivers, lakes and aquifers reaching critical lows.  Working with our partners in local authorities, our plants throughout the country were operating at maximum capacity, but unfortunately water restrictions became unavoidable in the areas worst affected.</p><p>The first national water conservation order - commonly known as a hosepipe ban - came into effect in July.  Orders remained in place until September.  Irish Water launched a nationwide water conservation campaign encouraging households and businesses to reduce water consumption where possible.  The response to the campaign was extremely positive and water consumption fell across the country as a result.  While we were extremely grateful for the excellent response from members of the public, the 2018 drought highlighted, in stark terms, that despite Ireland having an abundant supply of raw water, many of our current water abstractions and supply networks lack the resilience and flexibility to deal with these extreme weather events.  This is a key challenge that will be addressed in the national water resources plan, to be launched in this year.<br/><br/>In addition to managing the day-to-day operational challenges, Irish Water continued maintaining, repairing and upgrading drinking water and wastewater infrastructure through its capital investment programme.  We invested &euro;670 million across the country to make our water supply safer and more reliable, to improve wastewater treatment and reduce its impact on the environment.  Some 22 drinking-water schemes, supplying 166,000 customers, were upgraded and removed from the EPA's remedial action list, RAL.  Disinfection was improved for a further 80 plants, supplying another 240,000 customers.  We wrote directly to 165,000 households and businesses whose water supply remains on the RAL to explain to them the current status of the quality of their drinking water supply, the specific project or projects Irish Water will deliver to deal with the risk and how long it will take to complete the projects.  Important projects like the Kerry central regional water supply scheme, Ballyboden reservoir, Staleen pipeline and Swords water main rehabilitation were all completed in 2018 and 300 km of old, poor-quality water mains were replaced with new pipes.  We will invest &euro;500 million up to 2021 on our leakage reduction programme, systematically finding and fixing leaks, repairing and replacing valves and bulk meters, replacing old backyard lead services and corroded cast iron pipework, and completing first-fix repairs on private property right across the country.<br/><br/>On the wastewater side, six wastewater treatment plants were completed in 2018 so that raw sewage is no longer discharged at Youghal, Ringaskiddy, Bundoran, Killybegs, Belmullet and Rush.  The positive impact on the marine environment and bathing water quality in these coastal areas is significant and immediate.  Priority work continues on the 37 remaining sites, some of which are at construction stage and the remainder of which are at planning stage, so the this practice will be largely eliminated by 2021.<br/><br/>Having prioritised drinking-water quality in recent years, our public wastewater network is still in an extremely poor condition and this will take many years and hundreds of millions of euro to properly repair and replace.  We have started this work.  In 2018, we surveyed 175 km of sewer pipes and refurbished 47 km in priority areas.  As has been highlighted many times, it will take decades and significant investment to bring Ireland's wastewater infrastructure up to the required standard.<br/><br/>In 2018, Irish Water submitted 53 planning applications and 40 CPOs to progress critical projects.  Throughout the year, we engaged with our stakeholders and members of the public at local, regional and national levels.  This ongoing engagement is a priority for Irish Water and will continue in 2019 and thereafter.<br/><br/><b></b>While we are completing projects in every county in Ireland, key milestones were reached on strategic projects that will have an important positive impact at a national level, both in economic and environmental terms.  In Cork Harbour, where up to last year 10,000 tonnes of untreated sewage was pumped into the sea every day, the Cork Harbour main drainage project has now reduced that volume by half, connecting Ringaskiddy, Carrigaline and Crosshaven to the new treatment plant at Shanbally.  The drilling of a subsea tunnel in 2019 will connect Passage West, Glenbrook, Monkstown and Cobh and allow the project to be completed in 2021, with a huge positive impact on the marine environment around Cork Harbour.<br/><br/>On the east coast, the Vartry tunnel, built with exceptional vision in the 1860s, was decommissioned in late 2018 with the completion of a new pipeline to bring treated water from Roundwood in County Wicklow to south Dublin.  An upgraded treatment plant is under construction at Vartry and work is well under way to upgrade and cover the existing reservoir at Stillorgan, ensuring the quality of drinking water supply for 200,000 customers in Wicklow and Dublin.<br/><br/>Subject to the passing of the necessary legalisation, we anticipate that a planning application will be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in late 2019 that will secure a new sustainable water source for the eastern and midlands region up to 2050.  Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, which treats 40% of Ireland's wastewater, will have a new upgrade complete in 2022 to deal with its serious capacity challenges.  A planning application was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2018 in respect of the greater Dublin drainage project, which will provide wastewater treatment capacity for greater Dublin, also up to 2050.  The combination of these drinking water and waste water projects will ensure that current and future growth of the greater Dublin area and the eastern and midlands regions will have the critical water infrastructure required.<br/><br/><b></b>Over the past five years, Irish Water has established and consolidated national strategic capability to manage, improve and future-proof public water infrastructure to secure Ireland's economic growth and protect the environment.  All future capital and operational investment will be in accordance with three thematic areas, as set out in the Government's 2018 water services policy statement.<br/><br/>With clarity around funding and policy, the next stage for Irish Water is to become a stand-alone publicly-owned, commercial regulated utility.  Key to this is the transfer of staff from the local authorities.  We welcome the invitation to participate in talks expected to begin shortly at the Workplace Relations Commission involving the unions as representatives of the staff, the LGMA, CCMA and the Department to develop a framework for the future which would replace the current service level agreement we have with local authorities.  <br/><br/><b></b>Irish Water will increase capital investment by &euro;150 million to &euro;820 million in 2019.  We are extremely vigilant in terms of value for money from a public procurement point of view and will work closely with our economic regulator, the CRU, to target further efficiencies in our capital and operational costs.  By the end of 2019, we aim to complete work that will allow the EPA to assess a further 33 drinking-water supplies for removal from the RAL.  With regard to untreated agglomerations, two more projects will be completed to stop the discharge of raw sewage.  Work will continue on drainage area plans, DAPs, across the country.<br/><br/>Irish Water will publish its national water resources plan outlining a new approach to how we manage our water resources nationally.  Ireland is not a water-stressed country but we need to fundamentally change how we manage available water resources.  We will implement key policy initiatives in 2019, including a revised water tariff regime for businesses, which will be published shortly by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, and the new connections policy, which will go live in April of this year.  We will also encourage water conservation and provide free first-fix leak repairs for households whose water use is very high to help them to reduce consumption and avoid excessive-use charges.<br/><br/><b></b>While 2018 was a particularly challenging year, we believe Irish Water, working in partnership with local authorities and our supply chain, managed to keep water and wastewater services operating in often very challenging circumstances.  We achieved record capital delivery targets, improving the quality of drinking-water and reducing untreated waste water discharges across the country.  While the challenges facing us are significant, we believe that we will continue to perform strongly, safeguarding our water resources for future generations.  I thank the members for their time.  We will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021400002#E00200"><p>Most of my questions are for Irish Water.  I thank our guests for their submissions.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to a few points that were not touched upon, some of which are outside the delegates' control.  I will start off with the commercial harmonisation of rates.  The CRU has still not published the information, which is disappointing.  Irish Water has now been established for six years and we still do not have a harmonisation process in place for commercial rates.  We are facing significant differences.  The charge in Wicklow is &euro;3.04 per cubic metre and in Kildare it is &euro;1.59, with the largest possible user of water in Kildare, namely, Intel.  When will this be sorted out?  I acknowledge that, at long last, the CRU did publish the details of the development contribution scheme, as we used to refer to it in the local authorities.  The charge is coming in at roughly &euro;6,200 per dwelling unit, on average. I am a bit confused by what I read in this regard.  There is the infrastructure investment and there is the connection fee.  Is there another fee on top of the &euro;6,200 to get connected?  Maybe the delegates could confirm that.</p> <p>  I have always been concerned about the development of infrastructure in rural areas.  In my county and a number of my colleagues' counties, most smaller towns and villages have no capacity to develop or take on any development.  Is there a plan for this process whereby we can start upgrading the wastewater facilities in rural towns and villages?</p><p>It could form part of the solution to the housing crisis.  Many of the villages in County Wicklow are stagnating because there has not been a housing development in more than 20 years.  It is beginning to affect the schools.  In most of the villages with populations of under 1,000, there is no wastewater or water capacity.  Is Irish Water focusing on that?  Is any specific funding being ring-fenced for smaller, rural-type villages in order that they can develop and be part of the solution?  If not, is a process available to allow developers to engage with Irish Water and offer some contribution to the upgrade of existing plants in these areas?  If so, does a process have to be followed and is that process available for everyone to view?  How is the contribution calculated, or is it done on a case-by-case basis?</p><p> On a positive note, I congratulate Irish Water on its work in response to the drought last year.  It worked well, although we still need to educate people that even though we started shouting about drought in June, it was September that we should have been worried about.  People kept telling me the reservoir was full but I said to return in September when it would not be.  While the response was exceptionally good and worked at getting the message out, we could do more to educate people.  I acknowledge that the oral hearing in the planning process for the wastewater treatment plant in Arklow has taken place.  The plant was discharging raw sewage into the river and I welcome any progress on it. </p><p> Dr. Ryan mentioned 179 large towns, of which 28 are polluting.  What does the EPA define as a large town?  I am trying to get a handle on population growth.  I am also interested that we still do not seem to have reached the capital investment that we need to in order to fix the water infrastructure problem.  The level of State intervention remains at approximately &euro;86 million or &euro;87 million.  We were at that figure in 2007 or 2008 and we have only just returned to that level.  We have not increased the level of capital funding from the State into water services.  Will the Department engage on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-14a.1743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gallen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019021400002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments on the drought.  He is correct about the education aspect.  We are making plans for Lough Owel in Mullingar in case the drought hits us early.  September is usually one of the top-three driest months, which many people are not aware of.  Mr. O'Leary will address the questions about rural development while I will answer those on tariff harmonisation and connections.</p> <p>  On tariff harmonisation, it is up to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to manage the consultation process and we will deal with the outcome.  We have made a submission and we hope that the process will be progressed a long way down the road in 2019.  It is likely to be 2020 before charges will be applied because we have to do IT system upgrades, notify people and so on.  There will be a glide path for customers moving onto the tariffs.  Charges in the Deputy's county, which is next door to the county with the lowest charges, are particularly high.  In fact, the two counties have the highest and lowest charges in the country and there is inequity in that regard.  A significant outcome of tariff harmonisation is equity throughout the country.  Due to tariff harmonisation, 80% of customers will experience a rise in charges of less than &euro;250 or a reduction in charges.  Overall, therefore, the vast majority of customers will not see a large increase in tariffs, but some will be affected and the CRU is examining glide paths and so on.  A determination will have to follow in that regard.  In short, we expect there to be much progress in 2019, with charges applying from 2020.</p> <p>  On the connection schemes, there is only one charge, which is the connection charge.  We engage with developers and they can do it in two ways, namely, in bulk, where they enter an agreement with payments staged or upfront for multiple housing units, or they can break them into smaller chunks at the same rates in order that they do not have to invest in 100 houses before the first 20 are sold.  We work with developers in that regard.  We deal with small and large developers but in the case of the latter, we assign dedicated account managers to help them in the process.  For example, if there are more 300 houses, we will quote separate rates for wastewater, while if there are more 250 houses, we will quote a separate rate for water.  For smaller developments, the rates are standard but we will engage with developers on everything from timing to phasing of payments and so on.</p></speech>

The Irish Water draft investment plan contains a proposal for small towns and villages that is aimed, in particular, at smaller settlements to provide water and wastewater infrastructure.  We will work closely with local authorities to identify where that investment is needed.</p> <p>  Through the national water resources plan, our intention is to visit every local authority to address water and wastewater issues with the local developer and the local planners to determine what is needed and where it is needed.  Working with them and using the funding through LIHAF and the small towns and villages programme in the investment plan, we intend for there to be targeted improvements in infrastructure to facilitate the local housing and development which the Deputy is seeking.</p></speech>

It is different depending on where the discharge goes.  In short, however, if the discharge goes to an inland water, river or lake, a large town is defined as having a population of more than 2,000, while if it goes to a coastal area, it is 10,000.  Anything above that requires, as a minimum, secondary treatment to be in place.  It may require additional treatment but, as a minimum, it requires secondary treatment.</p></speech>

As a result of the debate on water, we have a strong policy context for water services, through the strategic funding plans and a commitment from the Government to increase resources under the national development plan to deliver on our shared objectives.  Capital expenditure, for example, is expected to increase from &euro;856 million in 2019 to &euro;1.3 billion in 2024.  There is an increasing allocation for the capital investment needs.  In the long term, that is, the next 25 years rather than just the next five to seven years, we plan to put in place the capital investment necessary to underpin high-quality environmental and economic development in the country.</p></speech>

I have four areas of questions.  On the EPA reports, we in the committee have given a commitment over three years that every time the reports are published, one of the important steps we want to take is inviting all the stakeholders to interrogate the reports, not only to give the EPA another platform to raise the issues but also to hear directly from Irish Water and the Department.  I am keen to hear their views in that regard.</p> <p>  In the appendices of the report, one can see the 132 areas where improvements are needed to resolve environmental priorities, the list of the 28 large urban areas that have not met the directive and the list of the 38 urban areas that are charging untreated water.  When we compare those with the 2016 report, we see that while there has been a reduction at one level, given that in 2016 some 148 urban areas were of concern to the EPA, the difficulty is that the reduction is not a straightforward net reduction and some areas are being added to the list.  While some are being removed from the list, others are being added, which is counter-intuitive because one would have thought that as capital investment increases and the planning permission is processed, there should be a gradual overall reduction, without new areas slipping.  It is a concern and I would be interested to hear the views of all three organisations on it.  </p> <p>  I also draw the attention of Irish Water and the Department to one of Dr. Ryan's points, namely, a strong criticism that we are not addressing the issues fast enough.  Notwithstanding the significant increase in capital investment, the speed is not enough, which confirms the European Court of Justice's decision.</p><p>While overall capital expenditure is increasing, is an adequate proportion of that going to tackle the various issues that are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's report, particularly the larger number of the 132 urban areas where improvements are needed?  I asked this on the last occasion too.  For example, in 2014, 2015 and 2016, overall investments in upgrading wastewater treatment plants and networks reduced dramatically.  That seems to have moved in the right direction, but can Mr. Gallen give us a breakdown as to what quantum of the capital investment is going into those particular works?</p><p> Is the Department in a position to give us an update on where matters stand with the European Court of Justice and the European Commission?  I understand, even after the negative judgment of the ECJ, there is clearly a period of time where the State gets to demonstrate that it is getting its house in order.  Is Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh comfortable that the work of the Department and its colleagues in Irish Water are doing is convincing the European Commission that we are on track?  Is he comfortable that if we meet the targets, as he outlined, by 2021, we will not face significant European Court of Justice fines for further non-compliance?  Can he give us an updated read on all of that?</p><p> In terms of the Shannon pipeline, two issues have been a regular feature of our discussions here.  While most of us absolutely accept the need to diversify Dublin and the regions' water supply and to increase capacity, two of the issues we keep coming back to are whether there is any additional capacity in the aquifers in the midlands and eastern region, and whether there can be an acceleration of leakage reduction in the public water system.  I understand that Irish Water or Ervia was going to conduct some updated surveys around aquifers, if they can give us information on that.</p><p> Every time we ask this question, we get the same answer that leakage reduction in the public system is difficult to achieve.  In Temple Bar it is, but all of Dublin is not like Temple Bar.  Will we see any acceleration of the leakage reduction in the public water system?  None of that is an argument for or against the Shannon pipeline project.  I, again, express the concern that if the pipeline goes ahead as is currently proposed, 40% of the water that will be pumped across the State will be lost immediately in the network and that does not seem to make economic or environmental sense.  Are we still in the same position or has there been any improvement?</p><p> From the Department's point of view, will we get the abstraction licensing legislation this year?  Can Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh give us an update on that?  Will that delay the planning application?  Mr. Gallen stated the application will go in at the end of this year.  His predecessor was telling us that it would go in at an earlier stage.  My understanding is the delay was not at Irish Water's end.  It was to do with the abstraction legislation.  That may or may not be the case.  If witnesses can give us a view on that, it would be helpful.</p><p> Lastly, on the single utility, there are elements of that negotiation which are a matter for the employer and the unions, particularly in terms of the legacy costs that the City and County Managers Association is concerned with and the terms and conditions that the workers are concerned with.  I will leave that to the WRC process.  Many of us here have two very significant public policy concerns, on which I am interested in the witnesses' response.  The first is whether the single utility is commercial or non-commercial.  It makes a big difference.  I understand - we have spoken about this previously - that Ervia and Irish Water's preference is for a commercial utility because it has borrowing capacity and maybe a little more independence from the annual budgetary cycle.  Given that it is on balance sheet, I am not sure that is the case.  Given that the borrowings are still more expensive if they are in the commercial context from the private sector, has any consideration been given to finding a way of ensuring funding security for the capital investment programme which we all agree is needed but in a non-commercial semi-State context?  During the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Charges, we spent quite a lot of time wondering how one could provide that funding certainty to a non-commercial public water utility, for example, through contractual relationships not unlike one has with design-build operators where one guarantees capital funding, whether it is loan or Exchequer, over a set period of time and there is a legally binding commitment from the Department.  If Irish Water had funding certainty, it probably would not care too much whether it was commercial or non-commercial.  The value from the taxpayers' point of view is that borrowing is cheaper.  It makes more financial sense.  It probably would also assist the company with its IR issues with the trade unions because it would be covered by the public sector pay agreement.</p><p> I realise the referendum is a matter for Cabinet and Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh probably cannot answer the question.  Let me express the frustration anyway.  We have been talking around this referendum now for over two years.  Second Stage of the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016, in the name of Deputy Joan Collins and the rest of us, was passed in November 2016.  It appears from the outside that the Department will have a difficult job convincing the unions about the package of issues that the WRC will look at if there is not a date for a referendum.  That is a matter for Cabinet and for the Minister and the Attorney General.  Many of us are growing increasingly frustrated that there is a promise of a referendum but the longer that gap stretches, the more difficult it will be for many, both in the political process and in the union and employee end of it, to take that political commitment seriously.  I emphasise the importance of that referendum.  It was the single biggest issue of submissions to the Government's expert group.  It was a major preoccupation of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Charges.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh cannot tell us when it will happen and when the wording will be available, but without that the process will encounter fairly big difficulties.</p><p> I am particularly interested in Irish Water and the Department's responses to the EPA's concerns, particularly that list at the end of the appendices of the 2017 report.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Leary will deal with the investment and also the WRC.  I will deal with the rest and if I miss anything, we will try to pick it up.</p> <p>  Without getting into the detail of the figures - Mr. O'Leary will cover that on the EPA side - in some of the statistics the Deputy is saying that we are going down and then coming back up.  If I use the example of the dirty 44 with which people would be familiar - the untreated agglomerations where we were discharging untreated effluent into watercourses and into the sea - standards have risen, more get caught in the net and there are more audits, etc.  It started at 44 cases, went up to 50 in total and is now down at 37.  As I stated earlier, we plan to have most of those off by 2021.  There will be some that will probably take a little bit longer but they will be well under way by 2021.  What happens is one starts at 44, standards go up, more fall under the bar and are added to the list, or there are more intensive audits, but overall we have come from 50 down to 37.  We will get another two next year and substantially more by 2021.  Mr. O'Leary will deal with some of the specifics around the investment.</p> <p>  With regard to the eastern midlands water supply project, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is absolutely right.  Besides anything else, it is a difficult message to sell that we will take it from the Shannon, bring it up to Dublin and put it into Dublin's foundations.  We are working hard on the leakage side to get leakage down.  Leakage reduction alone will not solve this problem for us but we have &euro;500 million set aside nationally between now and 2021 to get leakage down.  Our target is 166 million litres a day, 44 million litres a day of which will be in Dublin, which will make a significant difference but will not get one down as far as one needs to get.  At present - these figures fluctuate, seasonally and otherwise - we are at 45% leakage nationally and 35% in Dublin.  It is still an awful lot of water.  Considering we produce 600 million litres a day, 200 million litres leaking is an awful lot of water.  We absolutely have to get that down.</p> <p>  On the broader point of the need for the water supply project, if one takes the fact that 85% of Dublin's water, which is 45% of the Liffey's flow, is one source, besides anything else one needs a security of supply solution there.  In addition, it is likely, at 45%, that that is not sustainable long term.  Aside from the fact of the pure supply, we have issues around security of supply and resilience for the capital city and, indeed, the midlands region which will take 30% of the water.</p> <p>  With regard to aquifers, we are actively looking at alternative sources of water all the time.  We are intensifying that at present because if the water supply project is delayed for whatever reasons, and there are many reasons it could be delayed, we will have to keep water going into Dublin.  We are actively looking for alternative sources, not least because if some water intensive industries came into the country they would need water immediately and we have to be able to supply them.  In answer to that question, we are doing that all the time and we have recently intensified that.  We are about to embark on a multi-million euro programme, specifically, down towards the Meath and south Dublin area, to try to see if there is more water available.  We will continue with that.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. O'Leary.</p></speech>

That was the primary focus at the start.</p><p>As Mr. Gallen alluded to in his submission, the progress that has been made on drinking water is evident from the fact that, by the end of 2019, there will only be approximately 30 schemes left on the EPA's remedial action list.  That pendulum is now very much swinging towards the wastewater spend.  The spend on wastewater is increasing yearly.  By 2020 or 2021, the spend on wastewater will exceed that for drinking water.  The projections for 2022 show that what we will be spending on wastewater will be nearly the same as the total spent on the full capital investment programme last year.  Therefore, right up to 2024-----</p></speech>

Looking forward to 2022, the spend on wastewater will be &euro;511 million and &euro;361 million will be spent on drinking water.  That will continue up to 2024, when the spend on wastewater will come back down and the two will merge.  We will have to see what the spend will be then from there on.  We work very closely with the Department and with our colleagues in the EPA to determine where to target and prioritise spend.</p> <p>  To look at some of the locations, in the 28 of the 179 large agglomerations, works will be completed at 21 by 2021.  The remaining six will be addressed by 2024.  To look at the 57 locations identified in the EPA report as impacting on water quality, we have completed upgrade works in 36 of these locations and are carrying out assessments at the others.  That will also be completed by 2024.  Mr. Gallen has alluded to the untreated agglomerations which started out as the "dirty 44".  It is now the "dirty 50" but we have removed 44% of the raw sewage being discharged.  The EPA and ourselves know what the priorities are.  We work very closely with the EPA.  We acknowledge that the speed heretofore may not have been what was required but there were reasons for that.  The pendulum is certainly now swinging towards the wastewater side.  We should see an acceleration of compliance in that regard.</p> <p>  To briefly touch on the issues of the single public utility and the WRC, I am conscious that we are getting into talks with the WRC very shortly.  I do not want to get into too much detail but, from an Irish Water perspective, we are publicly-owned and primarily an insourced business.  Commercial considerations are important to us.  We are regulated.  We want to be commercial and we want to be regulated.   Being commercial goes beyond the boundaries of where funding comes from.  It has other benefits relating to the types of contract into which we can enter and so on.  Certainly, from an Irish Water perspective, we very much want to continue to be publicly-owned, commercial and regulated.</p></speech>

He asked why the numbers fluctuate a little bit.  There are two main components to that.  One is the investment needed to address the legacy of poor infrastructure and to bring it up to standard.  There is an investment plan.  We talk about the pace of investment and all of that.  The other component is operational matters.  There will always be ongoing issues in plants which may bring them into or out of compliance.  There may be increased pressures on a particular area where an agglomeration increases in size, putting pressure on a plant.  Such a plant would then have to be brought up to specification to deal with that capacity.  There will always be ongoing regulatory issues there.  I emphasise that there is no endpoint to this.  It will require continual investment over decades both to bring the plants up to spec and to maintain an appropriate level of water quality and treatment.</p></speech>

All three bodies - the Department, the EPA, and Irish Water - are working to a common agenda.  It is absolutely right that the EPA should keep our feet to the fire on that, as indeed does the European Commission to begin to address the Deputy's next question.  We are all on a clear trajectory so that, by 2021 or thereabouts, we will have dealt with almost all of our shortcomings in respect of the urban wastewater treatment directives.  We expect a judgment in the European Court of Justice at the end of March.  The Deputy is right; the process will then depend on the judgment.  If it is adverse, we will enter into negotiations with the Commission as to how to address the judgment before the Commission thinks of taking next steps.  Given the Government's commitment, the level of investment under the national development plan, and the clear work programme of Irish Water, I am hopeful that we will be able to get a good outcome in that regard.</p></speech>

There are areas with regard to the environment in Ireland in which we have lacked credibility because of a failure to deliver so we really have to deliver on this to ensure that we avoid fines.  We will be engaging and we do have a very good story to tell when we engage with the Commission.  As we know from other worlds, the Commission negotiates quite hard.  It will not give us an easy passage.  We will all be put to the pin of our collars to deliver.  There are other issues in respect of water and there are fresh infringement actions in that regard.  As Dr. Ryan said in respect of the EPA, the need to invest is a continual process.  With regard to the Commission, complying with directives is also a continuing process.  The Commission looks at each member state.  If it feels that the state is not in compliance it takes it to court.  We will keep revisiting the issue to ensure that we are in compliance.  We are not the only member state in that position.</p> <p>  With regard to the legislation on abstraction, we are hopeful that we will publish it this year.  We have said it will be published by summer.  We have a general scheme, which was agreed by Government in July.  There was public consultation on that.  We have had comments back.  There are complexities in the area.  Water rights are an issue.  It is taking us a little bit of time to work through that, but we will be giving it some priority in order to try to deliver the legislation.  It should be noted that the Minister asked the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities to review the Shannon project.  That is expected to take most of this year.  Planning, the review and the legislation need to run in parallel rather than sequentially to minimise delays.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the transformation process.  Obviously we will be entering the WRC process in the coming weeks.  Local authorities have issues in respect of legacy costs.  We had a meeting with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, on that yesterday.  The unions want to talk to the Department about the status of Irish Water, the issue of being commercial or non-commercial, and the referendum.  On the issue of being commercial or non-commercial, as Mr. O'Leary pointed out there are advantages to the commercial nature of the company.  Sometimes people think it has to be one or the other, that it is a zero-sum game, and that something is either a non-commercial body or a commercial body.  This is a public utility.  It will be 80% funded by the taxpayer.  As Mr. O'Leary said, it uses an insourced model.  It is not like the profit-making commercial bodies one would see in other areas of the semi-State sector.  It is Government policy that it act in a commercial fashion and drive efficiency.  It is regulated by the regulator.  It has commercial features, which are considered very important, as well as features of a public utility, which are equally important.  I do not believe it is a zero-sum game but I appreciate that the unions have their own position on that.  The Deputy also mentioned a referendum.  To reiterate the position, the Minister brought proposals to Government.  They are being considered by the Attorney General.</p><p>We are in constant contact with the Office of the Attorney General, however we do not have a final timeframe for delivery of final wording.  </p></speech>

I am also not comfortable about continuing the meeting where there is an all-male panel of eight people, with a woman representing one of the organisations seated in the background because the seating arrangements could not be facilitated.  Is there something that we can do about that this morning before we go on?</p></speech>

The first relates to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  It has a public consultation starting shortly on the amount to be charged for this new excessive-use charge which my party believes is a Trojan horse for water charges.  We take a keen interest in what is happening here.  When precisely will the public consultation start?  If a date cannot be given perhaps we can be told the number of months or weeks after which it will take place.</p> <p>  My next question is on preparations for the single water utility.  The WRC is playing a role in bringing together the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, management in the local authorities, ICTU and the unions for engagement on this issue.  We are told this engagement will commence in the coming weeks.  Can we be more precise than that?  If we cannot have a date are we looking at the month of February, March or April?  When is it due to commence?</p> <p>  The need for a constitutional referendum on keeping water in public ownership is very important.  Reference has been made to it this morning.  It has been delayed by the Minister but I welcome the fact the committee has a hearing on progressing this coming up very soon.  It is an important meeting on which we will focus.  My questions relate to engagement with the unions and the question of public consultation.</p></speech>

We are expecting an invitation any day to attend.  It could be next week or the following week.  The WRC is checking with all parties to come up with a suitable starting date for the discussions. We certainly hope it will we start in the month of February.  How long it will take thereafter we do not know.</p></speech>

Of the management team five of the 11 are women including the heads of human resources, asset operations, and customer operations and the acting head of environment regulation.  We also have the head of corporate affairs who is cross-functional so we could say six of 12.  I apologise for giving the wrong number earlier.  I left out somebody who is acting.</p> <p>  With regard to the excessive use charging it will be subject to consultation process one by the CRU.  As the Deputy knows that is Government policy.  We do not come up with policy, we implement it.  We believe the big benefit will be conservation rather than charges.  As members are probably aware 7% of people use 30% of the water.  We believe the vast majority of this is due to leakage.  We will engage with people and give them plenty of notice about their excessive use and do everything we can to repair leaks to save us the cost of treating, chemicals, electricity and pumping, which are extremely expensive.  The big benefit we see, for of for the utility and nationally, is the reduction in waste water and the increase in conservation.  People who have large households can apply for additional allowances and people with special circumstances or medical needs can apply for exemptions also.  We believe a very small number of people will end up paying and our intention is to do everything to make that number as small as possible.  We are not interested in the revenue as much as we are in reducing leakage and promoting conservation.</p></speech>

The office is independent but its job is to implement the policy recommended by the joint Oireachtas committee which was enacted in the Water Services Act.</p><p>As the only Member of the current Oireachtas with a declared disability, I could ask whether the Department has met the 6% requirement for employment of people with disabilities in accordance with public service obligations.  I could also ask how many of the senior management has a declared disability.  I will not do so because it is not appropriate to do it, and it is certainly not appropriate to embarrass public servants who are just doing their job.  I very much distance myself from what happened earlier.</p><p> That said, I have a couple of short questions.  Will the witnesses from Irish Water talk me through how they deal with planning applications?  I know of a case in Clare where a hotelier is applying for additional accommodation that is badly needed in a tourism area.  The council is seeking further information because of a concern relating to overcapacity in water and sewage.  The architect and agent on behalf of the client contacted Irish Water in November and as of yesterday that party has received neither an acknowledgement nor even a reference number with which to follow up the query and try to come back with a response to Clare County Council.  Consent by or an agreement with Irish Water is necessary in the case.  A period where further information is requested is allowed for six months and following that the application would become invalid.  This does not really give people much time to deal with an application.  We are now in the middle of February and the further information was sought last October.  What is the process and how does Irish Water handle this type of query?  Is it appropriate that an agent would not even get an acknowledgement from Irish Water going back to last November?</p></speech>

If his statement is correct, I apologise, as that is not up to the standards we set for ourselves and it is not acceptable for the people involved.  They should have received a reference number straight away for a pre-connection inquiry or a full inquiry.  If the Senator gives me the specific details, I will follow up on them.</p> <p>  The normal process is it can take up to ten weeks to get through the system with either a pre-connection inquiry or a full application for connection.  There are many steps involved with capacity planning, etc., so it is a long process not unlike that of other utilities.  The customer should be informed all the way through so if the Senator gives me the specifics of the case, I will follow up on them.</p></speech>

There are many towns and villages seeking an upgrade of wastewater treatment facilities, sewerage systems, etc.  There are a number of towns, particularly in tourism areas, where applications are lodged but the response is that they are premature ahead of the upgrading of wastewater and sewerage systems.  The problem is these villages are being left behind.  I can think of two examples, and it can be very frustrating for the people in the village involved if there are people willing to spend money to extend businesses and develop badly needed housing, but if an application is made, the response is that it is premature ahead of the infrastructure being developed.  What criteria is used to identify and proceed with these developments, particularly in rural tourism areas?  I know Clare County Council is so frustrated by schemes now that it has applied through the rural regeneration programme for two schemes in County Clare, with one in Broadford and another in Cooraclare.  To be frank, many people would argue the rural regeneration scheme is not the appropriate vehicle to provide for this type of scheme and it is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These questions are for Irish Water and the Department.  What is happening with these schemes and will communities just be left on the long finger indefinitely?</p></speech>

It comes through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, programme and our current and capital investment programme.  We are guided by the national planning framework and the local authority development plans but we make funding specifically available to local authorities.  If there is a small town, village or rural community they wish to develop, they have the discretion to use that funding.  We work very closely with local authorities but with the Senator's example of an application being deemed premature, it probably relates to our previous discussion about where the priority capital investment programme is targeted.  That is now swinging very much towards the wastewater side.</p></speech>

One of the new specific measures relates to what are described as community connections, which allow communities to come together to seek funding under the programme through the Department to develop drinking water and wastewater schemes.  There is a funding stream with grants up to a maximum of 85% of cost, amounting to &euro;7,650 per household, to allow those schemes to go ahead.  Local authorities have been invited to submit bids under the scheme and that will happen over the next few weeks.</p> <p>  This arose from the review put in place following the Oireachtas joint committee hearings and the report from 2017.  The Minister put the review in place to examine how the rural water programme operated.  A second part of the review considers the long-term needs for rural water.  There is a general acknowledgement that there are deficits in infrastructure but the immediate issue was to address what can be done now through the rural water programme.  That is being done.  The report on the long-term issue is expected to get to the Minister later this year.  In the group there is the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the local authorities, the Health Service Executive and so on.  It is a broad-based group and measures are being put in place in the short term, with plans for the long term.</p></speech>

There has been a significant improvement in terms of urban wastewater treatment directive non-compliant locations, as can be seen in the figures.  However, the rate of improvement in other areas is far slower.  Appendix A, which deals with the priority areas, shows a reduction from 148 to 132 locations, which is close to a 10% improvement.  On the areas discharging wastewater, again, there is a reduction from 44 to 38, so it is about a 14% improvement.  On the pressured water bodies, there is a reduction from 59 to 57.  I can fully understand why, on foot of a European Court of Justice decision, the priority would go into tackling those areas.  My worry, however, concerns all the other areas, given the EPA is year after year raising this significant number of cases.  I share the concern Dr. Tom Ryan diplomatically put in his commentary that the speed of improvement in those other areas is clearly much slower than for those that are in breach of the urban wastewater treatment directive.  I acknowledge we are dealing with data from 2017 and it is now 2019.  When we get the EPA report for 2018, there will be much greater improvements in those three or four appendices that will evidence the increased investment and increased co-ordination between the various players.  If I am not reading the report right, the witnesses might let me know.</p><p> Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh mentioned new infringement proceedings.  He might provide some information about the current position on those proceedings.</p><p> On a question for Mr. Gallen, we have had plenty of debates about the so-called charge for wasteful usage.  One of the concerns is the cost of repairs, given the figure of 7% of households is clear.  However, we do not know whether they are using that water or whether the water is leaking as a result of the properties being older, or whether, even if the householders get plenty of notice, they will have the financial capacity to upgrade their own systems.  In Irish Water's conversations with the Department and the Government, is there mention of how to enhance assistance for households that simply will not be able to cover the cost?  I am thinking in particular of rural Ireland, older people and families that could be asset rich but income poor.  This would ensure that nobody would be charged for something they are not using, which could be as a result of lack of ability to pay the cost of repairs.</p></speech>

Without straying into changes in policy, our interest is in saving water and we will do whatever we can to work with customers to save it, and we will be as reasonable as we possibly can.  We have rules about stopcocks inside and outside a property, and all that kind of thing, but we will work around that to help people, if necessary.  We certainly do not want to penalise elderly people who have a leak inside their house or where they cannot repair something under their driveway.  We have no interest in that and we will work with them.  While it would be very difficult to say we can commit to do everything free for everybody, and go into everybody's house and sort out their plumbing, nonetheless, the Deputy's point is well made.  There are people who genuinely want to work with us and who do not have the wherewithal to effect repairs.  We will deal with that as sympathetically as possible and work with them.  We want people to avoid paying these charges, not to enforce them.</p></speech>

As Mr. Gallen noted, in 2018 we got six of the untreated agglomerations off the list and we hope to get two off in 2019.  For various reasons, it takes time, but they are all on a trajectory to 2021, by which time the vast majority will be dealt with.  At the end of 2018, 132 plants were on the PAL.  By the end of 2019, that will be down to 104, then 98 by 2020 and, by 2021 it will-----</p></speech>

As assessments are carried out, and through working with the EPA, we are coming to a convergence of views as regards what should and should not be on the list.

The exact same approach will be taken and there will be very targeted investment to get those schemes off the PAL.</p></speech>

While I expect it to be lower than 70 by 2021, the problem is we have not carried out a full detailed assessment in regard to new ones that will be added and what mitigation or investment is needed for them.  There will be targeted investment to deal with that and we are working with the EPA on it.  However, I do not want to create illusions about the position when the 2018 report is published in 2019.  These things take time.  Our investment programme works in bundles so we try to progress a number of schemes at the same time.  When they start coming to construction, many will come to completion at the same time and we should see a step improvement.</p></speech>

Keeping in mind that we are beginning to put manners on our approach to dealing with non-compliance, our primary objective, which is reflected on page 63 of the plan, is to achieve full compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive but, thereafter, it is also looking at protected areas such as bathing waters, shellfish waters, high status catchments and priorities that have been identified in the plan, given we prioritise areas.  That will have an impact and we will start to take bigger chunks off that list.  Another important initiative, which is committed to on page 67 of the plan, is that the EPA will review urban wastewater discharge licences based on a better evidence base, so, when we do the reassessments, this may change that list because the situation may not be as non-compliant as we had thought.  We are in the process of trying to put resources in place within the agency to carry out that review on a prioritising, targeted basis.  There are, therefore, a couple of processes ongoing which will start to give us a better handle on that list.</p></speech>

It revisits a number of areas that had come up previously that we had hoped to have dealt with in a water environment Bill which did not proceed, given other priorities on the water side.  It is quite lengthy but much of it is technical in regard to whether our definitions are completely aligned with the directive, as well as there being some substantive issues, for example, in regard to the absence of control on abstractions, which is what the abstraction Bill is to deal with.  We have just received it and it is quite complex.  We will engage with it to try to understand the full implications and we will then go back to the Commission.</p></speech>

The reference that was made to the six-yearly review was made because, under the legislation, the licences of wastewater treatment plants have to be reviewed every six years.  That is a separate legislative requirement that has to be complied with and we are in negotiations with the Department on workforce planning around that piece.</p></speech>

Have the EU institutions modified their proposals based on the subsidiary concerns raised in the national assembly?  What is the new anticipated timeline for the progression of a dossier and is there any indication of an implementation date?  Is it likely that this proposal will still have a substantial impact on Ireland? </p></speech>

There is not yet a mandate for the Presidency to enter into the trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament and Commission as yet.  The Presidency is with Romania.  In my view, looking at the way things have proceeded, it could be June before there is a mandate for it to enter negotiations.  The engagement will probably happen during the Finnish Presidency.</p> <p>  The reasoned opinion issued by parliament last year was one of four from several member states, including the UK, Austria and the Czech Republic.  The Germans had some concerns as well.  There were concerns about subsidiarity and proportionality.  That has certainly informed our engagement at the working party on the environment in respect of our position.  Keeping in mind that these are discussions within Council and member state positions, there has been a significant shift which addresses the concerns this committee has on the issue of subsidiarity.  There is now more flexibility reflected in the Council version of the text, or proposal for the text, for member states to implement as they see fit, rather than being dictated to in the way the text was phrased in the original proposal.</p> <p>  The monitoring requirements have also shifted and are more proportional in terms of small agglomerations or water supplies.  The group water scheme sector, in particular, is happier with what is being proposed now.  Accordingly, as the supplies get smaller, the obligation to monitor has been reduced.  We have had ongoing discussions with Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The committee, in its reasoned opinion, mentioned that the standards being proposed went beyond the World Health Organization, WHO, recommendations.  The Council version has shifted back to the WHO standards.  Progress has been slow but we would expect that by the end of the Romanian Presidency, there should be a mandate to enter trilogue negotiations. </p></speech>

We know there have been some concerns in Lough Talt where the supply is on a boil water notice and will remain on one until the supply is upgraded.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre gathers statistics on incidents of illnesses and traces them back to determine where they are associated with water supplies.  We have not been made aware of any related to public water supplies.  There are incidents that are linked and associated with private wells but not directly with public water supplies that we are aware of.</p></speech>

I understand that for public group water schemes there are a few connections that take the water from a public source and distribute it through a network of piping.  Where does responsibility lie in that scenario?</p></speech>

In some cases the local authorities traditionally supplied the water off the public main into the group water scheme free of charge.  In some cases, they charge, while in others they do some maintenance and in others they do not do any maintenance.  In some cases, there are orphan schemes which were run by a group water scheme but that is no longer the case.  We are engaging through the Department with individual schemes.  Some schemes want to hand it back, while others want to continue but want work done on the supply we give them.</p> <p>  On general policy, we could not take on 300,000 customers in the morning.  We would not be geared and would not have the operational expenditure to manage and maintain a network of that size.  Over time, we believe that where group water schemes want us to take them in charge a process and funding will have to be agreed and we are willing to deal with that as we are required to.  In the meantime, our financial supports go to the group water schemes and the Department can talk about that.  Many of them do not want any interference from us.  They want to get on and do their own thing.</p> <p>  There are issues related to historical precedent, custom and practice, practicalities and a mixture of all that.  We deal with each as best we can.  Over the Christmas period, for example, a group water scheme ran out of water and we supplied tankers, even though it was not our network.  We cannot run an alternative system without the supporting funding and before we take on a scheme it needs to be brought up to a certain standard.  We will not leave anybody stuck.  We will work with all the current arrangements but, as matters stands, unless we have taken them in charge, such supplies are the responsibility of the group water scheme.</p></speech>

It is pretty much on a par with what is there on the public network.  In addition, there are funding measures under the rural water programme to support improvements in the infrastructure.  Mr. Gallen mentioned schemes that want to be taken in charge by Irish Water.  There is a funding stream which covers 100% of the cost of bringing deficient infrastructure up to standard so that it can be taken in charge.  In 2018, 21 schemes were taken in charge under that arrangement.  The figures for 2016 and 2017 were 13 and 15, respectively.  That is in addition to the funding streams available to the private group water schemes and there are significant funding supports available for infrastructural improvements.  In addition, the ongoing operational subsidies were significantly improved with effect from 1 January 2018.  There are policy mechanisms and funding streams in place to support the quality objectives and to make sure quality and public health issues are addressed.</p></speech>

Many of them are on mains water and sewerage but the capacity is gone and there is no new development in these villages.  I would be interested to know about the draft policy because a village is unlikely to secure funding under the LIHAF because that fund is needed for large-scale developments being used to open up road networks.  This means villages rely solely on funding from the town and village renewal scheme to get up and running which is not appropriate.  Maybe Mr. O'Leary can give me something in this draft that will keep me happy today.</p></speech>

I am not saying that we can address every issue, but we will make at least two visits to every local authority county by county to determine where each believes a need exists.  We have developed and published the first round of capacity registers so that local authorities can see exactly what water and wastewater capacity is available in their areas and what plans are in place for upgrades or new plants.  As a number of committee members mentioned, there can be a waiting period before a plant is upgraded, which frustrates people.  If someone wants to build a house, he or she wants to do so now, not in three years' time.  However, all of that will at the very least be transparent.  After we have done a tour of the country and spoken to all of the local authorities, we will have a much better idea of the pain points.</p></speech>

My interest in this area is as the professor of law and head of the law department at Maynooth University.  My area of research and teaching is employment and labour law.  I am interested in the definition of the employment relationship, how we define in law employees and others who provide services.  The questions, in law, of who is an employee and who is an employer, are extremely important.  They open the gateway to a range of statutory protections, including minimum wage laws, unfair dismissal laws and working time laws, which are among the most important.  The definition of someone as an employee also determines an individual's access to social security systems, unemployment insurance, sick pay and other matters, and has implications for taxation.  In terms of commercial or company law, employees are often granted particular rights in the event that their employer becomes insolvent, which are not granted to non-employees.</p> <p>  An issue in which I have been interested recently relates to collective bargaining and is the interface between collective bargaining rights and competitive or anti-trust laws.  The situation in the case of non-employees is that independent undertakings are generally forbidden from coming to mutual arrangements over basic terms such as minimum payments, as they would likely contravene competition laws.  It is very difficult for non-employees to engage in effective collective bargaining.</p> <p>  In recent years, concern has been expressed that a strict divide between employees and independent contractors is not appropriate for contemporary employment relationships.  We see that in the European Court of Justice has recently noted that the boundaries between the self-employed and employees are not as easy to determine in the fluid employment market, in which we currently exist, and it identified a category of workers which it called the "false self-employed", namely, service providers who are in a situation comparable to that of employees.</p> <p>  The difficulty of classifying people doing work into employees or self-employed is not new.  The question of false or bogus self-employment has long been identified as a challenge in the construction sector, for example, in particular.  However, it has gained more attention recently, domestically and worldwide, due to the growth of work in the so-called platform or gig economy.  Web-based platforms are thriving and they function as online intermediaries between a client or end-user who require a service, and those who are providing the service, doing the work.</p> <p>  There is no comprehensive statutory definition of either employee or contract of employment in Ireland.  Instead, it has been left largely to the courts to define these concepts, and for the scope section in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in particular, to seek to classify workers for PRSI purposes.  In doing so, the courts have identified factors such as control, integration into the business, mutuality of obligation, risk or investment, and other such categories.</p> <p>  Some jurisdictions have introduced a third category of employment status, between employed and self-employed.  For example, in the UK it is referred to as a worker in legislation.  Such workers are entitled to limited labour protection under the legislation.  The argument for creating such categories is to offer some labour law coverage to workers who do not fit within the classic definition of an employee.  In the widely known Uber litigation in the UK, for example, a group of Uber drivers successfully argued before the UK courts and tribunals that they had worker status under UK law, and therefore were covered by minimum wage and paid annual leave laws.  The possibility has also been discussed of introducing a statutory presumption of employment status, whereby it is assumed an employment relationship exists until the party resisting the status has proven otherwise.</p> <p>  The European Union has proposed a new directive on predictable and transparent working conditions.  I gather political agreement was reached on furthering it just this week.  In the explanatory memorandum to the proposal, the European Commission notes that in 2016 a quarter of all employment contracts were for "non-standard forms of employment" and in the past ten years more than half of all new jobs were "non-standard".  The Commission goes on to note that these trends have also led to instability and an increased lack of predictability in some working relationships, especially for workers in the most precarious situations.  Inadequate legal frameworks can subject workers in non-standard employment to unclear or unfair practices and make it difficult to enforce their rights.</p> <p>  The proposed new EU directive sets out an EU-wide notion or definition of worker as a person who for a certain period of time performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration.  It is important to note, however, that this definition would only apply in the context of the rights in the directive itself which focus on clearer and more complete information on the essential aspects of the work and some matters to do with uncertain work.</p><p>Under EU and Irish competition law, it is not possible for the self-employed to conclude collective agreements.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2017 provides that section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 which prohibits cartel action shall not apply to collective bargaining and agreements in respect of certain categories of worker.  There are three such categories.  First, the Act specifically applies to voice-over actors, session musicians and freelance journalists.  Second, the Act introduces the concept of the "false self-employed" worker and, third, the concept of the "fully dependent self-employed worker".  A trade union that represents a class of false self-employed, or fully dependent self-employed, workers may apply to the Minister to include the class of workers in question as falling within the scope of the Act in order to allow the union to bargain collectively and conclude collective agreements on behalf of the workers.  This legislation represents an innovative attempt to extend collective bargaining rights to vulnerable workers who do not fit within the classic "employee" definition and sets out in law the principle that collective representation should not be automatically denied to those who cannot satisfy traditional tests of employee status.  I also point to the importance in this area of a focus on collective standard setting and, in particular, sectoral standard setting.  Sector or industry-wide standards reduce the incentive to undercut commercial rivals, providing a level playing field where competition is not on the basis of wage depreciation.</p><p> In Ireland the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced the concept of sectoral employment orders, SEOs.  For example, the Sectoral Employment Order (Construction Sector) 2017 took effect from 19 October 2017 and provides mandatory terms and conditions in the construction sector generally which exceed statutory minimums such as the minimum wage.  A very recent proposal made in the United Kingdom has been to draw up a "sectoral map".  This would be done by governments but in consultation with employers and trade unions.  The purpose is to identify relevant sectors and sub-sectors which would be set down in law and subject to SEO-like orders.</p><p> It seems to be particularly important that sectors in which trust, confidence and safety are key concerns be the subject of State regulation.  Examples include domestic care services and passenger transport services.  The advantage of sectoral minimum standards is that one-size-fits-all solutions are not applied and the flexibility of collectively bargained standards means that adjustments can be made in response to changing economic and social trends.  It seems to be important that the State, particularly in the context of public procurement processes, monitor very carefully any sub-contracting relationship to ensure proper classification of all those working on State projects and, therefore, that proper tax and social security payments are being made.  In that regard, obligations might be placed on principal contractors to ensure compliance by sub-contractors, in particular with PRSI obligations.</p><p> The issue of employment status is one with which Legislatures across the world are grappling.  Achieving a balance in regulation between ensuring decent work, protecting business flexibility and ensuring appropriate contributions are made to the State is a difficult but vital and necessary task.</p></speech>

He more or less finished on that point, which concerns the definition.  Are there examples of jurisdictions where the definitions are more robust than they might be in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

What strikes people like me and my colleagues in the United Kingdom who come from the common law tradition where there is a tendency to let the courts decide on these matters is that jurisdictions where the definitions are set down more in law are finding it equally as difficult to address them effectively.  I should not be taken as saying there is an easy answer to having a comprehensive statutory definition in law.  Perhaps a particular weakness in the Irish code might be inconsistency in approach.  We have different definitions of "employee" in different Acts.  There is a slightly wider definition in the minimum wage legislation by comparison with that in the unfair dismissals legislation.  One of the weaknesses of our code is that we have not consolidated it as we might have done.  When we introduced new employment rights, often as a result of EU legislation, they were bolted onto the existing framework.  The short answer to the Chairman's question is that I do not believe there is a robust statutory definition of "employee" anywhere that would act as a panacea or silver bullet, but we should certainly pay attention to being consistent in the definitions included in various Acts.</p></speech>

Professor Doherty mentioned the usual cases.  I thank him for drawing attention to the anti-competitive scenario, where, if somebody is classed as self-employed, he or she is not entitled to bargain collectively.</p> <p>  On the point raised by the Chairman, my approach was to bring forward legislation to penalise arrangements under which people were more or less coerced into stating they were self-employed when clearly they were employees.  The approach I took was to set out the various criteria that would point towards a person being an employee and the various criteria that would point toward a person being self-employed and let the WRC or the court, on appeal, to decide the facts in each individual case.  With reference to what Professor Doherty said about the definitions and the difficulty in interpreting the definitions of "employee", the approach I have outlined is as good as any.  No matter what the definition is, or how comprehensive it is, it will still result in a case by case approach.  As the professor said, it can vary from one type of business to another.</p> <p>  I would like to hear Professor Doherty's views on the UK approach of creating a third category of "worker".  He said there was an advantage in that it extended certain limited protections to employees in precarious employment.  There is also a disadvantage in the sense that, under Irish law, where there is no third category, an employee might be classified in respect of all of the protections provided, whereas if there were another category of "worker", it might mean that some of the protections afforded to an individual so classified would be removed.</p></speech>

The definition laid down in the National Minimum Wage Act, for example, strangely approximates to the UK definition of "worker".  I am not aware of it ever having been subject to litigation.  I am not aware of any decision on it by the WRC or previous tribunals.  The wording, however, is very similar to the definition of "worker" in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  Leaving that aside, I believe the Deputy is right that in the Uber case in the United Kingdom, had the option been open to the UK courts and tribunals to regard the drivers in question as employees, they might well have done so.  That is the weakness of a third category.  I will be sanctioned and censured by my colleagues for saying this, but I am a professor of employment law who always seeks to avoid legal solutions to employment relations problems, where possible.  Introducing a third category would probably just introduce more complexity and litigation, but I understand the rationale.</p><p>One can see that, where it is all or nothing, it might be attractive to tell a person they do not get employee status but could fit into the other status to avail of some protections.  The introduction of this category in the UK, however, has not led to any particularly favourable outcomes.  I am not sure that the third approach is one I would recommend.</p></speech>

They estimated a loss of PRSI and tax in the construction sector alone of up to &euro;240 million per year.  Professor Doherty talked about the massive growth of the gig economy.  I am not sure if he has done specific work on this area but this topic has not really come before me until now.  We hear about construction, the media sector and airline pilots but this has not appeared on my radar.  It would be very helpful if Professor Doherty could expand on this a little.</p> <p>  Professor Doherty said that creating a third category would add to complexity and cause confusion.  I was going to ask him if it should be looked at but it seems, from his answer to Deputy O'Dea's question, that he thinks not.  I am interested in public procurement processes because I have some experience of dealing with people forced into bogus self-employment when working on public projects, such as for housing or schools.  One of the unions that came before us said it had represented a number of workers who were employed on projects involving Carillion to construct schools, which got into serious difficulty and ultimately went bust.  They took a successful case on behalf of plumbers who had been forced into bogus self-employment.  I have come across people who worked on school and housing projects where the main developers got into serious financial difficulty and there were restrictions on the workers in terms of redundancy or access to social welfare because of their bogus self-employment.</p> <p>  Professor Doherty said the State should carefully monitor any subcontracting relationships.  Will he expand on that?  ICTU gave its perspective as to what should happen in such cases and it would be interesting to know if he has similar views.  It is rife in the sector and contractors get contracts for fixed prices and then engage people in bogus self-employment, meaning pay and conditions suffer.  What would Professor Doherty recommend as part of a monitoring process?</p></speech>

Academics are always looking for something new and, at labour law conferences all around Europe at the moment, people are talking about the platform, or the gig, economy, but this represents a very small proportion of European economies, though it is increasing.  Its importance is that it has put the spotlight on situations where people provide services under some sort of third party direction but not in a way that conforms to a traditional employment relationship, which is common in sectors such as media and aviation etc.  In some countries, though not in Ireland as yet, platforms are used in the provision of very traditional services, one of the fastest growing of which is home care services.  Care providers are linked via a platform to somebody who requires care.  In such cases, and in other sectors, we need to be very careful about how we regulate the conditions of the people who provide the services.  Unfortunately, we have seen and heard quite disturbing things about the care sector in this State and, given that there is no employer in these cases, we need appropriate safeguards, both for the people who do the work and those who receive the service.</p> <p>  Most of us probably think of food delivery when we think of gig or platform work.  It is not very prevalent but it has spread to a lot of other sectors in other countries and we would be unwise to ignore this.  This issue is not new.  We need to decide where the responsibility lies for ensuring proper conditions for workers, and for ensuring redress where people receive a service which is not up to standard in some way.</p> <p>  As I said to Deputy O'Dea, I do not think a third category is useful but we might consider a broader definition of what we consider a worker to be, which was addressed by the EU in a specific context.  It would cover somebody providing a service, personally and for payment but not necessarily under the control of an employer, as we would traditionally understand it.  It does not necessarily include a requirement for mutuality of obligation, which is where things get problematic here.  If a company employs somebody to deliver something for 20 hours in a particular week and that person is not required to do it but has no other source of income, one has to ask if there is a genuine mutuality of obligation in the deal.  Can the person doing the delivery really say he does not want to do the job, bearing in mind that he may not be asked again if he does not accept it?  We need to think a bit more broadly about what we consider the obligations of employers to be in some areas, such as wages and holidays etc.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of public procurement.  This is something on which I have done a little bit of research.  In 2012 or 2013, I did some research into State contracts at a time when the only thing happening in construction was State contracts.  It was very clear that there was a perfect storm for contracting authorities, particularly local authorities, in which the requirement was to get things done as quickly and cheaply as possible.  If that meant accepting the lowest bid, however questionable it might have looked, so be it.</p><p>Trust was placed in contractors to fulfil obligations but it did not happen in many cases, especially in the case of workers from other member states who came here to do work prior to 2012 but in similar circumstances.  While matters have improved in that sense and there is much more construction work going on now, I am still not sure that there is critical or sustained scrutiny of the awarding or the performance of public contracts.  Outside this room there is a storm going on about a particular public project.  Since 2016, ironically, workers who come here from other EU member states to do construction work have some protection.  These are what we call Post-it workers who come to provide a service for a brief period of time and then return to their own countries, typically, construction workers from France who build something and then return to France.  They have protection in that the main contractor in that relationship can be liable for any shortfall of remuneration for subcontractors but that applies only to those workers and not to workers employed by domestic employers.</p><p> I have read the submissions of Congress and so on.  I would be broadly in favour of some sort of chain liability for subcontracting, particularly in the construction sector and in State contracts.  It is arguable that outside of State contracts it is a little more difficult to prove, monitor and so on but certainly within the context of public procurement, there should be liability for main contractors for things that happen down the chain.  It is done elsewhere.  It is not a revolutionary concept.  It is something we probably need to put on a statutory footing because it has been part of State contracts.  However, I am not aware of any contractual cases being taken by the State against main contractors who have not fulfilled their obligations.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Doherty for coming before the committee.  I refer to points 9 and 10 of his submission.  In terms of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2017, Professor Doherty said that this legislation represents an innovative attempt to extend collective bargaining rights to vulnerable workers.  Can he give us any examples of unions doing that and the workers who were covered by it?</p> <p>  I do not believe there is any reference to it here but I refer to the scope section, the social welfare appeals office, SWAO, the High Court and the Labour Court.  Many cases are upheld by the scope section as regards a worker being an employee.  They then go to the SWAO and are not upheld and then to the High Court.  It is a very long process.  That leads on to the point about the public procurement process.  One particular company, Giant Capital, 40% of whose clients are in the public sector, refused to implement a Labour Court recommendation relating to redundancy.  Two weeks ago, Irish Archaeological Consultancy refused to attend the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, in respect of workers.  What can we do in public procurement processes to insert in the contract that companies have to recognise the State industrial relations machinery?  If they do not, will penalties apply?  Would it be the case that they would not get a public contract in the future?  There is no point in having the State machinery if under public procurement, companies are not obliged to even recognise it when it is where workers can go to get vindication of their employee states.</p></speech>

I will deal with the competition aspect first.  I am sure the committee members will be aware of the history of this but for a long time the issue related to the three particular categories of voice-over actors, session musicians and freelance journalists.  For many years, throughout social partnership, etc., this issue was raised continuously.  It was raised with the troika during the programme period; I am trying to avoid saying "bailout".  It is a long-running issue.  The legislative response has dealt with the issue for those specific categories of workers, which is entirely appropriate.</p> <p>  My interest, as is the Deputy's in terms of her question, is who else might benefit from this.  The honest answer right now is that I am not aware of any other group on behalf of which the unions have made an application under this legislation.  In terms of my view on it, I have spoken at a few events about its relevance for this platform or gig work because it seems to be a potential way such workers could at least have the benefit of collective bargaining.  It could be applied in a broad range of scenarios where the employment status is not as clear-cut as a standard employment relationship.  For example, it could apply for care workers who provide services in domestic homes and are not employed by a hospital, a care giving company or something like that.  It has many potential applications.  One of the limitations of the Act is the provision whereby in order for the Minister to accept an application, he or she has to ensure there is no cost to the State.  I have been a bit cynical about that because what is the point of collective bargaining if it does not have a cost?  It has to have a cost to somebody.</p> <p>  Some weeks ago, the European Committee of Social Rights noted that an overly restrictive interpretation of that by the Irish Legislature would run the risk of being in violation of the European Social Charter.  The European Committee of Social Rights was of the view that prior to the introduction of this Act, Ireland was in breach of its obligations under the social charter.  Some of the members felt that this remedied it but only if it is applied in a proportionate way and not in a very restrictive way.  Some felt that we were still in breach.  The short answer is that there are no other workers of whom I am aware currently but the potential exists.  I would like to see a proposal being put to the Minister to see the parameters of this and what will be expected.</p> <p>  In terms of the second question, and Congress may have made references to this in its submission, the division of competence between scope and the social welfare side of the house on one hand and the WRC and the employment rights on the other hand is probably not ideal because people with very different backgrounds are making different decisions and are looking at different aspects.  Revenue and social welfare officials will have a particular interest.  WRC inspectors will have a slightly different one.</p> <p>  I have just read a fantastic PhD thesis, which I hope will be disseminated, that will be of real interest to this committee.  It is on the application of day-to-day social welfare entitlements for both EU and non-EU citizens coming here.  Much of it is around the appeals mechanism, the difficulties people have moving from one level to the other and the effective impossibility of a High Court hearing for the vast majority of applicants.  One way of addressing that might be to move all of these functions under one roof.  The WRC would probably be preferable.  The people in social protection have very specific expertise but this probably calls for a broader approach than just looking at the issue of PRSI and related matters.</p><p>The problem with legislative solutions is that they are individual solutions and they depend on the ability, willingness and capacity of an individual, who is often vulnerable, by definition, to take difficult, complex and time-consuming litigation.  Even before the tribunals, the vast majority of the time the employer will have legal representation and there is no legal aid for tribunals of this nature.  That is why I always look for the possibility of collective or sectoral solutions, which can be through old-fashioned collective bargaining, where people join unions and the union bargains on their behalf, or via State-set sectoral standards.  </p><p> To segue into public procurement, I might take the second part of the question because it follows on from what I have said.  It is utterly unacceptable for organisations which have been awarded State contracts not to engage with the State dispute resolution machinery.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I will give a slightly lawyerly answer.  Public procurement law is notoriously complex and subject to quite strict European rules.  For example, a suggestion was that State contracts could contain living-wage provisions and that, therefore, the living wage would be paid rather than the statutory minimum wage.  That is legally problematic, although it would need to be tested.  Another suggestion, which would require a contractor to ensure that everyone working on the project was a member of a trade union, could also be argued to be legally problematic, although it may not be.  I cannot see any problem, however, with a legally binding condition that the contractor must engage with the State disciplinary machinery.  I am sure it could be challenged but it would be a robust provision.</p></speech>

When we debated the question of the definition, it has become clear, as the professor noted, that it is about not simply the definition but also who decides or interprets the definition.  In general, the default interpretation seems to favour the employer in how it chooses to categorise those whom it employs or those who work for them.  It is probably one of the fundamental issues that, initially, the employer holds the power.  Challenging that interpretation requires a process of scope, through the courts or through difficult individual solutions.</p> <p>  I was interested in the Uber category.  My information may be out of date but, as I understand it, Belgium has defined Uber drivers as employees in a more classic sense, that is, not as the in-between category that exists in the UK.  It defines employees as persons who for remuneration undertake to work for another person under the latter's authority and has applied the definition with the associated supports and so on.  It is good to see.  A battle of interpretation is taking place everywhere and that is another interesting frame in that regard.</p> <p>  There are a few interesting aspects.  While it is true that the platform or gig economy is not as widespread, the professor is right that we need to take action.  Between 2016 and 2019, we have moved from there being one quarter of employees in non-standard employment to one half.  We saw how quickly zero-hour contracts spread.  I am often convinced that good practice tends to stay in pilot stage for ever while bad practice moves like wildfire.  </p> <p>  I am interested in what the professor said about how we might expand that sectoral-type approach, which would be useful.  There are two or three aspects on which the professor might elaborate, including the idea of collective bargaining as a sectoral standard.  An unusual aspect of it is discriminatory practice.  My colleague Senator Ruane is bringing forward legislation on spent convictions.  One of the issues that arise is that those with spent convictions can find it impossible to get insurance.  When one is self-employed or falsely categorised as self-employed, there are entire sectors in which virtually the only work one can get is self-employment.  There are categories of people, however, who can find it difficult to become self-employed.  It is interesting that there may be a discriminatory dimension to the matter.</p> <p>  Professor Doherty noted that there are particular areas of trust, confidence and safety, one of which was domestic work and home care.  The regulation of home care is an issue that has been pending for ever, and we know it is one of the major areas of growth that most needs regulation early because it would be vulnerable to challenge in the future, for example, under corporate courts if we moved towards investor court dispute mechanisms.  We need to get the regulations right and have them clearly and well established.</p> <p>  I have a concern about chain liability.  As I have indicated to the union, I can see one positive aspect of it, where the liability extends and where the liability can be pushed down to a subcontractor who can dissolve in a moment and reappear, which, as we know, some companies do as they need to.  I am concerned that we need it to be extended to the platform or gig economy where multiple individuals who may happen to have ordered food become categorised as the top-level responsibility, and all the companies deflect responsibility.  In certain areas I can see it being good but I am worried about it being atomised at the end to the point where it becomes almost impossible for an employee to identify the person who is ultimately responsible.  For those who access services in this platform, it is hard for them to know where they can get justice.  </p> <p>  I am interested in public procurement and am bringing forward legislation on the matter in April.  I would love to chat with the professor about it because it is fascinating.  One of the concerns I have about it is the price and where we embed.  I fully agree with the professor in respect of that engagement with practices.  The legislation is in line with the EU directive's obligation to abide by existing laws because it applies to everybody equally and so on, and existing legal practices and labour resolution practices should be included in that regard.  Is the professor satisfied that it is fundamentally better to seek the best price-quality ratio rather than the lowest cost?  Is the best place for us to embed these measures within the quality criteria or within exclusions where certain companies are excluded from application?  I am considering both in my legislation.</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy Joan Collins also raised the issue of penalties, which I will address presently.  On the definition of self-employment, if one talked to employers and employer representatives, I think one would find that if entering the Workplace Relations Commission system, the default status is almost always that of employee.</p><p>I have heard this view expressed very strongly.  Tribunals would almost always default to the position that the person is an employee and it is for the employer to prove otherwise.  This is perfectly appropriate, but before we get to that point, which the Senator referred to, when it is up to the declaration of status for social insurance purposes or tax purposes, it is self-declaration.  Therefore the presumption is usually the other way and it only becomes possible for the person who may not genuinely be self-employed to argue the toss once they have instigated a complaint.  I am sure that is where often most of the situations fall down, for very obvious reasons.  This is not my area of expertise, but I am not sure how declarations of status are made with regard to social insurance and tax.  At the outset part of this needs unpacking.</p><p> My interest in the sectoral standards is always about trying to get us out of this definition and the categorisation of everything very precisely, which is not possible in this area.  The scope section and the Department have produced a very good checklist to determine if a person is or is not an employee.  It needs to be updated, but individual situations may allow a person to tick four boxes here and four there, while the answer depends on the deciding officer on the day.  It is very important in sectors such as domestic care and others.  I do not believe it is justifiable for the State not to take a very close look at the situation in general in false self-employment and especially in certain sectors that present particular vulnerabilities or potential problems.</p><p> I understand that chain liability is not a panacea by any means.  Again, it can often get bogged down in litigation.  As has been said, it can be the shifting or deflecting of blame or responsibility to different parties.  I am keen for the concept as applied to the construction sector.  I would not be as sure, and would be a little more tentative, outside of that.  The construction sector presents very particular issues, as Deputy Brady referred to.  The sector is, by definition, a subcontracting industry.  That is what happens.  For the possibility of deflecting responsibility there, I do not see it as much as a problem there as in other sectors, especially if there is ultimately a machinery to enforce the obligations appropriately in the context of public contracts.</p><p> A slightly strange situation comes up in the aforementioned thesis I referenced with regard to social security.  Sometimes citizens from other EU member states who move to Ireland have greater rights that derive from EU law than people who never leave the country, including in the context of chain liability.  We must ask if those situations should not be equalised.</p><p> On the public procurement piece, any penalties that can be imposed for breaches of obligations would have to be proportionate.  That is for sure.  I am very much in favour of some sort of pan-European register that allows for a period of suspension for contractors who are found to be in breach of obligations under public contracts.  It could not be forever but perhaps it could be proportionate to the level of offence.  I am concerned that sometimes when this issue is discussed post-technical breaches are not counted.  I have heard lobbying and submissions from some sectors that say a company would not be disqualified for a technical breach such as not having records on site and so on.  To me this is not a technical breach: there is a breach or there is not a breach.  I would be strongly in favour of such a register.</p><p> On the direct question of price quality issue, in my experience while public contracts do not just consider the lowest cost, there is a big reluctance, which in some sense is understandable, for procurers to err on the side of safety and go for lowest cost.  Even though some of the clauses in public contracts have conditions relating to quality, the default option is price.  There is a real fear of litigation among public procurers that if they do not award the contract to the cheapest offer, they will end up in the courts.</p></speech>

They do, and sometimes we see that in the tender criteria, but I do not always see it being followed through in the award.  The Scottish Executive, for example, has inserted living wage clauses into public contracts.  There is a real question that this is not in conformity with EU law, but they have done it anyway.  To my knowledge the measure has yet to be challenged.  There is a timidity in how Ireland awards State contracts.  It is understandable, but to change it I am not so sure it is the law that needs to change.  It is very much the practice and culture of the awarding of State contracts that needs to change.  This would probably need to come from a fairly senior level.</p></speech>

I may have to run as soon as I see my number coming up.  I listened to some of the presentation by Professor Doherty earlier on the monitor.  My apologies I was not in the committee for it.</p> <p>  I have been following this over the past year.  I did not know much about it but since then I have learnt quite a lot about how it applies to the film industry.  I do not know if Professor Doherty has looked at this much but there is a big dispute going on in the film industry, to put it mildly, about this whole area.  It relates to who are the employers and who are the employees.  The witness may or may not be aware of the structure of the Irish film industry, which is financed by tax relief.  The tax relief has to be put through a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or designated activity companies, DAC, that are set up for the purposes of the specific movie.  Those tax reliefs are given to standing production companies, but the production company does not make the film.  The SPV is the agency that makes the film and people are employed by the SPV.  Standing behind the SPV, however, is the real producer company that is not time limited to the production.</p> <p>  What many film workers are raging about is that this structure means they have no rights because there is, in effect, no employer.  The workers will go further and say that if they ask for rights, or the application of the fixed-term contract legislation, or for the working time directive, they will never be asked back again.  They feel strongly pressured to declare as self-employed or if they attempt to assert their rights if they manage to get a PAYE contract.  I am curious as to what Professor Doherty thinks of all this.</p> <p>  There have been some rulings from the Workplace Relations Commission where workers have taken cases.  Workers in those cases, for example, have said that the producer company behind the production is the employer.  They argue that the SPV might have a different identity for every production, but standing behind that SPV is a producer company that constantly draws down this tax relief, and the worker has worked for these people on multiple occasions.</p><p>That producer company is saying that these workers are not its employees and have nothing to do with it and that, therefore, it has no obligations to them.  It seems to say that fixed term contract legislation does not apply to it.  I am trying to get the bottom of that.  I will ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about this issue.  Given that the Irish film industry is financed overwhelmingly by public money, this seems to be an unacceptable situation.  What does Professor Doherty think about that?  In his understanding, does fixed term contract legislation apply to people in the film industry?  I understand there are only a few derogations from that legislation and film is not one of them.  Other than those derogations, the legislation applies.  </p><p> I accept that there are some grey areas, but there is a control test, as set out in the code of practice for determining self-employment status for individuals.  Surely teams from Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection could be sent in to companies to find out who their employees are and establish the boxes those employees tick.  Are they coming in from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock?  Is somebody else telling them what to do?  Do they get lunch breaks if someone else tells them they have to have them?  It could be established fairly quickly whether they were employees or employers, and who the employer is.  I would be interested in any thoughts or insights into that area that Professor Doherty could provide. </p><p> The issue of penalties may have arisen earlier.  There have to be penalties.  What is Professor Doherty's understanding of the application of penalties?  I do not see that there are any for those who breach this legislation.</p></speech>

Oftentimes this arises because of complicated relationships.  I am not overly familiar with the film industry in particular, but the situation as described by Deputy Boyd Barrett seems clear enough.  It may be the case that in some instances we should not obsess so much about who is an employee and actually look at the obligations of employers.  In the case of an individual providing a service, there may be more than one employer that owes that person some obligations.  In the example the Deputy has given, if someone is on set, the obligations to maintain health and safety may be on the person controlling that set, whoever that might be, but the obligations to pay the person may be on somebody else altogether.  That might introduce more complexity to the situation.</p> <p>  Coming back to my sectoral view, trying to put basic standards in place for people working in film production, which apply across the sector, takes many of these problems away.  It makes it clear that a person working on a set is entitled to X, Y and Z and that someone has to be responsible for providing that.  The person responsible has to be from an organisation or entity of substance rather than form.  The committee has discussed these managed services companies before.  They are entities of form rather than entities of substance.  The code is good, and it looks at substance to some extent, but a clear statement that we should disregard form in favour of substance is something that might be useful in terms of any legislation that is set down.  Sectoral conditions could include a defined rate of pay for a sector and the entity that gives that rate is, in substance, the person who is performing the function of an employer in relation to pay.  That is a slightly more complicated formulation, but it is logical, makes sense and takes us away from minute discussions about who is an employee and whether equipment was provided.  If one is doing work in a particular sector, one should be entitled to a certain standard, and we should not have to go beyond the fact that he or she is entitled to that standard.  </p> <p>  In terms of penalties, was the Deputy talking about general breaches of the legislation?</p></speech>

By and large, I am not in favour of criminal sanctions for this kind of thing because I do not believe they work.  In its submission to the committee the Department mentioned that, under the Social Welfare Act, there are potential penalties, fines and convictions on indictment.  I do not know whether the committee has the figures on how many prosecutions go ahead but I suspect they are very few in number.  Outside of the specific area of health and safety, very few criminal prosecutions are taken on employment rights because they are hard to prove.  The sanction for public contracts is along the lines we have described.  People are not given contracts again and the State litigates against contractual awardees who do not fulfil their functions.  The remedies for individuals include compensation, allowing that remuneration owed is backdated.</p></speech>

I am not saying it should not be a part of the mix, but I believe that it is in the interests of the public, especially where public money is used, that the public gets the maximum amount back for its investment, whether via film tax relief or public funding.  Even in the private sector it is important to get the maximum tax revenue possible from employment.  People should not be allowed to miscategorise themselves.  There is a problem with employers trying to miscategorise people, but people can also miscategorise themselves in order to gain a tax benefit.  That is problematic, and should be addressed by providing fairly objective criteria for defining employees.  Someone cannot just decide that he or she fancies being an entrepreneur when that is not the case.  By declaring oneself an entrepreneur one effectively undercuts somebody who wants PAYE direct employment doing exactly the same job.  I believe that approach is prevalent in a number of sectors, particularly where younger people are engaged who do not worry about pension contributions and all of that stuff and are happy to freelance.  They may regret taking that approach in 20 years' time.  In the meantime, they are undercutting people who have worked in an industry for years and have been fighting for pension entitlements and that kind of thing.  Does Professor Doherty understand my point?</p></speech>

It is probably less of a concern than being coerced into misclassification.  I take the example of freelance journalism for which there is a minimum schedule of rates and holiday entitlements that employers will provide or a minimum sick pay scheme to which everyone must contribute.  It alleviates the problem to some extent.  It is a form of the State coercing people into making contributions.  I do not necessarily think that is a problem.</p></speech>

We have a long way to go here.  Recently, I have come across a local facility in Limerick which was funded by the Department of Education and Skills and run by a local board.  When the local board decided to close the facility, people were let go without redundancy or other employment rights.  However, the Department insisted that all responsibility lay with the local board, which was, of course, worthless to the employees.  We saw that on a larger scale in a D&aacute;il motion we passed last year on community employment supervisors.  The Department insisted that a Labour Court recommendation that supervisors should get pensions was a matter for the local community employment boards.  I am interested in the film industry and hope people get sorted out, but the State is the main offender in this regard.</p></speech>

Sectoral orders are a way to ensure that whatever way he or she is categorised, the person can access the basic provision.  However, there is a loss to the State.  We know this from the radically different PRSI contributions that are coming through from those who are self-employed and those who are not.</p> <p>  I refer again to the issue of public procurement.  There is also an issue for the State as an employer.  There are a number of areas, including early child care workers and other areas like that, where the State could do much better.  Is the scope going to be within the criteria in the design of requests for tenders and not necessarily within clauses, which has largely been the focus?  I had always thought of it in reverse and I know that comes up against the European directives, which require that a tenderer should not have a number of people in need of FIS as that is, in effect, the State having to subsidise a bad employer rather employing a good one.  There are problems when one hits that as it is a payment linked to Ireland.  However, one could require that a certain number of workers would be employees, whether in Ireland or elsewhere.  Would a requirement that they be categorised as employees fit within the European procurement framework?  It is reasonable if the most economically advantageous tender is the overarching goal.  Certainly, it fits within that.</p></speech>

However, the classification will matter more in future than it does today when the likes of auto-enrolment pensions come in and the employer will make a contribution.  It goes back to the first part of our discussion where we asked what was the definition.  It is more than a matter of existing entitlements.  It will become a future contributions scheme from an auto-enrolment perspective.</p></speech>

When I teach employment law to undergraduates and talk about fixed-term contracts, I say it is the State section of the course because all of the cases are about the State resisting classifications.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that there is an obligation on the State as an employer to be the model of best practice.  We have not always seen that, unfortunately.</p> <p>  On public procurement, more could definitely be done at tender stage.  It tends to be a little generic.  While the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criteria are applied, we simply expect tenderers to be in compliance with the law.  That is pretty much it.  There is definitely scope to be a bit more specific on the criteria used.  A criterion requiring that a certain percentage of persons on a project would have to be employees would have to be related to the subject matter of the contract.  Why would a particular contract need employees rather than other categories of worker?</p></speech>

It would be an interesting idea and I am thinking of it as I speak.  While it is certainly something that could be done, one would have to be careful about how the specific criteria were framed and there would have to be a reason for it beyond the notion that it is a good thing.  I do not want to come across as suggesting that entrepreneurs being self-employed is in some ways a bad thing, because it is not.</p></speech>

I would be strongly in favour of that as it goes back to the point that the State should be a good employer and should also ensure that the contracts it provides are subject to the machinery of the State.  On the Chairman's last point, it will become more significant.  We all saw the case involving a journalist who has been writing for an Irish newspaper for nearly 30 years and who has now been told he is freelance due to the technicality of a law in another member state.  The definitional point is, therefore, important.  We are always looking for ways to extract ourselves to the greatest extent possible from finite arguments about definitional criteria.  A slightly broader definition of "employee" than currently exists would be useful and the definition the EU is going to propose in certain areas would be useful but it would be good to focus on means by which to avoid getting down to definitional criteria.</p><p>However, if we can focus on a means by which we do not have to get down into the definitional criteria, for example, in the area of social insurance or pensions, we can have a look at the entire system and say perhaps contributions should be equalised in some way or at least brought closer together to reduce the incentive for misclassification.  It is definitely a package of measures that is required.  My final view on it is that I do not like to focus too much on statutory definitions of employees if it is just about access to a range of other rights.  The committee might want to think about how they should be granted in and of themselves without considering the definitional issue.</p></speech>
